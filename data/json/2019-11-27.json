The historic two-hour general strike in the middle of the Velvet Revolution saw people from Prague to Bratislava take part in a beautiful, peaceful wave of freedom, courage and unity.  (Applause) For me, these two hours go to the heart of what the European Union has always meant. It is not only about parties and politics, rules or regulations, markets or currencies. It is ultimately, and above all else, about people and their aspirations. It is about people standing together for their liberty, for their values – simply for a better future. There is one quote from the great Václav Havel, one of the heroes of 1989, that stands out for me when I look ahead to the future: ‘Work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed’. I chose this quote because, over the next five years, our Union will embark together on a transformation which will touch every part of our society and of our economy, and we will do it because it is the right thing to do – not because it will be easy.  (Applause) We sometimes forget that our greatest achievements have always come when we are bold. We were bold when we sought peace where there was pain. We were bold when we created a single market and a single currency. We were bold when we welcomed the part of our European family that had been out in the cold for too long. But in the last years, we have had to focus on the here and now, managing crisis after emergency, fighting to keep our unity and solidarity intact. If we have emerged stronger in that time – and I believe we have – it is, in great part, thanks to the leadership and conviction of my predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker. A great European, he has devoted his heart, his soul and his life to our Union, and his legacy speaks for itself. Jean—Claude, merci de nous tous. (Sustained applause) Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les membres du Parlement européen, cela fait quatre mois que vous m’avez accordé votre confiance. Depuis, j’ai rencontré tous les groupes politiques et tous les chefs d’État ou de gouvernement. Ensemble, nous avons formé une équipe européenne exceptionnelle. Vous, les membres du Parlement, avez auditionné chacun d’entre nous. Je vous avais promis de vous écouter, c’est exactement ce que j’ai fait, et je continuerai de le faire, accompagnée de Maros Šefčovič et de tous les autres membres du Collège. Nous avons souvent été d’accord et, parfois nous ne l’avons pas été, mais c’est la démocratie à l’œuvre. Aujourd’hui, ici, au cœur de cette démocratie européenne, je vous demande votre soutien pour un nouveau départ de l’Europe. The team you are voting on today come from different cultures and countries and have different backgrounds and political colours. We have teachers and farmers, mayors and ministers, doctors and diplomats, engineers and entrepreneurs. We have those born before the Berlin Wall was built and those born after it was torn down, those who lived in dictatorships and those who helped young democracies join our Union. It is a team with almost – almost – as many women as men, only one woman away from gender balance.  (Applause) This shows we have made real progress, but also that we still have to do more. As the first woman to be President of the Commission, every member of my College will have a gender-balanced cabinet – for the very first time.  (Applause) And by the end of our mandate, we will have gender equality at all levels of management for the very first time, and this will change the face of the Commission. Every Member of my team will bring their own personal stories and perspectives on Europe. They will each have their own policies and priorities to manage. But all together we will be one team that works in the common European interest. We will be one team that works with this House and with Member States to tackle our generation’s defining challenges. We are ready but, most importantly, Europe is ready. My message is simple: let’s get to work. (Applause) This is an unsettled world, where too many powers only speak the language of confrontation and unilateralism, but it is also a world where millions of people are taking to the streets to protest against corruption or to demand democratic change. The world needs our leadership more than ever: to keep engaging with the world as a responsible power, and to be a force for peace and for positive change. We must show our partners at the United Nations that they can rely on us as a champion of multilateralism. We must demonstrate to our friends in the Western Balkans that we share the same continent, the same history, the same culture, and we will share the same destiny. Our door remains open. (Applause) We also share the same destiny with our transatlantic partners. Yes, we have issues – without any doubt. But our ties have lasted the test of time. While we are speaking, thousands of students, researchers, entrepreneurs and artists continue to build zillions of friendships, business contacts, and science projects. This myriad of fine threads woven together make a bond that is stronger than any individual point of discord. Countries from east to west, from south to north, need Europe to be a true partner. We can be the shapers of a better global order. This is Europe’s vocation and it’s what European citizens want. I am happy to have such an experienced diplomat as Josep Borrell on our team, working alongside Jutta Urpilainen, Olivér Várhelyi and Janez Lenarčič. They will do an invaluable job together. We will invest in alliances and coalitions to advance our values. We will promote and protect Europe’s interest through open and fair trade. We’ll strengthen our partners through cooperation because strong partners make Europe strong too. My Commission will not be afraid to speak the language of confidence, but it will be our way, the European way. This is the geopolitical Commission that I have in mind and that Europe urgently needs. If there is one area where the world needs our leadership, it is on protecting our climate. This is an existential issue for Europe and for the world. How can it not be existential when 85% of people in extreme poverty live in the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change? How can it not be existential when we see Venice under water, Portugal’s forests on fire or Lithuania’s harvests cut by half because of droughts? This has happened before, without any question, but never with that frequency and with that intensity. We do not have a moment to waste anymore on fighting climate change.  (Applause) The faster Europe moves, the greater the advantage will be for our citizens, our competitiveness and our prosperity. The European Green Deal is a must for the health of our planet, our people and for our economy. Frans Timmermans is the right person to make this happen.  (Applause) And I am delighted that he will be supported by Kadri Simson, Adina Vălean and many others. The European Green Deal is our new growth strategy. It will help us cut emissions while creating jobs. At the core of it will be an industrial strategy that enables our businesses – big and small – to innovate and to develop new technologies, while creating new markets. We will be global standard setters. This is our competitive advantage and is the best way to ensure a level-playing field. But all of this has to serve the European people. They want and expect Europe to act on climate and environment, but they also need affordable, clean and secure energy. They need to be skilled to work in the jobs of tomorrow. They need to commute to those new jobs or be connected from home and we have to make sure that those needs are fulfilled in a sustainable way. It is a generational transition towards climate neutrality by mid—century, but this transition must be just and inclusive or it will not happen at all.  (Applause) It will need massive investment in innovation, research, infrastructure, housing, and the training of people. It will require public and private investments at the European and at national levels. And, once again, Europe is already leading the way. The European Union will mainstream climate financing throughout its budget, but also throughout capital markets and the entire investment chain. In regions that will have to make a bigger step than most we will support people and businesses with a targeted just transition mechanism. It will cut across different funds and instruments and attract the private investment we need.  To help us achieve this, the European Investment Bank will be a trusted partner. I am particularly happy that the progress it has made to strengthen its role as European climate bank is obvious. This will boost investment in European technologies and the solutions the world is looking for.  But there is more to do. We only account for approximately 9% of global emissions. We have to bring the world with us and this is already happening. From China to Canada and through to California, others are working with us on their own emissions trading system, and Phil Hogan will ensure that our future trade agreements include a chapter on sustainable development because we know that climate change is about all of us. We have the duty to act and the power to lead. (Applause)  Meine Damen und Herren, die Digitalisierung ermöglicht Dinge, die noch vor einer Generation undenkbar waren: weltweit miteinander kommunizieren, Zugang zu Informationen, Fortschritte in Medizin, Umweltschutz, Mobilität, Inklusion. Es gibt keine Zukunft ohne Digitalisierung. Margrethe Vestager ist diejenige, die uns auf diesem Weg weiterbringen wird. Wir werden Tätigkeiten automatisieren, die uns Menschen schwerfallen, zum Beispiel das Tragen von schweren Lasten oder das Repetitive, die Wiederholungsaufgaben, egal ob in der Fabrik oder am Schreibtisch. Aber das hat auch etwas Gutes: Das wird uns Zeit schenken. Zeit für das, was uns Menschen auszeichnet und was Computer eben nicht können: Empathie und Kreativität.  Der Pflegeroboter kann zum Beispiel beim Umbetten helfen und die Digitalisierung kann bei den Verwaltungsaufgaben helfen. Aber immer mit einem Ziel: dass Pflegepersonal wieder Zeit hat, das zu tun, was wirklich wichtig ist, nämlich mit den Patienten sprechen und für sie da sein.  Digitalisierung wird uns ermöglichen, effektiver und effizienter mit Ressourcen umzugehen, weil wir alles ganz genau werden aussteuern können: Wasserverbrauch, Energie und all die wertvollen Ressourcen unseres Planeten. Ja, die Digitalisierung wird unsere Gesellschaft, unsere Wirtschaft, unsere Verwaltung von Grund auf verändern, und sie tut es ja schon bereits heute. Um die großen Chancen zu nutzen, aber um auch die Risiken einzudämmen, müssen wir da klug ausgleichen, wo es der Markt nicht kann. Wir müssen sowohl unseren europäischen Wohlstand als auch unsere europäischen Werte schützen. Wir müssen unseren eigenen europäischen Weg gehen – auch im digitalen Zeitalter. Wie wollen wir das konkret machen? Erstens: Wir müssen Schlüsseltechnologien beherrschen und in Europa besitzen. Dazu gehören mit Sicherheit Quantencomputer, künstliche Intelligenz, Blockchain und kritische Chiptechnologien. Damit uns das aber gelingt, damit wir diese vorhandenen Lücken schließen können, müssen wir das zusammen angehen, da wo wir dann immer stark sind. Also lasst uns unsere Ressourcen bündeln, unser Geld, unsere Forschungskapazitäten, unser Wissen, auch unsere große Fähigkeit der Umsetzung dann in die Praxis.  Wir haben das schon einmal getan beim Supercomputer. Europa ist derzeit dabei, auf dem Weltmarkt einen – einen! – der drei leistungsstärksten Rechner zu erwerben. Das ist klasse, dass wir ihn bekommen, aber ich möchte, dass wir ihn in der nächsten Generation als Europäer selber bauen. Das muss unser Ziel sein. Europa hat alle Wissenschaftler und industriellen Kapazitäten, um auf diesen Feldern wettbewerbsfähig zu sein. Lassen wir uns das nicht kleinreden, weder von außen noch von uns selbst. Klar, Innovation braucht kluge Köpfe – gar keine Frage –, aber Innovation braucht auch Diversität. Innovation braucht Freiräume, um zu denken. All das haben wir hier in Europa. Die Menschen wollen hier leben, sie wollen hier forschen, sie wollen hier ihre Zukunft gestalten. Wir brauchen zukunftsfähige Infrastruktur mit gemeinsamen Standards sowie Gigabit-Netzwerke und sichere Clouds, nicht nur der heutigen, sondern vor allen Dingen dann auch der nächsten Generation.  Das Rohmaterial der Digitalisierung, das sind Daten. Mit jedem Klick, den wir hier in Europa tun, füttern wir Algorithmen – meistens eher transatlantische – die wiederum unser Verhalten beeinflussen. Das ist kein guter Zustand.  Deshalb: So wie wir das bei der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung getan haben – nämlich den Rahmen für die Welt gesetzt haben und das konnte nur Europa tun –, so müssen wir dieses auch bei der künstlichen Intelligenz tun. Weil wir in Europa vom Menschen her denken, nicht vom Markt und vom Geld her. Nicht vom Staat her, sondern vom Menschen her. Es geht nicht darum – das ist wichtig –, den Datenfluss einzudämmen. Es geht darum, dass wir die Regeln setzen, wie verantwortungsvoller Umgang mit Daten geht. Denn für uns Europäer hat der Schutz der digitalen Identität absolute und oberste Priorität. Uns ist das wichtig. Gleichzeitig wollen wir Innovation. Heute werden 85 % aller nicht-personenbezogenen Daten – 85 %! – nicht ein einziges Mal genutzt. Sie werden automatisch gesammelt, sie werden nicht ein einziges Mal genutzt. Das ist eine Riesenverschwendung. Denn in diesen Daten schlummern Erkenntnisse, die wir haben in Europa und die wir nutzen sollten.  Wir müssen deshalb einen Rahmen beschreiben, damit Regierungen und Unternehmen Daten teilen und in einem sicheren Pool zur Verfügung stellen können. Ich kann mir keine kompetentere Person vorstellen als Thierry Breton, um dazu eine Datenstrategie zu entwickeln. Ja, und dann gibt es das Thema Cybersicherheit. Das ist die Kehrseite von Digitalisierung, also ist es für uns auch Priorität. Wir brauchen für die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der europäischen Unternehmen höchste Sicherheitsanforderungen und eine einheitliche europäische Vorgehensweise. Dazu müssen wir Wissen über Gefahren teilen: nicht need to know, aber need to share. Wir sollten eine gemeinsame Plattform schaffen, gewissermaßen eine erweiterte Cybersicherheitsagentur. Nur so stärken wir das Vertrauen in die vernetzte Wirtschaft, und nur so erhöhen wir die Resilienz gegen alle Arten von Risiken. Das kann uns alles gelingen, wenn wir gemeinsam vorgehen, wenn wir auf unseren europäischen Werten aufbauen. Und dann bin ich zuversichtlich, dass Europa auch im digitalen Zeitalter eine führende Rolle spielen wird. Das kann Europa! Honourable Members, Europe has a lot to be proud of. We are the world’s trading superpower. We rank first globally in exporting manufactured goods and services. We are the largest source and destination of foreign direct investment anywhere in the world. Our industry is world class in high value sectors, for instance making a third of the world’s space satellites, and our companies are at the cutting edge, holding 40% of the world’s renewable technology patents.  We should harness this transformative power of the twin digital and climate transition to strengthen our own industrial base and our innovation potential. This can only be done through investment. We have to scale up. For years, we have invested less in innovation than our competitors do. This is a huge handicap to our competitiveness and our ability to lead this transformation. This is why we should not see the next Multiannual Financial Framework as a simple accounting exercise. The world seven years ago looks nothing like the world in seven years’ time. Our budget must be significantly modernised. I know that in this field I can rely not only on the experience and skill of Johannes Hahn, but also on this Parliament. But public budgets can only go so far. We must make sure that investment can flow to where it is needed by completing the Capital Markets Union. This will help improve access to finance for small businesses and start—ups to let them grow, innovate and take the risks they need. The same goes for the Banking Union. We have to complete it in order to make our financial system stronger and more resilient. I have entrusted this task to Valdis Dombrovskis, the right person for the right job.  (Applause) He will make sure our economy works for people: quality jobs, equal opportunities, fair working conditions and inclusion. He knows that we need sound public finances for sustainable growth and he will drive our competitiveness and our sustainability. They go hand in hand. We should never forget that competitive sustainability has always been at the heart of our social market economy. We just called it something different. Think of the family—owned businesses all across our Union. They were not built solely on shareholder values or the next bonuses. They were built to last, to pass down generations, and to provide a fair living for the employees. They were built on passion for quality, tradition and innovation. The things we make today may have changed, but we must rediscover our competitive sustainability.  It was in this spirit that each and every Member State committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and it is in this spirit that Paolo Gentiloni will oversee the implementation of the Goals. He believes in it and I believe in him. (Applause) The European economy has recovered from one of the worst economic and financial crises since the end of the Second World War. The labour market remains strong and unemployment continues to fall. However, with clouds forming on the horizon, Europe should prepare for what is ahead. We need to rely on what makes us strong: our single market and our single currency. It is high time to complete our Economic and Monetary Union to deliver growth and jobs by increasing macroeconomic resilience. We must use the flexibility allowed under the Stability and Growth Pact to give the time and the space for our economies to grow. At the same time, we must support Member States with targeted investments and structural reforms. I cannot think of a better person to lead this work than Elisa Ferreira. (Applause) Last month, 39 people lost their lives in the back of a lorry after having been trafficked through at least four EU countries. It is a tragedy that a mother in Vietnam receives a message from her daughter in Europe saying that she does not have room to breathe. For those 39 people, for their mothers, fathers, and friends, we all agree that this should never ever happen.  (Applause) People expect Europe to find common solutions to the shared challenge of migration. This is an issue that has divided us but we should step forward. We need solutions that work for all. This is the task that I have entrusted to Margaritis Schinas and Ylva Johansson. With their different skills and perspectives, they will form a formidable team. One thing is for sure: Europe will always provide shelter to those who are in need of international protection.  (Applause) It is in our interest that those who stay are integrated into our society, but we also have to ensure that those who have no right to stay return home.  (Applause) We have to break the cruel business model of smugglers. We must reform our asylum system, never forgetting our values of solidarity and responsibility. We need to strengthen our external borders to allow us to return to a fully—functioning Schengen. We need to invest in our partnerships with countries of origin to improve conditions and create opportunities. It will not be easy, but let us remember the words of Václav Havel: it is the good thing to do.  (Applause) Migration will not go away – it will stay with us and, therefore, I think that a Europe that is so proud of its values and so proud of its the rule of law has to be able to come up with an answer that is both humane and effective. We should be able to do that. The same team of Margaritis Schinas and Ylva Johansson will also be responsible for strengthening our internal security. They will ensure that law enforcement cooperation can deal with new and emerging threats and they will make sure that Europol, our best tool to fight crime, is fit for purpose.  When I was a girl, living in Brussels, my little sister died of cancer at the age of eleven. I remember the utter sense of helplessness of my parents, but also of the medical staff who looked after her with such care. Every one of us has a similar story – or knows someone who has. The number of cancer cases are rising but we are getting better at diagnosis and treatment. Europe will take the lead in the fight against cancer. Early next year, Stella Kyriakides will launch an ambitious cancer plan. She is the right person to make sure that Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan helps to reduce the suffering caused by this disease.  (Applause) The point is that Europe needs to care for the things people care about. People care about the future of our children and our society. Culture and education are what link our history with our future. This is what makes us unique: our soul, our culture, our diversity, our heritage. And I know that with Mariya Gabriel it is in safe hands. This is why I am happy to announce that her portfolio will be renamed Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth.  (Applause) People care about fairness and equality in every sense of the word. This is why I chose Nicolas Schmit to be in charge of implementing our European Pillar of Social Rights and fighting poverty from childhood onwards. He will put forward a framework to ensure that every worker in our Union has a fair minimum wage. (Applause) Helena Dalli will be the champion we need to break through the glass ceilings, those barriers holding people back because of who they are, what they believe and who they love. These barriers have to disappear! Period. People care about their rights, values and freedoms. The rule of law, as our foundation, can never be compromised. We must ensure that it is respected and upheld everywhere, with every country treated equally. We must focus on dialogue and prevention but never hesitate to take all necessary measures. We need experience and engagement, and Věra Jourová and Didier Reynders are exactly the right people for that. (Applause) People care about the air they breathe, the water they drink, the food they eat and the nature they cherish. We can all be happy that Virginijus Sinkevičius will be leading Europe’s fight to preserve our biodiversity and oceans, while ensuring our coastal and fishing communities can thrive. And we have Janusz Wojciechowski, who will ensure that our farmers can also thrive as they adapt to new realities.  The twin transitions – climate and digitalisation – will bring changes for all, but let there be no doubt: farming will remain a valued part of our culture and our future. We need a sustainable farm—to—fork strategy – from capital access for young farmers to the fact that imported food products from third countries must comply with the European Union’s environmental standards.  (Applause) People care about having a say in their future. The turnout in this year’s European elections was the highest in a quarter of a century. But democratic participation does not stop on election day. We will mobilise Europe’s best energies from all parts of our Union, from all institutions and from all walks of life to engage in the Conference on the Future of Europe. It should be inclusive for all institutions and citizens and the European Parliament should have a leading role. From the Commission side, Dubravka Šuica, an experienced Member of this House, will work closely with you to make this a success. (Applause) We all know that one Member of our family intends to leave our Union.  (Applause from certain quarters) A vast majority of this House seems to be happy about the fact that a very, very, very small group in this House will not be able to clap as loudly anymore. (Loud applause) I have never made any secret of the fact that I will always be a remainer.  (Applause) We will respect the decision taken by the British people. We will work closely together to find a solution to common challenges, especially on security matters, but one thing has to be absolutely clear: whatever the future holds, the bond and the friendship between our people are unbreakable. (Applause) Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les parlementaires, dans trente ans, d’autres, ici-même, porteront un regard sur nos actions, comme je l’ai fait au début de mon discours. Que diront-ils? Cela dépend de ce que nous ferons ensemble. Si nous faisons bien notre travail, l’Europe de 2050 sera le premier continent du monde neutre en carbone et elle sera une puissance de premier plan dans le numérique, elle restera l’économie qui réussit le mieux à assurer l’équilibre entre le marché et le social, et elle sera chef de file dans la résolution des grands enjeux mondiaux. Le chemin est ardu et la tâche n’est pas facile, mais ensemble nous pouvons y arriver. Inspirons-nous de cet esprit optimiste et volontaire d’il y a trente ans qui a fait tomber le rideau de fer. Pour en revenir à Vaclav Havel, il y a des millions d’Européens qui s’engagent parce que c’est la bonne chose à faire. Il y a ceux qui s’investissent pour renforcer leur communauté; ceux qui donnent de leur temps pour prendre soin des personnes âgées ou pour nettoyer un parc; ceux qui sortent dans la rue mais qui, aussi, changent leur style de vie pour protéger le climat. Ce sont des gens qui veulent faire la différence. Nous aussi, le Parlement, le Conseil et la Commission, nous devons faire la différence. C’est dans cet esprit que j’ai construit mon équipe et c’est dans cet esprit que je suis ici, aujourd’hui, devant vous, pour demander votre confiance.  Mettons-nous au travail, afin de pouvoir dire dans trente ans, également: vive l’Europe, es lebe Europa, long live Europe! (L’Assemblée, debout, applaudit l’oratrice)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, clear priorities, well balanced, forward looking: that was the speech we heard today from Ursula von der Leyen. I thank you for this. The last weeks were prime time for us as the European Parliament. We checked all the candidates proposed by the Member States, whether they were ready for the job. Not everybody was ready for the job, but finally we now have Commissioners in front of us who the responsible committee gave the green light to. The EPP was always insisting during the whole period on a transparent and fair procedure. Ursula, the last weeks and months were challenging for you, but you were finally very successful. You worked hard and presented to us today your new college: the team for the leadership for Europe. Together we delivered, and today, hopefully with the full support of this House, we can also give the new Commission a strong democratic legitimacy. One of the key achievements of your team is the better gender balance – the improvement of gender balance. We have more female Commissioners than ever before, and I’m proud to say, as an EPP responsible politician, that from the EPP part of the college, we have 50% women, so we achieved our goal to get a 50% balance. Others still have to work on this, and we brought, as the EPP, the first female Commission President-in-Office, so for us it’s not only about Sunday speeches; for us, we deliver when it is about gender balance. (Applause) And we have a good mixture from experienced colleagues like Johannes Hahn, like Phil Hogan, Valdis Dombrovskis and Mariya Gabriel. We have new Commissioners like Stella Kyriakides, Margaritis Schinas and Olivér Várhelyi, and we have two colleagues who served for years in the European Parliament: Adina Vălean and Dubravka Šuica. So from our team as EPP, we have a good mixture and we count on their contribution. My Group, the European People’s Party, got in the last elections 40 million votes, and we have now the responsibility to deliver what our people, our voters, ask us to do. As the biggest party in Europe, in the European Parliament, in the Group we want to deliver now. In 2024 we will have implemented an ambitious and smart climate policy based on innovation, without attacking farmers and without doing politics against the industry. In 2024 we will have achieved a situation whereby the European Union has a master plan against cancer. We will have achieved, in 2024, to build up five million new jobs. And we have to stop the brain drain between East and West. In 2024 we will have agreed on further trade agreements; when Trump is building up trade walls, we as Europeans have to build up trade bridges. And in 2024 we will have transformed Europol into a full European FBI, where the mafia and organised crime is really under pressure. In 2024 we will have defined the final borders of Europe. Turkey is a strong partner, but Turkey cannot become a member of the European Union. And in 2024 we will have established a strong European Border and Coast Guard with at least 10 000 Frontex officers to protect our borders, so it is they and not the smugglers who decide who is arriving in Europe. That is what we have in mind when we speak about delivering. That’s why the European People’s Party will today vote in favour of the Commission. Let’s start now to deliver our promises. Ambitious projects are important – no doubt about this. But in the coming years there is even more at stake. We feel our societies are falling apart. Our European common feeling is more and more under attack because of the split between people who feel threatened by globalisation and those who enjoy the new opportunities. What makes Europe unique is at stake. A feeling of belonging is needed so much; identity is needed so much. All of us know how to describe our national identity: by our history, by our achievements, our culture. But we, as Europeans – can we describe our way of living, our European way of life? Even in the poorest countries in Europe we have a health system based on solidarity; in the US they are still discussing Obamacare. All over Europe the death penalty is forbidden; that’s not the case at global level. Democracy, rule of law, equal treatment of men and women; and, as the headline for the European way of life 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, freedom: freedom of speech, of religion, of the press. I’m fascinated by the Chinese culture but I don’t want to live the Chinese way of life, and the Americans will always be Europe’s closest partner – but I don’t want to live the American way of life. I prefer the European way of life. We will always protect, promote and guarantee the European way of life. I like being a European, and the next five years will decide whether Europe keeps its heart and soul, or whether  it will be pushed aside in a more and more brutal world. The EPP is ready to work together with all democratic groups in this House for a better Europe. This EPP have proven, in the tradition of De Gasperi, of Adenauer, Schuman and Helmut Kohl, that we fight for a united Europe. The people count on us. Let’s start now to deliver. (Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Iratxe García Pérez", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr. President. Mrs Von der Leyen, in July we gave her a vote of confidence — even though she was not our candidate — because she pledged to include in her work programme priorities which for us are fundamental. You agreed to make ecological transformation the great axis of the next legislature. And besides, he pledged to do it in a fair way, leaving no one behind. We want to get to work as soon as possible, but we need to be sure it won't let us down. Before the hearings began, the Socialists and Democrats gave our final vote that this great goal of environmental, economic and social sustainability will materialize with very concrete measures that transform and improve the lives of our citizens. That's what we're here for. That's what we've been chosen for. That is why, and in order to ensure the competence of each and every Commissioner, my political group has acted with responsibility and demand during the hearings of the twenty-six Commissioners who will be part of their future College. Because this time we can't fail. We cannot fail the young people who demonstrate every Friday to tell us that the planet and its future are at stake. We cannot fail women, and that is why, thanks to our pressure, it has been thoroughly used to achieve the most joint Commission in history. Our group will continue to give the battle for gender equality, not only in the number of positions but also in the policies to be carried out. One of them should be to try to end the scourge of sexist violence with a European directive. (Applause) Nor can we fail so many citizens who see with concern how their territory is depopulated by a lack of opportunity. And that is why we are committed to a Fair Transition Fund, ambitious and with additional resources, that helps make the ecological transition socially fair and leaves no one behind. We have five years ahead of us to show that politics does have solutions. That unity makes strength and that Europe has much to say in an increasingly convulsive world. We will not listen to the burdena behind fear, those who want to go back and renationalize policies. We know that only together and together can we face these great challenges. And for that we need a strong Commission, a courageous Commission, a Commission capable of making a new dynamism, overcoming old policies. New challenges call for new forms of politics, an increasingly complex reality. And the best guide to renewing our principles, ensuring the sustainability of our social model and ensuring the coherence of our policies are the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda. We are pleased that, thanks to our demand, you have accepted that each Commissioner individually, and all as a College, are responsible for implementing them, as well as their integration into the European Semester, a fundamental issue. We are very pleased that the New Green Pact is the priority of the future European Commission, and we know that Frans Timmermans will do an excellent job. The weather emergency can't wait. (Applause) And for us, more than a 'green agenda', for the Socialists, it will be a 'watermelon agenda', green on the outside and red on the inside. The European Union must regain its social soul and put people and the fight against inequalities at the heart of political action, and this requires very concrete policies. In the previous legislature we laid the foundations for a European social pillar that we now have to develop. The Socialists and Democrats have a battery of proposals to strengthen the European social pillar, as well as the financial and fiscal architecture of the Union, and rest a sure that the next five years will continue to insist on it. And these same principles of respect for human dignity, solidarity and justice must also guide foreign policy, which, I must say, could not be in better hands. Josep Borrell has the enormous task of trying to assert our interests and values: peace, rules and multilaterality in a world with enormous turbulence. We will also be demanding to comply with the principles in immigration policy and trade policy. In this way, we will lose our legitimacy if we do not do so, if we are not consistent. And let's be ambitious with the next budget, too. We can't do anything else with less. And new projects need more money. That is why our group will be very demanding with the new Multiannual Financial Framework. Finally, the Socialists and Democrats do not give the battle of greater European democratization for loss. We want to improve and strengthen the spitzenkandidaten system and discuss transnational lists again. That's why we'll get as involved in the next Conference on the Future of Europe. The European Union is built day by day, and that is why it is so exciting. Paul-Henri Spaak, one of the parents of the European project, said that scientific experiments are rehearsed over and over again until they succeed. Our experiment for a united, prosperous, just and egalitarian Europe must no less be. What we do in this legislature will depend to a large extent on the continuity of the European Union's project and for citizens to re-trust the institutions. We Socialists and Democrats are very clear about this. We want to live up to the circumstances and that is why we will support this College of Commissioners with our demanding, loyal and vigilant vote today. We hope that this Commission will be aware of this and act responsibly. We're playing too much.

Mr President, Madam President-elect, ladies and gentlemen, this committee is the result of a process of severe scrutiny which this Parliament has reserved for it but which should make it stronger. She will now have to fulfill her commitments, the ones ursula von der Leyen presented to us here. I ask this Commission to show us three things: vision, passion and ambition. This is the only way to prepare Europe to face the new challenges of this world and, at the same time, to excite the citizens. It is very much enthusiasm that we need to carry out these projects. Ms. von der Leyen referred to a geopolitical commission; that is fine, but it requires profound changes. As a group, we have put forward four key priorities. Firstly, we have the ambition to make Europe the first carbon-neutral continent in 2050, whose economy will have to be ready to meet this challenge. This will be possible with entrepreneurs, farmers and researchers ready to act. So let's invest in the transition with a Just Transition Fund and a climate bank, with a budget that lives up to this task. Second, digital technology is already transforming our society by providing considerable opportunities for citizens and our economy, but it also carries risks. In the face of this development, let us build leading companies in this field and help our small and medium-sized enterprises by making it easier for them to access financing within a regulatory framework for artificial intelligence, including using a real European data strategy. I am sure that Margrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton will be up to the task. Thirdly, in five years' time, will Europe still speak on an equal footing with China and the United States and will it still be a voice heard in Africa? We must also show that we are capable of managing an asylum and migration policy that lives up to our values, of building a trade policy while having effectively implemented sustainability clauses, and of building a true Defence Europe, nevertheless open to its partnerships. To do this, we need to reconnect citizens to Europe. We want a European democracy that is not just elections every five years, but in which everyone feels part of the situation; this is exactly the mission of the conference on the future of Europe, of which my group will be a driving force. This will be the way to remove the institutional obstacles that prevent the Union from doing the right thing. Too little too late syndrome must be eradicated once and for all. Otherwise, it will not be Mr. Schinas, with his wallet, but the Americans or, worse, the Chinese who will decide tomorrow our way of life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, dear Commissioner candidates, you are running today for leading the European Union: a Union that started out as a project of peace, of democracy, of human rights – a fantastic project. Whereas, right now, if we look around us, thousands of people are drowning at our borders. More than five women get killed by their partners every day. And a Union where some of the Member States are turning away from these basic values of democracy, of rule of law and of freedom that so many of the European citizens have fought so hard for. A Union that risks to fail in the face of the climate crisis, thereby risking the livelihood of the younger generation and future generations. But it’s also a Union with a great potential to be the front-runner for climate protection, to be the place of innovation and for visionaries; the continent that would stand up for its values and for human rights, be it at home or in the world. So today, the question is: will the new Commission, will you be ready to fulfil those potentials? Will you be able to meet the challenges of the environmental, social and democratic crisis that we do have in Europe right now? This will take courage. It will take conviction. During the hearings we’ve heard conviction in some of you, but not in all of you, and not on all topics. How, for example, is the Commission going to deliver an ambitious climate-protection programme if there is no will to change the agricultural and the trade policy? I can tell you that this is not going to work. Green headlines are just not enough. We need ambitious content. We need an ambitious agenda, and without a deep reform of the agricultural policy and of the trade agenda, any climate policy must remain half-hearted. And we just don’t have the time for that. (Applause) Let me point out some other problems as well. It is an unprecedented situation that the boss of one of the biggest IT companies in Europe will be a Commissioner for the internal market, including the digital economy, and thus overseeing the area his former company is one of the biggest players in. We acknowledge and we appreciate even the steps that Mr Breton has committed himself to undertaking in order to minimise the conflict of interest, but we do think that the conflict of interest here is inherent in his portfolio, and he didn’t have a voice over that. But we do think that this is a big, big problem and that the digital market should have been removed from his portfolio. And as Greens, we cannot accept this sort of conflict of interest, which risks our reputation as EU institutions. Another big problem lies, unfortunately, with our Commissioner from Hungary, sent to us with best regards from Mr Orbán. How can somebody who represents a government that is constantly undermining and breaking EU law and values, how can someone like that be telling countries that want to join the European Union that they absolutely have to follow rule of law and European law? That is cynical. (Applause) I believe that hardly anything embodies the European spirit as much as our integration policy. The idea that countries are willing and eager to join the European Union, to join our common union built on peace, democracy and freedom: that is the flame burning for us in Europe. And what are we telling those countries that are right now willing to change their policies, even their name? We’re telling them that they’re not important, that their voice doesn’t matter, that their aspirations don’t matter. I think we have made enough mistakes in that area recently. Let’s not add another. (Applause) President von der Leyen, we have raised those issues continuously. This is nothing new to you, but it’s really for those reasons that we cannot support your Commission. But we are willing to work with the Commission in order to strengthen European democracy and human rights; in order to tackle the climate crisis and to foster European integration. Whenever you and your college take initiatives in that regard, we are more than eager to cooperate with you, to work together with you. You will find in us a constructive partner, but rest assured that we will also be critical if you don’t. You can count on that. Colleagues, it is time for us to act: climate cannot wait, social inequality cannot wait to be resolved. And we hope that this Commission will surprise us in many positive ways, and we’re willing to give you a head start in that as well. Thank you very much. Good luck.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Jordan Bardella", "mepid": "131580", "text": "  on behalf of the ID Group. - Mr President, Mrs von der Leyen, during the debates of the European campaign, right and left may have given the illusion of disagreements as to the direction to be given to the European Union. But today, by a conspiracy of interests, you will, ladies and gentlemen, elect a Commission which is in line with the previous one. The game of musical chairs of the commissioners' posts that we have witnessed in recent weeks will do nothing: a good commissioner is above all a man or a woman who must be able to enter without flinching in the mould of regulations and procedures of which only Brussels has the secret. The emergence, throughout the continent, of political forces defending the interests of peoples and nations should have pushed you to review your copy and break with the totally obsolete logics that you will nevertheless prolong: free trade treaties, unfair competition, detached work, liberalisation of our public services, mirage of a federal Europe and, of course, migration laxity. So many words to which you will remain deaf, embarked in an infernal machine, technocratic, without borders and without soul. Shortly after granting the title of Commissioner for the Protection of the European Way of Life, your semantic courage gave way under pressure from the Socialists to become the promotion of European lifestyles, so much so already to appoint him because he will be: a Commissioner for the Promotion of Immigration. This Commission, I am sure, will fulfil its role perfectly, that of a leaden cap designed to stifle the aspiration for freedom and the historical continuity of European nations. Brexit should be an opportunity for the Council to put the treaties back on the table and move towards a fairer, more protective and above all more democratic Europe of nations.

The fact is that of the debate we have heard and also of the many proclamations and indications that have emerged in this debate.  There is, however, one starting point that is ignored, or even exalted and emphasised: the work of the Juncker Commission. This is the first point of disagreement, on which we take a totally negative view, because it is a Commission that in these five years has had such slow political action in finding solutions that, when it has sometimes found them, it has arrived with problems that have changed completely and profoundly. So we must also think about the political issue that has led to this, an issue that is back in alternate stages. Yesterday, a proposal for a document from France and Germany went back to the previous scheme, namely that of the management of the Juncker Commission, that is, exactly the approach that led to these negative results. In addition, there is a second issue, which is just as important as this one: the differences that have characterised political clashes in recent days, in recent months, even between France and Germany, and not on minor issues. Having a different, critical or polemical or alternative approach to NATO, Madam President, is not the same within these institutions. We need to clarify these positions for you. We want a clear position on this from the Commission and the President. And then there are the themes. Certainly the speech by the President of the Commission, the programme is a programme that looks ahead, a programme that aims to resolve all the major issues that are on the table, but we must also be realistic. What? The Just Transition Fund. What? Let us not put the issue of reducing emissions into an argument of environmental extremism, but let us try to put in place some firm points. 9 % of global emissions are produced in Europe, more than 40 % between the United States and China. And what is our demand for industrial policy? What is our objective and our response to the world of work, to the choices that must be made in this direction? Then there is the european budget and the multiannual financial framework. We want to do everything: the green deal, agricultural policies, cohesion policies. What? When are we going to deal with it and how are we going to deal with the budget? What answers will come to this question? As well as the major budgetary issue, with the risk of inserting the drift, once again, which aims to put in place penalty mechanisms for certain countries, as this Parliament has already done in the past with Article 7, finding an answer, precisely in those countries in which it has activated this procedure, by the people, because in those countries the voters have given the opposite response to the action of the European Commission supported by this Parliament. So we need clarity on these points, just as I would like to touch, finally, on the subject of immigration. His reference, his reference to the dramatic event of the 39 people who died inside a lorry, is something that certainly makes us think. But here is a failure of this policy, because on 21 November 67 immigrants died in the Mediterranean Sea and a thousand have died since January 2019. What is the immigration strategy? What is the policy? That of promising more resources within the budget in order to be able to increase and support the border police or that of having a strategy to give a real and serious answer, in which to make everything responsible overall and to pose and solve the problem in those places from which immigrants leave, and certainly not in the final phase in which they arrive?  These are the knots we are asking for. Our group has a different position, and I have no mystery in saying this because, as you know, we have a party within us which also expresses a Commissioner. Having said that, our approach will be realistic: we will look at the issues that you will address, point by point, the action and the things said, and on this we will give our action and our contribution, where this contribution will be useful to improve. Where we realise that a strategy will emerge that is far removed from our positions, we will clearly be in a position of opposition.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Martin Schirdewan", "mepid": "190517", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

We are talking about investments of up to EUR 1 trillion in a Green New Deal, and at the same time you are talking about massive investments in the digital transformation of the economy and society. But so far you have not been able to resolve the contradiction inherent in all these statements: how do you intend to implement your political plans if you stick to the wrong policy of austerity and cuts? Mrs von der Leyen, you will fail with your political programme if austerity is not brought to an end and the Member States cannot finally reinvest. And, Mrs von der Leyen, a different Europe is possible, but our visions of Europe and the paths that lead there are different. Peace cannot be achieved by armament and the militarisation of European foreign policy, but by imposing a halt to arms exports and by pursuing international disarmament. Social justice cannot be achieved by deregulating labour markets, but by enforcing binding social standards that protect against poverty and guarantee dignity. Environmental protection does not need flowery promises, but an ambitious policy to limit global warming to 1.5° and reduce CO2 emissions by 70% by 2030. The tax fraud of large corporations is not stopped by referring to the OECD, but by enforcing effective corporate taxes and closing the tax havens.

Today, when we sit together 30 years after the fall of the Wall, we are still seeing corruption flourishing in some Member States of the European Union, the rule of law is at risk and journalists are fearing for their lives or even being murdered. I am grateful to you for pointing this out. We must really work to ensure that the rule of law, peace and freedom apply throughout the European Union, including beyond. All the best and thank you for that! Thirdly, we have raised the issue of security. As the European Union, we have relied for years on the United States to guarantee our security. We are seeing that, unfortunately, they are increasingly no longer doing so everywhere, that we ourselves have to ensure order in our neighbourhood and that we do not have to ensure that civil wars do not explode there and that hundreds of thousands of people are murdered and displaced, and that we ourselves have to take responsibility there. I also very much support the fact that you are focusing on this. Fourthly, the issue of climate change. I am very grateful to you. Yes, we need a green deal. However, as you have pointed out, it must not be one-sidedly green. Many people are afraid of this. People who stand on the ribbons in the factories are afraid of this. People in rural areas who feel disconnected are afraid of this. Farmers are afraid of this, who are asking themselves: how are we supposed to bring food production and all these things together?

We have a huge amount of work ahead of us to make Europe. You mentioned a number of challenges. I want to focus on three keywords: sustainability, inclusiveness, social justice. We must therefore aim decisively and unambiguously at socially inclusive development that is environmentally sustainable, as the only asset today, to relaunch economic competitiveness, create new quality jobs and preserve the planet, leaving no one behind. To do this, it will be necessary to establish a new approach to economic governance that points to growth, not only by reviewing criteria and parameters but by incorporating social and environmental sustainability from the European Semester.

From my point of view, it makes no sense for someone who knows so little and is capable of leading the demography of the whole of Europe in demography.  However, this paradox is easy to explain. From your view, from Berlin when you look at it, the position of demographic commissioner to Croatia is a reward to the Croatian establishment for filling German cities with a minimum of 50 000 inhabitants per year according to scientific research.

The most progressive, actually, political agenda for the Commission is at the table, and we have to back it. But we Socialists shall be very vigilant and demanding on what you deliver, and the first test will be the Multiannual Financial Framework, because you cannot make policies without resources. Second, we have a strong team of Socialist Commissioners who have the vision, competence and energy to deliver, and the Commission cannot be seen anymore as the domain of the EPP, where one party dominates the policies. It’s a balance of policies and political forces. Third – last but not least – European citizens have no patience anymore. They want us to deliver. In the last European elections there was record participation, but the patience of citizens is at its limits, so please start acting and delivering from today. You only have five years.

Thank you for your determination to make this happen, and I now look forward to seeing similar balance in all of Europe’s institutions – on its boards and at its top tables.

One of the key tools at our disposal to deliver is the budget of the European Union for the next seven years. President—elect von der Leyen, let me tell you what Parliament expects in this area. We have all seen the people of Europe come out and vote: students, farmers, SMEs, people expecting more on security, expecting us to deliver more on tackling climate change. And we have to be honest with the people of Europe. We cannot do more with much less. If we agree that Europe should do more, this needs to be reflected in the budget of the European Union, and the position of Parliament is clear: fresh priorities require fresh funding. Please join us, President—elect von der Leyen, in convincing the Council and the Member States to put their money where their statements are. This is my first point. My second point: which areas should we invest in? We should strike a balance between old priorities and new priorities. Just because cohesion and agriculture have been our priorities for decades doesn’t mean that they are outdated. We need to continue to invest there, but of course we need to invest in digital, climate and so on. My last word is on timing. The budget is important, but it has become urgent as well. Let us work together to achieve, in the European Council in December, a common understanding on what we expect from Europe and what we expect from the budget.

In short, we share a political and non-bureaucratic vision of the Union. However, we will ensure that commitments are turned into concrete choices, including in the union's next budget. Of course we are committed to the fight against climate change, but we must also be careful that industry is not penalised, that our agriculture is not penalised. Industry is crucial, as is the company, to creating new jobs. That is why we need a competition policy that is appropriate to the times, enabling our companies to compete not only at national level but also at global level. We need protection against unfair competition. Attention to the Silk Road, to the Chinese hegemonic strategy, which risks putting the entire production system in difficulty, with dumping, including environmental, including social and not only commercial dumping. Attention is also paid to the protection of agriculture, as I said. We cannot allow cuts in the common agricultural policy. Agriculture remains a fundamental instrument for protecting the environment and for protecting employment in our European Union. It is therefore an unsustainable role.

This process is a sham. We are being used as a stage army marched out today to rubber-stamp a thoroughly anti-democratic imposition of a top-down power at Commission level. This Parliament is no more than a faux-democratic charade used to give a veneer of legitimacy to an illegitimate decision-making process.

That is true in national democracies but it is a flagrant lie, fake news and disinformation in relation to the Commission. Ms von der Leyen herself was not elevated to a position of power due to people power. The only power on display in her election was a behind-the-scenes cabal, which pushed her forward as a last-minute compromise candidate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's vote is not a vote like any other, it is a major vote, perhaps the vote of the century to face the two greatest challenges of our time: the climate catastrophe and the crisis of inequality, two issues that cannot be accommodated by vague or contradictory commitments. However, at the end of this sequence of auditions, it is clear that we remain hungry. From an ethical point of view first, three candidate commissioners have been dismissed for conflict of interest, and serious doubts remain about the independence of other members of the Commission. On the substance, there are of course promises to be welcomed, such as the minimum wage, the right to commit, the right of initiative of parliamentarians or the prospect of a major plan to insulate buildings. On all these issues, we will be vigilant allies in forming majorities of social progress. However, beyond these few advances, you remain clinging to the dogmas responsible for today's social, democratic and ecological crises. How can we aim for a green pact while pursuing climate-friendly free trade agreements? How can we combat tax evasion by protecting, within it, among the worst tax havens in the world? How can we think of a humanist policy by refusing a welcome worthy of exiles? Finally, how can we give hope to the peoples of Europe by continuing to impose on them the shackles of austerity? You can't be both firefighters and arsonists. The fire threatens everywhere, the European Union is now playing its survival, as citizens' distrust of the institutions has already exceeded the alert threshold.

People and the world deserve fiscal justice and end the impunity of multinationals that do not pay their fair share of taxes. People and the planet deserve a civilian body of rescue at sea, not a commissioner for the promotion of the European way of life who will turn a blind eye to the dead in the Mediterranean. People and the planet finally deserve better public services and social protections to lift the 113 million Europeans out of extreme poverty.

We may still deliver leaflets, knock on doors and transmit party political broadcasts on TV, but increasingly our voters are getting their information online through social media platforms and cleverly targeted advertising that takes advantage of ever more effective algorithms to target them individually from thousands of miles away.  It’s fair to say that citizens all over Europe are at the mercy of anyone with a sinister agenda and a computer. We are undergoing a quantum leap in our electoral processes, one that eclipses the advent of the printing press, the newspaper, the radio and the television, but the gap between this evolving technology, on the one hand, and regulation and legislation on the other, has now become a great digital chasm. Both literally and metaphorically, the old rules cease to apply as our legislation falls woefully behind reality. The stubborn refusal of companies such as Facebook to take clear and decisive action to police their platforms opens a door into our elections that any foreign actor can waltz through unimpeded. The proper regulation of platforms such as Facebook is not an infringement on freedom of speech. It is our moral duty. We must take stronger action against fake profiles and accounts. We must strengthen the EU Code of Conduct on disinformation, and we must reform electoral laws to cater for the modern era. We must investigate the financing of political parties by the Kremlin. For instance, in the UK, we know that Russian oligarchs have paid huge sums of money to play tennis with Boris Johnson.  Hostile governments are taking advantage of the digital space to interfere in our elections to further their own political goals. With over 50 national, regional and local elections due in Europe before the end of 2020, we must start taking this threat seriously. Those who detest the idea of democracy and view the messy process of elections as a charade to shore up their positions – Vladimir Putin chief amongst them – pour millions in economic and human resources into targeting European voters.  We have seen this in the UK, France and Spain, too. But it’s not just Putin who is playing this sinister game. We know that Dominic Cummings, who is advising our own government, spent time in Russia. This must be investigated, and there are many in this House who are here because of the darling of the US alt-right, Steve Bannon. There are those within our own Member States who are more than happy to accept the help of these external actors in their quest for power. I would look at Nigel Farage but he hasn’t turned up this week. I also look to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who has refused to disclose a parliamentary report on Russian interference in the Brexit referendum of 2016. He knows what is in that report. We know what is in that report, but he refuses to release it because the truth stands in the way of his personal ambition. Boris Johnson – release the Russia report now!  Things have got so bad that in the UK electoral campaign the government is now impersonating fact-checking websites to spread misinformation. Vladimir would be proud. He doesn’t even need to interfere any more. That one of the oldest political parties in Europe is willing to do this, says much about how foreign electoral interference takes root, infects our society and becomes the norm.  There must be a parliamentary response to this unacceptable behaviour and there must be decisive action, both in Member States and in Europe, and yet politicians have so far come up short. Facebook still operates as the Trojan horse into our democracy. The time has come for this new Parliament, for this new Commission, for this new reality we live in, to get serious. If not, we will be forever at the mercy of any authoritarian at a keyboard. I welcome your opinion, colleagues, and I hope you sense the same danger that I do.

Kennedy once said: ‘The ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all’. I believe that maliciously-influenced or misled voters could pose a similar risk to our societies. Evolving malicious interference and online manipulation shows that this risk to our democratic institutions is real and requires our constant attention. We are therefore grateful for this new opportunity to engage with you on this important topic. Let me repeat that our Presidency’s priority is to make sustained efforts to raise awareness, increase preparedness and strengthen the resilience of our democracies to disinformation. Hybrid threats, including foreign interference in our democracies, remain, therefore, at the top of our political agenda. The Presidency has taken a number of steps, in particular a dedicated and permanent horizontal working party of the Council was created during the first month of our Presidency. It discusses how to strengthen the EU’s capabilities in countering hybrid threats and to build resilience in the EU and Member States. The mandate of the group includes election interference and disinformation campaigns. We have proposed Council conclusions to be adopted in December on complementary efforts to enhance resilience and counter hybrid threats, building on the important work done at the EU level in recent years. The conclusions also pay attention to countering disinformation and securing free and fair elections. The last debate held in this House in September sought broad agreement that foreign interference and disinformation pose a major threat to democracy and EU values. Without a doubt, the EU institutions and the Member States have an important role to play; this is in the remit of their competencies in the protection of democratic processes. It is therefore appropriate that protecting European democracy is also a priority for President von der Leyen. We have in particular noted with great interest that Vice-President Jourová will be responsible for coordinating the work on a Europe and Democracy Action Plan that will include a set of initiatives. This will require a focus on building up resilience and countering disinformation while pursuing and protecting fundamental freedoms. Countering hybrid threats requires a comprehensive approach and a horizontal working method. This is why the work needs to be done in close alignment with all relevant stakeholders in the EU institutions as well as in the Member States to enhance the EU’s ability to prevent, detect and respond to hybrid threats. Protection of our democracies and elections involves concerted efforts by the EU and the Member States, but also by civil society and industry. Our response has to be comprehensive, with a focus on both the internal and external dimensions of the threat. Much has been done already, both by the EU institutions and individual Member States. Let me just briefly mention the main milestones, such as regular exchanges in the European election cooperation network, setting up the Rapid Alert System, enhancement of strategic communication, facilitating networks of independent fact checkers, promotion of media and digital literacy and awareness-raising activities, and monitoring of the implementation of the code of practice by social media platforms. But it is also important that we further develop institutional mechanisms and tools to fulfil the objectives set by the European Council. It is also essential to continue developing partnerships, especially our cooperation with NATO. In this regard, the Helsinki European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats also contributes to fostering cooperation in this field. Likewise, disinformation strategies by foreign actors are deployed beyond our borders. So we need to work with partners in the eastern and southern neighbourhood and in the Western Balkans. As stressed in the conclusions on democracy adopted by the Council last month, exposing disinformation, effective scrutiny over the financing of political messaging, strengthening media, information and digital literacy skills are key elements in this regard. We need to act together in a structured and coordinated way in order to tackle these challenges. Protecting elections is at the core of defending our European values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to take the floor on the issue of interference from other countries in our democracies and elections. The Commission has been deeply engaged in broad efforts to address the manifold risks stemming from lack of transparency, disinformation and other manipulations of electoral and democratic processes, and is committed to strengthening this path in the upcoming term. Indeed, as we heard from the Presidency, it will be one of my biggest tasks in the new Commission. Thank you for the support. The conduct of free and fair elections is primarily the responsibility of Member States. Nevertheless, a European approach is necessary given the cross-border dimension of efforts to manipulate democracy and the importance of joining efforts to address the threats. Just as with the rule of law, what affects one Member State can affect all and impact the Union itself. The threats at stake are complex and the targets are constantly evolving. For instance, external actors are more often using domestic proxies. We also see new technological developments allowing for new forms and strategies of interference. In the context of the 2019 elections, the Commission has taken a number of concrete steps to address the challenges, including with the election package of measures to secure free and fair elections in Europe, with the Code of Practice on Disinformation, which has been signed by Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft, and with the Action Plan on Disinformation, with which we have also made some progress. We will build on this work in the upcoming term. We have worked to put a holistic and permanent framework in place, with an aim to strengthen the resilience of our democracies and adapt to the evolving threats and coordinated and intentional manipulation.  To address the threats at stake, a coordinated and comprehensive approach is necessary, involving all actors across government, including regulatory and enforcement authorities, political parties, journalists, fact-checkers, researchers, educators and society and civil society at large, as well as industry and the online platforms. Some of them I mentioned, but of course we need to invite more to work with us. And of course we will need citizens to work on strengthening their own resilience against these new threats. I sometimes say that we have to work on increasing the demand for truth, and this will be a very big task ahead of us.  We need to get better when it comes to detecting, analysing and exposing disinformation and other manipulations of European democratic processes, whatever the tactics and actors employed. This needs to go hand in hand with wider efforts on monitoring cybersecurity and resilience against hybrid threats. In terms of cooperation, we can be pleased with the European cooperation network on elections, which meets today for the fifth time to discuss its future work on safeguarding elections. This is a new club and a very important piece of our toolkit. We also need to further enhance cooperation between EU institutions and EU Member States via this network and the Rapid Alert System, which will help us build a genuine community of practitioners. It will also allow us to build meaningful cooperation with international partners, such as the G7 or NATO, because we are facing a real global problem. We can improve the effectiveness of communication through a coordinated response to disinformation incidents, as well as raising public awareness more generally.  To this end, it is important to pursue our efforts aimed at facilitating the establishment of an independent community of fact-checkers and academic researchers to detect and expose disinformation campaigns across social networks.  Following its initial 12-month period of implementation, the Code of Practice on Disinformation is now in the process of being evaluated. Should the results under the Code prove unsatisfactory, the Commission may propose further measures, including of a regulatory nature. We also need to invest in strengthening media literacy, which is key to resilient and democratic societies. Citizens must be empowered to have the adequate tools for a well-informed participation in democratic processes. President-elect von der Leyen has proposed a new digital services act, which will upgrade our liability and safety rules for digital platforms, services and products. She has also pledged to put forward a coordinated European approach on artificial intelligence. These efforts will be vital if we are to ensure a prosperous, safe and democratic digital future for Europe. Building on the political guidelines of President-elect von der Leyen, I will in the new Commission lead on the work towards a European democracy action plan addressing the threat of interference in our European elections, whilst being mindful of the need to protect the freedom of expression. I will look into possible legislative proposals to ensure clearer rules on the financing of European political parties and greater transparency on paid political advertising. In our actions we must never lose the balance. Our goal is to protect our European democracy. So it is clear that the respect for freedom of speech and our fundamental rights and values must be our cornerstones.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 101, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Paulo Rangel", "mepid": "96903", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, first I would like to congratulate Commissioner Jourová for her nomination and to wish her well.  Commissioner, we know from experience that you are truly and deeply committed to the tasks that are involved in your portfolio. We know that your challenge is a difficult one, but I think there is also some enthusiasm, so I wish you all the best. You know that you will have the cooperation of our group and, I believe, of the House. The House has supported the whole Commission in a very strong and clear way, so I think we will have a very good relationship. I will now turn to my national language.  Madam President, the attempt to meddling, whether by foreign powers or sometimes with some complicity of internal forces, is undoubtedly a serious problem. Disinformation is not a new problem in history, but today, thanks to technological elements, it has a much stronger repercussion throughout society. We know that, for example recently, the Czech intelligence services have drawn attention to Russian and Chinese interference in the political and institutional process. We know that, in the case of Brexit, as has already been said here, there has been interference. We know that in the case of Catalonia an important part of the IPs is based in Greater Moscow. And so we know that there is foreign interference, that they take advantage of the internal political dynamics, that it is real and that there are tensions, to exploit it, expand and create instability, and also create disinformation, in the context of our societies. And so here I believe that it is fundamental, that it is indeed decisive, that we have, first of all, a great concern for the education of citizens. Citizens, and young people in particular, must be able to discern, to differentiate what is true from what is false, they have to have critical capacity.  There are very important social workers here: politicians, of course, religious leaders, scientists at the academy and journalists in particular, are four groups that we must have as target groups to rightly train and transmit, say, this to society. On the other hand, I think we could also use the External Action Service, because it must be effective in the capitals where we suspect there is such interference, to show the displeasure of the European Union.  And I must say by the way: there is also some interference linked to problems, the threats to internal democracy, and I can not help today remember the case of Malta, where the murder of journalist Daphne Galizia was something terrifying and that shows that free information is in danger even with the physical threat, and not just with the digital threat.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 102, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Kati Piri", "mepid": "37229", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. Free and fair elections are at the very heart of democracy, of our European project and our Union, but free and fair elections are not a given and should not be taken for granted. Election interference challenges the foundations of our democratic systems and risks are growing day after day and they are there to stay unless we take action. This is a major issue in many of our Member States and current policies are insufficient to counter this hybrid assault on our democracies. Millions of Europeans are being exposed to massive disinformation campaigns due to foreign interference. Cyberattacks have risen to an unprecedented level, with dangerous access to strategic infrastructure and data. Electoral rules on the financing of political parties by third countries are being breached. However, EU governments are still failing to act. Some governments are even hiding the truth from the public. This is the case of the UK Government of Boris Johnson, for instance. It recently refused to release the Intelligence and Security Committee report on the Russian threat to UK democracy. But this is far from being an isolated case. This comes after a plan by Russian actors to fund the Lega of Matteo Salvini, the Austrian FPO Ibiza scandal, the case of the French Front National, the Leave.EU campaign in the UK and suspicious online activities during the last European elections in Germany.  Last month, at the initiative of the S&amp;D Group, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which we called for bold action here in Parliament. We understood the importance of this issue and we called for the establishment of a special parliamentary committee on election interference to address the challenges effectively and holistically. But the proposal did not pass, due to the opposition of 52 Renew colleagues. I am puzzled why our colleagues from Renew, and more specifically the UK Lib Dems, insisted on having this topic on the agenda yet voted against the special committee addressing this issue here in the European Parliament. However, sometimes we find that it takes time to come to challenges. So let’s unite, let’s work together and let’s ensure that in the European Parliament too, we take this issue very seriously.

Madam President, Madam Vice-President, of course I congratulate you on behalf of the Renew Group on your re-election this morning. I would like to add, as a personal matter, all the pleasure I have in seeing you on the subjects that had already associated us in the previous Parliament, namely democracy and the rule of law. Our history is made of the search for a somewhat complicated balance. As Mrs von der Leyen pointed out this morning, the fragility of our democracies and the European Union stems from this historic search between the defence of freedom, the defence of freedoms, the right to think and the right to express ourselves and, at the same time, respect for the rules of law that are required of all so that we can live together in society. Throughout our history, we have invented printing, through which we have developed knowledge and ideas and advanced humanism. We invented and defended freedom of the press and freedom of thought, but we have been able to balance - you know, Madam Vice-President, especially since you come from a country that has not always experienced freedom of expression and freedom of thought freely - this freedom of thought by the principle of responsibility of those who disseminate and , at the same time, by rules imposed on the press and broadcasting. We can't spread everything in our democracies. When I hear, at a time when the internet is replacing the printing scheme, the press, etc. and going much faster, that we must give it total freedom, that it should not be regulated, that it should be allowed to self-manage, I think, Madam Vice-President, that we are undermining the very essence of the value of European democracy, that of the balance between freedom and the rule.

Today, however, we are talking about a different subject. \"The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is ruining our economy\" – that was the subject line of the email that paralyzed the Bundestag for weeks. This was a virus that, as it later turned out, was smuggled in by a group close to the Russian military intelligence service GRU. This was only the most obvious example of external intervention in our democratic institutions. But a lot of things are under the radar, and that is really a cause for concern. Everything that takes place in agitation in this form is part of a veritable ideological confrontation, a propaganda war in the digital sphere, it has to be said, between Russia and China on the one hand and the liberal democracies on the other. This does not only happen in German or English, it also happens in Russian. The case of Lisa in my city of Berlin – Berlin-Marzahn – where many hundreds of Russian speakers were mobilized by reports on Russian TV, by fake reports on Russian TV, is well known. But this propaganda is also happening on German, and not only in the form of Russia Today; Redfish on Facebook is a radical left group that actually calls for interesting and good and important climate policy concerns, but at the same time incorporates agitatory propaganda and belongs to the Russian news agencies. So we must also look at these ways, and these news agencies too. But we must also look at our own colleagues. There are parties that have a deep contempt for our democracy today and also contempt for this Europe, and they are also sitting here. Just today, there have been reports about the AfD – a pity that our colleagues are not sitting there: Jörg Meuthen EUR 95 000, Guido Reil EUR 45 000 – that is the donations that – it has just become clear – have been recruited via fake donors for these colleagues who are sitting among us every day. We have to ask them where this money comes from when the AfD is already openly saying that it is going to the Russian embassy for consultations again and again. Where does this money come from? Many of these funds came through Switzerland. It would be interesting to get answers to these questions. But it is not just about the anti-Europeans, it is also about us. We must strengthen our own democratic institutions, we must not fall into the anti-democratic patterns ourselves.

If this theme is imposed on us, it is obviously to reinforce the idea that Vladimir Putin's Russia would hide behind the successes recorded by sovereignist forces on a European continent.\" If President Macron, Chancellor Merkel and their friends rack up electoral setbacks, this could only be explained by manipulation from abroad. The National Agency for Security of Information Systems claimed last year that during the French presidential campaign, there were no Russian cyberattacks, giving the wrong of President Macron's camp. Even better, the report published on 14th June by the European Commission was quite unable to identify any disinformation campaign organised from abroad and focused on the European elections. So it's quite amusing to see that it's those who claim to uncover plots that resort to conspiracy by regularly imagining an invisible Russian hand. Interferences are clearly visible and very real, but they are not where you would like to see them. Didn't former US President Barack Obama interfere in the French election by openly supporting Emmanuel Macron in the inter-round? Didn't Chancellor Angela Merkel say in 2016 that she wanted to roll back the National Front? Finally, what about the threatening statements of European leaders or officials to intimidate the British people during the Brexit referendum or after the election of Mr Salvini in Italy?

It naturally raises thoughts about how much electoral influence China is trying to do under the surface when they are so brazen in the public sphere.  It is not only anti-democratic foreign powers that are trying to influence elections in democratic countries. The EU, too, uses propaganda to influence elections by painting a picture of who is evil and who is good. They also often paint a purely apocalyptic picture of the threats to the EU and the community and cooperation that exists. This is, of course, pure scare mongering to influence the national elections. And is there any difference between who is trying to influence an election? No, it's not.

They did not spend it in the North of Ireland; instead, the DUP spent it in a country where they do not field candidates – England – in order to circumvent English electoral law. There was no investigation into where it came from.  After the Brexit referendum, legislation was put in place that protected the DUP from having to disclose the source. This is the same DUP which is currently inciting loyalist mobs to campaign for DUP Brexiteers. Loyalists have put up intimidatory posters against Sinn Féin candidate and Mayor of Belfast, John Finucane, whose father, Pat, was murdered by Loyalists and British State Agents.  If this was happening anywhere else, the EU would be condemning it.

How much more evidence do we need to understand that this evidence is real? Well, the Commission, of course, talked about continued and sustained misinformation during the last May elections, similar to those carried out in the US and France. The report, of course, talks about limited action and I encourage the Commissioner, of course, in her new role, with the new College, to do as much as possible. Because what we’re talking about is online and offline safeguards, the banning of profiling for electoral purposes, the content shared by bots, the removal of fake accounts. Neither the private sector nor indeed our governments are doing enough yet. There can be nothing more important than free and fair elections. This is against the law, it’s covert, it is illegal and we must do something about it to safeguard our democracies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 110, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Martin Horwood (Renew).", "mepid": "197755", "text": "   – Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Vice-President on her election.

Will it detail Russian influence in the narrowly won Brexit referendum? We don’t know because our government, as has just been said by Mr Moraes quite rightly, has tried to silence our national parliament but still refuses to publish this report, although we know that no government agency or department stands in the way of publication, only the Prime Minister’s political will. Perhaps this is because the report may detail Russian donations to our ruling Conservative party and to the Brexit campaign. Our national parliament is currently dissolved and our government may have been at best asleep on the job, but I’m delighted that the European Parliament has provided a democratic forum in which we can ring the alarm bell and sound the wake-up call and I hope the Commission’s response will be much more determined.

Europe must ensure that every Member State takes the cyber threat seriously, because confidence in europe and for us elected politicians stands and falls with whether we take the threat to our democracies seriously.

Thanks to that fight, freedom and free and fair elections are something that we have across Europe in a much larger number today. It also something that we must safeguard, and we must take action, because we have been under threat. This is not just a debate about the lies before Brexit; it’s something which concerns all of us and which we experienced in every election, including the European election – in every national contest. Indeed, this Parliament did adopt a resolution last month on how to best approach the fight against foreign interference and against the spread of disinformation. I think this is a very good start for political action.  Let me just underline three things which we would expect from the Commission. First, this fight against external interference, and also the fight against disinformation, must become our political priority. This is not just a technical issue; this has to be at the forefront of the Commission’s political fight in the next five years. We have to make it a political issue; we can’t just keep on talking about who is responsible, who is to blame. We must take action, and indeed, we must be bold in terms of proposing also regulation. We must safeguard the space on the internet. We must safeguard Europe’s values. We must safeguard our democracy. We must also invest more money, more resources, into education – indeed, into education in the area where our citizens are most vulnerable: in cyberspace; on the Internet; in the digital space.

In the UK we are not there yet, as our Prime Minister – Boris Johnson – claimed last week that he had never seen any evidence of Russian interference in UK democratic processes. However, in December 2017, the then UK Foreign Secretary – Boris Johnson – said that he had seen evidence of Russian interference in UK democratic processes. Which Boris Johnson is telling the truth? As our First Minister of Scotland said today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is dangerous and unfit for office. In this climate of xenophobia, racism and intolerance towards foreigners, I’m very pleased to hear the tone of the debate today. When I read the text first of all, earlier this year, on our right to engage and make sure that when we talk in this debate, we choose our words very carefully. It is the state organisations and their representatives that get involved in this interference, in which it is not the people who exercise their democratic right to vote and to stand for election in their adopted country.

She describes any return to national sentiment as a danger and both claims to protect us from foreign interference. Any debate or resolution concerning the interference of foreign countries in elections is in fact very clear political attacks on European patriotic movements and, often, on Russia, accused of being major actors in foreign electoral interference and misinformation in national and European democratic processes. I can also cite proven cases of direct and overt foreign interference by leaders or lobby groups in the recent elections in the European Union: Mr Soros and his Open Society, which put out anti-Hungarian government watchwords on the walls of Budapest; Algerian leaders, who regularly call for the dissolution of the National Gathering; Mr Erdogan, with the abundant subsidies we give him, who gives voting instructions to dual nationals in Germany and France; and Mr. Obama, who is providing broad media support for Mr. Macron two days before the presidential election.

In Spain the Socialist Party is about to make an electoral alliance with the support of the Catalan separatists, but with an alliance with podemos's communists.

On the one hand, it is the concept of influencing, that is, when someone informs someone about something truthfully, independently, and the concept of spreading false news, and that is the problem that we encounter. Spreading disinformation is spreading lies! No one here is against free media, including social networks, spreading truthful information. No one here is protesting that. But we are all aware that false information is spreading on social media, and both the European Union and the Member States must oppose this. In the Czech Republic, for example, civil intelligence warns against Russian and Chinese influence. Its annual report draws attention to a Russian-backed campaign on social media and in the media to weaken both the European Union and NATO, in the form of false information. Influencing political processes seeks to put Member States in conflict and, of course, it is in the UK that this has succeeded. This means that this is about preventing the spread of lies, not restricting media freedom. On the contrary, we want free media, that's what we're all calling for. That is why I think that both the European Union and the Member States must support authors, they must promote media freedom, public media. I think that we are now facing a situation where the Member States have to implement the Audiovisual Services Directive, the Copyright Directive, which will ensure the promotion of quality media.

To emphasise the threat we face: in the first quarter of 2019, 2.2 billion fake Facebook accounts were removed, and Twitter challenged almost 77 million spam or fake accounts. From the Brexit referendum, to the election of President Trump, to the recent European elections, all have been subjected in some way to disinformation campaigns.  While fake news proliferates, high-quality journalism suffers. Populations are best served by a political system held to account by a well briefed, expert media who are sceptical – not cynical, and inquisitive – not inquisitorial. Consensus is not truth. Rumour is not fact. Defamation is not heroism. Career destruction is not systemic reform. Europeans recognise the threat of misinformation, and they want action.  A recent Eurobarometer poll showed that 83% of Europeans think that fake news is a threat to our democracy. There is a serious urgency to this. Doing nothing risks the fundamental foundations of our democracy. We need a quick—access route to deal with online lies. For too long, social media has operated as a Wild West of human discourse. The snowflake never needs to feel responsible for the Avalanche. We must have well—funded cybersecurity systems in place to counter the threat of fake news and foreign interference, with all Member States working together. Without proper facts and information, our laws will have little value. Without proper facts, our citizens cannot be confident in our institutions, including this one.

And another doctrine: ‘a lie repeated one hundred times becomes the truth’. We know this from the past, especially the former communist countries, and I lived half of my life in such a country. We were brainwashed by everyday propaganda, which was created in the Kremlin. That’s why I am quite happy that I can work on this agenda, because it has something to do with Russian propaganda, which is spread in the EU. We cannot only blame the external actors. We have also our own very hard-working and capable producers inside the EU, so we have to be very clear about who we have against us. We are taking lessons from some past events – you mentioned some elections in recent years, so this is exactly what we are doing, and we are clearly saying we will not be passive. We will continue what we have already started. We will upgrade the action plan against disinformation. We will upgrade all the efforts and plans around the elections. We will continue working with the electoral network, and we will continue working and cooperating with the platforms which have subscribed to the code of practice against disinformation. There is plenty of work ahead of us, and I think the debate also showed where we still have the gaps. We work and will continue to work against illegal content. There is some illegal content which we recognise as illegal by our criminal laws. What I mean is child pornography, terrorist content and illegal hate speech, which is spread through online networks. My doctrine is: what’s illegal, what’s prohibited offline must also be prohibited online. There must be crime and punishment also in the online world. It cannot be a space without the law. I have had many debates with police and prosecutors, telling them that they have to go after the cases of detected and clearly illegal content online. This disinformation is a little bit more problematic because we cannot clearly say that this is illegal content. Lying has always been here, and it was always recognised as not prohibited by the criminal law, and this is the legal issue. But we have to recognise the fact that this kind of lying, this kind of disinformation can be pretty dangerous. That’s why we are working against disinformation in the framework of working and fighting against hybrid threats, because this is also connected with our security. We work with the definition of disinformation which is needed to be focused and where we are concentrating our attention. We work with the definition that disinformation is verifiably false or misleading information which is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public and which may cause public harm. For us, what’s important is its verifiably false factor – we are not fighting against opinions, we are fighting against lies which are proven lies which we can counter through information. We will focus on intensity of disinformation attacks, on the level of threat – that’s why I mentioned before that we will work with NATO also on this issue. We will look at the intensity of manipulation and we will look at intentions. So our response will also have to be coordinated and well targeted. I think that we all are aware of the fact that the digital transformation and the revolution, having internet and social media, it is on one side a fantastic thing for a better life for the people. But also we have to see the risks. When I see what can happen from the sitting room – you can either initiate humanitarian help, save lives and the health of people or you can organise humanitarian crises or even genocide. Look at what happened to Rohingya. We also can see the cases when it is the starting point for revolutions. Look, for instance, at Maidan in Ukraine. It started on social media. So this is not a black and white picture. We have to support the good things, but also to address the risks. I just want to briefly react on some of your comments on the budget – that it’s underestimated. We have already increased the budget of StratCom and of the professional units which deal with the fight against disinformation. We have to be better in analytical work; we have to support research; we have to be better in detection and education. We will not pay for all that with big money, because we have something very valuable, we have started cooperation between the EU institutions, the Member States, with the platforms, with civil society and with research, because as you rightly said, we need to develop better technologies for detection and analysing disinformation which might cause harm to our society. We have to protect better the elections and to be very serious about the strong demand for GDPR to be used, is applied to protect the private data of voters so that we don’t have any further Cambridge Analytica cases. We have to do much better and more on transparency, including the transparency of the financing of political campaigning. We have the obligation to guarantee that in our Member States and in the EU there will not be the cases that the last elections will be the last free ones. You never know, but we have the obligation to guarantee that we will have free and fair elections. We must not have winners of the elections who will win because they can lie better. We must not have winners who will be better at using dirty money and dirty methods. I think that this is what we have to work together on. I have many more comments, but I am quite far beyond the time. Thank you very much for your attention.

Indeed, I was first of all thinking, I think it’s the third or fourth time that I say goodbye to this Hemicycle either here or in Brussels but indeed it is a pleasure to be back for the last session in which I will be in office, and just to reassure you that not only will I take the debates tonight, but also the urgencies tomorrow and the vote tomorrow, so I will be there until the very last moment possible and that is indeed somehow a sign of dedication and recognition of the work that this Parliament is doing, in particular on foreign policy.  Let me also thank you for the opportunity with this debate to look back at these five years of work with our Eastern partners. I remember very well when I took office in 2014 that was the most important element of our foreign and security policy agenda for sure. I can now proudly say that we have become closer, as the European Union, to all our Eastern partners, to all six of them, in different ways, and I believe we have managed to improve the situation of each and every one of them in this partnership and through this partnership even if, obviously, challenges remain, and I will try to go briefly through the achievements, the positive sides, but also the shortcomings and the things on which we will, I think, still need to work a lot together.  I believe that this positive path that we have followed has been possible because our work has been focused always on our greatest common interests that we share between the European Union and our Eastern partners, and that is our people, the people of Europe, whether they live inside or outside the European Union. Indeed, the 20 deliverables that we are implementing within the Eastern Partnership focus on the issues our people care the most about – jobs, energy security, education, strong civil society, independent media – things that are indeed on top of our citizens’ agendas. In these years, we have put in place ambitious association agreements and free-trade areas with Georgia, with Moldova and Ukraine. Their citizens can now also travel to the European Union without a visa when they come for business, for tourism or to visit family. We have also achieved good progress in trade, energy, connectivity or the digital sphere. At the same time, we need to do more in the fields of rule of law, judiciary and fighting corruption.  Earlier this year we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Eastern Partnership together with our partners, and we decided to launch a broad consultation process on the future of this Partnership. We have collected now more than 200 contributions coming not only from governments and civil society, but also academia, the business community, Members of the European Parliament and other stakeholders, and I want to thank you for the contributions you have given us. I am proud I can now leave to you and to my successor this huge capital of ideas, achievements, but also aspirations and dreams, as a very solid foundation for the next Eastern Partnership summit and for the future of our Partnership itself. Of course each of the six countries has a different situation and different aspirations too, so let me very briefly go through them.  Ukraine has faced unparalleled challenges, with Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since 2014, we have put together for Ukraine the biggest support package in the history of the European Union. We have invested more in Ukraine than in any other country in the world and no other partner has invested in Ukraine as much as we have done.  This has led to some very important tangible results. I would say that Ukraine today is a stronger, more resilient country than it used to be. The new government has taken a bold approach to reforms as the people of Ukraine expect substantial change on the rule of law, on the fight against corruption and the prosecution of bank fraud.  In in recent months, positive developments have also materialised on the security side, mainly thanks to Ukraine’s constructive approach and the Normandy Four Summit on 9 December is now an opportunity for substantial progress. Our priorities are the same as those of our friends in the Eastern Partnership countries, be it security, good jobs, good governance or institutions that they can trust and rely on. This is also the case in the Republic of Moldova, where we have supported structural reforms to fight corruption, improve the electoral framework, and to ensure an independent and accountable justice system. Moldova now has a new government and the need for genuine reform remains. As always, the European Union, is ready to support reforms in all possible ways and as always our support remains conditional. Our support is – and I believe will continue to be – focused in particular on reforms to fight corruption and vested interests and in ensuring that state institutions preserve, or rather sometimes build, their autonomy and are not politicised. Moving to Armenia. The government has committed to substantial democratic reforms in line with our partnership agreement. In fact, Armenia considers the agreement with the European Union as a true blueprint for reforms and we are proud of that. Our support to the reform process has increased after last year’s political revolution, including to the ongoing justice reform and I am confident that this Partnership will become even closer in the years ahead. With Azerbaijan the work continues in order to finalise a new agreement. We want an ambitious agreement in line with international standards, one that ranges from human rights to the support of the diversification of their economy. We will also continue to work for the peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, encouraging and supporting dialogue at the highest level between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We fully support the mediation efforts and the proposals of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, including through the work of our Special Representative.  The European Union was born as a peace project. Building peace is our DNA, it is our raison d’être. It goes to the core of who we are. We need I believe to continue investing enormously on this, as conflict has not yet disappeared from our continent. On the contrary, the security situation along the administrative boundary line with the Georgian breakaway region of South Ossetia has worsened in recent months. That is why we are increasing our EU monitoring mission’s presence on the ground, because our support to Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is not just a statement or a declaration of principle: it is the foundation of our daily concrete work on the ground.  Georgia is a close and reliable ally in the neighbourhood in our Partnership, and this is precisely why we don’t shy away when we see risks – as today we see the risk in the country of a backsliding on some important reforms in the rule of law area.  Finally, on Belarus. The recent parliamentary elections were somehow a lost opportunity to deliver on international standards and we have called on the authorities to implement electoral reforms before next year’s presidential elections. You will know that we have divergences with Belarus, particularly on human rights, yet I’m convinced the only way forward is to continue engaging and to finalise our partnership priorities. This would be the best way, not only to work on our mutual interests, such as the economy or nuclear safety, but also to better address the human rights situation, which is so important for us.  So putting people first was our approach throughout these five years, with all the six partners, as diverse as they are, with a differentiated approach respectfully, and we’ve always focused on people and not on geopolitics, and I want to close on this: to stress once again something that I have discussed several times, not only with our partners in the East of Europe, but also with our interlocutors a little bit further east, explaining clearly that our Eastern Partnership is not, and I believe will never be, against anyone – it’s for. It’s for our people. It’s for improving living standards, including democratic standards, for a more peaceful European continent based on partnership and cooperation.  I went to close my short remarks by thanking you and this Parliament for all the support you have given to our work with our Eastern Partners because, in particular in this field, the work of Parliament has been key in liaising with the national parliaments through your many delegations, through your many visits, and this has been a fundamental pillar in accompanying our work, not only with the institutions, but also the societies of our six Eastern Partners.

We have just heard it from the High Representative: the Eastern Partnership is an important instrument for promoting the transformation from formerly authoritarian, socialist systems to democratic, constitutional and market-based countries. In my view, there are three objectives that should now accompany the further development of the Eastern Partnership: firstly, the European Union should make the political and economic integration of the Eastern partner countries a strategic priority for the next decade. This applies in particular to Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, with which we have already agreed deep and comprehensive association agreements. Secondly, this integration process requires a clear, consistent strategy and active support from us as the EU and, on the other hand, serious efforts from our partners. As we have often stressed in this House, the principle of 'more for more', more for more, but there is no doubt about that, the principle of 'less for less', less for less, applies. And as the High Representative has just explained, we should focus on democracy, the rule of law, the independent judiciary and the fight against corruption when it is incentivised for further reform. Thirdly, in order to take advantage of the dynamism of the Eastern Neighbourhood, it is necessary for the European Union to indeed continue to make progress and adopt a qualitatively differentiated approach. The 2030 Trio Strategy for Relations with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, which is initiated by Andrius Kubilius – who is sitting here in the Chamber and will speak immediately – could contribute to this. The Eastern Partnership is also part of a long-term strategy towards Russia, because the success stories of the countries associated with the EU can also give the people of Russia hope that positive change is possible. We in the European Parliament, in close cooperation with the newly elected European Commission, should push forward these objectives resolutely. And these objectives should be presented in time for next year's summit. And finally, dear Federica, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, your committee in this European Parliament, let me say a word of thank you. Like almost every Wednesday during plenary sessions in Strasbourg, you're sitting on your seat discussing foreign policy with interested colleagues from all the political groups, wholeheartedly let me once again thank you for the excellent work you have done in the last five years.

Let me start with recent developments which are to my group’s concern in Georgia. Large protests are currently held in Tbilisi, since the government failed to deliver on its commitment to change the electoral code in 2020 to a full proportional system. This promise was given to the Georgian voters and we expect all Georgian parties to deliver on this promise. While Georgia did come a long way in democracy during the last few years, the current political crisis risks great instability in the country and that’s something that Georgia can simply not afford. We expect from all political parties that dialogue is initiated on how to solve the current deadlock. Then in Azerbaijan, which is far from Georgia’s level of democracy, the Aliyev dynasty has a horrible track record when it comes to human rights. Only last month, authorities have violently dispersed peaceful rallies of opposition parties and dozens of participants were detained, beaten and mistreated. Illegal wiretapping of EU diplomats in private conversations with opposition and civil society makes their job impossible, and the failure of the EU to confront all this is sometimes tied to a fear that Azerbaijan may turn to Moscow. Well, I believe that already happened a long time ago and now we see unfortunately the confirmation. High Representative, let me also, on behalf of the S&amp;D Group, thank you for the last 5 years.

I don’t know what position you will take but I am sure our roads will cross and we will have a good and effective cooperation. The Eastern Partnership initiative allowed us, the European Union, a very unique opportunity of creating a zone of partnership and security along our external eastern borders. For our partners it is a chance to attain prosperity and stability by adopting European standards. We have learned many lessons over the past ten years, including the one that application of programmes without adjusting them to realities, needs and the aspirations of concerned countries does not work. For the next decade of the Eastern Partnership, we need to be more ambitious and, instead of inventing projects, we should invite our partners to join the ones that we ourselves are implementing in the EU. Our Eastern partners must be given a real partnership, therefore, to be included into our initiatives on climate, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, connectivity, energy and social inclusion programmes and priorities. It is evident that those who put more efforts and present positive results on reforms carried out should be allowed to deepen their aspirations with the European Union. We have several countries which, without EU membership, are participating in our single market. Ukrainian workers are already important contributors to Lithuanian, Polish and other economies, and they deserve to have their labour rights fully guaranteed.

Does this action support Russia’s interest in the region? Are those people the representatives of the West? But those are the wrong questions. The leaders of these countries do not have to believe in us, they need to believe in the future of their countries. Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine are all at a critical juncture. In all three cases, we have seen ambitious starts of reforms, and yet in each case, but for different reasons, today we are not sure whether those reforms will continue or whether they will end up in democratic backsliding. And the question is not whether politicians can write nice press releases about Western liberal values – I’m sure they all can – the question is whether they can carry out reforms backed by their societies. Meanwhile, the Eastern neighbourhood countries expect us to support them, especially since other neighbours are working against the success of these countries. The economic success of those neighbourhood countries would be Putin’s biggest defeat. The societies of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova want us to help in the process of transforming their societies, which is not without sacrifice. I know what I want to see in these countries. I do not advocate reforms because that would serve our geopolitical interest, as you have mentioned Ms Mogherini, or the business interests of Germany’s car industry. I’m advocating painful reforms because the overwhelming majority of the people living there want to see democratic and prosperous societies; an economy which works for the people and not for a few oligarchs; a state which serves the citizens, not the politicians’ personal interests. For meaningful change, we need strong and committed governments. However, strong government does not mean having an executive power without control. It is worrying to see those trends in Georgia and in Ukraine, as already mentioned. Yes, the governments are under pressure, but they can by no means neglect or oppress criticism. Our criticism is not about someone being pro—Kremlin or pro—Brussels, it is about being pro—democratic and in favour of functioning institutions. And yes, it is in Putin’s short—term interest to have politicians in power whom he can personally influence or buy off, but this is not our style. We need leaders to be pro—reform. Our interest is to have functioning institutions which will work well without Putin, without the oligarchs and even without us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 172, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Bernhard Zimniok", "mepid": "197489", "text": "  On behalf of the ID Group, I would like to make a i-see of the Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which Once again, the EU is approaching a project with a very blue-eyed approach: this time to enlargement to the east. Let us look at Ukraine. Ukraine has received the most attention among its entire eastern neighbours for years, particularly because of its dispute with Russia. Since 2014, €14 billion in grants and loans have been granted to Ukraine to support reform efforts. This includes the reform of the judiciary and alignment with the European standard. This includes the implementation of the Hague Convention on the Abduction of Children( HC for short. If a child is abducted by a parent to a country that has signed the KÜ – for example, now specifically to Ukraine – the country's judiciary should ensure that that child is returned to the country from where it was abducted. Ukraine has failed since the agreement was signed. Reports of corruption and nepotism are mounting, and by 2017 there had been 33 child abductions from Germany to Ukraine. The then Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Justice admitted in an interview that not only one of these children was returned to Germany – despite positive judgments of the Ukrainian courts. I therefore call on Ukraine to finally transpose and implement the Hague Convention on the Abduction of Children into national law.

Despite our efforts, there are still very difficult issues that we have to raise. Many dynamic things are very positive.

That is why our Neighbourhood Policy must continue to support these countries, together with their people, in this process. This also means more rule of law, independent justice, involvement of civil society and empowerment of actors to intervene in social development, efforts to combat corruption, development of stable democratic institutions, promotion of political dialogue and confidence-building measures, transparency, independent media, peaceful conflict resolution and the promotion of peace, security and stability. However, the current developments are worrying and concrete. For example, Moldova. The election of Maia Sandu was a glimmer of hope. When Sandu proposed a change in the law on November 8 that would have allowed candidates for attorney general to be nominated directly, Socialists and Democrats requested a no-confidence vote that narrowly lost the government. The Sandu government apparently proved to be a threat to the kleptocratic system of the old elites.

But, we cannot be bigger fighters for the integration of those countries than the leadership of those countries. Today I will talk mainly about Georgia, not about Moldova, whose new prime minister decided to go for the first visit to Moscow. Recent developments in Georgia force us to be really very much concerned about the situation and future of democracy in Georgia. It’s obvious: no democracy, no integration. You know that the leader of the ruling party in Georgia decided not to implement his own promise, which he gave to Georgian citizens and the opposition to support the introduction of a proportional election system. He gave this promise in order to convince, to answer the previous wave of protest in the middle of last summer. Now the trust of Georgian people towards Parliament and to democracy in Georgia is lost. It’s obvious that the ruling party decided not to fulfil their promise because, perhaps, they became afraid that they will lose proportional elections next year. What are the conclusions we can make from such a decision of the ruling party? Perhaps it means that the ruling party is planning to use old administrative tricks to win elections. That is why this discussion is a very good opportunity to urge ruling party leadership and leadership of Georgia to come back to real and trustful dialogue with the opposition. Second, we need to urge both the ruling party and the opposition to agree on major reforms of the election system because people will not trust in the old system. The so—called German system could be a basis of such an agreement because that would not demand a change of the Georgian constitution. And the last point, the European Parliament should urge political parties in Georgia really to implement all the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OHDIR) recommendations on how the administration of elections should be improved in order to stop the practice of influenced elections.

With the launch of the Eastern Partnership in 2009, the European Union strained to improve relations with countries with which it shares strong interests in energy, i.e. security, while strengthening general, multilateral and regional cooperation. Through comprehensive trade relations, the European Union wanted to strengthen its influence.  In recent months we have been witnessing events in these countries that are very much affecting these plans. While preparations are under way in Ukraine for the Normandy summit, the first in three years, it encourages the cessation of conflict and prisoner exchanges. Unfortunately, a new wave of instability is breaking out in Georgia due to the lack of compromise on electoral reform. Elections in Belarus continuously do not meet international standards. The opposition has no more deputies this term. In Moldova, the ruling coalition recently fell apart. While opportunities in Armenia look stable, apart from the permanent conflict with Azerbaijan, I would like to stress in particular the European Union's relationship with Azerbaijan. There is an inadmissible absence of reaction as european union officials publish their talks through public media and the leadership speaks out openly against the European Union.  It is clear that after ten years since the establishment of the Eastern Partnership, geopolitical challenges and political circumstances in these countries require stronger action by the European Union.

But what is hampering most the progress in all these countries is still Russia’s wish to hold them in its sphere of influence. Five out of six Eastern Partnership countries have conflicts on their territory. This is what prevents these countries from moving forward. The new European Commission should have as one of its priorities working towards finding solutions to these frozen, or not so frozen, conflicts, so that the Eastern Partnership countries can focus their energy on the much-needed reforms and development. It is imperative for the EU to support the territorial integrity of the Eastern Partnership countries. Also, we must guarantee adequate funding in the new MFF to help them continue with reforms.

I believe that we have to continue on that path. But you also said that more needs to be done in the area of the rule of law and the judiciary, and I couldn’t agree more with you because we should not be complacent about what we see happening at the moment. I believe that what colleagues have already mentioned concerning the recent developments in Moldova and Georgia are very much due to the lack of stability of the institutions. We have tried to support institution-building, but we see that, for instance, in Moldova, the grip of the old regime is very hard, and it is a question of the old power trying to defend its vested interests. If we can do more there, in these areas in our neighbouring countries, I think it’s worth increasing the efforts on the rule of law and the judiciary.

I would like to confirm the words of the High Representative that there was no proposal for this to be a vote against Russia. It was Russia itself that decided that it was threatened by democracy and free trade. The European Union has invited Russia as an observer in a group of Friends of the Eastern Partnership.  The question is, how successful have we been? We have spent over EUR 10 billion on valuable projects, we have deep free trade agreements, visa-free travel with three of these countries. 80 000 young people have benefited from Erasmus+.  In all these countries, however, there is one thing that we have not been able to win, namely uncompetitive structures in the economies of these countries.

Russia is openly and increasingly aggressively changing the internal political, social and security arrangements in most countries of the region.

Ukraine is a country badly hit by the Russian Federation, a country that lost Crimea, which actually has a civil war disguised in the east of the territory, a country that has ports often blocked on the Black Sea.  Why this? Because the Russian Federation cannot accept this country's orientation towards the European Union. The solution for Ukraine to remain whole is to be supported and helped by European experts, showing the government the error, if the Steinmeier plan were to be implemented. It is the risk of losing eastern Ukraine, because a referendum will follow after federalisation and the declaration of independence will follow, as in Hosetia, in Abkhazia, in Crimea. It's Russian technique.  In connection with the Republic of Moldova, unfortunately Mrs. Maia Sandu has entered the situation of losing the government alone. In Moldova it is a paradox. The opposition, which consists of two pro-European parties, is witnessing a tough, minority government of pro-Russian Dodon.

At the same time, this region is an arena of opposition to two competing concepts: that of European integration and of the European cooperative. Ten years from now, the Eastern Partnership should do two things.

Of course, that wasn't easy. The fact is that Eurasia is an area where the key interests of the world's geopolitical players interbreed, where more than 70% of the world's population lives, where 75% of the world's energy reserves are located. And of course there is also Russia and China and many other countries seeing their interest, and the European Union of course needs to define its own.  In this sense, really good results have been achieved, but unfortunately we see that in some countries we have a reverse process, that certain democratic standards are being lowered and that the process of adopting Western standards of democracy and the protection of human rights unfortunately does not go as we should perhaps all together.  Here I would send three messages of what I think the European Union should do, what principles should guide its policies. First, it should be unique. We must not allow the individual geopolitical interests of some Member States of the European Union to impede the achievement or undermine the credibility of a common European policy. This uniqueness, this definition of common interests is the only way for the European Union to be a serious player on the world stage.  Secondly, the European Union needs to be clear and open, without a finger in its pocket. It needs to clearly define its interests and in this open and transparent way approach those pro-European and pro-Western forces in these countries in this area.  And third thing, the European Union needs to deliver on its promises. Without fulfilling promises, without honoring those results achieved in individual countries in the long term, these countries will lose any motive to approach Europe, to approach the West.  Of course, negative phenomena should be condemned, but all those positive things should also be honored. And I would emphasize that no one is good just because they are pro-Western oriented, political or words-oriented, but should show it by deeds.

I congratulate the new authorities on their enthusiasm and courage in making the changes that both Ukrainian society and eu partners are waiting for. The fight against corruption, judicial reform, responsible and effective governance are great challenges. The progress of decentralisation and the strengthening of civil society are also crucial for the development of Ukrainian democracy.  However, while appreciating the determination of the authorities, I would like to stress the importance of extensive consultation, the inclusion of all partners – including civil society – at all levels of change.

Ten years ago, it was launched when the Czech Republic was president of the European Union, and that's when we Czechs stood by it. I also remember those debates on the part of the Czech Government, in which I had the honour of being, when the main philosophy was to help countries that are between the European Union and Russia, fill this space and, unfortunately, are often under enormous pressure and influence from Russia. I think this partnership fulfils this geopolitical reason. If we were to vacate this area and stop communicating with these countries, to support them, I fear that russia's influence, which has unfortunately been increasing in some of these countries recently, see Moldova, for example, would increase even further in the future. So the geopolitical plane here is unequivocal, but then there is the simple reason that these are countries whose people, at least in no small part, want to live in freedom, democracy and prosperous states. These are our European values that we should support in these states. I think that, despite some problems, this partnership can be evaluated positively and we should intensify and strengthen this cooperation for the next decade. It must be said, as some colleagues have said, that these six countries do not logically have a unified development – there are some internal problems, there are varying degrees of Ingerence of Russia – and that we should therefore have a different strategy for individual states.

When I took office exactly five years ago, five years and a couple of weeks ago, I paid my first visit outside of the European Union to Israel and Palestine, including a visit in Gaza. And I said at that time that I believe that a two—state solution could be achieved during my mandate. This was the goal that I kept in my mind and in my actions all of these years. And, at some points, I have to say this goal seemed to be getting closer, but we all know what the situation looks like today. This doesn’t mean that the perspective is not there and is not valid anymore. I think it is a matter of political will and political conditions, and I’ll get back to that. But today, clearly, if I paid the same visit probably I wouldn’t say that I believe that that solution could be achieved in the coming months or years. The very idea of two states today has come under attack as never before from many sides. Yet, we should all know that a two—state solution remains – I’m profoundly convinced of this – the best and the only realistic chance for peace and also for security in the holy places. This is a principled and a pragmatic position at the same time. Nobody – nobody – has presented a credible alternative to two states so far. Many have argued against, but nobody has expressed any clear view that can substitute that objective realistically. And any plan that is not firmly anchored in international law – and let me add, also in the profound aspirations and interests of the people, not only of Palestine and Israel but also of the region – would ultimately fail. Our support for the two states is a matter of international law, is a matter of justice and democracy, but, as I mentioned, is also a matter of realism. In these years, we have worked full time to avoid the dissolution of the two—states perspective. And the work continues today, even in such difficult circumstances, let me say especially in such difficult circumstances. Because sometimes we have the impression – as do some of our friends in the UN system, in the Arab world, but also a little bit farther away in Africa and Asia – that especially in this moment where it is so difficult to keep the perspective alive, that the voices of wisdom and realism need to be heard and need to speak up. This is why we have, as the objective was fading away, kept our position and our work at full speed and with all our strength. This explains our position on all recent developments. First, on settlements: we have always believed that border changes can only be decided through direct negotiations between the parties based on the pre—1967 borders. Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory are illegal under international law. They constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two—state solution impossible. In addition, settlement activity in East Jerusalem seriously jeopardises the possibility of Jerusalem serving as the future capital of both states. We have never shied away from restating this position, including just a week ago, and it is a united European position. I frequently hear many people inviting us to speak with one voice. In difficult times in difficult years, this has remained and remains the strong united European Union position. Our position is also clear and unchanged regarding the security of the state of Israel. Firing rockets on Israel’s civilian population is simply unacceptable, and I’m grateful to Egypt for their diplomatic efforts, which helped to stop the recent escalation. And I will repeat once again: Israel has the right to security, Israelis have the right to security. But we are also convinced that security will only be sustainable and real if it is built on peace and on a two-state solution. As you know, in recent years we have also worked constantly to alleviate the suffering of the people of Gaza. With the Gaza desalination plant we are providing concrete and long—lasting support which will benefit hospitals, schools, enterprises and every citizen of Gaza. Yet the crisis in Gaza is inherently political in nature and requires a political solution. The closure must end and crossings must be fully opened. At the same time it is also clear that Gaza is part of the future state of Palestine and that Palestinians themselves must find unity beyond their divisions. We know that the current political outlook is uncertain, both in Palestine and in Israel. Discussions among Palestinian factions have not yet led to a substantial reconciliation. President Abbas has announced his intention to set a date for elections. And on the Israeli side, the political stalemate continues and might lead to an unprecedented situation with the third election in just one year. It is my firm conviction that, with courageous leadership, a return to negotiations is possible. I am still convinced today, five years after my first visit as a High Representative in Palestine and Israel, that that is the goal and that is realistically achievable. Actually, I’m convinced that this is the only achievable, sustainable, realistic solution to this conflict. And let me say, personally I’m also deeply convinced that, out of all the crises and conflicts of the region of the Middle East, this is probably the easiest to settle in concrete terms, provided – and this is the most difficult thing to achieve – there is political will among the parties and among the international players to accompany this process. There won’t be peace without a strong political commitment by both sides and by the international community.

I give her all the support, and I certainly share a lot of what she has said in a situation that is logically not going to be resolved immediately, but in which we all try in good faith, from different angles of view, to participate so that there is at last a peace, which will give stability not only to the region, because of this terrible conflict that has been spending it for years , but also us Europeans, and the rest of the world. Congratulations, Vice President, on the work done. And, in our case, I want to make it clear that Israel is a preferred strategic partner with whom we share history and values. We are, after all, the European Union and Israel, democracies that we strive to promote throughout the world our principles and our vision of a world that respects the right to assistance of other States and peoples. Israel is concerned about its security. It's logical and normal. We've all seen how the cloud of rockets that came out of Gaza began. It is no less true, too, that there should be no escalations, and we welcome the slowing down of this in the end. We cannot do so with our statements; and I always have a bit of a feeling that we're always talking based on what Americans say. Let us see if we already in the European Union react and act on our own in this matter. I believe that we can contribute to dialogue, we can contribute to peace in our own way. I think it's important not to get carried away by tweets and statements. I think it is important that we work, that members of the Knesset come, as they will come ⸺I have asked for it and they will come, I believe, in two weeks' time to the Strasbourg plenary⸺; that, at the executive level, these ministerial meetings continue that were interrupted, and that we continue with that dialogue. And then the work we can do. I think it's a big mistake about the labelling on the products in the settlement areas. I think it is the other way around, the European Union should be working with Israel and the Palestinians and helping the development of the region. I think it would be necessary to make a new approach that will give more prosperity to the area. Maybe we can actually help put an end to this. Some communist comrades on the far left are already laughing. Logically, we'll listen to them. I don't want to insult anyone, I don't want to mess with anyone.

Only days after yet another round of violence in and around the Gaza Strip, US State Secretary Pompeo announced a major U-turn of US policy towards Israeli settlements. He declared, and I quote: ‘the establishment of Israel’s civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law’. This declaration clearly goes against the 4th Geneva Convention, UN Security Council resolutions and the 2004 opinion of the International Court of Justice. I welcome and fully support the immediate and strong reaction by you, High Representative. Israeli settlements are illegal under international law and Israel has the obligation to end all settlement activity as an occupying power. Pompeo’s announcement is yet another example of the Trump administration’s obsessive support for Prime Minister Netanyahu. This includes the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moving the US Embassy there and recognising Israel’s sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights. It seems that the Trump administration, instead of coming up with the so-called deal of the century, has decided to play with escalating the conflict at the expense of Palestinians, Israelis and the international community at large. President Trump must understand that the Middle East is not his foreign policy playground. It is the home of millions of Israelis and Palestinians striving for peace, day after day. The steady increase in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including in east Jerusalem, clearly undermines the prospect of any viable two-state solution. This is our only hope for a just and lasting peace in the region.

Mr President, Madam High Representative, I would like to thank you very much in the first place. We have debated here many times over the last five years until very late in the evening. I always enjoyed having to go into the debates with you. Moreover, I think that we have debated Israel and Palestine most often. You said it was your first shipment outside the EU. Well, I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we have debated the situation in Israel and Palestine the most many times in the last legislature, because we are concerned, and because we continue to be concerned.  If we now just look at the fact that since 2017 Israel has built up 12 000 dwellings a year in the West Bank, that 26 illegal outposts have been built, and that since 2009 no fewer than 6 000 Palestinian buildings in the West Bank have been destroyed, including buildings financed with European taxpayers' money, then I think it should be clear. Israel is working step by step towards a one-state reality, on a fragmentation of the Palestinian territory where there will soon be no room for the Palestinians at all. We can't let this happen. I would like to hear you say: 'We need political will'. Well, Europe stands for an international legal order based on rules. It's up to us to go against that power policy of Netanyahu and Trump, against the settlement politics that they are purposefully escalating. It is up to us, Europe, to continue to fight for this two-state solution, which I believe is the only solution.  Madam High Representative, it will probably be one of your last debates here in the plenary in Strasbourg. So I ask you, but also your successor, to oppose any decision that is a step back in the peace process, to act hard when our projects are destroyed and to speak out unequivocally – as you have already done against Trump and Netanyahu – when a decision violates international law.

By recognising the illegal settlements, the United States has once again put itself outside the norms of international law. It has supported those that seek to ensure that any future Palestinian state would be unviable. Israel’s right to exist is beyond debate. Any country’s right to illegally occupy territory seized in military conflicts is not beyond debate. There are differing views, I know, across the Chamber in regard to this conflict, but I believe there is a common wish to see a lasting peaceful solution that represents both sides. Each step along the road to occupation and annexation is a step away from a stable two-state agreement. What does it mean for the EU? Firstly, we know that the US has not been, and will not be, a reliable partner in this process while the current administration is in place. The EU is therefore the leading world power interested in promoting a lasting solution for the region and willing to act as an honest broker between peace-seeking elements in both governments. Secondly, we need to consider how we as an economic union can influence the situation. I do not, and will not, support the BDS Movement but, nor can I support the economic activities taking place on stolen land in contravention of international law. In the Irish Senate I supported a bill from my colleague Senator Frances Black to prohibit goods from illegal settlements being imported into Ireland, a measure that would only have called on the Irish Government to make real its commitment to the provisions of the Geneva Conventions.

The two-state solution has long been an expression of the EU's political cluelessness and loss of reality. The two-state solution means the return of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Will this bring peace? No. Let us remember that in 2000 Yasser Arafat rejected a very generous offer to exchange territory. In 2008, Mahmoud Abbas did exactly the same thing. When Israel withdrew in 2005, Hamas immediately demanded the total liberation of Palestine, i.e. the expulsion and murder of all Israelis.

Mr President, Madam High Representative, Secretary Pompeo's statement on settlements has caused a great deal of controversy, but in the meantime he certainly had a point. Those who describe the settlements as illegal use very big words. It does not do justice to the complexity of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, pre-emes the outcome of necessary peace talks and ignores israel's failure to make legitimate claims in the territories concerned, both historically and legally. These are not occupied territories, but actually disputed areas, for which a solution can only be found through negotiation. I would therefore urge the High Representative not to put any energy into the exchange with the US on this issue. Then we're not going to get any further. Instead, invest in measures that do matter that can bring peace in the area closer. That is why I say: stop supporting terrorists and their families indirectly through the Palestinian Authority, following a recent decision by the Netherlands.

That's signed in the Oslo Accords.  Israel has violated the Agreements from the outing point, and not just the Agreements: it has violated international law and UN Resolutions. In the meantime, Palestine has comprehensively fulfilled all its commitments.  What are Israel's non-compliances that I can set an example for?

No other internationally legally binding agreement has ever superseded that, and the West Bank is part of Israel in that agreement. it is never been a separate sovereign state. When the British left in 1948, war broke out between Arabs and Jews, and the West Bank was seized by Jordan. But their annexation was never recognised. So, when Israel took back control of its land 19 years later in a defensive six-day war in 1967, it did not cross an international boundary. So, those who say the settlements are illegal are completely misinterpreting Article 49 of the 4th Geneva Convention. Two weeks ago, the EU passed a law forcing Jewish-owned businesses in the West Bank to label their goods differently to non-Jews. This racist law, reminding us of an earlier periods in European history, will not lead to peace in the region. The EU should be ashamed of itself for perpetuating the myth that settlements are illegal under international law when that ruling lacks legal evidence.

I have the impression that we are moving into a place – and I hope the European institutions, including this Chamber, don’t move into that place – where it’s international law that is disputed.

Events are unfolding and each case is different, yet there seem to be some common causes. The triggers have been specific policy initiatives but the protests have then expanded, targeting inequality, sectarianism and corruption and asking for better governance and better job opportunities. Our response to these protests has common elements, too. We have condemned any act of violence, from all parties. We have urged restraint in handling the demonstrations. We have asked for respect for freedom of expression and prompt investigation of instances of violence. We have also demanded that external actors always respect this country’s sovereignty. Now, let me briefly comment on a few specific cases, the ones you mentioned on the title of the debate. First on Iraq. The challenges that Iraq is facing are unique. The country is finally coming out of a long conflict, it needs reconciliation and reconstruction. It also needs to deliver on its people’s aspirations to a better life and better opportunities for all. These expectations need to be fulfilled if Iraq is to stabilise in the long term, and I’ve seen myself during my last visit there – in July, if I’m not wrong – how far the country has come when it comes to being ready to work on reconciliation and reconstruction, but also how fragile this progress is. And I think we are now seeing this clearly. From the beginning of the protests we have been asking for dialogue and steps to quickly address the protesters’ concerns, including those steps suggested by the UN mission. This is even more urgent today. We also continue to encourage Iraq to maintain its policy of constructive engagement with all its neighbours in times when its role as a voice of wisdom is essential in the region. We Europeans have always said that we want to help the people of Iraq win the peace, and this is what the people of Iraq are asking right now. So, we will continue to be on their side and to accompany Iraq on its path towards a stronger, more inclusive and more just democracy. In Iran, the recent protests also stem from genuine frustration with the current economic hardships. Citizens have the right to peacefully demonstrate, and there is no justification for the disproportionate use of violence by the security forces. All reports of incidents deserve swift and full investigation by the relevant independent authorities. I also want to emphasise that we expect the Iranian authorities to ensure the free flow of information and access to the internet at all times. Let me add something that is clear and obvious, but it is important to clarify this once again, that this has nothing to do and should have nothing to do with the implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran. We continue to fully believe in the diplomatic and security value of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), of the nuclear deal with Iran. Yet it is no secret that the preservation of this agreement has become increasingly difficult. And let me announce today that we will have a joint commission with Iran that will be convened on 6 December to this end. As you know, together with the role of High Representative also comes the role of a coordinator of the Joint Commission of the JCPOA of the nuclear deal with Iran, and we have worked in this capacity so far very hard to keep the unity, not only of the Europeans – that has been done – but also of the participants to the nuclear deal that have remained in the agreement after the US withdrew. And I believe this unity is key to preserve the agreements as much as possible. We all agreed just a few weeks ago that we must spare no efforts to preserve the deal, and let me also say that I wish my successor all the best as he takes over also this difficult essential role: that of coordinating the Joint Commission of the JCPOA. Third and last, but not least at all, let me say a few words on Lebanon where protests have led to the prime minister’s resignation. Lebanon is a very special partner for the European Union and it holds a very special place in our heart. Today, the people of Lebanon are asking for good governance, good governance and good governance, beyond any sectarian line, and this is truly inspiring, as Lebanon society often is. It is urgent to address the demands of the Lebanese people while preserving the peace and the stability that Lebanon has worked so hard to achieve in all these years. This calls, first and foremost, for the swift formation of a functioning government to ensure political and economic stability, followed by the rapid and decisive implementation of effective reforms on governance and corruption, in line with the Lebanese people’s aspirations. This moment can become somehow an opportunity to deliver the reforms that Lebanon so urgently needs while, at the same time, preserving the country’s stability and resilience. And let me add one word on something that is not on our focus specifically tonight but is still there. Let us not forget that the whole Middle East remains an incredibly fragile place. We have just discussed the situation in Israel and Palestine, let us not forget that the situation in Syria is still far from being settled. On the contrary, in the north-west of Syria, the situation has got worse once again, only a few weeks after the Turkish military operation opened a new front in the north-east of Syria. So, regional tensions are still running high, and this is putting even more importance and pressure on those in the region and beyond the region who are trying to calm down the situation and find sustainable outcomes to the current dynamics. In these years, we’ve been trying to build multilateral solutions to all crises in the region and we have worked very closely with our partners – including Lebanon and Iraq – to stabilise those countries to bring investment for reconstruction and economic growth and to support these countries in their reform agendas. Each of these countries will have to find its own way to overcome their current difficulties. Nobody can do it for them. But the European Union will continue, I believe, to support dialogue and accompany reforms. It is one of the regions that is closest to us, I often say it is our common region, and the European Union, I believe, will continue to engage as a reliable partner and as a force for peace in the Middle East.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 266, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Ivan Štefanec", "mepid": "124929", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, we have heard about the recent demonstrations and uprisings in Iran. These protests, which have been going on for over 11 days, took place in all 31 provinces of Iran and in 176 cities. The main opposition has announced that the number of those killed during the Iranian people’s nationwide uprising is over 450, but the number of deaths could be much higher.  The names of over 150 of the young men and women who were brutally murdered by Iran’s security forces have already been published and this is really a very sad list. For example, this list includes Nikta Esfandani, who was just 14 years old, and in her case the regime’s officials told her family that since she was only 14, and was a kid, they would not ask for the cost of the bullets – this really is unbelievable. President Rouhani’s government, which some regarded as so-called moderate, quickly shut down the internet to prevent the news and videos of these crimes from coming out of Iran. The government is also refusing to hand over the bodies of those killed to their families or preventing funerals for them. I am very concerned about the fate and treatment of over 10 000 detainees. Some of the regime’s top officials have hinted that many of those who have been arrested will soon be executed – executed by public hanging even. They are especially focusing on the members of the resistance units of PMOI, which the regime has blamed for this uprising. The crimes carried out by the Iranian regime are, by any measure, crimes against humanity. We must not allow the people who have come onto the streets to stand for their rights to be arrested, tortured or silenced. I should remind you that the Iranian opposition leader Ms Rajavi has called on the United Nations to dispatch quickly fact-finding missions to Iran, and that the regime leaders must face justice for perpetrating crimes against humanity.  To conclude, we in this Parliament should stand with the people of Iran and I urge the EU High Representative to do the same by ending current policy because, from my point of view, this current policy has failed and will only damage the credibility of Europe, not only amongst the people of Iran but also among people around the world.

However, we can identify levels of poverty, the sharpening of humanitarian conditions, the lack of freedom and expectations, especially for young people, corruption and low confidence in political power as elements that have led to strong social tensions. This is the case with popular protests in Iraq, Iran and Lebanon, countries marked by strong internal upheavals and crises, often fueled by external power games. But understanding this cannot, however, mitigate the level of our apprehension at the violence that is being exerted against the demonstrators to varying degrees. In Lebanon, repressive violence against protesters by identified groups can never be tolerated. In Iran, the repression of peaceful protests generated by rising fuel prices, the cutting of the Internet, arbitrary detentions, torture, the more than 100 dead and radical calls for the application of the death penalty are unacceptable and lead us to call for the abandonment of the use of violence and the pursuit of inclusive dialogue, the only way to resolve the economic and social crisis.

Mr President, blood has flowed in Tehran and is still flowing in Baghdad, with its hundreds dead. Yet behind this tragedy, it is the birth of a new Middle East that we are witnessing. Let us first observe these demonstrations in Baghdad and Beirut. In these processions, there are no Sunnis, no Kurds, no Shiites, no Christians; there are Lebanese, there Iraqis, citizens of these two countries, protesting shoulder to shoulder against the deterioration of their living conditions, the extent of corruption and the collapse of public services. No one would have thought that the Community borders could be erased in this way, but in social anger, a century after their creation by the colonial powers, these mosaic countries finally seem to become nation states. It's a breakup. In the second turning point of recent weeks, Iran is now in trouble. In Lebanon, Hezbollah, the armed arm of the Islamic Republic, is as contested as any other party. In Iraq, all communities, L.S. Shiites, denounce Tehran's control over the government and the state apparatus. These two countries are in revolt against the protectorate that Tehran would like to impose on them and this is a serious setback for this regime at a time when the Iranians are denouncing soaring prices and challenging the very foundations of theocracy. It is now more than twenty years since this power went from crisis to crisis, but their pace is accelerating while their depth is increasing. The power that we saw ascending in the Middle East may no longer be so and everything could be changed in this region whose balances are changing from month to month.

They were not organised, but they were united in one claim: ‘we are the people’. Two weeks ago in this House we congratulated ourselves on the successful demonstrations and how they have changed our lives for the better. Since this summer we have seen demonstrations in many countries around the Middle East. Algeria: ongoing. Egypt: violent and cruel crackdown. Lebanon: a Prime Minister stepping down and an old elite clinging to power. Iraq: their protest is met with the utmost violence. About 350 are dead. Iran: a massive media blackout. We don’t even have viable information, but more than 100 are dead for sure. In all of these uprisings we see people taking their claims to the street against corruption and for participation, against repression and for democracy. What is new in this protest is that they don’t care anymore about sectarian or regional boundaries. We are all Iraqis is what they shout in the streets of Baghdad, and that is apparently scaring the old elites. A tear gas canister fired at the head of a 17-year-old in Baghdad, a mother in jail for posting on Facebook in Cairo, protesters greeting security forces with flowers and met with live ammunition in Shiraz in Iran. And we, the European Union, the ones that have just celebrated 30 years of peaceful revolution, we are bystanders once more. In Iraq we have been present for years. We have supported with humanitarian aid. We have had reconstruction projects. We actually have a mission on security sector reform in the very same country where medics are shot in the back when treating the wounded, where snipers are firing at peaceful protesters. And those in the streets of Iraq, they refused the interference of Iran and the US and they are very clear about that. The UN has lost its credibility and protesters are clearly, clearly calling on us, the European Union, to fill the void, to organise dialogue, to stop the killing, to investigate the abuses, to do a proper security-sector reform and to just teach them crowd control. And the EU is issuing statements without commitments. Let me be clear, doing nothing or only a little in such a situation can actually do a lot of harm.

While it is true that there is a widespread crisis situation in the Shiite Crescent, it must be admitted that the specificities of individual countries deserve separate discussions.  That is why I want to concentrate on a country very close to my heart, small but of incredible strategic importance for the entire region: Lebanon. Beirut is facing an unprecedented crisis, both political and economic, with 150 % of GDP debt, out-of-control inflation and a plummeting credit rating, and the economy is on the brink of collapse. Urgent reforms would be needed, impossible to implement given the equally complex political situation, which has precipitated after the resignation of Prime Minister Haarīrī and the difficulties in forming a new government. Ladies and gentlemen, we all know how crucial this country is geopolitically and the disastrous consequences that would be in the event of its protracted destabilisation. We need a new government that can commit itself to carrying out the necessary economic reforms, but at the same time commits itself to combating widespread corruption, which remains one of the causes that led to street demonstrations. But Lebanon alone cannot emerge from this crisis, even considering that some 1.5 million Syrian refugees still live in the country to date.

We would very much like the wider Middle East, our neighbourhood, to share the same values as us towards women, children, young people, the disabled, but also dissidents, all-faiths and different ethnicities. But another Sweden and Greece and another Egypt and Syria. From our enthusiasm we may once have supported some lively revolutions, which brought far, much worse regimes than the original overthrows. So we have now learned that idealism must be balanced with a little realism and an image of the result. We must be cunning, as agents of instability act in the wider Middle East, lurking to install hard regressive regimes.  With all their weaknesses, Egypt and Israel are rocks of friendship and Europe's most stable and reliable partners in the Middle East. And we are well aware that they both have the intention of self-improvement. With regard to Iraq, I fear that, as long as we do not strongly support its rebuilt, we will respect it. 11 of the country's 36 million are in need of immediate humanitarian aid. These people are potential refugees. They may not yet be on European land, but I am sure that each of you can understand the father and mother who will do anything to save your child. And they will form the main mass of the puzing. I am sure that, in addition to halting the refugee process, humanism motivates us to help those people in need.

The region's countries have become hostages to Iranian influence and politics through the so-called Shiite Crescent. Following the collapse of the nuclear agreement, Iran is abusing the crisis in the region as a means of putting pressure on the region and on the international community.

We must call on the Iranian authorities to respect the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, including the lifting of the total blockade of internet access that has been decreed.

Mrs Mogherini, is Europe going to have any role in the Middle East, or are we going to let these people suffer and the far right take advantage of the consequences of this disaster? Europe must bury military interventions, be an independent, stabilising actor, bet on equal-to-equal relations.

In this situation, the Europeans we are must have three major objectives. First, we must help these countries in their quest for democracy, in any case, in their desire to move towards a stronger rule of law. I am thinking in particular, as a French elected official, of our friends in Lebanon who can and should benefit from our support in this transition. Secondly, the protection of minorities must be guaranteed, as is our historic role. I am thinking in particular of the Christian minorities, of whom we must be the protectors in this region, but also, for example, the Yezidi and all those who might be affected by violence. Ensuring peace and respect for the rights of every human being in this region, regardless of their faith, should be a priority of our diplomacy. Thirdly, as my colleague pointed out at the time, it is important to ensure that these developments are not captured by what is now our major enemy, not only in this region, but in our territory, i.e. Islamism. As we know very well and we have already experienced it, we must be concerned about how radical Islam can take control of these territories, in a demand for democracy. Today, we must be vigilant. Thirteen French soldiers died the day before yesterday in the Sahel-Saharan strip in Mali to fight this enemy. Dear friends, we have been very touched by the support you have shown to France in this moment of mourning, but this support must also be concrete today. Our country cannot carry this fight alone. We must join forces in this commitment, unite our military forces, of course. We will not have strong and effective diplomacy if we do not have, at the same time and collectively, the means of our action. Thanks to the European Defence Fund, for example, as well as through a more constant commitment to this effort to defend Europe, Europe can serve the peace of tomorrow by assuming to develop its strategic autonomy and serve a free voice in the world that is emerging.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 282, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Brando Benifei (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124867", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing very different countries but today they share a broad protest movement by thousands of people who are calling for a decent life, a job, social inclusion and the fight against corruption.

The economic and social fragility of Lebanon, for example, europe's important partner, which has welcomed, as we know, well over a million Syrian refugees, over 30 % of the population, a situation that is leading the country to collapse. Europe cannot and must not let this happen and must support Beirut even more strongly in order to respond to the demands of the Lebanese people. However, I must also draw attention to the many cases of the return of several refugees to the hands of the Syrian army, cases that are reported to us by various sources on the ground, such as Amnesty and Operation Colomba, which constitute a serious violation of the obligation not to reject them, as well as condemning those who suffer them to certain death.

I’m certain that Britain’s special relationship with the US can help.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 306, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, I have seen that the majority of interventions tonight on this topic confirm and encourage the approach that I described at the beginning of this debate. Thank you for that.  Let me just answer specifically one question that was asked, even if I don’t see the Member of Parliament present in the room – but I am sure that she will be watching us carefully from her office. She was inviting the European Union to finance some concrete projects in the Middle East and she mentioned, in particular, the case of Iraq.  Just as an example, to name the numbers, just for Iraq specifically, we have been financing concrete projects and that means demining, that means job creation, that means reconciliation – projects that exist and that we visit constantly, at my level, at the level of our delegation on the ground. I’m sure some of you have visited as well some of these projects we finance in the Middle East. Just for Iraq in the last years: EUR 1.25 billion of concrete projects just for Iraq. That is to say that this is not just diplomacy – even though diplomacy in this particular time of global politics is a valuable element, and sometimes I believe we underestimate the power of our diplomatic engagement. But it’s not just diplomacy. It’s also about supporting very concretely the projects that help people on a daily basis. Many of you have said it’s real people, it’s real people with real needs. It’s children, women and men that have faced difficulties not just for years, but sometimes for decades, and that live under very difficult situations in security terms, in economic terms.  The European Union and the European institutions are also financing those concrete projects that are literally life—saving projects for millions of people. I would have expected that members of the European Parliament would know this. So if I can invite you to document yourself, at least on the projects you agree on financing in these areas, I think this would be a service to the way in which you can represent your constituencies.  Having said that, let me say clearly that obviously I cannot state – and it would not be appropriate for me to indicate – what the position of the next Commission and the next High Representative will be on this. It is obviously for them to shape it, together with the Council, but let me say that I hope and I believe that the European Union, with your support, will have to be – even more so in the future – a fundamental partner for the people of the region, because sometimes we don’t realise how important the role we play is. Whenever you visit you hear from your interlocutors, and not only the governments or institutions, but the people, civil society and simple citizens that are the key of democracy, that they count on us. Sometimes I have the impression that they recognise our role much more than Europeans do.  So I think that the road ahead will have to be investing even more in economic and diplomatic but also security terms, in supporting this region in finding its way to a sustainable peace and sustainable security. And obviously, as many all of you have said, and as I’ve said in the beginning, with the firmest rejection of any form of violence and disproportionate reaction and handling of the protests from the authorities. This is clearly unacceptable. And this is exactly why, for instance in Iraq, we are engaged in the security sector reform system, because we see the need for a reform – otherwise we wouldn’t be engaging in that respect. We see the need to change and improve the way in which the institutions can handle the security situations of the country, and many other situations. So again, I hope I that this Parliament will give all its support to an even further engagement and work of the European Union institutions in the Middle East.

The Cotonou Agreement covers cooperation with nearly 80 countries worldwide and it covers a wide set of policy areas. In these times, times of increasing global uncertainty, we, the European Union, must defend and promote multilateralism, global cooperation and a rule-based world order. These are all core values of our European Union. The Cotonou Agreement expires in February next year. Negotiations for the next agreement have already started. Prior to that, Parliament has outlined what we want to see in the new agreement. Parliament’s consent will be required once the negotiations are concluded. So far, the ACP and the EU have agreed that the foundation of the future partnership shall focus on key values and principles and on overarching priorities. Attached to the foundation agreement, three regional partnership protocols will detail cooperation priorities tailored to the regions’ specificities. It is agreed that the foundation and the regional partnerships will be one legally binding instrument. The latter was not a given when the first discussions with EU Member States started, but it was one of Parliament’s key demands. But in today’s debate we need more clarity and we also need the new resolution, because some of Parliament’s key concerns have not been addressed. On behalf of the Committee on Development, I have therefore tabled questions to the Council and to the Commission. We would like to hear clear answers to them today. We believe that these questions will provide guidance to the incoming Commissioner. The first question is: where do we actually stand on the key demand of Parliament that the new agreement should reinforce the parliamentary dimension at ACP level? I would like to make clear that the European Parliament cannot accept that the executive level of government might have no parliamentary counterpart: that there will be a Joint Council of Ministers, a Joint Committee, but no parliamentary meetings. We agree with a reinforcement of parliamentary cooperation at the level of the three regional pillars, but this is not sufficient. We don’t want to lose the benefits of peer-to-peer discussions at ACP level. Another important issue, and also on behalf of the Committee on Development: where do the Council and the Commission and the ACP stand when it comes to reinforcing provisions to combat discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and to ensure that sexual and reproductive health and rights are integrated and supported through the new agreement? These are key values of the European Union, and we need to make sure that this will also be within the agreement. Another important question is about civil society. We know that in some countries this is of very serious concern, and we want to see an increased role for civil society. This needs to be recognisable in the agreement and also at ACP-EU levels. Last, but not least, Parliament clearly stated that the new agreement should provide for a peer-review mechanism for monitoring progress as well as gaps in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals on a regular basis. We need more clarity on which way this will be integrated into the next agreement. Before I end with a very clear message from the European Parliament, I would like to thank Commissioner Mimica for all your hard work. You have worked very hard with the European Parliament and we are really thankful for the cooperation so far, and also with the Council. We now count on the Commission and the Council to be champions of our demands in the coming weeks and the coming months and to provide answers also today; hopefully clear answers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 310, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Tytti Tuppurainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, it’s a pleasure to address this House on the ongoing negotiations for the future agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) and the European Union. This is indeed a very timely discussion. Post—Cotonou continues to be a key file for the Council. Negotiations are ongoing and until now five negotiation rounds took place at political level, the latest one in September in New York. The next meeting of the chief negotiators is foreseen to take place in December. Both parties agree that the future development cooperation framework should be based on the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on climate change and must reflect and adapt to the changing global context, new challenges and opportunities. The ambitions are high on both sides to use the relationship for joint positions in international fora. The EU shares the ambition of the ACP—EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the European Parliament to strengthen the parliamentary dimension. Our EU negotiating directives clearly stipulate that the parties shall pursue an inclusive and open multi—stakeholder approach, including by strengthening the role of national parliaments, local authorities, civil society and the private sector. These directives aim to strengthen regular political dialogue at all levels, enabling the active engagement of a wide variety of actors, including civil society, in dialogue and cooperation processes. They also aim to strengthen the role of civil society and the private sector as the key partners in realising the objectives of the partnership. The negotiations on migration issues are ongoing. The EU’s aim is to arrive at a more operational text compared to the Cotonou Agreement. The EU negotiation mandate also stipulates that all elements of migration cooperation would be addressed in the regular political dialogue, which would ensure regular discussions with our partners on this important topic.  Economic partnership agreements help regional economic communities by providing necessary expertise, technology and experience for trade integration. They are tools to enhance trade and investment, value addition and industrialisation, and economic integration. The work done so far on these agreements should inspire the future trade arrangements between the ACP and the EU. The EU negotiating directives are very clear when it comes to non—discrimination based on sexual orientation and sexual and reproductive health and rights. They aim to commit the parties to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of the right of every individual to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence. The EU aims for an agreement that ensures universal access to quality and affordable comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information, education, including comprehensive sexuality education and healthcare services.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 311, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "Neven Mimica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Chair, Mr Tobé, and all the members of the Committee on Development for their excellent work and for the close collaboration between our respective institutions on this important file. I welcome your resolutions and the questions on the ongoing negotiations on the renewed partnership agreement between the European Union and the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States.  The negotiations are progressing, I would say, at moderate pace. As chief negotiator, I have to be realistic. When the Cotonou Agreement expires on 29 February next year, the negotiations will not have sufficiently advanced and there will be a need to have transitional measures in place. Therefore, I am glad that the Council has adopted a decision supporting the extension of the Cotonou Agreement until 31 December 2020. This way, a solid legal basis can remain in place during the transition period. The EU-ACP Committee of Ambassadors will take the final joint decision by the end of January 2020 at the latest.  At this advanced stage of the negotiations I appreciate that Parliament wishes to reiterate the core elements formulated in the two earlier resolutions of October 2016 and June 2018. Your opinion has been heard. You have one key demand: the strengthening of the parliamentary dimension, including at the EU-ACP level. I strongly believe that the role of Parliament should be enforced in the future agreement. However, in line with the negotiation directives from the Council, I also believe that this can best take place at the level of the regional protocols and less so at the level of the EU—ACP. Nevertheless, the Commission takes note of the recommendation formulated by Parliament on this heading.  I would also like to recall that the recommendation by the Commission to the Council of December 2017 included the proposal that the three regional parliamentary configurations could be brought into one on specific occasions. Eventually, that proposal did not become part of the Council’s negotiation directives. Honourable Members, I welcome your question on political dialogue. We have put forward to our ACP partners a proposal for comprehensive dialogue covering all objectives, priorities and policy areas. I also welcome your concern for a genuine multi—actor partnership. The EU has a clear position: we are seeking from all parties a commitment to facilitate the active engagement of a wide variety of actors in dialogue and cooperation processes.  Concerning your call for reinforcing provisions to fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and for upholding sexual and reproductive health and rights, I can say that we are aligned on this but I note that our proposals to the ACP side have not received a positive feedback and further negotiation is required. So far, we have a bracketed part of this paragraph. On migration, the Commission appreciates the concern of Parliament. The European Union and the ACP are currently negotiating a balanced text seeking a substantial compromise between the negotiation interests of both parties. Concerning the economic partnership agreements, I would like to recall that these are self—standing international agreements. However, the post—Cotonou Agreement will provide a coherent framework for cooperation with ACP States, linking all negotiated and future EPAs to respect for essential and fundamental elements.  Lastly, honourable Members, your question on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) is welcome. It gives me the opportunity to recall that the UN Agenda 2030 will frame the future ACP—EU partnership agreement. Our comprehensive dialogue with the ACP partners and a multi—actor approach will be essential to put in place the conditions and instruments for regular monitoring and implementation of the SDGs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 312, "date": "2019-11-27.json", "name": "György Hölvényi", "mepid": "124715", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank you for your support. Dear Colleagues, Without cooperation between the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the Union, it is inconceivable that challenges such as migration, climate change, contribution to education, access and security could be overcome.  The Cotonu Agreement, which is still in force, offers a framework for cooperation to address these challenges. The possible delay in the entry into force of the new convention simply puts Europe at a competitive disadvantage. Europe can only be interested in reducing the effects of emigration in developing countries, strengthening democratisation processes and security.  Education and vocational training are the most important elements of the development of cooperation. Allow me to draw attention to something special in this. Cooperation with Ecclesiastical organisations is almost essential for ACCS countries, but is now almost zero. Note that, according to World Bank data, 50% of health and education care in sub-Saharan Africa is provided by religious organisations. Accordingly, it is very important that our development partners include Church organizations.  In the new solution – the Commission needs a solution – in the new agreement, the Commission must find a solution to address the root causes of migration, or at least try to do so. As Commissioner Urpilainen said during her hearing, we must focus on tressoning the root causes in the coming years. We expect an agreement that settles the readmission of migrants more effectively than before, sees remaining in the homeland, security, quality education and the strengthening of decent work locally as a strategic objective.  For these purposes, from 2021 we need to use the NDICI, which, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, may also include the EDF, the most important source of development contributions to the ACCS countries. We need to be clear about how the Commission plans to establish a link between the Post-Cotonu Agreement and the NDICI. We must take into account the specific needs of the ACCS countries, treating them as equal partners.  In conclusion, we expect an agreement from the Commission to help us stay in place and return to migration, to take into account the specific characteristics of the different ACCS countries and to strengthen the Role of the European Parliament in ACCS-EU cooperation.

And as has been said here, the European Parliament has over time expressed very clear positions on the objectives and mechanisms for implementing the future agreement. A position which, moreover, was reflected and shared last week in Quigali, Rwanda, where the 30th Joint Parliamentary Assembly took place, to which I co-chaired on behalf of the European Parliament. And from that meeting, among more than 100 countries representing nearly two billion people, a strong consensus emerged, a consensus to fulfill the timings and mandates to be able to close the agreement in November 2020, translating a robust partnership between equals, inspired by the Millennium Agenda. But also a consensus that a flexible vision will prevail to reconcile a shared framework for sustainable development within the ACP-European Union relationship, but also with sub-regional economic and trade partnerships, and in particular with the European Union-African Union partnership. And finally, a consensus to rationalise and strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the agreement as part of our differentiating matrix in an increasingly competitive geopolitical context in which we have to know how to make a difference. I am aware that talking about the Cotonou Agreement or the agreement that will succeed it says very little to most Europeans. But if we make it clear how decisive it is to deal with certification, climate change, forced migration, conflicts generated by the exploitation of endemic poverty and the fragility of the institutions, we will be able to show that a good design, a good implementation of the agreement, is good for the peoples of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, the European Union and humanity in general.

Madam President, Commissioner, deep down, we all know in this room that our destinies, those of the ACP countries and the European Union, are linked and that they will be even more so tomorrow. Only together can we provide the answers to global challenges, starting with the management of the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis. Our friends in the ACP countries are sounding the alarm because the consequences of climate change are jeopardizing their survival. The European Union's support for adaptation to climate change is essential if we are to act before it is too late. Another major challenge is the fight against poaching and wildlife trafficking, which must be a priority to save biodiversity. Secondly, I would like to recall the role of youth and women. African youth, in particular, depends absolutely on the fate of a continent in transition. The European Union and the ACP countries will need to build bridges between their young people in the field of education, entrepreneurship and academic and cultural exchanges. This will allow them to build their common future but also gender equality, women's empowerment, education, including their sex and reproductive education, which are essential. Unlocking the feminine potential is the best bet we can make for the future. Commissioner, after more than 60 years of partnership and with new players on the international cooperation scene, the European Union cannot do without its historic allies.

Madam President, the new European Union-ACP agreement will be an opportunity to forge partnership relations on an equal footing, based on a genuine partnership and not on a paternalistic relationship. It will depend on the outcome of the negotiations, which is already proving problematic. Indeed, with the opening of free trade, many ACP countries are not able to compete with the cheap products of the European Union that flood the Sahel countries in Africa. Let's illustrate our point with the example of powdered milk from Europe sold on African markets. This milk defies all competition with local milk. In addition, migration is the current issue of concern to both the European Union and the ACP countries. However, we must ensure that development funds are not linked to the draconian measures of the European Union's migration policy, which has become a double-edged sword. It allowed racists to turn on the sirens of fear and thus conceal their hatred and xenophobia under the guise of lack of security. On the contrary, we must seek to adjust our priorities to that of our partners - the elimination of poverty, education and vocational training, the promotion of legal migration and the possibility of a return to the country of origin followed by voluntary reintegration - in order to reach a genuine agreement that corresponds to the sustainable development goals. We must not condition development aid by erecting too high barriers to climate, migration and security. Promoting such a policy is contradictory to the values of the European Union and to the principles that govern relations between partners. Imposing this kind of policy on ACP countries is in many ways comparable to a neo-colonialist policy.

Failure is primarily political, since neither multilateral dialogue, embodied by institutions that have struggled to produce any concrete results, nor binding instruments have been successful. The failure then concerns immigration, since, even though Article 13 has been ineffective, this resolution is locked in the rejection of any conditioning of aid to control migration flows by the countries of origin, which should be, on the contrary, one of our first requirements. Finally, on the economic front, the indigent progress report, revealed last week, of the pact with Africa, launched by Germany, is yet another blow in the water in terms of reviving private investment. The same will be true of its global framework of action, pompously dubbed the Marshall Plan for Africa. How could it be otherwise when basic material conditions are not guaranteed?

It is never too much to remember that this agreement has three fundamental objectives: reducing poverty and in the long term to eradicate it, sustainable development and contributing to the progressive integration of ACP countries into the world economy. If these are your first, and post-Cotonou, objectives, you have to reassume these commitments. The Commission's negotiating mandate says exactly this: the agreement will be based on and strengthen the fundamental values and principles of this agreement which ends now next year. This is therefore the first idea I would like to leave in a current scenario where concrete measures need to be taken to promote and enforce human rights or defend democracy, economic growth and investment, combat climate change, promote peace and security, and act in terms of mobility and migration. The primary objective of eradicating poverty in line with the objectives of sustainable development should remain our ultimate goal. And on the future of the agreement I would like to leave three notes, not least because much has already been said in this debate. Firstly, the maintenance of the parliamentary dimension in the future acp-EU partnership. The resolution we will vote on tomorrow underlines this very well, reiterating the importance of strengthening this parliamentary dimension, i.e. the future institutional framework should include an ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and as our Co-Presidents of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly have done, and I greet my colleague Carlos Zorrinho in Quigali in his joint statement, and of course the Chairman of the Development Committee on this subject , I also believe that this claim should not be negotiable in the context of the adoption of the future agreement by the European Parliament. Secondly, to defend multilateralism as the only truly effective path to lasting peace, economic prosperity and sustainable development. We will only be able to implement in practice on a truly effective scale the ambitious goals of sustainable development if we do so through the various existing global forums, and with this partnership ours this could act as a lever for common positions. We should also spread our ideals and principles to the people in these forums, as that saying goes very well: we alone can go faster, but together we will surely go further. Thirdly and lastly I would like to underline something that is little talked about, and that is the importance of parliamentary diplomacy for stimulating institutional rapprochement in multilateral terms, both at the level of parliaments, governments, regional or local powers and, of course, public administrations, and also, finally, i will add greater involvement of civil society in the political process to encourage the holding of various types of events.

Young citizens have innovative ideas for shaping the future relations between the ACP and the EU.

However, there are still some problem issues, and they seem to concentrate on the issue of migration and mobility, and this is why I focus on this issue. The treaty is based on the principle of equality and shared responsibility. But if you look at the EU text proposal, it applies very concrete requirements on the ACP countries, such as readmission of migrants, strengthening border controls and combating irregular migration, whereas in exchange, the EU hardly offers any concrete commitment regarding legal migration. Adopting this text would deprive the countries of remittances and other benefits of migration, without any clear perspective on labour migration. This does not really resonate the equality of the partnership. Regarding shared responsibility, I find the only provision on refugees and international protection pretty meagre. Africa hosts so many more refugees than we do. Why don’t we see a stronger EU commitment to support the protection and reception of refugees through financial means or through resettlements? That would be shared responsibility, and also in line with the UN Global Compact on Refugees. The EU’s responsibility for refugees in Africa will even grow if this migration cooperation leads to more refugees stuck in transit countries without any access to asylum.

The future framework for cooperation must recognise and preserve the integrity and unity of the ACP bloc. We therefore reject attempts to divide to reinthat have already been made in the imposition by the European Union of so-called economic partnership agreements against the will of the ACP countries, and are again visible in the negotiation of the future partnership. Contrary to ways that accentuate the dependence and subordination of ACP countries, it is necessary to stimulate the diversification of their economic base, strengthen their production systems, stimulating their autonomy and coherence, promote the development of public services, invest in health, education, sanitation and water supply, housing and better use of the endogenous potential of each country.  The role of the European Development Fund needs to be strengthened by strengthening its appropriations and aligning it with these priorities, rejecting any logic of conditionality on the acceptance of Eu policies, in particular in the field of migration. It is necessary to break with the logic of structural adjustment policies, with free trade and with the permanent attempts to export neoliberal models that have proved disastrous. The cancellation of the debt of the least developed countries, and I will end, Madam President, is a question of justice that would allow additional resources to be channelled into development.

We are still light years away from the objectives of reducing and eliminating poverty, as well as integrating the ACP countries into the world economy.

A genuine win-win partnership with the ACP will only emerge with the maintenance and strengthening of the parliamentary dimension. If it is true that the functioning of this assembly must be reformed in order to become more effective, removing it would be a counter-attack. Protecting human rights, the rule of law, sustainable development goals and combating climate change are all themes that will find solutions if we act together, and parliamentary diplomacy is the vehicle for real progress.

It is important that future agreements play a greater role for civil society, and diversity must be a watchword for inclusion. It is extremely important in order to counteract the shrinking democratic space that we see around the world. 3. Gender equality and women's empowerment must permeate the whole agreement. Sexual and reproductive health and rights must be a priority. 4. Finally, we must not forget the question of fate: environmental and climate issues. We must all take joint responsibility if we want to ensure a planet to live on in the future.

It’s fostered key political dialogue, strengthening relations between us and the ACP countries via frameworks based on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It’s allowed for important discussions on issues such as freedom from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, and sex and relationship education, as well as provisions for corporate social responsibility and assistance to tackle tax evasion.  We must revitalise and reinforce the EU’s relations with the ACP countries. We must emphasise the importance of the parliamentary dimension of the future agreement in order to ensure democratic accountability at all levels and to promote the legitimacy and visibility of the partnership. We must also scale up the involvement of civil society and ensure any new agreement is rooted in the 2030 Agenda with a peer review mechanism for SDG implementation.

It aims to m.in poverty, guarantee the rule of law, promote the sustainable economic and social development of partner countries and gradually integrate their economies into the global economy. The global situation and new global challenges such as the migration crisis, terrorism and climate change have meant that the basic principles of the partnership must be redefined. Negotiations and work on the new shape of the agreement are protracted, but we must ensure that the legal and political foundations of the future EU-ACP agreement are sound and based on the principles of equality between partners and not on the existing recipient-donor relationship, which is not working.  It is also important to ensure that the three regional agreements based on other frameworks between the EU and Africa, the Pacific and the Caribbean separately do not distract from the main priorities of the partnership as a whole.
