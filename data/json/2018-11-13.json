Today's debate concerns the future financial perspective after 2020. But it should be noted that for the European Parliament this debate is very important and not just a purely financial analysis. The European Parliament followed the European Commission's approach to future finances very closely, and it was therefore very important for us to put forward proposals for the future of finances by the President of the Commission and the famous five scenarios. We expected the Commission's proposal to be a political choice for one of these scenarios, all the more so because, in the previous perspective, the 2020 strategy was still the basis for calculations today, so we expected the calculations presented to be a consequence of the adoption of a specific model of the European Union. This has not happened either in the Commission, in the Council or in Parliament, so the discussion on the multiannual perspective has in fact become a discussion about the model of the European Union and today it is of a very special importance.  Moreover, the European Parliament presented its preliminary position in line with the Commission's previous positions in March 2018, ahead of the European Commission's position in May. We have read the European Commission's proposal very carefully and have stated that this proposal, in terms of the size of the budget, by the European Parliament is not acceptable, because we believe that this size of the budget will not allow the tasks to be carried out.  On the other hand, the European Parliament has expressly agreed with the European Commission on a number of elements proposed in the multiannual financial perspective, in its position, which was presented after the Presentation of the European Commission. Firstly, the European Parliament agreed that new tasks that will need to be financed after 2020 should be taken into account, i.e. matters relating to defence, border protection, the asylum system. The European Parliament has agreed, as regards the design of the future budget, on a new way of allocating policies, but also of funds, and has therefore taken this as a starting point for further discussion. The European Parliament also agreed that today's challenges facing the European Union mean that we need to increase spending on research, on exchange activities through Erasmus, on small and medium-sized enterprises, and on this parliament has put forward its proposals to increase spending. Parliament, on the other hand, does not agree with the financing of new tasks by reducing old, so-called traditional policies, even if we take into account the shortcomings of the post-Brexit situation.  Parliament presents its proposal in its report, showing this time the exact calculations and translation into the language of the specific financial solutions of our general position on the size of the budget, i.e. 1.3% of gross national income. This is the Starting Position of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is ready to negotiate, it is ready for swift action that could result in the completion of the work in due time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Isabelle Thomas", "mepid": "114279", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, remember, two years ago in this Chamber, after the British chose to leave us, we are swearing our hand on our hearts that we would never again give the breakers of Europe the opportunity to prevail. Since then, nothing, immobility, the division of states, the total lack of solidarity, the broken promises. So how can we be surprised that the same causes produce the same effects? The far right is 40% in France, Italy - the most federalist of us - has fallen into Europhobia and, in Germany, xenophobic nationalists have entered the Bundestag. Let us face it: the disintegration of the European Union is under way. Today, what is the Last Chance Commission proposing? A first-class burial, budget cuts that only dilute European ambition: minus 16% for the CAP, less 10% for cohesion, less 7% for the social fund, less 45% for funds for the poorest regions. The Commission has submitted to the least budgetary dictated by the governments, and this at the risk of the future of the Union and despite the speeches, such as that of Emmanuel Macron in this Chamber or the one that Angela Merkel will do later. It is therefore possible to extol the European merits with impunity in front of the cameras and to work underhand to cut off his food. Is it so difficult to listen to our fellow citizens? The messages are recurrent and clear. The field testimonies and the Eurobarometer surveys converge: the priorities expressed are the fight against poverty and exclusion, employment, social protection and public health, the climate emergency, migration. All these policies come at a cost and all these changes must be accompanied. The energy transition cannot be reduced to fuel taxes. Do you have to be deaf not to hear the messages of citizens? These political priorities must be re-edsary-like. The European budget must be taken out of its systemic undersizing. One comparison sums it all up: the US federal budget accounts for 22% of U.S. wealth, while the EU budget is painfully 1%. In Europe, austerity is indeed everywhere, it is not the preserve of national budgets, it also plagues the European Union budget. Today we have the opportunity to write another story, which is what we are proposing in this report. We have consulted all the sectoral committees of this Parliament, we have heard from the representatives of European civil society and I would like to thank all the teams who have made this possible. This is a first for the multi-year financial framework: we have built a rigorous, cost-effective counter-budget to meet the Commission. We demand the maintenance of the EU's pillars of agricultural policy and cohesion, we strengthen flagship programmes such as Erasmus or the Youth Employment Initiative, and we guarantee a target of 30% of EU spending on combating climate change. We are creating programmes against child poverty and to support workers in decarbonisation. By budgetary sincerity, as the real guardian of Article 311 of the Treaty, we defend a responsible European budget raised to 1.3% of the Union's wealth and the introduction of new own resources to finance it. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we are the European Parliament, we are the democratic institution elected by direct universal suffrage, the legitimate voice of our citizens and their territories, we have a duty to give Europe the means to act in line with their expectations. Our hand must not tremble and, once is not customary, I will paraphrase President Juncker: the financial framework 2021-2027 is the budget of last chance for Europe. Give us this mandate and swear in this House not to agree to a budget that would defy European ambition.

Multiannual budgets, the so-called financial framework, are a positive differentiator of the European budget. It is positive because they allow for predictable financing of multiannual programmes and investment programmes are by their very nature multiannual. Never – as is clear from my experience – is it ever business as usual. I remember, on the side of the European Parliament, that in 2004-2005 it was a historic enlargement of the European Union, but an extension to so-called net beneficiaries, without net contributors, and therefore it was a problem for net contributors. At the time I was designing the 2014-2020 budget, it was at a time of great economic crisis when Brussels was calling for a tightening of the belt, which also did not facilitate budget negotiations on the european budget side. Today, this condition is Brexit, but this is not a very big condition that threatens European budgets, because many capital cities, including the largest net contributor, Berlin, and the largest net beneficiary, Poland, declare the possibility of increasing their own contribution to the European budget. So that this will for these negotiations to be concluded before the European elections must be confirmed in the course of the agreements, in the transition from positioning countries – because that is easy; positioning the countries that are happening now, this is such a protocol of divergence, and this is an easy matter. The aim, on the other hand, is to move on to the phase of agreeing on the final draft, which is a much more difficult phase, namely finding a common position between the Member States and entering into negotiations with the European Parliament. Together with Gérard Deprez, I am responsible for the revenue side of the European budget. Here we have a paradox: this site has been heavily criticised for many years, and at the same time it has been very stable for many years – it has been unreformable since the late 1980s. The reason, of course, is the UK rebate and the unsusundliness to opt out of the UK rebate. This entailed various other privileges for Member States, mainly net contributors. At the moment, when we are already negotiating without The United Kingdom, it seems that we have some window of opportunity, that is, we have some opportunity to reform the income side as well, but this must be based on two iron rules. Firstly, the so-called fiscal sovereignty remains in national parliaments and cannot be compromised. Any amendment must be ratified by the national parliaments of all Member States. But there is a second principle: if we are introducing some of the European Union's so-called own resources – and there is a whole list of candidates – this must involve a reduction in the contribution from gross domestic product, that is, it must not mean an increase in the burden on the citizens of the European Union. Only on such a condition can the income side be reformed, including, of course, various other sources of income, including penalties, which should be included in the European budget. I think we have a chance this time, and this is clearly written and will be clearly voted on in the So-called Interim Report of the European Parliament: for us, the income side and the expenditure side is one package, that is one thing. Of course, we know very well that, in the case of the revenue side, the European Parliament has much less room to play than on the expenditure side.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Jean Arthuis", "mepid": "124773", "text": "  rapporteur, on behalf of Gérard Deprez. Madam President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, my dear colleagues, my colleague Gérard Deprez cannot be with us and I speak on his behalf. Our plenary will vote tomorrow on the negotiating position proposed by your Committee on Budgets. Our interim report reflects the vision of what the next post-2020 multi-year fiscal framework should be and its funding with new own resources. This report is the result of more than two years of work, of which the rapporteurs Jan Olbrycht and Isabelle Thomas for the MFF (multi-year financial framework), Gérard Deprez and Janusz Lewandowski for own resources, should be thanked and congratulated. This report presents the European Union's long-term budget and specifies, for each heading and for each programme, the amounts of the appropriations allocated. It is the culmination of our two previous resolutions voted on 14 March and 30 May of this year, respectively. By its vote, Parliament means its unity and willingness for the next negotiations with the Council and the ministers of the European Union. In view of our full preparation, I would like to regret that the Member States have made no significant progress in finding a common position. I trust the Austrian Presidency to activate the process and reach an agreement by the end of this year. By raising the overall spending ceiling for the multi-year financial framework to 1.3% of the gross national income of the 27 COUNTRIES of the European Union, Parliament is being reasonable.  It intends to take on new priorities: youth, with the tripling of appropriations for the Erasmus programme and the doubling of funding for the youth employment initiative, but also digital research, climate, defence and migration. Yes, the aim is to meet these new priorities, without cutting funding for agricultural and cohesion policies. Finally, and I welcome this, the interim report calls for identifying the measures that States are funding at the national level, without any real effectiveness in the face of the challenges of globalisation. Therefore, if it appears that these expenditures would be more effective by placing them in the European budget, we can imagine taking the European Union budget beyond, well beyond, 1.3% of gross national income (GNI), without increasing overall public expenditure in Europe. In other words, it is about starting to shape the budget of a world power.  With regard to the European Union's own resources, we must admit that the current system is extremely complex, unfair, non-transparent and totally incomprehensible to European citizens. The new system must result in a substantial reduction in direct contributions from Member States. The aim is to finally get out of the tyranny of the so-called 'rightful return', so contrary to the principle of solidarity and so contrary to the community spirit. It is clear that the provision of new resources should not in any way imply an increase in the tax burden on European taxpayers. As the United Kingdom prepares to leave the European Union, let us use this circumstance to dislocate, in the name of fairness, the maquis of rebates, rebates and other benefits granted in negotiations as clandestine as they are questionable. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to tax the activities of the digital giants for the profits they make in Europe, to tax financial transactions as well. In any event, the resources thus collected will be recovered by the Member States and made available to the European Union budget. It is therefore not infringing on the tax prerogatives of states. The interim report on the post-2020 MFF and new own resources aims to consolidate a Europe that speaks to European citizens, a Europe that gives itself the means to meet their expectations, a Europe that prepares their future and protects them. We have yet to reach an agreement with the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Karoline Edtstadler", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, first of all thank you very much to everyone for being present today as Parliament prepares its position on the multiannual financial framework (MFF). The MFF file is considered a top priority by this Presidency and the Council is working at full speed on the file.  Ministers discuss the issue every month when they meet in the General Affairs Council and experts meet every week to discuss the proposals in detail. No efforts are spared to make as much progress as possible before the end of the year. But as we dig deeper into the Commission proposals we also identify more and more elements that will require difficult discussions and, ultimately, difficult compromises.  This was obvious also yesterday when ministers had a substantial debate in the General Affairs Council on the MFF proposals. Yesterday, ministers identified by the Presidency some topics as key future ones and we have to look at this. To name just a few: many ministers intervened on the overall size and distribution of the budget; the weight of national contributions, the size and protection of national envelopes in cohesion, or the external convergence in agriculture. Those are not issues that will be easy to solve.  And let us not forget the necessity to achieve unanimity in the Council. So if you look at the number of issues on the table and their complexity, and if you take into account the overall political context of our work, it is increasingly clear that it will take time to finalise the Council position. The MFF is not only about numbers, because behind numbers we are talking about policies. That’s why these negotiations are an all-encompassing exercise and a highly political one. It is not a secret that some elements are so sensitive that they will require guidance from the highest level. This being said, work doesn’t stop in the Council. We are all very much aware that cooperation with Parliament will be essential to conclude this file. This is why the vote taking place this week in Parliament is very important and the interim report you will adopt I am sure will be looked at in detail by delegations.  This is also why the Presidency insists on keeping Parliament informed about the progress in the Council and organises exchanges of views regularly between the two institutions. In that spirit, yesterday evening my General Affairs Council colleague discussed with Parliament’s negotiating team the latest developments in the Council on this field.  This dialogue and our debate today are very important to make sure that we understand the position of one another and our respective constraints and expectations.  I hope I managed to convey the complexity of the discussions in the Council and the difficult choices that await Member States down the line. I hope you can take this back with you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has had on the council. With today's interim report, Parliament defines its position on all the programmes and on the structure of the budgetary framework proposed by the Commission in May and June for the next decade. I would like to thank the rapporteurs, all the committees and the Committee on Budgets , with Mr Arthuis in particular – for the work behind it. If we take the timeframe from May this year to the present day, the Council and Parliament have made considerable progress. Parliament will vote tomorrow. The Council has already made intensive use of the last few weeks under the Bulgarian and Austrian Presidencies at working level and in the Council in general, and the negotiating box is practically ready. On the basis of this, the policy level can now begin to bring about results in the negotiations. Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful that important horizontal issues are indisputable. Parliament and the Council accept the seven years as a timeframe. The seven chapters - the headings - and thus a visible policy are accepted by the Council and Parliament. We agree between the Commission and Parliament that new own resources are useful for broadening the revenue side and will have to discuss this in the coming weeks on the basis of various proposals.  The fact that the rule of law must be included in the budgetary framework is accepted by a majority of Parliament and the Council. The fact that we need a high degree of flexibility in order to respond promptly to new problems and tasks should, I believe, also be acceptable on the basis of the Commission's proposal from the Council and Parliament.  Who knows today what the challenges are for Europe 2026? A high degree of flexibility between the headings and programmes and the financial years therefore seems to me to be sensible and necessary, as in the midterm review and the reform adopted by Parliament and the Council a few years ago. The programmes are therefore accepted. There are considerations in Parliament for a few complementary programmes – the tourism programme, the structural change of coal regions. It is undisputed that we need to help on the road to a low-carbon future for Europe. The only question is this: should cohesion, research and general programmes be used to target the coal regions and co-finance their structural change, or is a specific programme more sensible, as proposed by Parliament's Committee on Industry? I believe that, having the horizontal issues, the seven headings, the classic programmes are largely indisputable, the crucial point is: what funding do the programmes need?  We have three main pillars: Pillar 1 – agricultural policy, Pillar 2 - cohesion policy, Pillar 3 – the addition of new programmes or growing programmes that represent the future and new tasks. We used to have agriculture and cohesion with 40% = 80% each in the budget framework, currently at around 70%. The Commission is proposing a moderate reduction to around 60% – 30% agricultural, 30% cohesion. These cuts – 5% in the agricultural sector and 6.3% in the cohesion sector – have been criticised. But I say to you quite frankly, even in the knowledge of the Council debate and the expectations of some Member States that the framework does not exceed 1.0% of the GNI, to believe that the British can go and bring cohesion and agriculture into the future without cuts seems to me to be very realistic – accepted as a starting point, but since we end up needing 27 Member States – unanimity – and Parliament must agree to this, Parliament must agree to this. , I would ask you to be somewhat flexible, not only in the budget itself, but also in politics, and to accept moderate cuts. When a wealthy uncle goes with the British, the gifts under the Christmas tree will no longer be chosen, but tend to be a little less or more efficient. The third pillar – doubling Erasmus+, increasing research, Horizon Europe, stabilisation, Connecting Europe or much more for neighbourhood and the world, for foreign policy, for our approach to combating reasons for flight – I believe that the third pillar – proposed by us with 34% – shows where Europe's added value exists if Europe invests jointly, across borders within the EU and across borders with our Mediterranean neighbours. , in the Maghreb, Sahel, Subsahel, Middle East or Western Balkans. So for me the crucial open point is: 1.3 - 1.0 – 1,114 and: When do we decide? The sooner, the better. The lesson of the current budgetary framework must be that whoever adopted the Execution rules, as it happened then, have been lost time in 2014 and 2015. Investments at European level will not be realised by this budget in the first and second years. That is why it should be possible to adopt it in 2019 – not in 2020, but in 2019. Since this is an election – your election, the European election – we would prefer us to continue to try everything to be ready by April next year. That would be the best option. The second best would be autumn next year, the worst would be autumn 2020. That is why the European Council of 13 and 14 December is of crucial importance. And our expectation to the European Council, our request, is for the European Council to take on the priority of Europe's budgetary framework alongside Brexit and migration, that is, the permanent issues. Early adoption could then be possible, provided that the Member States and the Council and Parliament are willing to compromise. Europe would then show that, with a stable budgetary basis, it can go into the next decade successfully and collectively.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Željana Zovko", "mepid": "185341", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the DEVE committee. - Dear Chairman, at the outset, I would like to congratulate my colleagues on a well-prepared report that includes proposals as well as further steps to create a new Multiannual Financial Framework, which will take into account the UNITED KINGDOM's exit from the European Union.

Likewise, taking into account the Union's priorities, and I think, including the Western Balkans, as well as the enlargement strategy published at the beginning of this year, it was expected that the Commission would increase funding for the IPU in its proposal, in order to assist candidate countries and potential candidates in advancing the rule of law, economic well-being and the functioning of institutions.

And the first error in budgetary control is to underbudget new and urgent ambitions. Hence the expenditures of migration, cooperative self-sufficiency in security and defence, the strengthening and Europeanisation of development cooperation or the fight against climate change, but also the fight against poverty and indebtedness of society and citizens, therefore need a budget counter-project such as today.

Mr President, thanks to co-rapporteur, Mrs Ayala Sender for her contribution. The Committee on Budgetary Control has historically focused on the legality of spending. Fortunately, in recent years, there has also been an increasing focus on efficiency. The hundreds of billions of euros we spend here must also achieve a political goal. Spending the money is not for nothing. It's not about redistributing money. It is about achieving clear political goals. They must therefore be well defined and the results must be very easy to measure. I hope that both the European Commission and the Council, as well as the members of this House, will read the Court's reports carefully, because it says time and time again in every policy area that this efficiency is not good. Only last week, a very critical report was published on the common agricultural policy, as proposed by the European Commission. I'm glad we're going to green. But the way in which the Commission wants to green is with non-measurable targets, i.e. the money is spent, but the environmental objectives will not be met.

We must give greater support to local and regional authorities, direct support to meet the challenge of the social and working integration of refugees. We must put on the table the Guarantee for Children, a tool designed to break the disadvantage of more than 25 million children who are on the threshold of poverty and at risk of social exclusion.

The interconnection mechanism for Europe, which was created by the Commission, represents an undeniable success which is at the heart of investment, but also of the single market, as the engine that irrigates it. It is also at the heart of a number of other problems, including environmental problems. I regret that its staffing has not been sufficient and I also regret that the transfer under centralised management of 20 billion, from the competitiveness funds, has not been accepted, which would have allowed, without cutting the European budget, to have better management of our resources. Everyone agrees - and I think the Commission is also - that centralised management is better than management that is not. Finally, the agencies we defend, because their tasks have increased considerably. On the other hand, their means have increased much less, while they have a central role.

Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. Thank you for your speech here today. With what you have said, you are speaking much more from the heart of our group than the colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the other left-wing groups have said. And to your address, I would like to make it quite clear: if you don't know the destination, you can't find the way. A year and a half ago, President Juncker presented a White Paper outposing five scenarios, and he promised that we would discuss these five scenarios – ranging from limiting the EU's competences to establishing a quasi-own state – that we would discuss this possibility with the citizens of the EU and then represent the will of the citizens. I ask you: in which country has this discussion taken place comprehensively? In Germany, at least not. And if we do not know what the citizens want, then I cannot understand at all that some here claim that they are speaking for the majority of the citizens if we are now calling for a 30% increase in the budget. 30% more on the departure of the second largest net contributor: for me, this is without any basis, there is something wrong somewhere. Accordingly, I must also say that we would simply have to rethink the structure of the budget. There are good approaches here. For example, that we have one more budget line is fully in line with our opinion. We must also address new priorities accordingly, and we must provide these priorities with sufficient financial resources. But this also means that we keep checking: what are we giving out so far? And when we see that we still have an agricultural budget that is close to 30%, that is still far too much. The EU is not threatened by famine, but it is threatened by a traffic attack, especially in the big cities. We are threatened by being left behind in digitalisation. We are also threatened, still, by a migration crisis. We have to spend money here, but not on an agricultural budget that is simply oversized and ultimately overgrown. Cohesion policy is basically a good instrument, but we should limit it to the less developed regions. I think it is a contradiction in our view that we should also promote better developed regions through cohesion policy. Finally, the EU should not give the impression that, if it has enough money, it can solve all the citizens' problems. That is misleading. We should make it clear that subsidiarity, personal responsibility and good framework conditions are ultimately the key to a good EU.

The first concerns education, research and innovation. It turned out during the previous framework that when the EU added money, the Member States took the opportunity to remove money. It was therefore a zero-sum game that Europe did not really win much on. The second challenge concerns structural programmes. When we look at developments in eastern Central Europe – the countries that have lived under various forms of dictatorship for almost 80 years – and how their structural programmes work, we are faced with a suspicion that structural programmes are simply not properly sized. The third challenge will be our climate policy. We are facing major challenges there, and I suspect that we are already falling behind a little and that we are not keeping up with the pace that we should actually be keeping in relation to the Paris Agreement. We have major security challenges, both internal security and security in a world sometimes determined by Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. It may therefore be that we need more security and rehabilitation. We have challenges relating to agricultural policy. We must have agricultural policy which also succeeds in putting emphasis on carbon dioxide being seized via agriculture.

Most Member States have only one thought, a Margaret Thatcher thought, in their head: 'I want my money back'. That is, of course, a disastrous stupidity.

Seven years is a long period of time in life and in budgetary terms. Many unexpected developments will occur during the next seven years, as they have also occurred during the current seven years. We needed to react to the migration and refugee crisis in a way which we did not foresee in 2013.

Flexibility will be important in the next seven years in order to respond to the unexpected developments which will occur. Also, predictability and stability is important.

The crisis of confidence expressed by our fellow Europeans leads us all to question ourselves.

Of course, we must retain, at least at their current level, the European Union's historic solidarity policies, the common agricultural policy and the cohesion policy.

The second point is the unprecedented reduction in the Cohesion Fund, 46%, partly because we have done well, because the economies have grown in the new Member States in particular, but still. We are now seeing a new EUR 10 billion being proposed from that fund to the Connecting Europe Facility. In the Committee on Regional Development, we have adopted a position: proportional, an appropriate share. We have said that 4 billion would be a responsible transfer and that any further transfer would be rejected. The third point I would like to make is the synergy between the various budget chapters, for example between research and development, the knowledge economy. We see that Horizon Europe, Horizon 2020 is used for 90% in particular in the old Member States. We cannot have a lopsided Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. This week is a budget week. On Friday, we will try to adopt the 2019 budget together with your colleagues from the Committee on Budgets and the Council and the Council Presidents. But the budgetary structure for the next decade is more far-reaching and important. I am grateful that tomorrow's vote, on the basis of today's speeches, will be a broad majority, a very broad majority in favour of your report and therefore of your positions on all the programmes and on all the clusters and all the headings of the Commission's proposal. Parliament is thus in a position to start negotiations at political level with the Council and with the support of the Commission. I am grateful that a few Members have remained stubbornly here. I would like to respond to all the speeches. But it was precisely from this side, where Mr Obermayr accused me of having made a brazen budget proposal – he had hardly separated his speech, that he was gone. I see that you are back: good morning, Mr Obermayr. Otherwise, however, we have only received criticism from colleagues who are no longer present.  What is it all about? We do not want a superstate of Europe. At 1.3%, you cannot finance a superstate. Of the EUR 100 generated by a citizen with handwork, headwork and investment, levies, fees and contributions – an average of EUR 50 in Europe – are taken from him, which is, on average, the national quota in Europe. Of the 50 euros, one euro has come to Europe so far. There are 49 in Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Rome, the regions, the municipalities, the social security systems. One euro out of fifty. The discourse of the next few weeks will be: whether it should be a 1.00 euro or 1.30 euros or 1.114 euros. In fact, it is a manageable dimension in which the capacity to act and the will to unify Europe must prove themselves.  If we do not agree, the winners would be autocrats in Ankara and Moscow and other capital systems such as China. I remind everyone of this. We must reach agreement – you and the Council, all 27 Member States: Foreign Ministers, Finance Ministers, Heads of Government and also national parliaments, which are behind these governments. I therefore deliberately call on you all: let us enter into the discussions with the aim of reaching agreement, with a willingness to be flexible and also to be realistic. I cannot imagine from all the Council meetings in which I have attended that the starting position, 1.3%, will also be the result. As a starting point, I think your report is very effective, very good. But it will not be the result. As the Commission, we are ready to make changes. I am not saying that my proposal will be the result. Optimizing it, simplifying it, changing it is your right and your duty. We are happy to go down this road, together with the Council. We are told that the next budget framework is 30% higher in nominal terms than the current budgetary framework, and that is true: it is up to 30% higher in nominal terms. Why is this the case?  If you compare a 2014 budget framework with the 2021 ff., we have seven years of inflation – automatically increasing 12 to 14% in nominal terms and 0 in real terms. If we compare gross national income in 2014 with that of the next decade, on average, more than 2% increases are added. This means that in our budget framework alone we have a nominal increase of 26%, without one euro being left with us in real terms. Brexit: For some Member States, the elimination of rebates, which I think is logical, and new tasks lead to a 30% increase in nominal terms, very, very marginal in real terms.  Now comes the crucial point: I do not want to combine defence and an army at European level with the budgetary framework. But it turns out that defence research and procurement of equipment can be more efficient in the European team. When it has been said here that the money comes from the Member States – that is true, 70% comes from the Member States; no, it comes from the citizen and the taxpayer, because the Member State collects it 100% from its citizens. We can demonstrate that if defence research is done together at European level, it will be cheaper and cheaper for the taxpayer to procure defence industry together. The taxpayer saves money. We can get the same devices cheaper at European level by means of tenders than 27 national silos ever separated from them. In research, the same case. We have three objectives: 0.7% for development aid, 2% for those who are NATO members, for defence – and 3% for research and innovation. This is why expenditure on Horizon Europe, Erasmus+ or the joint defence research or for Horizon Europe, all expenditure, investment to achieve the 0.7%, 2% and 3% target. This is particularly true in \"Neighbourhood and the World\" and Africa. In other words, we must make it clear to the citizen that investing at European level does not mean spending more money, it means investing more efficiently and more cost-effectively. I admit one point: anyone who conducts European defence research is changing the structure of competence saver a bit, shifting competence from Paris, Vienna, Rome, Berlin to Brussels. So it could be a question of power. But it would be cheaper for taxpayers to conduct European research, to be European in Africa, and also to make European investments in defence. This has nothing to do with the superstate. One final point. We spend less than 7% on administration, 6% to 7%. My request is that if we want good administration – in Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the other institutions – then we should not continue to cut the lawnmower at heading 7. We need a qualified, good civil service, and we have already, in fact, achieved a high level of efficiency in our services in all the European institutions. I look forward to the discussions in the coming weeks, and I look forward to seeing how and whether the European Council on 14 December will take up Parliament's ball tomorrow and the Commission's proposal of May and June and make this a priority. On the way to the European elections, the Union no longer has many great chances of showing that it is capable of action. Brexit can only reduce the damage. Migration will not be the big solution.

The debate we have had clearly shows that talking about the MFF, about the multiannual financial perspective, is not really an accounting conversation. This is a discussion on the various policies of the European Union and this discussion will continue in the discussions on legislative texts. This shows that even if there are differences of opinion within parliament, we believe that the MFF is an extremely important course of action in the coming months and years. Secondly, this discussion has also shown that we must be interested not only in what is the task of the European Union, but in what is happening in the European Union. What is important to us at that time is what is happening in the Member States and what money is being spent on individual policies within the Member States, as the Commissioner has said. This needs to be added. It is necessary to add what the Member States are spending, plus what is in the Budget of the European Union. This cannot be separated. The third point – and Here I am turning to the Council – is the fundamental question, which is, even after this debate, whether the budget is intended to reflect a certain political line, or is the political line a reflection of the budget? What are we discussing? Are we discussing what we want to achieve and how much it will cost, or are we discussing how much we will give and what can we make of it? It seems to me that this debate has made it very clear that parliament believes that the budget should be a reflection of political ambitions.

Secondly, Madam Minister, this Assembly, as you know, is responsible and fully understands that governments refuse to increase their national contributions. That's a good thing, we don't want it. We do not want to increase national contributions. We want clean resources, not additional taxes for our citizens. Moreover, who is constantly increasing the competences of the European Union here? More often the Council than Parliament. So, please! On the other hand, don't hide behind the little finger of unanimity.

It's a huge challenge. Who knows what we will have to deal with in 2027? Several colleagues intervened, questioning whether it was appropriate for powers to be transferred to the European Union. The real question is whether, today, because of the challenges posed by globalisation, Member States, alone at the national level, still have the power to assume certain prerogatives of sovereignty in the fields of defence, security, digital, migration and climate.  In all these areas, is it not time to pool European means to regain real efficiency, to make the European Union a world power, and to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens who ask us to prepare their future and protect them?

How many tens of millions of victims has this European tragedy caused? Well! ladies and gentlemen, if we are to be worthy of the memory of all these victims, I think the right answer is to build a Europe that meets our expectations, a Europe that allows us to take back control of our destiny, a Europe at the service of peace, freedom, prosperity and solidarity.

Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr Antonio Tajani, Mr President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioners for their excellent work and for their excellent work. Almost fifty years ago, former German Commission President Walter Hallstein called European unification an \"unprecedented audacity.\" That was in 1969, ten years before the first direct election to the European Parliament. At that time, the European Community was still in its infancy. Many of our greatest achievements – Schengen, the single market, a common currency – were still visionary projects. But the foundation stone was laid, and with it, after centuries of wars and dictatorships, the citizens of Europe had for the first time the prospect of a lasting peaceful and stable future. And today I stand in front of the largest democratic parliament in the world with joy, but also with gratitude.  (Applause) They, the 751 members from 28 countries, together represent more than 500 million people; that is almost seven percent of the world's population. We feel the heartbeat of European democracy in your House. This is demonstrated by the debates held in 24 languages. And that shows something that makes Europe, that is diversity. But it is precisely one of the great strengths of us Europeans that we have repeatedly , despite all the diversity – been guided by the will to reach agreement, by the will to compromise, and that, despite different origins, despite different attitudes, we have always come to a result for the good of the Community. It is now more than eleven years since I spoke to this House for the first time. Germany had assumed the EU presidency at the time, in 2007. I spoke at the time about the diversity that divides us and does not share us, about freedom, which must be defended again and which Europe, like human beings, needs the air to breathe. At the time, I spoke of a fundamental value that distinguishes Europe, of a value that combines freedom and diversity in Europe. I have spoken of tolerance. I have spoken of the fact that the tolerance, the soul of Europe and therefore an indispensable fundamental value of the European idea. Over the past eleven years, however, we have also seen how much the world has changed and how, with it, the soul of Europe has been strained, if you like. Global political, economic and technological challenges have been evolving faster and deeper. We have been through a major sovereign debt crisis, international terrorism has not stopped before the European Union, wars and armed conflicts are taking place just a few hours from here on our doorstep, global movements of refugees and migrants are also affecting us Europeans in a very concrete way, and digital progress is changing our way of life at a breathtaking pace. We are feeling the consequences of climate change, old allies are questioning tried and tested alliances, with the United Kingdom, for the first time a country will leave the European Union, how deep this cut will be, we feel more than ever in these days of intense negotiations, and I would like to thank Michel Barnier most warmly for his work. (Applause) Dear Members of this House, why am I saying this? We all feel that it has become more difficult to predict developments. But we feel something else: it is becoming less and less promising to assert the interests that one has on the global stage alone. Conversely, it is becoming increasingly important for us Europeans to stand together. For this, we need, more than ever, respect for others and their interests within the European Union. More than ever, we need an understanding that tolerance is the soul of Europe, that it is an essential part of what makes us Europeans, and that it is only with it that we can develop a willingness to understand each other's interests and needs as our own needs. That is the prerequisite for meeting. (Applause) This brings us to the heart of European solidarity, without which successful action is inconceivable. This solidarity is based on tolerance, and it makes up our strength, which is nowhere else, as Europeans, for three reasons: firstly, solidarity is a universal value. Working for each other is a prerequisite for any functioning community. This applies to the family, to the village community, to the sports club and to a community like the European Union. Solidarity is an integral part of the European Treaties, it is a central part of our canon of values. Solidarity is part of European DNA. We support countries and regions in their economic development or in the fight against youth unemployment, we help each other in the event of natural disasters, we stand by each other in the event of terrorist attacks or reactor accidents, we have put in place so-called bailouts in the European sovereign debt crisis to help affected countries solve their economic and financial problems. These few examples alone show that the individual Member States of the European Union, and with them the citizens of the European Union, are not alone in difficult times and emergencies. On the other hand, these few examples also show that individual national decisions always have an impact on the whole Community. Secondly, solidarity always goes with responsibility for the community of all. In concrete terms, this means that anyone who undermines the rule of law in his country, who curtails the rights of the opposition and civil society, who restricts freedom of the press, not only jeopardises the rule of law in his own country, but also jeopardises the rule of law of all of us throughout Europe. (Applause) Europe can, of course, only function as a community governed by the rule of law if the law is applied equally and respected everywhere. Anyone who bets on solving problems through new debt alone and disregards commitments made calls into question the foundations of the strength and stability of the euro area. Our common currency can only work if every single member fulfils their responsibility for sound finances at home.  (Applause) Anyone who questions Europe's unity with third parties, for example on agreed sanctions or on human rights policy, undermines the credibility of the whole of European foreign policy. For Europe can only make its voice heard in the world if it is united. (Applause) This means that solidarity always means overcoming national egoisms. I am well aware that Germany, too, has not always behaved impeccably or behaved impeccably in the eyes of some. For example, in the years before 2015, it took us far too long to accept the refugee issue as an issue for all the Member States of the European Union for us as Germany ... (Applause) ... and to understand that it is a pan-European task. Thirdly, solidarity for the benefit of all also means acting in the well-understood interests of one's own. Respect and support for others and the representation of one's own interests are not contradictory – quite the contrary! An example of this is our cooperation with African countries of origin of refugees and migration – as the President has just pointed out. This cooperation helps Europe because it organises, controls and reduces flight and migration to Europe, and it also serves the people on the ground by improving their lives and by saving them from embarking on an often life-threatening journey to Europe. Another example is the European commitment to global climate protection, which is absolutely necessary, both ecologically and economically and socially, for the protection of natural resources and thus for us. It is good for Europe if developed and emerging countries as a whole produce fewer greenhouse gases and our economies become greener overall. It also benefits all Europeans if the eurozone also develops free of faults and becomes a haven of strength and stability. It is good for all Europeans if everyone participates in European civil protection. It is good for all Europeans to help those who are particularly affected by flight and migration. Tolerance requires respect for the fact that the issue of the reception of refugees in different Member States provokes different reactions on the basis of their own history, their demographic development. Solidarity requires us to make every effort at the same time to find a common path on which we can overcome these challenges, as well as all other challenges as a community. So that is what makes Europe: solidarity as a universal fundamental value, solidarity as a responsibility for the community and solidarity as a well-understood self-interest. Ladies and gentlemen! Unity and unity are essential for Europe's success. I would therefore like to highlight three areas which, in my view, will be particularly important. Firstly, foreign and security policy: as Europeans, we are already realising that we have a great deal of our interests everywhere. better defend where we perform together. Only united is Europe strong enough to be heard on the global stage and to defend its values and interests. The days when we could rely unreservedly on others are just over. This means that if we want to survive as a community, we Europeans must take our destiny more into our own hands. (Applause and boos) And that means that Europe must become more capable of action in foreign policy in the long term. That is why we must be prepared to reconsider our decision-making channels and to refrain from unanimity where the Treaties make this possible and wherever possible. (Applause) I have proposed that we set up a European Security Council with changing rotating staffing levels of the Member States, in which important decisions can be prepared more quickly. And we must create a European intervention force with which Europe can also act at the scene. We have made great progress in structured cooperation in the military field. That is a good thing and is being supported as much as possible here. But we should work – and I say this very deliberately from the development of recent years – on the vision of one day also creating a genuine European army.

And this is not an army against NATO – I ask you – but it can be a good complement to NATO. No one wants to question classic connections, but in a ... (Strong applause) But, ladies and gentlemen, it would be much easier to work with us if we now have over 160 defence systems, weapons systems and the United States of America only 50 or 60. If we need independent administration, care and training for everything, then we are not an efficient partner, and if we want to use our money efficiently and yet fight for the same goals, then we can stand together in NATO with a European army. There is no contradiction at all. (Loud applause and heckling) And that closes, of course ... (Interjections) Look, I'm looking forward to it. I am not irritated. I also come from a Parliament. So! (Loud applause) This also includes the joint development of weapons systems within Europe. This also means – and this is a difficult task, including for the Federal Republic of Germany – that we develop a common arms export policy, because otherwise we cannot act uniformly in the world. Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, the economic success of Europe is important. It is the basis of our strength and a prerequisite for us being heard in the world at all. If we are not economically strong, we will not be politically influential either. I am very pleased that the programme of Jean-Claude Juncker, the Investment Fund, has had a significant impact in recent years and that we have already launched EUR 350 or 340 billion of the EUR 500 billion of investment by 2020 – a good programme for more investment. I know how many times the demand for more investment has come from your House, and that is now on the way. However, we should also talk about this, because EUR 340 billion is not a cardboard stick, but a real contribution to greater prosperity in Europe. And, of course, a stable prosperous Europe also includes a stable economic and monetary union. We want to develop the European stability mechanism further, we are working on the banking union, we are working on a eurozone budget – Germany and France have spoken out in favour of it; I believe that this should be closely linked to the medium-term financial perspective – and we are in favour of liability and control being shared. In other words, the banking union and, later, a European deposit guarantee scheme, require that risks in the nation states were also reduced beforehand. This goes together, European solidarity and personal responsibility are always two sides of the same coin. But here, as the European Council – at least Germany is in favour, together with France – we will certainly present visible successes by December. We will also make progress on an issue that is being discussed very intensively these days, in which you are also very involved, namely digital taxation.  Germany does not have the question of whether we need to carry out digital taxation – this is a matter of course in the age of digitalisation – but we have the question of how exactly we do this. I believe that one of the democratic habits is that we should take note of the Commission's proposals, but that something can also be added. We believe that the best thing would be to find an international solution in an international context. We are relying on minimum taxation. If that does not work, however, we cannot wait until St. Neverleins Day, but then we must act at European level, and Germany is committed to this.  (Applause) If we are honest and look to the future and think about our prosperity, then we have to accept that today it is no longer the case that the major innovations – as was the case 100 years ago and 130 years ago – always or mostly come from Europe, but it is the case today that very many of the fundamental innovations from Asia come from Europe. , come from the United States of America. That is why the question is, of course, whether we, as the continent in which the car was once invented, will also determine the mobility of the future? It makes me uneasy that we can't produce battery cells, for example. It is okay for Chinese companies to invest in Germany now. But I think we should make a great effort to also in Europe to be able to master the drive technology of the future and to make battery cell production possible again here.  (Applause) We have the European instruments for this. We have it all in our hands, as we are doing with the chips today. We need to be at the forefront of quantum computers, we need to develop a common strategy for artificial intelligence. All this is still possible because we have a strong industrial base in Europe. We can build on that, and we must take advantage of that now. In this respect, research and innovation are key points for our future prosperity. The third area, ladies and gentlemen, which I would like to call on is the issue of refugees and migration. In the euro crisis, we have already had many hurdles to overcome in order to reach a common solution. But we have succeeded. But on the issue of flight and migration, Europe is not yet as united as I would like it to be. And since this is a central issue in terms of our relationship with our neighbourhood, we must find common ground here. And we have made progress on this. We all agree on the need for a common European border management. In retrospect, it was certainly a little frivolous, I say, that a Schengen area of free movement has been created, but is only now working to obtain a register of entry and exit to know who is with us and who is leaving us. However, it is right that we do so now. It is right that we develop Frontex. I think the Commission's proposals are good. Here, too, it is a question of this: if everyone wants to retain their national competence and if none of the European border guards wants to give any powers, then it can be so great and as good as it is, then it will not be able to carry out its work. Here, too, we must give up national competences to a little extent and act together. (Applause) We must then also consider: how can we share the work of development aid, development cooperation and Africa's economic development? There are now excellent results – none of this would have been possible two or three years ago – where we work with individual Member States with the Commission in individual African states, thereby achieving greater added value than if we all appeared there individually. We can learn a lot more here, but I think we are on the right track. Then it is also a question of developing a common European asylum procedure. If everyone makes their decisions differently, then one need not be surprised that people from a particular country know this immediately and then secondary migration takes place naturally in the area of freedom of movement. We must make the effort, just as we are developing a common level playing field for the internal market, to develop common standards on such sensitive issues as those of the right of asylum and humanitarian responsibility. Otherwise, we will not be able to cope with the abandonment of refugees and migration.  (Applause and boos) Ladies and gentlemen! These were now three examples from many, and the fact that I have hit the core is shown by the protest. This is beautiful and honorable. (Applause) I believe that people want Europe to tackle the very problems that are burning on their nails. People want a Europe that provides answers to the questions that depress us. This does not mean that Europe must be everywhere. It remains the case that not every problem in Europe is a problem for Europe. Solidarity does not mean ubiquity. But solidarity means that Europe acts where it is needed, and that it can then act strongly and decisively and effectively.  I am convinced that Europe is our best chance for lasting peace, for lasting prosperity, for a secure future. Our meeting in Paris, at the invitation of the French President, to commemorate the horrors of the First World War a hundred years ago, should have made us aware once again of what happens when nations have no respect for each other and what happens when communities such as the League of Nations, which was founded as a result of the First World War, fail. There was even greater horror. (Applause) That is why we must not squande this European opportunity. We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to the past generation, and we owe it to future generations. This means that nationalism and selfishness must never again have a chance in Europe. (Applause) But tolerance and solidarity are our common future.

Monsieur le Président, ils ne résistent pas au plaisir de faire comme le Parlement.  I very much liked what you said here when it came to the plea for multilateralism. Multilateralism is part of the DNA of the European Union. What you have said about migration is at the very heart of what the European Commission proposed here years ago. Incidentally, the applause today was greater than the support of many when I said that Angela Merkel – As I said in October 2015 – is someone moving towards future history. History will tell you right. Not everyone in this House has always seen it that way. But you were right that you did not close the borders. (Applause) The CSU applause could be less sparse than it was today. (Laughter) When it comes to Brexit, we are swimming in the same channel. I repeat: we do not want punitive action against The United Kingdom. Great Britain, United Kingdom, has in free (interjections) But I'm not swimming in your direction – I'm swimming in exactly the opposition direction! But we have to respect the vote of the British people.  It's our duty to make the best of it, in the interest of Britain, in the interest of the European Union. We are not in an aggressive mood when it comes to the future relationship with Britain. The European Union, the continent, has to recognise that Britain, starting in 1939, was playing a major role when it came to freedom and the freedom of this continent. We are grateful for that ... (Applause) but this is not a reason to leave the great history between the islands and the European Union. In fact, I think that leaving is a tragedy, an historical error, a mistake, and we have to make the best of it and the Commission, together with Michel Barnier, is moving in that direction. (Applause) So, all in all, Chancellor, dear Angela, what you have said here is at the heart of what we are doing. Perhaps you are a little more supportive of all the Commission's virtuous initiatives on migration, on Africa and on euro reform. If you do more than you've already done, you'll get even bigger, and that's a performance.

I would like to start with a quote: 'The unity of Europe was a dream of a few. It became a hope for many, and it is now a necessity for all of us.\" It was Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, who coined this sentence. Madam Chancellor, I would like to thank the Chancellor for her With you in the office is a big picture of Konrad Adenauer, and you stand in this tradition of the German chancellors, who, knowing the history of the Federal Republic of Germany and Germany as a whole, always know that Germany can only do well if it is connected in friendship and partnership with its neighbours. Thanks to this pro-European attitude of the German chancellors – from Adenauer to Brandt, Schmidt, Kohl, Merkel, and many others – the unthinkable has been made possible in recent decades, because the largest country has made a significant contribution to this Europe. I am allowed to say today that I am 46 years old and That I am part of the first generation on this continent to say that she can live in peace and freedom throughout Europe. They belong to a generation that was also allowed to live in peace, but which was imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain for much of their lives. My grandfather was still part of the war generation. Unthinkable has been achieved, also because of the German contribution, also because of your contribution, Chancellor. That is why I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks for your clear pro-European stance. (Applause) But what does this work mean today? I would like to say thank you because you have emphasised that, first of all, pro-European means seeing the other, seeing the other's problem. For example, in the euro crisis, you sat down in Germany and explained to the Germans what the internal market means and demanded solidarity with other states, and it is the case that on the question of Ukraine, when Russia has again shifted borders militarily on this continent – for the first time since the Second World War – you have said that we Europeans must stand together and give a united answer. , that breach of international law will not be tolerated. And here it is that last summer – Jean-Claude, I made it clear in my speech manuscript inside – that borders cannot be closed unilaterally unilaterally, but can only be solved by dialogue with the neighbours. I would like to say thank you for this commitment, for this way of making politics, of overcoming selfishness, of seeking partnership. In addition, of course, we are in challenging times. Today, I would like to argue primarily methodically, not about the content, because we are discussing a lot, but are arguing methodically. The first is that we need a new will in Europe to take responsibility. We have discussed this here on several occasions. There is agreement in the Council, ministers regularly agree with 95%, 90% approval rates, especially in the Councils of Ministers, and when they are at home they know nothing more about it, even vote against it, even protesting. We have to end this Black Peter game. I would like to give a positive example today: it was Spain, for example, which knows no anti-European force. Why does Spain not know an anti-European force? Because politicians like Mariano Rajoy did not blame Brussels or attack it for the mistakes during the crisis, but Mariano Rajoy said: we Spaniards have a responsibility for the country, we must take over and do our homework. So, let us stop shifting the responsibility to Brussels! Then Europe will be much better off. (Applause) We must give Europe success. Only then will we reach the hearts of the people. There were many speakers at the lectern who spoke about their country's successes in economic policy. Overall, Europe is well on its way. That is why we can also underline that the initiatives of the European Commission, by Jean-Claude Juncker, have also led us to be economically strong. We will only win people if we also give Europe success. The third thing I would like to say about this methodical thing is that, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has done. Brexit has shown us that the \"I want to have my sovereignty back\" argument works, that it falls on fertile ground. That is why we need a new approach to build the bridge between the people and the European decision-making process. In my view, this does not require a new german-French axis, but a genuine European parliamentary democracy. This Parliament is the political map of Europe. Here sits your party, the CDU, here sits Syriza from Greece, here sits the National Front from France, liberals from Belgium, here all the political forces of this continent are united. And if decisions are taken here, when discussions take place here in the place of European democracy, then there must also be consequences. For example, a few months ago, this House decided to freeze the talks on Turkey's accession to the European Union for the time being, because the talks are difficult at this stage. I believe that this must have consequences in everyday life if this Chamber comes to such decisions in such bipartisan unity. And I would like to make one thing clear: Parliament is already a strong chamber, but it lacks a right, namely the right of initiative that every Parliament knows. We know that it is a great task to amend the Lisbon Treaty. That is why I would like to make it clear – as you know, I was nominated last week as the leading candidate of the European People's Party: if I become President of the Commission, I would like to promise that legislative initiatives of this European Parliament will also be presented by the Commission in the future, an indirect right of initiative of the European Commission's commitment that this Parliament will have the right of initiative that it then needs. (Strong applause) Last but not least, Europe needs ambition. I grew up politically in the 1990s. There was Helmut Kohl's chancellor, who told the Germans: we are abolishing the Deutschmark and introducing the euro – a not popular topic in the Federal Republic of Germany at the time. He did it because he believed in the future, because he thought over the decades. That is why I have sat in my seat today gratefully, because you have underlined the ambition for foreign and security policy. If we go in the direction of the European army, if we go towards 'unanimity, towards the principle of majority', then this European Union can not only become an economic giant that we already are today, but it can also turn this European Union into a political giant that can impose our values, our interests, globally. That is what we hope for, and that is why we would like to see good luck in your term of office of implementing these political objectives together!

Chancellor, a warm welcome also from the Socialist Group here in the European Parliament, in the House of European Democracy! I would ask colleagues to understand when the German Chancellor speaks to us here that I want to talk about Germany for a moment before we continue to talk about Europe. Yes, it has been very impressive to see in the last few days how much dignity was thought of of the dead of the First World War – in Germany, in France, in Great Britain, in Belgium, everywhere where people have seen the traces of this global catastrophe, the trigger for the Second World War.  I would like to add: Yes, in Germany we also commemorate and have thought – the courageous men and women from Kiel who refused an order a hundred years ago. The sailors' uprising, the uprising of soldiers and sailors who refused to go into the oh so – thought the generals – decisive naval battle and thus set a fanatic for the end of the First World War. One of these important democratic moments in German history, of which we are proud and which we perhaps do not care enough about: the 1918 revolution, the speech by Otto Wels in 1933, with which the entire Social Democratic Group opposed Hitler's Empowerment Act from the fascists, 17 June 1953 in the GDR and, yes, the peaceful revolution of 1989, which was also a milestone in your personal experience and personal career. What I want to say is that we Germans must be aware of how closely the fate of our nation is linked to our homeland, with Europe, and that we must never forget this, and that it affects all peoples, but one thing in particular is that we cannot afford failure. And that we Germans, let me say this as a German Social Democrat, have no right to fail when it comes to Europe – much less than anyone else, with the background to our history and with the mandate for our future. This also means that any hesitation, every pettiness, is already leading us on the wrong track. I want to create a picture so that it becomes clear what I want to say, Chancellor; no one here in this room doubts your pro-European attitude. But I fear that the expectation is deeper, that Europe's expectation of us Germans is deeper: please bring in your strength to give Europe strength. That is the expectation of Europeans in Germany. This applies economically, it applies politically, and this also applies to the political debate, to the intellectual debate on Europe. Let me recall a picture from the recent past: it was Commission President Barroso from your party family who, in the face of the financial crisis, proposed that we pursue a Community policy, launch a Community initiative. What has come out – under pressure from Mr Schäuble, including your pressure – is, yes, an intergovernmental action, ending in the troika. We have had many debates here about why the results were not good in many respects, because they were not democratically controlled, because it did not control the European Parliament, because in many respects it was the policy of bureaucrats. We need to change that. I am in favour of us drawing two conclusions as soon as possible, and I would ask you to support this. Firstly, the Community method must be made strong. Only if the European House of Democracy is in charge will we be able to succeed in the future. (Applause) And secondly: yes, of course, we Social Democrats went into a coalition agreement in Berlin because we wanted to make Europe strong. The European part of the coalition agreement must be fully implemented as quickly as possible. This applies to the European Monetary Fund, to the deepening of economic and monetary union, to the fact that Germany must take the lead in climate protection, and this also applies to the fact that we are making progress in social policy – for example, in the framework directive on reliable working conditions – that the mandate is not blocked by the European People's Party, but that we can make it clear to precarious workers that we are able to make clear to precarious workers. where Europe stands and that it helps them. Unfortunately, these days, we no longer know enough what the European People's Party stands for. We no longer know for sure: is it the European People's Party of President Juncker? Is it – and this will also be a problem for Manfred Weber – is it the European People's Party of your European policy speech? Or is it the European People's Party of Mr Kurz, the President-in-Office of the Council, who is currently in the process of taking part in the United Nations Migration Pact. Turning our backs on what I find disgraceful and what will be a major step backwards, including for Europe, that makes heavy war equipment come up on the border with Slovenia? Or is it even the European People's Party of Mr Orban that is equating the media, driving the European university out of his country and railing against refugees? (Applause) What does this great party of Konrad Adenauer and Robert Schuman stand for? What is it worth, and where is it in political discourse?  I would like to point out that we must all invest courage and all our strength in advancing Europe – the sustainable, the solidarity, the just Europe, in which everyone finds their chance and their opportunity. I would like to say that for the men and women of my group, Europe is not a stain on the map. For us, Europe is a state of mind, it is a commitment to freedom and democracy and tolerance. I thank you and I wish you luck and success at work. There is still much to be done.

Madam Chancellor, you are certainly one of those politicians who has had a decisive influence on what has been going on in Europe, not only as a leader of a very important nation, but also as a remarkable personality. But, precisely because of your exceptional status I’m taking the liberty of sharing with you some of the concerns that I have about the European Union. You are a very powerful person. You make the basic decisions in Europe. You anoint people for top positions within the EU. Even here in the European Parliament, when you want to do something that your government does not like – like stopping Nord Stream or curbing Jugendamt – there are always innumerable obstacles popping up and, in the end it turns out to be extremely difficult to do anything about it. Even if we can do something about it, then it is ignored by your government because your government can afford to ignore it. This power spills over. When I talk to some of my German colleagues here, I usually hear them sermonising. That’s very common here in this Chamber. I would say I hear them pontificating from the position of heavyweight moral champions, which they consider themselves to be. All this is true but, in real terms, I think your political family is playing second fiddle in European politics. Interesting as your speech was, I cannot resist the feeling that 95% of what you said could have been said by Martin Schulz, a politician now largely forgotten, but he was once a big man here. He was pushing this Chamber to left, being seconded by the European People’s Party. The truth is, Madam Chancellor, that the European Union has been hijacked by the left, which has imposed on it its ideology, its political agenda and even its language. To personalise it somewhat, we have just heard Mr Bullmann of the Socialists and Mr Weber of the PPE Group. If you cut out two or three sentences from what Mr Bullmann said, they could have exchanged speeches and nobody would have seen the difference. I can say more. I can imagine Mr Bullmann being the chairman of the EPP and Mr Weber being the chairman of the Socialists, and it wouldn’t make the slightest difference either. I would say more: I can imagine Mr Verhofstadt taking both positions. (Laughter) It wouldn’t make a difference. Perhaps the only difference would be that there would be more insults flying around. So much for diversity. The immigration crisis, which cost you so dearly, Madam Chancellor, is just the tip of the iceberg. I will not be telling you about the tradition of German Christian democracy – you know more about it than I do – but what happened to it? Where has it evaporated to? The portrait of Konrad Adenauer in your office is not enough. Where is your Christian democratic vision of what Europe should be like? Why is it that you and your political family passively observe while the EU has been turning into a political bulldozer of social engineering? This creeping centralisation, these so—called harmonisations through the back door, and the more and more obscure power structure. The bigger the institution you make, the more power structures become obscure. That is an elementary truth about politics. Everybody knows about it. The abysmal arrogance of the EU officials, the awful ideology oozing from almost every document written in a horrible newspeak, new strange institutions, chronic violation of the treaties, all this supposedly leading us to a radiant future of Europe. But this radiant future is a left-wing fantasy, and I do not want to live in a left-wing fantasy.

Well, I’m proud of this pro-European majority that exists in this House, Mr Legutko. I am proud of that, to be part of it. You have spoken for six minutes and I don’t even know what your position is in the meanwhile, in those six minutes; the only thing I know is that you are against Europe, but that was not new, that’s every time when you interfere. Chancellor, the last time that a university was closed in Europe happened 75 years ago. That was in November 1943 and it happened in Norway, where the University of Oslo was closed, officially because a part of the building was burnt. But the reality was that the occupying Nazi authorities were determined to suppress the continuous calls for autonomy and for academic freedom by the authorities of the university. That happened 75 years ago.  I am telling you this story, Ms Merkel, because in two weeks’ time from now, and that will be on 1 December, the same risks happening in our own European Union again; this time not in Oslo, but in Budapest, in Hungary, where a reputed university, the Central European University, the CEU, will be forced to close its doors and everybody knows why: because this is part of a personal crusade, even full of coded anti-Semitism, of a man, Mr Orbán, against another man, the founder of the university, namely Mr Soros. I have a question for you. My question is: when will you and your colleagues in the Council finally put an end to such shameful and scandalous behaviour in a value of the European Union?  (Applause) And I do not ask you this question to make it difficult for you, but I ask you this question because I firmly believe that more than migration – and that’s an important issue – more than the next financial crisis, more even than Putin, I think, that this threat from within undermines today the European Union. And we already had a fatal division in the past between north and south during the euro crisis. We already had this wound of Brexit, that still is a wound, and now we risk an even more devastating split between the east and the west, going back in fact a little bit to the Iron Curtain and to the Berlin Wall. Allow me to say – because I want now to come to the role of Germany in the European Union, because it’s about the future of the European Union that we are talking – that since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany we have made progress: the euro, for example, but not so much more. Because since the reunification of Germany, it is true that Germany has become the most powerful Member State of the Union: most powerful in population, most powerful in the economic realm, but, naturally, with more economic power, more political power comes also more responsibility, and certainly European responsibility. Precisely there I think that since 1990 Germany hasn’t always assumed fully this big responsibility, if I may say so. In a certain way I understand too what happened, as the country was preoccupied with something so historical and so emotional as the reunification of the country. The integration of a bankrupt communist state into the Bundesrepublik – and that was an enormous endeavour – and by doing so all the energy, all the efforts went to this new gigantic task. But by doing so – and that’s my message that I want to give, Chancellor – by doing so, the more traditional, the more – how shall I put it – post—war German ambition so typical for Adenauer, so typical for Genscher, so typical for Kohl, to build always an ever closer union on this continent, lost traction and also energy. The debate in Germany on Europe, if I may say so, and it is not a criticism, it’s a fact, narrowed far too much down to a discussion about what? About Kompetenzabgrenzung, I remember many of the discussions with your predecessor, Mr Schroeder, or about Steuern; that was the debate in Germany, Steuern – taxes blasting in. So two weeks ago, Chancellor, you announced that after this mandate you will quit politics. But let me encourage you to use, nevertheless, the period and the coming months and the coming years. Why? Well to put Germany back on track, I think, towards this ever closer union. And I think your intervention of today is certainly a step in that direction. We need a leap forward again with Europe. We need the re—launch of the project so that we can face the challenges of the world of tomorrow. It will be a world in which, in a certain way, we will be on our own: facing the Chinese, facing the Indians, facing the Russians and sometimes facing the Americans when it concerns trade, for example, in their war. So, Ms Merkel – and this will be my conclusion – you can do that. We know your strength. We know your courage. We have seen that courage during the migration crisis. You have a unique chance to achieve it now, to make this leap forward in Europe. Why unique? Because there is a President of the French Republic – Emmanuel Macron – who is also a convinced European, not in the traditional French approach. You know what the traditional French approach is: “Vive l’Europe, pourvu qu’elle soit française”. Not in that way. He outlined a European project in his Sorbonne speech and my message to you, to both of you in fact, is: embrace this vision, join forces, revive the European dream as mirrored in that emotional image of both of you three or four days ago in Compiègne, holding each other in a tender but powerful embrace. You showed there, Ms Merkel, the whole world how immensely beautiful also this common European project is and I wish you a lot of success in this.

I must go back to Mr Verhofstadt – and I am happy to do so – because I too would like to remind you of what a great gesture of reconciliation you have sent in recent days. You reminded – together with Macron – that we had the 1918 ceasefire, that this ceasefire ended one of the greatest disasters, and that the European Union is the greatest peace project in the world. Together in the European Union, we have broken down walls and united the countries of Europe. We have fought for freedom and democracy and overcome national blinkered thinking. Europe is very close to our hearts for us, but it is important for us. We want a strong and a united Europe, a Europe in which we all fight together and constructively for our future. We want a Europe that protects human rights and defends the rule of law with all the necessary consistency. Europe must be strong against the enemies of democracy, against the resurgence of right-wing nationalists. We want a Europe that promotes social cohesion and offers people jobs and prospects. We also want a Europe that taxes large digital corporations at least as much as the baker around the corner. We want a Europe that is committed to peace in the world and stops exporting arms to Saudi Arabia. We want a Europe that puts itself at the forefront of climate protection and protects our livelihoods.  This future of the European Union, Chancellor, is also in your hands. Unfortunately, however, the Federal Government, your Federal Government, is consistently on the brakes when it comes to Europe. For example, the climate crisis – one of the greatest challenges of our time, if not the greatest one. We are destroying the planet on which we live, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has just written this into our family book. In a few weeks' time, the EU will have a duty in Katowice to move forward, because this is the last decade in which we can still change course. But the objectives to date are far from sufficient. Two things that we urgently need to address now: this includes a minimum price for CO2. Some Member States are already considering whether they can move forward together. I ask: will Germany, will the Federal Government participate? This means that car manufacturers urgently need to reduce the CO2 emissions of their fleet. Unfortunately, however, Germany has ensured in the Council that the Council burys an ambitious target. Does this look like the German contribution to climate protection? Because the climate cannot be saved with vague declarations of intent and glacier photos. We need concrete, ambitious targets for Europe and rapid implementation. Instead, the Federal Government has simply buried the climate targets it has set itself and is the brake on European climate policy. This is a real disaster for Europe, for the coasts and for the island states, for the whole planet. To be sure, Germany is not the only country in the EU with a climate reality problem. But it is the greatest, with the greatest responsibility, and that weighs heavily. The fact that Germany is constantly violating European environmental protection laws, such as clean water and clean air, underlines the problem.  Climate protection and renewable energies also help to become energy-independent. A natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, on the other hand, cements dependence on fossil fuels and harms the interests of Poland and Ukraine. No one needs this pipeline – except perhaps Gerhard Schroeder and Vladimir Putin.  (Applause) Another example: the eurozone. We have known for eight years that the eurozone is not as stable as it should be. What has happened since then? Half a banking union, little stability pact and, sorry, a relatively small investment fund. He can still grow. That is simply not enough. In any case, with social cuts, they will not stabilise the currency area, but will only divide Europe. The European Parliament has said what to do. The President of the Commission has made proposals, and so has the French President. You don't have to like them all, okay. But to bury your head in the sand and hope that this somehow settles itself is apolitical, and that is irresponsible. The next crisis is already pre-programmed. Why not finally sit down with Macron and the other colleagues and put forward a reform proposal for the eurozone? Why is the federal government dumb? This is about the future of our entire Union.  And still such a Example: Tax justice. Here, too, the federal government is blocking. Together with the governments of the last tax havens in the EU, such as the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Austria, you are ensuring that the urgent transparency in the tax system does not come. They ensure that corporations can continue to exploit tax loopholes and that Member States lose EUR 17 billion in revenue each year. We must finally put an end to this obstructionist attitude. Move forward for real climate protection, for a stable eurozone and for an end to tax fraud. If the largest Member State is on the brakes, then we are not making any progress. We need a new start for Europe.  You said that it is worth working for Europe. If you are serious about this, then act! Right now, otherwise you will not live up to your speech. Europe needs impulses and people to move forward – large and small, symbolic and practical, courageous and determined.

Mr President, Chancellor, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work she has One hundred years after the end of the First World War and more than sixty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome – last year – the process of European integration should actually have progressed further, at least to the point that, as you said, national selfishness, self-aggrandism in Europe are excluded. And I would like to add: another bloodshed. I am not sure that this will be an automatic way. When we talk today about the need to revive the European dream, I say: yes, but please so that the European dream does not turn into a nightmare. That is why I would like to say a few other points on some of the points that I would also like to criticise here on behalf of my group, because the reality is different from what you have just described here. You know the line, Chancellor, 'Resurrected from ruins and facing the future'. As a lesson from both world wars of the last century, the deaths of millions of people, war must never again start from German or European soil. \"Creating peace with fewer and fewer weapons\", \"swords to ploughshares\" – did these demands not relate to any kind of arms race at any time? In your 13 years as Chancellor of Germany – I am sorry to ask you this – what have you really done in order to stop German and European arms exports to crisis and conflict zones? In case of doubt, the interests of the arms companies always take a stand above values such as human rights and also democracy. And I would also like to contradict you in the following and to say clearly: please do not follow Macron on the way to a European army, to a military union! Keep in mind that many other EU states are more relaxed than Germany can ever be allowed to. For Germany, the parliamentary reservation applies, and that is a good thing. The fact that it could be used again and again and became an effective instrument is thanks to the peace movement in Germany, in Europe, but also to the Greens, the Left and the Social Democrats and many others, and this is not automatically transferable to the EU. We call on you to do much more politically and diplomatically to preserve and extend existing disarmament agreements between the superpowers. It is up to you to stop German arms exports and to reach EU agreements so that weapons are not supplied from EU Member States to military conflict zones. We call on you to finally allow social union. It is just wrong, as you said a few years ago, that social policy is exclusively national policy. If we do not manage to create a social union instead of a military union, then we may also have further consequences, and then Brexit will not remain. Personally, I do not want that. Mrs Merkel, you have taken up the post as climate chancellor. We are talking about minimum ecological standards. We call on you to break the deadlock in the Council! This applies to everything that has been mentioned so far. I would also like to point out that we expect the Federal Government to play a different role in country-by-country reporting. The point here is that we finally oppose tax avoidance, tax fraud by large corporations, and that we free up money for the tasks that are actually necessary. They have replaced the Community method, which includes Parliament, with the so-called intergovernmental method. It has been essentially your share. We call on you to undo this. Make sure that the European Parliament is co-answering for these tasks, that it does not simply depend on what agreement can be concluded between two states, one of which may be dependent on the other. This does not strengthen democracy, it does not strengthen confidence. There is no excuse for dealing with Greece, Mrs Merkel. And even if Wolfgang Schäuble took on the role of Mephisto, they let themselves be distracted from the right path and watched life in Greece be destroyed. Austerity policies and austerity dictates have been Mephisto's magic potion. The blackmail of sovereign Member States and massive interference with fundamental democratic social rights have put people in existential need. This has led to a massive loss of confidence in recent years. And I would like to point this out to you: correct this! We need a halt to all forms of austerity. And with a view of Italy, I can only recommend: Yes, it made a proposal from the Bundesbank to issue compulsory bonds of the rich in Italy so that they can pay the debt there. A great proposal – redistribution, but please in all the Member States of the European Union! Then we no longer need to talk about whether the Maastricht Treaty or the fiscal compact will be respected, then we really will have a basis for freeing up money for education, for social issues, for much more that we need. Finally, on the refugees, you have gained a great deal of recognition worldwide by not closing the borders. But why, then, do you turn a blind eye today to dying in the Mediterranean? This can't be! You must work precisely to ensure that we have legal channels, that solidarity is actually provided in all the Member States, that we, as the European Union, really comply with the values that we have proclaimed, that we live them on a daily basis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 145, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Nigel Farage", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, I would like to say to you, Ms Merkel, that many of my Eurosceptic colleagues had been booing you this morning, but they shouldn’t be in a way because the British should be cheering you. Without you, we’d never have made it over the line with Brexit – and I want to thank you very much for that. And of course many of these Eurosceptic groups on the right, the centre and the left will come back here after the next European elections in huge numbers directly as a result of your immigration and asylum policy. Your ‘we can cope’ led to a huge migrant tide – indeed, a stampede – that came across the Mediterranean: young men coming from very different cultures, who were not going to integrate. Young men, none of whom would have qualified as being genuine refugees, and I think in many ways we looked at it in the referendum and we said that we don’t want to be part of an increasingly German-dominated European Union, and we certainly don’t want to pay the price for Ms Merkel’s errors. And I believe – having heard you today, and listening to senior French politicians over the last couple of days – that for us leaving the European Union is now indeed a liberation. It’s a European Union that we’re told is now to become an empire, a militarised European Union, an undemocratic European Union, a European Union that seeks to continually expand to the east. A European Union that has launched a new Cold War against the United States of America. A European Union that tries to rewrite history. And I think, a hundred years on from the Armistice, we should be genuinely worried. The idea that this new militarised Union is somehow a recipe for peace – I suggest you will sit back and think a little bit more carefully. Maybe you should all reread history: the European project was set up to stop German domination. What you’ve seen today is a naked takeover bid. (Applause in some quarters) So I think Brexit becomes a necessity after this. And for the rest of the countries: Ms Merkel, you’ve had a long, successful career, but your political decision to open up the doors unconditionally is the worst decision we’ve seen in post-war politics in Europe. Is it not time for you at last to admit that you were wrong? Is it not time for you to say to German communities and many others ‘I’m sorry for what I’ve done to you and the problems I have inflicted upon you for many decades to come’?

Madam Chancellor, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work she has done on this We have so much in place in Europe, and yet almost everything seems to divide us at the moment. Europe is the home of all our Christian-cultural homelands - the home of our families. Europe is home to a unique scientific society, the most successful economic model in the world.  Chancellor, you are a European past, and today and here you are saying Adieu. It is appropriate to tell you something about the future, because our aim is not a European empire, but a Europe of the fatherlands. German government policy has shaped the euro and economic union – in breaking stability criteria, such as the ECB's misuse of government financing, bank financing, and intervention in the budgets of sovereign states. In doing so, they have set a childishly naive morality of solidarity against economic reason and the principle of responsibility.  German government policy has shaped energy and transport policy. Whether you were trying to get out of nuclear and coal power at the same time, or now in the fight against diesel. In doing so, they have set childishly naive morality of resource conservation against science and the principle of moderate state governance. German government policy has eroded the foundation of Christian Europe, the family, through the invention of countless gender identities, through the application of the concept of marriage to any sexual communities, through the decoupling of children from their biological parents, by the state sovereignty over the classical parental task, moral education and many other acts of shame. In doing so, they have set the childishly naive morality and arbitrariness against the natural law and the Christian principle of the family. (Interjections) German government policy has tolerated, promoted and triggered the most powerful migration movement in recent history. It began with humanly understandable emotion. This was followed by a loss of control and overburden – the loss of control of state institutions, the loss of control of the education system, the security bodies, the social systems and the overburdening of the population. In doing so, they have set childishly naive morality of charity against social cohesion and the principle of preserving European cultures. Mrs Merkel, every single German, every European acts morally when he personally supports Greeks. Many have done so. Every German, every European acts morally when he conserving resources. Many do. Every German, every European acts morally without alternatives when he exercises tolerance for coexistence outside classical families. Almost everyone does. Every German, every European acts deeply morally when he protects people in need from persecution. Many do.  But, Chancellor, a state that saves states, a state that is responsible for fluttering and combats private transport, a state that declares all forms of human coexistence to be a family, a state that believes that it can help every human being in the world at any time, such a state suffers from megalomania. He overestimates his abilities, he supposedly protects everything and ultimately nothing at all. If, according to you, Europe is not to fall apart once and for all, but to become a model of success again, then economic and monetary policy must be shaped in the sense of a professor and not planned in offices, energy and transport policy must be thought of in Aeuropean europe and not longed for in metropolitan latte-macchiato kitchens, the Christian family image must be brought to the fore, instead of being felt by quota gender professors, external border identity and Christian culture are re-emerging. , instead of fantasising about cultural destruction.  Our Europe of foundations is built on responsibility, identity, Christian culture and science. Their heritage is shaped by destroyed institutions. Two Unions – and you can now listen well, ladies and gentlemen of the CDU – and two Unions leave you in a serious state – the European and the Christian Democratic. Others need to restore.

Mr President, I would like to thank the First of all, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their contributions to my speech and, with regard to Jean-Claude Juncker and Manfred Weber, who have once again mentioned the subject of the United Kingdom, I believe that it is extremely important in what spirit we accept and shape the departure of the United Kingdom. I regret the decision of the British citizens, but it must be respected. I have therefore thanked Michel Barnier and I can also thank Jean-Claude Juncker, because I believe that the spirit in which we do this will decide for decades to come how we can have a partnership. And Britain has made it clear through Theresa May that they remain part of Europe. There will be a variety of opportunities for cooperation in which we can work together. And that is exactly what we want to do. In any case, I say this for the German Federal Government. I would then like to briefly address a number of issues that have been raised. The one issue that is perhaps also one that is related to, Mr Legutko, is that Germany is a country with 80 million inhabitants and an economically strong country, that we may have to be more cautious than others when we represent our interests. But we also have interests. And we do not always agree with everyone, and they do not always agree with us. I would just like to point out that Germany – this is not a boastful piece – has about 90 cases before the European Court of Justice, and we have accepted all the judgments, even if we did not like them. We know that, of course, we also have differences of opinion. I know that even my friends in the GROUP of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are far from in agreement on Nord Stream. Personally, I believe that we will use more gas to shape climate change, especially in a country like Germany, which will no longer have any nuclear energy in a few years' time and which, with its strongest energy pillar, renewable energies, is already making a considerable contribution to climate protection. But if we want to get out of coal, we will have to use more gas for a bridge time. And that means that this gas import should also be diversified. But we will not exclude Russia as a source. I am very much in favour of Ukraine not leaving as a transit country. But whether the gas we need more comes via Nord Stream, comes through Ukraine, comes through Turk Stream – it's always Russian gas molecules. Europe will not be able to become independent of Russian gas, but it can diversify its sources. That is why I can tell you that Germany will also build an LNG terminal in order to respond to other possibilities of gas importation when other sources dry up. But if we say that we can phase out nuclear energy, we should phase out coal, we are building natural renewable energies, then we also need a part, and that will be gas for quite some time. Secondly, there is a subject that has been raised here time and again: the Community method and the intergovernmental method. I would like to say that the Community method has been strengthened time and again by Germany and is being further strengthened. At the moment, however, we in the European Council are in a situation where it has been almost stated that the European Treaties can never be changed again. Let me tell you quite frankly that if we take this position, Europe will become, so to speak, a fossilised entity. A Community that needs to respond to new challenges must also be able to adapt its treaties to the realities of the world.  (Applause) That is why I cannot see that we are taking the view that we are not changing the Treaties. However, if we want to act at European level and the Treaties do not yet give competence, I have always advocated that the ESM be entered in the euro area protocol of the Lisbon Treaty. It does not depend on Germany, we can do that tomorrow. However, it is not easy to get a majority in the European Council for this. If we cannot do that, however, then we must also act as a precursor to community action. It would have been worse if we had done nothing at all about monetary union. And that is why one does not exclude the other. I strongly advocate that we do not take treaty changes as an end in themselves, but that we do not simply exclude them. Because if we were to do this at home and say, \"We will never change our Basic Law again,\" then we would also be able to do so. nation-state that does not fulfil its responsibilities. This brings me to the point that you mentioned that whole groups seem to be interchangeable here. I think you know as well as I do that they are anything but interchangeable. But I do not know of any nation-state that is not based on a common platform such as a constitution or, in our case, a basic law that was adopted by a two-thirds majority or more, and which nevertheless argues about any legislative project within that common platform. And when it comes to the foundations of the European Union, fortunately there is a large group in this Parliament that agrees on the basics. That is the foundation of the cohesion of a community. There can then be an intense dispute about the design of the basic principles. Fortunately, whenever we talk about the basic principles here, there is still a majority. (Applause) Then on the subject: What role should Germany play? Look, you want two things at once. They want us to be the first, so to speak, visionary, with France, for example, but also, of course, to guarantee that the visions will also be a reality, so that the European Council will finally accept all of this unanimously by 28 votes, and soon 27 votes. And this area of tension between the vision and the feasibility among the Member States must not, so to speak, ever grow, but at some point it must also be realized what one is prepared to do. I may sometimes be a little reluctant to formulate objectives. I stand by this, however, because people in our home want what we say to be implemented in the end. When it comes to respect for the individual Member States, I must include in my thinking what is thought in these Member States and which is deemed possible by the respective political majority. Otherwise, vision and my own idea – I can imagine many other things, I have just talked about treaty changes – and what we then really deliver, fall apart. And that must be kept together. I would say that Germany has always played a role in this and will continue to play it, both to formulate ambitious goals and also to see that there is respect for others who do not always pursue the same things. This is also part of the European Union. And then there is a word about migration, because I also have a limited speaking time: we are all proud of our values, and that is what Europe is founded on. Article 1 of our Basic Law in Germany states: \"The dignity of man is inviolable.\" Now there is a terrible civil war and a huge challenge on our doorstep by ISIS, by Islamist terror. Mrs Zimmer, just by one example of the Yazidis, I would like to tell you what the Federal Government was thinking when we were thinking: do we support the Peshmerga with weapons to prevent the destruction of a people, or do we not support them? We have decided, we support it, and I believe that was the right decision, even if it was not easy for us. (Applause) I would like to say to you further: we have now established a very close migration partnership with Niger. This is one of the poorest countries in the world. That is where the terrorists come from Mali, well equipped with weapons because of the failure of the international community in Libya, and then the terrorists of Boko Haram come from Nigeria. And I say to this president from Niger. You know, we could still imagine giving shoes to your soldiers. We could still imagine training them a little bit, but when it comes to arming their soldiers so that they can fight the terrorists, Germany is unfortunately not there. The World Bank is not there. We and everyone, including European development aid, have sometimes put their heads in the sand. So we don't get respect. I still think it is better that we support African soldiers who are prepared to fight their terrorists, but that cannot end with shoe equipment. That is what I am saying. (Applause) Or we say: this is what our French friends do. That is not honest. And now even more on migration. So we've had a civil war and we still have it in Syria. We have a terrorist Islam and we have six million refugees outside Syria and Iraq. These six million, or perhaps even seven million people, are being taken in by Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. We have – and I said this in Germany at the beginning of this parliamentary term, also as my mistake, my Misjudgment, my failure , did not pay sufficient attention to whether these people in their refugee camps had at least one dollar for food and some form of education. And so the refugees came to us because they fought for their lives. And now the whole of Europe – 500 million people – has, in the end, of the six million Syrians and probably one or two million Iraqis – and I do not have that in my mind at this point – we have taken in one to 1.5 million people and helped them in a dramatic situation where many Europeans have been helped in other times. Do you really think that this is something that can, so to speak, lead us into inability to act? (Applause) We must, of course, ensure that we have died out of illegal migration, where people have given all their money to the smugglers, and that we get out of there. That is why I have concluded the EU-Turkey agreement and have been criticised a great deal for converting illegal migration into legal migration, in order to be told by the UNHCR which people we should help. That is our common objective. But we were not sufficiently prepared for it, and now we have to learn it. And that is why we set up Frontex, that is why we have the Sophia mission to save people, that is why we have a partnership with Africa, that is why we are building the coast guard from Libya, that is why there is a Libya conference in Palermo today. I only want the Europeans to develop a uniform Libya policy so that the poor do not constantly hear two different things. That is part of it. But it is clear that where we have not engaged ourselves enough, we cannot simply get off the field. I think that we should also say with our heads high: we have learned from our mistakes, we will do it differently in the future. And that includes the partnership with Africa. Now the last part with climate protection. I have already said something about the gas. We stand by our climate targets, we have made very ambitious plans for 2020. We will try to achieve as much as possible and really achieve our 2030 climate goals through a climate change law. Mrs Keller knows this too. Finally, perhaps I would like to conclude by saying that it was Wolfgang Schäuble in the G20 presidency who ensured that these tax avoidance matters were far restricted by an international agreement of the BEPS. This is currently being implemented. That is why I believe that Germany has made a very good contribution to this.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which is I think the German Parliament would be very grateful if it could ask me more often in this length. We have now had over 30 questions, and it is, of course, quite impossible for me to deal with these 30 questions now, especially since I had also told the President that I had to leave the House at half past six. That is why I would just like to say very briefly: firstly, I am, of course, very pleased – and I expressed my indirect delight by mr Hallstein's quote – that Manfred Weber has been chosen as the leading candidate of the European People's Party and has also presented himself wonderfully there.

(Applause) Secondly, I would like to point out that, for me, the word that Mr Leinen used, and which I do not want to put into my own mouth, is not a view of European monetary union and of our common budgetary policy. We Germans benefit from the fact that we have a Europe and, above all, we have a Europe that also grows closer together. That is why we are committed to cohesion funds, to structural funds. Nobody – I could say now, nobody knows better, but I do not want to say so – but I am deeply convinced, and we now see it in our own German history, through the merging of East and West, how important it is that we have cohesion and convergence. If we do not have them, people will also lose their enjoyment of Europe. The only question now is: how do we achieve this? Of course, political ideas are mixed up and divergent. I am very much in favour of the European social market economy. But the social market economy also says: I have to generate what I then distribute. If this balance breaks down, then no force in the world will be able to restore social security to people. If such a thing is out of balance, then countries must also take ownership. I know how difficult it was in Greece, how difficult it was in Portugal. But I believe that today we are all growing again, that we have put in place a major programme against youth unemployment, that the european employment agencies are now working together, that we in Germany have also provided vocational training for Greek young people and others, that we want to continue this aid. That must be the spirit. If we do not create really sustainable jobs, then we will have no chance of really building a good Europe. This also applies to Italy. We want to reach out to Italy. I say this explicitly. Italy is a founding member. But Italy has also adopted many rules, which we all have together as a legal basis. We cannot simply say that we are not interested in that now. That is why I am not going to say anything at all, but the Commission has an important task to do here. I hope that solutions will be found in discussions with the Italian Government, that is my fere hope, and that is what I said to Prime Minister Conte.  I would like to say something about the Hungarian criticism. Look, when there were very, very many refugees in Hungary, Viktor Orban asked the then Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann, and he again asked me on a given day whether we were prepared to help Hungary and take in refugees. We should not forget this when presenting the history of migration. Should we leave Greece alone in an extremely difficult economic situation? Should we leave the countries of the Western Balkans, which have a European perspective, alone in their difficulty? Or, in such a situation, we should say: we must protect our external border – what we then did with the EU-Turkey agreement, but in between we must all bear the burden on each other!  That is why it must be said quite honestly that Hungary has not yet been able to protect its external border in 2015. I have never opposed Hungary's responsibility to protect external borders, never. I just found that Hungary couldn't, and because Hungary couldn't, others jumped in.  But now to be insulted every day for the fact that a request from Hungary to Austria and Austria to Germany is now also presented as if we had done something that was not right, I find that funny, and that is what we have to look at when it comes to presenting history. (Applause) Then there is a point on the subject of a two-speed Europe. I feel that many countries, especially from Central and Eastern Europe, are very concerned about this Have. The two-speed Europe is also a Europe in which Member States can decide whether or not to cooperate on a particular cause. The Schengen area is not shared by all the Member States of the European Union. That is the decision. Some cooperation in internal security is not shared by everyone. Not everyone has introduced the euro to date. We cannot now say to Hungary and Poland: you must now adopt the euro if you do not want it yet. That is why there is already a Europe of different speeds. What is important? There must be no closed shop. There must never be an initiative in which Germany and France and three others say that no other Member State should participate in this, but must always be open to all. And then it's okay, but then we already have a two-speed Europe today. Finally, with regard to Mrs Valenciano, I would just like to say briefly: look, we have, by and large, two approaches. One believes that together we can solve many problems – not all, but many problems – better. Not all problems have to go to the European Parliament, but many problems. And there is another group here in this Parliament that does not believe that. She actually sits here every day to make it clear that the nation states can do better on their own. Now it is a matter of not saying: you have to do this, and then I say again: you have to do that. But all those who are convinced that the multilateral project of Europe – European unification – is basically the right response to the lessons of history and the right response to the challenges of the future, all of whom must stand together in this basic conviction and fight with each other fairly and respectfully for the right solutions. That is our task, and I will continue to work for that. Thank you very much.

People are afraid of illegal migration, for example, citizens and politicians in the Czech Republic refuse to show any solidarity with refugees, even a large part refuses to accept unaccompanied children.

Its European path is now even enshrined in the constitution of Georgia and enjoys cross—party support. Unlike here in the EU, in Georgia there are no serious anti—European movements. Georgia has shown a good absorption capacity and between 2017 and 2020 the association programme has been supported with funds of between EUR 371 and 453 million. It is reflected in the report that the EU takes very seriously the oversight of this financial spending. I believe that Georgia is making enough communication efforts to guarantee that its citizens know about the projects realised with the help of the European Union. The AA has a very positive effect on EU—Georgia relations. It has allowed us to extend our political relations under the security dialogue so that now Georgia is even taking part in our CSDP missions. Georgia provides an example that the EU’s structural foreign policy really works.  Even if the EU is still silent on the concrete membership process, the Georgian side is really putting a lot of energy into it. Many say that Georgia has gone much further than other association countries in its ambitions and performance, and has made a series of ministerial reforms to achieve the objectives of the AA. That is why Georgia needs more highly—qualified personnel from the EU. They need our expertise in energy, in the environment, in safety standards and other fields. If you want our engagement in Georgia to be sustainable, we need to boost it with knowledge, not only with money. Georgia has achieved huge progress on many democratic issues, including free media and journalism. In the last five years the number of TV channels with nationwide coverage rose from 3 to 13. This is important considering that TV is still the major source of information for the people. In its judiciary reform, Georgia can already claim many achievements. Among them one can mention accessibility for the media, the removal of politicians from the High Council of Justice, the reform of the High School of Justice, and so on. The parliament is now working on further reforms of the judiciary to address disciplinary proceedings, caseload and other issues.  Recent constitutional reforms transform Georgia into a truly parliamentary democracy with strong powers in the hands of the parliament, particularly as far as its oversight over the executive is concerned. Georgia expects a transition to a fully—proportionate parliamentary election system in 2024. This will make political life even more vibrant, and the active engagement of civil society in Georgian policymaking is a good precursor of this new trend.  The report also reflects major improvements in human rights standards, and freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and of association are now protected much better than before in Georgia. Some challenges need to be tackled however. Let’s say that our current association agenda has to take account of the legacy of the previous government Georgia had since its independence in 1991. Therefore this report does not only contain an assessment of achievements but also provides concrete recommendations for further work. On a separate note, I would like also to underline that this report gives support to Georgia in its pursuit of peaceful conflict resolution and reconciliation. The report welcomes Georgia’s efforts to maintain constructive dialogue with Russia and supports its committed participation in the Geneva international discussions. My report proposes a decision to draw up such implementation reports on Georgia on an annual basis, and considering the recent positive dynamics I think that the next report will reflect even more achievements.

These are Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The deliberations and today’s and tomorrow’s vote on this report must be viewed as additional confirmation of the EU’s strong political commitment vis—à—vis best performance in the Eastern neighbourhood. In my capacity as standing rapporteur on Moldova, I hereby wish to dwell on the main findings and conclusions of my report. I will do so in all frankness and sincerity as a true friend of European Moldova. The EU—Moldova partnership is not abstract. The EU and Moldova are bound by a very solid and comprehensive association agreement document which contains a set of legal and political obligations. It is a partnership based on common values, and respect for democratic principles and fundamental freedoms.  This is exactly what worries me the most: a continuous and even deliberate back—sliding in relation to democratic standards in Moldova over the last couple of years. To begin with, I do regret that the Moldovan authorities choose to confront or even disregard the joint opinion and recommendations of respected European institutions – the Venice Commission and the ODIHR – as regards the recent changes in national electoral legislation. This House, as well as other European institutions, has been doing its utmost to explain to Chișinău that electoral legislation must not be tailor—made and changed a year before elections, bypassing civil society and other political actors in Moldova. I am very upset that the advice of the European bodies has not been taken into account. I must also say that the Moldovan authorities’ actions that led to invalidation of Chișinău’s mayoral elections earlier this year were very disturbing. Equally disappointing was – and continues to be – the lack of real progress and transparency in the investigation of a USD 1 billion bank fraud case. I wish to repeat our call in the report, namely that the findings and recommendations of the two independent Kroll reports must be published in full, and those responsible for the fraud must face real justice.  To continue, I wish to stress that the so—called fiscal reform package is giving us grounds for another serious concern. Our report states that this tax amnesty scheme is substantially doubtful, insufficient and lacks transparency – and sometimes even logic. For all the reasons mentioned above, I must say – and I am saying this with regret – that the  EU was left with no other choice in deciding to put on hold the macro—financial assistance and budget support programmes foreseen for Moldova. Moldova seems to be the first country, at least in recent years, that has had to face such strict conditionality measures from the EU side, resulting in the suspension of EU assistance. I am sure you will agree that this is a fact that speaks for itself.  Colleagues, in sending this message we continue to extend our hand of cooperation to the Moldovan authorities and civil society at large, in order to stay in close touch. In exchange, I believe we will reach our goal. Moldovans will understand that the only way forward is Europeanisation – meaning a comprehensive package of political and economic reforms.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 197, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, I wish to start by thanking Parliament for its continued support for our eastern partners and helping associated countries to progress in implementing the reforms set out in the Association Agreements.  Before I enter into the specificities of the two countries, let me mention one very important element, a crucial part of our relations with these countries: our engagement with civil societies. The situation is different in the two countries, but they would like to thank the civil society partners that are monitoring the implementation of their Association Agreements. Their contribution is highly valued. I welcome the draft reports prepared by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and would like to thank in particular the rapporteurs Mr Mamikins and Mr Auštrevičius for their remarkable work.  Turning first to Georgia. The report demonstrates the achievements in progress made in particular regarding reforms related to the implementation of the Association Agreement and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement. It also notes the positive trends in terms of closer links with the European Union, which is Georgia’s largest trade partner, representing almost one third of its total trade, as well as the most significant donor and the largest source of foreign direct investments. Relations between the European Union and Georgia are close today. As a tangible sign we will be hosting a high-level meeting between Members of the European Commission and of the Georgian Government in Brussels on 21 November, chaired by President Juncker and Prime Minister Bakhtadze. This meeting will provide a unique opportunity to discuss areas of future cooperation and driving the political association of economic integration process forward. On the EU side we will highlight the importance of working on the implementation and sustainability of reforms and increasing reform efforts in the area of law enforcement and justice. We will continue to focus our support on key areas for sustained growth in jobs with our programmes, and matching skills with the labour market and economic and business development. It is rightly pointed out in the report that some key structural reforms are still needed for a transparent and competitive economy that ultimately provides more jobs and economic perspectives for citizens. For instance, ensuring proper functioning of the labour market, an efficient social protection mechanism, strengthening economic governance and public financial management, and further improving the business environment and financial infrastructure.  These efforts will also be supported through our macro-financial assistance of EUR 45 million. Payment of the first tranche is still foreseen for this year if the Georgian Parliament ratifies the Memorandum of Understanding in time. Another area which requires further improvement is the system of checks and balances. Against this background, we have been working with the Georgian Parliament to strengthen its oversight function. For instance, we are supporting the Budget and Finance Committee on public finance policy reform and will continue to do so through a programme on governance and fiscal accountability which we are currently putting in place. Additional support for parliamentary oversight of the security sector is planned as part of an overarching programme on security and the rule of law. This innovative programme on security will address many of the key issues identified as crucial in the report such as, for instance, supporting the fight against corruption, organised crime and money laundering; strengthening the capacity of state institutions to prevent and fight crime; and enhancing integrated border management.  The actions foreseen also respond to the recommendations under the visa suspension mechanism. Very closely linked to this is the need for further reform in the justice sector, as also clearly highlighted in the report. We will focus our support on commercial justice, which is one of the few areas where Georgia still needs to undertake reforms. At the same time, effective implementation of human rights protection and anti-discrimination measures remain a challenge.  We are also fully committed to a policy of non-recognition and engagement with Georgia’s breakaway regions. Our approach is to include these territories in our sector support programmes in Georgia, where possible, as we are doing in the area of agriculture, rural development, for civil society, and for vocational education and training.  Furthermore, improving transport links and infrastructure, boosting energy resilience through strengthening energy interconnections, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy is a main priority for our work with Georgia and the other partner countries.  As you know, Georgia is keen to enhance its participation in EU programmes and agencies. To respond to this, as well as to the great success of Erasmus+, in Georgia we have included a top-up of EUR six million in this year’s assistance package, which will provide more young people, youth workers, students and academic staff from Georgia with the opportunity to engage in more exchanges. Thanks to this, we will be supporting some 700 additional mobility opportunities for academic staff and students.  Investment in youth is crucial. In early September I had the pleasure and privilege to open the first European School outside the European Union in Tbilisi for students from all six Eastern Partnership countries. This represents a very important milestone not only for Georgia, but for the whole Eastern Partnership and the young.  All of this demonstrates our very close relationship with Georgia and you, the European Parliament, have a key role to play in this. The Georgian Parliament and Government are very closely following your work and they have paid considerable attention to this report. It’s also in your hands to ensure that Georgia will wholeheartedly continue its reform efforts in all sectors. Moving now to Moldova, let me start by thanking this Parliament for the continuous attention paid to the Republic of Moldova and for the ongoing work at political level and with civil society in particular. This is vital for our relations. I agree with the report’s finding that Moldova has made some progress in economic reforms, fiscal consolidation and bank restructuring following the banking fraud exposed in 2014. The EU, together with other international institutions, provided substantial assistance to the signing and implementing of these reforms for the benefit of Moldovan citizens.  I also take positive note of the constant increase in bilateral trade between the EU and Moldova. Let me thank in particular, as you also do in your report, the people who continue to work hard for positive change in the country. They have a fundamental role to play in driving political and economic reforms. I reiterate our expectation that the Government of Moldova will provide them with an enabling environment to pursue their activities.  At the same time, this report touches upon all of the key concerns of the European Union: respect for the rule of law, ensuring free and fair elections, and the independence of media and civil society. As you know, the Council shares these concerns, as clearly stated in the Council Conclusions on Moldova adopted at the end of February. Since then, there has been a worrying deterioration in the rule of law following in particular the invalidation of mayoral elections in Chişinău. On this, the High Representative and I immediately expressed strong concerns and called to take appropriate measures to ensure that the results of the elections reflect the will of the voters.  The resolution adopted in this House on 5 July echoed our concerns. Furthermore, and in line with the principle of strict conditionality, the Commission put on hold payments under the macro-financial assistance and EU budget support programmes. I would like to assure you that in all our contacts with the authorities we consistently underline the need for the continuation of implementation of reforms for the benefit of Moldovan citizens. In this respect, we expect immediate and urgent actions to be taken in the area of the prosecution of the banking fraud, the independence of the judicial system, the fight against high-level corruption, and the need to ensure that the next parliamentary elections are conducted in a free and fair manner. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen progress on the Moldovan side in addressing our main concerns.  The EU remains committed to the implementation of the Association Agreement with the Republic of Moldova, and it expects the same level of commitment from the Moldovan authorities.  The EU is also committed to continuing to provide substantial assistance to Moldovan citizens – I stress Moldovan citizens.

It'll be too late! Then, if the Socialist party wins, together with Mr. Dodon they will take the Republic of Moldova to the Eurasian Union. It is time to now support the citizens of the Republic of Moldova in their journey towards freedom, towards democracy, towards the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 225, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς (ECR).", "mepid": "125069", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to point out that my position with regard to Moldova is completely negative, and that is because Moldova has recognised Skopje as so-called 'Macedonia'.

We will continue following the implementation of the Association Agreement very closely, as well as the political developments in Georgia and, of course, in Moldova. Let me reiterate that we are fully committed to supporting Georgia’s reform efforts on its path to prosperity. A key focus will, of course, be sustaining growth. Georgia’s GDP is growing by a remarkable 5% per year and, of course, it’s about jobs. This will be done by actively providing support in the areas which require most attention and ensuring proper implementation through our continuous policy dialogue. May I say that in Georgia in particular, we are concentrating on, I think, three specific regional areas where we are trying to invest more in order to see and make a difference and to understand what it means to get support from the European Union. As for Moldova, the European Union remains committed to the implementation of the Association Agreement but it expects the same level of commitment from Moldova. I have listened very carefully to some statements concerning the fact that we have for the moment suspended financial support. But may I say, sometimes I have the feeling that people pretend to be pro—European, pro—Western, but in terms of how they act I can’t see the European values, the European commitment.  So in a way we have to take decisions if all our recommendations and advice, almost all of which comes not only from the European Union – the Commission, this Parliament – but also from the Venice Commission, have not been respected. Almost always quite the opposite was done and, in that respect, we have to take consequences, otherwise it’s about our own credibility.  But, once again, not to be misunderstood, we are also committed to continuing to provide substantial assistance to improve the lives of Moldovan citizens and we are ready to re—engage also with financial means, provided that the situation is changing.  First and foremost, our intention concerns ordinary citizens. They should not suffer from these developments, so be reassured that we will do everything to serve the interests of Moldovan citizens. It’s not about backing a specific political party or a specific government. No, it’s about taking care of ordinary citizens and improving their living conditions, which is, I think, the most important issue. So, when it comes to the next elections we will have a very close eye on the run-up to these elections because again, these elections must be free and fair, and the will of the voters has to be respected. I count on the further support of honourable Members to strengthen the relations with Georgia and Moldova, boosting cooperation as well as keeping up the momentum for reforms.

The concrete example of Georgia confirms that the EU is a good model for imitation, and the European perspective – no matter how near or far it can be – still exerts an important attraction. But let’s not make Georgia the hostage of its own success. As I have said before, Georgia still needs to solve many problems, and it needs to keep in mind the social dimension of policy change.

One thing is certain. Turning away from Moldova and strongly punishing the lack of progress, we will achieve only one thing: we will push the country towards Russia.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which We can say that the outrage over the deadly business of arms exports has never been as great and has never been as widespread as it is today in the face of the horrors in Yemen. Frigates, patrol ships, artillery tracking and bombs – mainly from Germany, France, and Spain – make life hell for children in Yemen. Perhaps, at this very moment, hospitals and school buses are again the targets of the murderous attacks. In addition to the US corporations, at the moment, those from Europe are supplying almost half of the war equipment to the areas of the Middle East. How can this be possible? After all, there is a set of rules prohibiting the supply of arms to crisis regions and countries where vile human rights violations are on the agenda. How can this be possible? After all, we have the common position with its eight criteria for controlling arms exports. How can it be that Saudi Arabia and the Arab Emirates get all the weapons from Europe that make the Yemen war possible and implement the naval blockade – this naval blockade, which is leading to the humanitarian catastrophe about which we are all informed? We have the common position, but it can only be really good if it is implemented. I do not believe that arms exports are necessary to guarantee the stability of states and regions. We do not all agree on this. Nor do we all agree on whether and how much the profits of the arms industry should be protected. It is wrong how the economic positive effects of the arms industry are also exaggerated with regard to jobs. However, even with all these differences of opinion, we should also remember one thing in common: anyone who refers to human rights, humanist values, peace and stability must strive for everything possible, so that the common position on the control of arms exports is effectively implemented. This includes a strong and common language to end the different interpretation and application of the criteria, and in particular the introduction of a sanction mechanism. Final control must be improved and licence production must not be misused to circumvent export control. Although we in my group are the sharpest critics of the new EU armament programmes and reject the defence fund, including the so-called peace facility, I welcome the fact that the report develops common ground in integrating programmes such as EDIDP and Co. into parliamentary control mechanisms. What is also new and pleasing is the extension of the criteria to the deployment of military and security personnel for training purposes and much more.

Arms exports are a national prerogative of course but through the years Member States have agreed that national policies should converge and that transparency should always be guaranteed.  Parliamentary scrutiny is essential to transparency and your work should also encourage national parliaments of Member States to play their role with regard to arms exports control. Channels for dialogue on arms export issues with this Parliament have developed considerably over the years, with the crucial engagement of NGOs, the academic world and the defence industry.  This is an important achievement and it shows that transparency and dialogue can take place without prejudice to the respective responsibilities of national stakeholders. At a time when we advocate further transparency worldwide, notably via the Arms Trade Treaty, it’s important to show there is no contradiction between transparency and national security. The EU framework governing arms exports mainly revolves around the EU Common Position on arms exports adopted in 2008. This framework is based on the national responsibility of EU Member States on arms exports licensing decisions together with well-developed information sharing between export control authorities of Member States. The EU Common Position has allowed the creation of common criteria for export control. This has led to increased convergence, increased transparency through obligatory public reporting and it has facilitated the exchange of information between the Member States’ export control agencies.  As the report by Ms Lösing recalls, the Common Position demands that all Member States publicly report on their arms exports. The risk assessment criteria laid down by the EU Common Position are comprehensive and far-reaching in terms of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, the risk of diversion and the impact on internal and regional stability. Their daily application by national licensing officers is supported by the so—called User’s Guide, which was revised in 2015 in order to align it with the Arms Trade Treaty.  The EU Common Position aims to promote responsible arms export policies and the convergence of national arms export policies. In support of these objectives, the Council and the European External Action Service have set up an information-sharing platform through the Council Working Party on Arms Exports and an IT platform enabling the exchange of information relevant for risk assessment, including details on licence denials.  As the report also notes, at the beginning of 2018 this Working Party on Arms Exports began work to reassess the implementation of the EU Common Position and the fulfilment of its objectives in accordance with the mandate given in the Council conclusions of July 2015 and this work is continuing to date.  We welcome that the report by Ms Lösing pays tribute to the work of the Working Party on Arms Exports in connection with cooperation, coordination and convergence.  Let me now briefly widen the picture of the EU’s cooperation and assistance on export control capacity development in third countries. A number of countries in our close neighbourhood, mainly in the eastern neighbourhood, have aligned with the criteria of the EU Common Position. To assist them in the daily operational implementation of the Common Position, the European Union has put in place a programme to fund technical cooperation. The latest phase covering 2018-2019 was approved by the Council in January 2018.  Secondly, let me stress once again how central the Arms Trade Treaty is to raising the standards that govern arms trade towards greater responsibility and transparency. One hundred and thirty states have signed the Treaty and 96 countries are state parties, including all 28 EU Member States. However, some of the largest arms exporters and importers, such as Russia, China, India and Pakistan have not signed or ratified it yet.  Our goal remains to make the Treaty even more universal. Last August the Fourth Conference of States Parties of the Arms Trade Treaty met in Tokyo, hosted and chaired by Japan. The conference discussed the effective implementation of the Treaty, including transparency in reporting and how to encourage further universalisation. Our work for the effective implementation and universalisation of the Arms Trade Treaty includes both financial support and diplomacy. In 2014-2016 a dedicated EU assistance programme with a budget of around EUR six million was active with 15 countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia.  A total of 113 countries participated in the activities organised in the programme’s framework, which focused on showcasing regional best practices, encouraging regional cooperation and strengthening regional arms control structures. A new EU outreach programme adopted last year extends our assistance to 18 roadmap countries and 14 ad hoc partners to strengthen their domestic capacities to implement the Treaty. We will continue to bring together dozens of other countries to share experiences on a regional level. This programme receives over EUR seven million in funding from the European Union and it benefits from the technical expertise of export control officials from EU Member States. In addition to these tangible actions on the ground all diplomatic opportunities are used to encourage more countries to join the Treaty, including by offering EU assistance where needed and requested. The arms trade is becoming more and more globalised so it’s every day more important to work for the globalisation of the Arms Trade Treaty. At the same time it’s our duty to lead by example when it comes to arms exports from the European Union and your report is an important contribution to this goal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 239, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Gilles Pargneaux", "mepid": "96948", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S and D. - Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make several comments on this report.

We heard Chancellor Merkel today sharing her vision of a European army. Now the question is, how can we get out of the often fragmented approach that we see in Europe today?  On arms exports, I would like to make three points. Firstly, countries need to share their interpretation of arms controls rules, because currently we see Member States failing to even make four submissions. Secondly, dual—use items, including hacking and surveillance technologies, are currently insufficiently controlled. Our House has adopted a very strong position already, which includes respect for human rights as an assessment criterion before granting a license, and we are waiting for the Council to take its position so that we can enter into trilogue before the end of our mandates here. My third point is that we have been crystal clear about ending exports of arms to Saudi Arabia. In fact, we voted for it in a majority four times already, and I want to echo our appeal to Member States again today to stop selling the very arms that are causing such extraordinary bloodshed in Yemen, and the humanitarian price that we see of that war is far too high for anyone in Europe to contribute to it. European companies combined represent the second largest market of arms, so making sure that this industry serves our political objectives and respects minimal ethical and international legal standards and values is essential for a common European credibility. Of course, we don’t have a magic wand to spread peace in the world – we would be happy to use it if we could – but at least what we need to do is act seriously to avoid the export of instability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 242, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Bodil Valero", "mepid": "124993", "text": "  Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to take Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr The common regulatory framework for the control of exports of military technology and armaments is binding on the Member States, but when you look at how it is applied, it is hard to believe that this is actually the case. For example, we must not issue export licences if there is a clear risk that the military technology or armaments to be exported may be used in the event of serious violations of international humanitarian law, nor if it can be used for internal repression, such as torture and other serious violations of human rights. However, that is exactly what is happening in both Yemen and Saudi Arabia, as we all know – in Yemen, blatant violations of international humanitarian law, and in Saudi Arabia, serious violations of human rights. The attacks on the port of Hodeidah have dramatic consequences for the population, which is already severely affected by cholera and famine. In Saudi Arabia, bloggers are imprisoned and journalists are murdered. The fact that the Member States continue to sell arms to Saudi Arabia means that we are complicit if we do not put an end to it. An EU embargo can put an end to all arms exports, not just new sales. That is why we in Parliament have so many times already called for an embargo, but the Member States seem to care more about jobs at home than people's suffering in other countries. According to our common rules, jobs are never the basis for arms exports. We have also asked in this House for the embargo to cover other countries in the Saudi-led coalition.

Arms sales to non—state actors are of particular concern and therefore the transparency of end—user certificates becomes paramount. Yemen is a political problem and peace will only come through dialogue between Yemeni factions, not through the response of international actors. The simple fact is that the international community has outsourced the Yemeni conflicts to the Saudi—UAE coalition. We rightly decry the humanitarian crisis in Yemen whilst ignoring the underlying issues. The UN Special Envoy is doing a good job, but he is constrained by the lack of options on the table due to so many groups being excluded from the talks. Let’s properly debate this, rather than this constant cheap—point scoring. If we are not prepared to intervene then surely we cannot deny material support to those who do so on our behalf.

Of course, the main responsibility for controlling arms exports lies with the countries from which exporters come.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. First of all, I am pleased that, within a manageable timeframe, we have managed to bring the cooperation of the European competition authorities within the framework of this European Competition Network here in Parliament, together with the Council and, of course, with strong commitment from the Commission, to put it into place. I believe that it is possible to say today, thanks in part to the work of the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur from the Committee on the Internal Market, Mrs Maydell, that we have managed to find a very round solution here which will take us an important step forward in the area of the application of European competition law. As you know, this is only the second legislative proposal that the European Commission has brought to the European Parliament in the field of competition law, and I believe that the House has been perfectly able to resolve the sometimes difficult balancing issues in European competition law in a sensible way. I am extremely grateful to all those involved, especially the shadow rapporteurs. However, I would also like to point out that the perception that in many areas of the classic internal market, to which I am now counting competition law and its application in a broader sense, we are not as far as one or other citizen, as one or other parliamentarian in the Member States might think, because we still have different principles of application in the technical and executive conduct of procedures. Here we have succeeded in taking an important step forward. I believe that this is a sign that the internal market is still alive and that we are ultimately able to achieve better results for businesses in Europe with uniform standards – better than can often be the case through different application of European law in different Member States' authorities. That is why it is right that we have taken this step, and that is why I believe that we should do it elsewhere and that, perhaps at a later stage, real unification should indeed be required, not only of the legal bases, but also of the procedures. However, it is true that we have, of course, made many improvements, not only in relation to the Commission proposal, but also in relation to the current legal situation, but there are still – albeit smaller – differences in the application of European competition law in the Member States. In the end, they were necessary in order to reach a consensus with the Council and the Member States. And it was good that the Member States took part in this. However, it is, of course, always tricky in the end in competition law when different procedures in different Member States are reflected in the procedure, because competition law thrives on the fact that we have a real level playing field in the European Union, in the European internal market, and this real level playing field is best demonstrated by the fact that equal law actually applies to everyone, and in all respects. One of the problems that has arising in the deliberations of this directive, which concerns not only European competition law, but also economic law in the European Union in its entirety, is that we have just repeatedly stated that, unfortunately, legal principles already laid down in European law in the broad sense have not been implemented in this way by the Member States, in so far as they themselves were responsible for implementing it. , that we could have been satisfied with this in a single European legal framework. That is why we have had to re-spell a whole series of general legal principles in this directive as well. We in the European Parliament hope that the Member States will now be able to cope with this rather second definition of European law in application and that we can rely on the Member States actually implementing the principle of 'equal rights for all' in competition law. This is an important step that we must take here.

As the rapporteur already mentioned, this is a key proposal to enable national competition authorities independently, with full resources, to make sure that consumers can have the full benefits of competition, because yes the directive may be to some degree technical but the idea is very simple: we want to make sure that consumers can have the benefits of competition, affordable prices, choice and innovation in the marketplace.  This proposal was made end May 2017. It was thoroughly prepared, after a long public consultation, between November 2015 and February 2016. So now we are at the end. The legislator – the Parliament and Council – has taken I think very worthwhile efforts to make this proposal a proposal that will work.  The thing is, and I hoped more people would know this, that we work on a daily basis with national competition authorities to enable the benefits of European competition law for every citizen in Europe. This is important because the national competition authorities are on the ground, they are in the national market, they know exactly what may be the problems in the construction industry, in retail, in the national markets, so that consumers are well served.  The thing is that enforcement is only as good as the tools at hand and here unfortunately it has turned out that, well, currently there are too many gaps and too many discrepancies in the tools of national competition authorities. That poses a problem, because it makes it obvious that in some Member State there is a risk of one way of doing things, in another Member State the risk of another way of doing things or illegal behaviour not being detected and consumers therefore suffering harm.  This is why this proposal is a good proposal and this is why I’m so grateful for the very constructive cooperation that we have had to enable this proposal. Companies will benefit from the ability to compete fairly within the single market and consumers will benefit from more efficient and even competition enforcement.  We have enabled a political agreement on this directive. You will soon vote and we will then have implemented the agreement that we reached in May this year.  I do agree with the rapporteur. This is a milestone. It is a milestone in the history of European competition law enforcement and following its transposition into national law, following its implementation, the national authorities will have the most necessary tools to stop and to sanction illegal behaviour that harms consumers. That, I think, is the important thing, because this is all about the citizen.

This is because the Directive will lead to better enforcement of competition rules in the Member States.

Although we like to talk about European competition law, we should always be mindful that, apart from some of the big cases that dominate the headlines, the actual work is not done by the Directorate-General for Competition, but by the national competition authorities in the Member States. In most years, for example, more than 85% of all decisions and decisions that apply EU antitrust law are adopted by national competition authorities. If we want competition law to be applied effectively in the sense of the social market economy, we therefore need strong national authorities that can do so. Today, we see major differences in the quality of national competition authorities. The range in the Member States ranges from powerful and independent authorities with several hundred employees to authorities with a handful of staff. There are also significant differences in the political independence of national competition authorities. We have competition authorities that can operate freely within their mandate, and we have competition authorities that are hanging on to the fringes of national policy. The length of the proceedings, the quality of the proceedings and the penal framework also vary considerably in the Member States of the European Union. The overall question is whether all national competition authorities are capable and willing to ensure effective enforcement of competition law. That is why it is right – and thank you very much to the rapporteur – that we can adopt common minimum standards today.

The constructive approach I experienced in the procedure guaranteed that the European Parliament’s position was representing most of our views and we could stand for it unanimously in the procedure of the trilogue. I am personally very happy that this report, based on my request, approved by one of the previous annual competition reports.  As shadow rapporteur and also on behalf of the Socialist and Democratic Group, let me underline some points which were key elements for us to be able to support the procedure. Namely, strengthening national competition authorities and granting them more effective investigation, decision-making and sanctioning tools, granting sufficient independence from political interference and also in the allocation of the budget, to find solutions to divergences in leniency programmes in different Member States, to keep the maximum amount of fines at least at 10%, and that fines will be calculated on global turnover and not on relevant turnover.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 270, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Jasenko Selimovic", "mepid": "134243", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, the EU competition rules and the national competition authorities which are able to enforce them are the cornerstone of the proper functioning of our single market. However, many breaches of the competition laws still do occur. Each year losses of about EUR 250 billion happen because of the undiscovered cartels. These cartels are not raising the prices by 5% or 10%; they are raising prices by up to 30% and this situation is of course unsustainable. Why is it happening? Because the national competition authorities cannot enforce the rules. Some of them do not have proper human, technical and financial resources, some do not have proper tools in order to detect competition law infringements. Not all of the authorities can impose fines and not all competition authorities interpret competition law in the same way. My colleague, Andreas Schwab, in his excellent report has proposed to solve these problems. He proposed to reinforce the impartiality of national competition authorities, to provide them with a greater budgetary autonomy, to allow them to carry out joint inspections and to harmonise somehow the level of fines against competition infringement in the EU. This report is aimed for better implementation of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Among the important compromises that have been included in this report, I would like to draw attention to three. Firstly, the establishment of a legal framework for proceedings against anti-competitive institutions or companies which allows those proceedings to be shortened and the prosecution of those illegal practices to be made more effective. Secondly, it is a question of creating the possibility of repealing the obligation to impose penalties where the institutions or firms concerned disclose the existence of a price conspiracy or other conspiracy which is intended to distort the fundamentals of competition. These leniency procedures, as we call them, are important for a more effective fight against competition violations. Thirdly, we are imposing a limit on the financial penalties that will be applied to anti-competitive companies, and I believe that this proposal that they should be equal to at least 10% of the value of annual turnover is correct.  Finally, however, I would like to say that we have a lot of work ahead of us when it comes to competition in the single market, particularly in terms of service trade.

Therefore, this text is crucial. Thanks go to the rapporteur and the negotiating team for achieving this outcome.  I particularly welcome that Parliament’s position on the level of fines, as well as the calculation base for the fines, on the global turnover of a company, was retained in the final agreement.

The fact that fragmentation in the national application of the rules treats anti-competitive actors differently from one country to another, and that it is also possible for cartels to escape fines simply by carrying out restructuring. It is therefore right and necessary that we demand more harmonisation in the enforcement of competition law and more harmonisation of the powers and resources of competition authorities. Our rapporteur, Andreas Schwab, has very clearly outlined the development that has been initiated here – a thank you for that. There are, in fact, four clear areas. Tomorrow, we will adopt a more coordinated leniency regime, which will encourage companies to present evidence of secret cartels, a deterrent penalty of up to 10% of total global turnover, better protection of consumers against illegal business practices and a response to the new distortions of competition that the digital age is bringing.

But I think the very clear message from Parliament is that we need higher fines in order to get a better deterrent, and if you do something illegal, it should be felt in the level of fines. Second, I think it was a very important compromise that we reached on exactly the question of a cooling-off period, because independence from political decision—makers is one thing, but also independence in your mind so that you avoid the revolving doors between business and the authorities is a very important point, which is why we focused on the decision-making parts of the competition authority, and I think these compromises are very balanced and very good.  Also, thank you very much for the very specific example of what the risk of a monopoly is, because sometimes people think ‘well, this is out of a textbook, what is this nonsense, it’s theory’. No, no it is real life. There is a very obvious risk when you have a monopoly that prices go up and you see it and people feel it. I want to thank you – because this is only enabled because there is a very strong cooperation with the rapporteur and a strong report – the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of course as such, but also all the shadow rapporteurs who have engaged very thoroughly in enabling the compromises that ended up with a political agreement.

Of course, this has been difficult, but we have a lot of things ahead of us still, because now comes the important point of transposing this directive into national legislation so that it becomes real life, and of course the Commission is fully dedicated to enabling the national legislative authorities to transpose this in a correct way.

Mr Vice-President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and for the work she has I can only return the thanks. I believe that we have actually managed to find really good compromises at many interfaces, and I would like to return to what colleagues have just said. I just believe – and this is perhaps something that still divides Mrs Lépez Bermejo and myself – although we have worked very well together – that, of course, the rights of defence of companies and the leniency scheme, even if they are perhaps a little difficult to understand at first glance, will ultimately bring more to citizens and consumers, because they will create transparency. , which the Commission or the competition authorities alone could not provide for.

All this can, of course, only be particularly successful if there is a good and constructive atmosphere in this European network of competition law. The European Commission is, of course, responsible for this. I believe, Commissioner, that you have done this very well over the last four years.

The question is what the calculation scale must be. In this respect, I still find it questionable from a legal point of view that we should take as its basis the overall world of a company, because the competence of the European Union is, of course, necessarily limited to the European legal framework. However, by the fact that the European Commission ends up denying this penalty with other antitrust authorities at international level, I think that the majority, which wanted to go in a different direction here, can certainly be followed. I therefore believe that, on the whole, we have found really viable compromises. It will now be a question of further examining the question for the Digital Single Market – which we did not do here in the end – to what extent interim measures are actually a possibility here.

To the proponents they present a new paradigm for the internet and watching-based value transfer systems that can overcome shortcomings inherent in systems of corresponding banking between intermediaries. They also offer enormous potential for simple and fast capital raising and the figures are quite impressive. Widely quoted estimates are that this year to date more than USD 21 billion was raised in over 900 initial coin offerings globally and this is more than three times the amount raised in 2017. Sceptics believe that crypto-assets and initial coin offerings are not serious, that they are vehicles for fraud and manipulation, tools for speculation, manipulation and money laundering. For the Commission, crypto-assets and initial coin offerings present most opportunities and risks.  It is still early days and the technology has a long way to go, but we believe that crypto-assets are here to stay. The underlying blockchain technology is very promising for our digital economy, which we should embrace and support.  Crypto-assets cannot be separated from blockchain technology. Blockchains, as opposed to much broader categories of distributed leisure technology, are chains of crypto-asset transactions. Pursuing the opportunities of blockchain implies that we take an interest in crypto-assets, both in terms of the advantages they offer but also to address risks they may present. The Commission was closely involved and fully subscribes to the Financial Stability Board’s assessment that, for the time being, crypto-assets do not pose a financial stability risk. This may however change if the market grows quickly. The market remains volatile and presents significant investor protection and market integrity risks. Warnings to investors about risks may not be sufficient. Rules of the road are necessary, not only to protect investors and increase market integrity but also to provide legal clarity and certainty for a legitimate crypto-asset ecosystem.  We have already expanded the scope of EU anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist finance legislation to crypto-asset exchanges and wallet providers through the recent fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.  The main question for financial regulators is whether crypto-assets are financial instruments and therefore covered by financial regulation. The second question is whether that regulation is suitable and addresses the risks while supporting and enabling the opportunities. There are no simple answers to these questions. Whether the current EU financial regulatory framework applies to crypto-assets on the one hand depends on the specific characteristics of each crypto-asset. On the other hand, it largely depends on how EU law is applied in national law and supervision. Financial regulation and definitions of financial instruments were developed before the age of crypto-assets and initial coin offerings. It is therefore often not clear whether they are covered or not, even if they present similar features to financial instruments. We are assessing this together with the European supervisory authorities, which are expected to present their conclusions by the end of the year. Without jumping to conclusions, the Commission notes that some Member States have already established that existing law is not applicable or that it is not suitable and they are developing sui generis frameworks. Other Member States consider that at least some crypto-assets fall within existing definitions of financial instruments, but even in these cases, applying existing growth raises complex, practical and enforcement questions. Crypto-assets that do not meet the definition of financial instruments, whether under EU or national law, also present investor protection and market integrity issues. So this legal twilight zone is not good for a single market, it’s not good for developing a potential new source of market-based finance and it’s not good for investor protection and market integrity. Following the conclusions of the European supervisory authorities’ legal mapping exercise, the Commission will assess the possible way forward.

If you look at how they are being used, it quickly becomes clear that they cannot deliver on the promise of a revolution. In view of the enormous price gains that Bitcoin &amp; Co. have had in the meantime, virtual currencies became interesting for many private investors as speculative objects. They were often held as a substitute for stocks, bonds or gold. Unlike other financial instruments, however, virtual currencies are completely unregulated. The markets for these currencies are opaque, volatile and prone to manipulation. Many investors have suffered a total loss because they have participated in windy initial coin offerings. This regulatory Wild West must be stopped. When private investors invest in virtual currencies, they should be able to be sure of a certain level of protection throughout the European Union. The good news is that, in principle, all the elements of sensible regulation already exist. We have consumer protection rules, we have provisions against market abuse, and we have already established transparency rules in other areas.

Nobel Prize winner Stiglitz warns: \"You can't have a payment method based on secrecy when you're trying to create a transparent financial system.\"  If we open a hole with a bitcoin, then all the harmful and illegal activities will go through that hole and no government should allow that, let alone the European Commission, Mr. Commissioner. Please regulate, regulate and do not leave this fragmentation that we are already seeing there in several Member States. Regulate and don't let these virtual currencies and so-called initial coin offerings, etc. be seen as an El Dorado. If they are true financial transactions, then they have to be treated as such and regulated as crowdfunding operations or capital increases. There is an urgent need for the Commission to prevent dangerous drifts such as the one we have seen in Malta and to produce European regulations that end the vacuum of crime and European governments must also urgently ensure that their FIU and other law enforcement have the technological and human means necessary to dismantle criminal applications of these dangerously deceptive technologies and to end the impunity of the criminals who exploit them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 292, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Tom Vandenkendelaere (PPE).", "mepid": "129164", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the temptation is great for investors. The Bitcoin, the Ether, the Litecoin, the Ripple, they all promise huge returns that you can never achieve with traditional savings products. But anyone who invests in Bitcoins and other virtual currencies, to date, gets into a roller coaster without seat belts to have.  As an investment, the risk is enormous: the price really goes all the way; there is no intervention from banks or countries; There are no rules, and there is no supervision.  If something goes wrong, like your digital wallet being hacked, you can't go anywhere. The need for action is an understatement. We all agree on that. In addition to the need for consumer protection, there is another adder: a potential jackpot combined with anonymity naturally attracts investors, but unfortunately also criminal organisations. Exact figures are missing, but according to rough estimates, it is more than 7 billion euros of criminal cryptocurrency annually. The key question with this is: can we make the link between the online user and the real identity behind these coins? With Bitcoin you can, but dash, for example, can't. We have to keep that in mind when we start regulating. Last question: who should regulate? Well, the players of this game are unfortunately not bound to our European borders alone. A G-20 initiative on a global framework for regulating and controlling virtual currencies is therefore necessary. But don't let that stop us, dear Commissioner.

These financial innovations open up opportunities for the speed and multiplicity of uses, but they also carry certain risks, including money laundering or fraud. The fifth anti-money laundering directive provides for several provisions on virtual currencies, but this is not enough and nothing has been thought for the tokens issued during the initial offers. It is therefore necessary to examine the world of crypto-assets as a whole, which includes, among others, tokens and virtual currencies. It is crucial not to leave a legal vacuum and a framework should be developed that can provide better security for investors as well as control tools in the hands of regulators. While their classification as a financial instrument may seem like an attractive option, it is necessary to measure all the implications and, in particular, the risk of applying unsuitable rules to this nascent sector.

That’s why, from the European Commission side, we also change the terminology and we’re no longer talking about cryptocurrencies, we’re talking about cryptoassets. Because, indeed, there is only one currency in the euro area and it’s the euro, so the rest is cryptoassets. Second, on the need also for international cooperation in this area. Cryptoassets and blockchains are a global phenomenon. As regards policy and regulation, to be effective it also needs to be internationally coordinated, so we need to do our homework here at EU level but also need to coordinate this work internationally. At the EU level, as I said, we need to complete our assessment of the applicability and suitability of existing rules and, together with European supervisory authorities, we intend to do so by the end of the year. Based on this assessment, then we need to look at what is the best way forward for risks to be confined and monitored, consumers and investors to be protected and innovation to be encouraged. In addressing legal uncertainty and risks for market integrity, investor and consumer protection or security requirements, we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. The underlying technologies which make cryptoassets work and spread have major potential across sectors. It is a new development, so we need to make an informed decision to find a right balance.

The regulatory framework and taxonomy were developed before the rise of crypto-assets and ICOs. The market for these products and services remains very volatile and carries significant risks in the area of investor protection and market integrity. Warning of these risks may not be enough. Rules are necessary to provide clarity and legal certainty for the crypto-ecosystem. Under the fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, the scope has already been extended to crypto-asset exchanges. This is a step in the right direction.

At the outset, let me state very clearly that I am here in my capacity as the Presidency and not to defend or comment on national decisions or standpoints. Migration is a global phenomenon requiring the engagement of the whole global community to deliver global responses. This debate and your intention to be present with a delegation of Members of Parliament at the intergovernmental conference in Marrakech, where the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration will be politically endorsed, demonstrate the importance you attach to this initiative. Since the first draft of the global compact was put on the table, Member States have engaged in extensive discussion on the document in the Council, during both the Bulgarian and the Austrian Presidency. Member States also actively engaged in a discussion in New York, where six rounds of intergovernmental negotiations were held on this document. Of course, the preparation of the global compact had started well before that, with the adoption of the new Declaration for Refugees and Migrants in September 2016. From then on, the EU actively engaged in providing input at the various stages of preparation of the first draft of the compact. Let me seize the opportunity to comment on the role of the UN High Commission on Refugees in the process of the debates in the Council. Representatives of this key partner body were invited to various Council meetings to ensure that Member States had the most up-to-date and complete information when debating the global compact, the final draft of which was the document put on the table in July. As you are aware, the Council does not have a common position on this text, which will be considered and handled by each Member State. The political endorsement of the global compact at the intergovernmental conference in Marrakech and the subsequent adoption of the document in New York at the UN General Assembly session in January will not be the final steps in the process. One of the crucial elements of our success in the field of migration is our good cooperation with third countries. I can assure you that the Council and the Presidency will continue to contribute to that purpose.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 302, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to join you today to discuss the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, in particular as we approach the final stage of the process – its adoption. In our globalised world, human mobility can only be addressed effectively by the international community as a whole. It is a global phenomenon that requires global solutions, a global response. No country can manage this alone, but together we can set up a humane, dignified and secure mechanism for governing human mobility. This is why the Commission strongly supports the Global Compacts and will be actively engaging in their follow—up. Over the past years, the European Union has built a comprehensive approach to address migration and forced displacement. Our approach has proved to be the right one and delivers results. All this was possible thanks to our common work inside the European Union, and to strong cooperation with our partners, in our region and also worldwide. Our approach is based on solidarity, shared responsibility, multilateralism and engagement. And this is exactly what the UN Global Compact for Migration is about, as the UN compact on refugees.  The Migration Compact is the result of two years of intensive consultations and negotiations at the UN level, involving governments and other actors. It is the first ever agreement at international level on migration. The commitment to work together to improve cooperation on international migration in order to make it safe, orderly and regular. We all know that the text is not perfect. As you know, ‘perfect’ is the enemy of good! As in any international negotiations, EU Member States had to make compromises with states from other regions in the world that have a different perspective on migration. But overall, we have good reasons to be satisfied with the Global Compact on Migration.  The final text of the GCM contains many actions that will help us firstly to improve the situation for migrants; secondly, to reduce irregular migration; thirdly, to address the drivers of migration, fight trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling, and manage borders and facilitate return and readmission.  Several misconceptions on the compacts have been floating around. I think we need to address them. First, the compact is not legally binding. It will not create any legal obligations for States. It is a menu of policy actions and best practices from which States may draw to implement their national migration policies. More than that, it is fully in line with the principle of national sovereignty and fully respects the sovereign right of States to determine their national migration policies. Second, the compact does not encourage migration, nor does it discourage it; what it aims at is that migration takes place in a safe and orderly manner. It contains no language to promote a ‘human right to migrate’, but it stresses the need to protect migrants’ human rights. Migration has been part of the human experience throughout history. It is our task to make it work for all. The compact as an international cooperative framework will usefully underpin our existing work with third countries and international organisations such as IOM and UNHCR. It will also serve as a platform for new partnerships. Europe is already at the forefront of migration and has a developed migration policy with high standards for migrants and refugees. The compacts will allow promoting the same standards outside the Union borders, thus improving international cooperation on migration in all its aspects. It will help to jointly turn migration from a European and national challenge into a shared one, and into an opportunity for human development, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We all supported the UN initiative to hold a high-level meeting on migration at the 2016 United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The unanimously adopted New York Declaration launched the work on the two Global Compacts, on refugees and on migration.  The EU took an early lead in the discussions on the Global Migration Compact and participated actively in the preparatory work. Our delegation in New York has been working closely with our Member States in order to ensure that the European Union’s priorities were reflected in the final text. We have done so together with the 27 Member States that have been actively negotiating and speaking with one voice.  This has allowed us to bring forward a Global Migration Compact that largely reflects European objectives and respects our key concerns. We therefore regret the decision by some EU Member States not to support the Global Compact on Migration. It is their national decision, which does not affect the position of the Commission.  The Commission will continue our work to improve migration management worldwide. This is what the EU acquis on migration and development leads to. We will notably continue our engagement with the IOM, which will lead on the implementation of and follow-up to the compact, which will entail sharing experiences, helping countries to overcome shortcomings and searching for solutions to a global issue.  We will also continue to support partnerships at bilateral, regional and global level in the area of migration. With our partners in the world, the Migration Compact will be an important basis for cooperation along with what has been agreed as the common EU approach to migration.

The document makes migration a positive phenomenon, blurs illegal economic migration with the issue of genuine refugees and legal migration, and makes illegal migration a fundamental right. The adoption of the package would therefore have irreversible consequences, due to the interpretation of the law and the development of customs, which are contrary to the interests of the European people. At the same time, they are contrary to the interests of the Third World, because they suggest false, unfulmountable promises of better prosperity, while many third countries will lose their working generations and this illusion will lead to more and more individual tragedies.  I consider it fortunate that, following Hungary, Austria and Bulgaria are also withdrawing from the process of adopting the package and that a number of other Member States are considering withdrawing from the migration pact, such as Estonia. I see that more and more people are realise that this is a document that is offensive to national interests and dangerous to our Europe.

In an age of globalization and increasing interconnectivity, not all human beings are equal in law and dignity in the face of mobility and migration.

They should therefore be concerned. If this pact is just a governance tool to block immigration from the south, it is a decoy. Detention must remain the exception, it is said. Evictions must be done in accordance with international law, without risk to life and without exposure to inhumane treatment, according to specific procedures that respect legality.

This global compact does entirely the opposite. Genuine migrants are people who have legitimately applied to migrate to another country from their own country under the immigration laws of the country to which they want to migrate. People who force their entry into a country are not migrants: they are illegal migrants. This compact wants to solve the problem of illegal immigration by making it legal, thereby encouraging even more immigration into Europe. It wants to decriminalise so-called humanitarian assistance to illegal migrants, so that aiding and abetting an illegal act will become legal. The whole process of illegal migrants gaining entry to a country and their processing will be made simpler and it will be made almost impossible to deport them. Not only that, if anyone is bold enough to criticise these policies it seeks to criminalise that dissent by means of so-called hate speech and xenophobia laws. This compact is a plan to increase the mass importation into Europe of millions upon millions of people from non-Christian cultures in Africa, the Middle East and beyond. It would eventually make Europeans minorities in their own lands and change Europe and its cultures into something else entirely.

As long as this common European asylum system arrives, we will do the right thing by supporting an initiative which calls on the Commission to take the necessary measures to provide this common European regulatory framework to the Member States, which allows them to cover the possibility, in an orderly manner, of opening the legal door that has been demanding on us for years the whole of non-governmental organisations , humanitarian associations, legal experts, bar associations and even churches, which ask the European Union to live up to its promise and to do something to overcome divorce, which is terrible and regrettable, among its promise, among the ambitions proclaimed in the letter of its Treaties — and particularly in the area of freedom, justice and security — and what has been its performance to date. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I am asking for support tomorrow for this legislative initiative which aims to open a legal avenue, a legal channel, through this humanitarian visa instrument for potential asylum seekers and persons required of humanitarian protection. That they can do it legally without losing their lives in their efforts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 339, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission has been carefully following the work on the report on European humanitarian visas, prepared by the rapporteur, Mr López Aguilar. We take note of the calls on the Commission to make a proposal on a European humanitarian visa by the end of March 2019. We also believe that in order to better manage migration comprehensively, we need to enhance legal and safe avenues to the EU for third-country nationals in need of international protection.  Increasing resettlement from Turkey or Niger is part of the solution to engaging with third countries and reducing irregular arrivals. At the same time, we believe that the greatest potential for reaching this common objective lies, at this point in time, in the swift adoption of the Union Resettlement Framework Regulation proposed by the Commission in July 2016. It will be the first legislative instrument of its kind to better coordinate Member States’ resettlement efforts, which until now have been the result of a combination of national or international programmes.  I commend the efforts of Parliament that have contributed greatly towards reaching a common position within the Council. But both co-legislators need to take the last steps to transform the preliminary agreement into the final adoption of the proposal. The Commission stands ready to provide all the support needed. We believe it is of utmost importance not to risk complicating the adoption of the Union Resettlement Framework Regulation, which now requires our full attention.

Mr President, this dossier on humanitarian visas is sadly representative of European developments on migration. Under pressure from the nationalists of the extreme right, European countries are dishonouring the values of hospitality, while our history, especially in the West, is nourished by movements of people fleeing poverty, persecution, pogroms and conflict. Fifty million Europeans migrated between the middle of the 19th century and the First World War, and this continued until the fall of the Berlin Wall. What about today? Europe hosts 6% of the world's refugees, or one refugee per 1,000 inhabitants. In Lebanon, refugees make up more than 25% of the population. And we are the ones who would welcome all the misery of the world? At least 37,000 people identified - and probably many more - have died in the Mediterranean. Most of them were asylum seekers. These people died due to a lack of regular routes due to a lack of humanitarian visas. Yes, I do! 90% of those granted international protection by states arrived irregularly, with the risks known. Resettlements, Commissioner, are not up to scratch, and that is not even the point. Some of those who govern us will one day be held accountable for their inadequacy in the face of this global refugee crisis. I would like to thank Mr. Lopez Aguilar for his tenacity.

The humanitarian visa framework is a good mechanism to reduce the death toll and combat smuggling, particularly since 90% of migrants enter Union territory through irregular means.

In 2015, I repeatedly visited both refugee camps in Greece and Italy, as well as on my way through the Balkans. It has been seen that the European Union cannot effectively recognise who has the right to asylum and who does not. After third-country nationals were allowed into the European Union, all those who had a so-called Syrian passport at the time, even though the Syrian passport may have been forged, were considered refugees.

There are not many ways to prevent deaths at sea or in the desert, but also to combat – because this seems to be the obsession of European governments – human traffickers, to destroy their business, as they say.

The shared objective is to lay down common provisions on procedures and to specify under what conditions each Member State must make the possibility of issuing a European humanitarian visa conditional on persons in need of protection. In this way, persons in need of protection may enter the territory of the Member State which issued the humanitarian visa for the sole purpose of submitting an application for international protection in that State.  It is currently estimated that 90 % of those who have obtained international protection have reached the Union illegally. In addition, the estimated cost of irregular crossings in terms of human lives has been at least 30 000 deaths at the Borders of the European Union since the beginning of 2000.

However, I believe that the financial burden resulting from such proceedings should be borne solely by the issuing States and by no means by the Union budget.

But I would like to add some consideration, because, first of all, I have heard objections which seek to dilute the evidence that, although some Member States have exemplary practices and legislation in this regard, others do not. And the important thing is that there is no European framework. There is no common European framework that can set out the possibility that, in consulates and embassies, humanitarian visas can be issued to allow such legal entry to those who are going to risk it anyway and lose everything in their efforts. Hannah Arendt, a memorable philosopher of the 20th century, spoke to us that it is as important as having rights or more the right to exercise rights. It's the right to have the right. And there is no point in a right to asylum if, in order to be able to exercise it on European territory , which recognises it in its Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and obviously does not recognise It to Europeans but to the desperate of third countries — they must risk their lives or lose it in the attempt. It's an unsustainable situation. We have denounced it many times and, worst of all, we have heard how we are denounced by all the partners who have been heard in this European Parliament for years: non-governmental organisations, legal professions, human rights activists. It's about time we answered. It's not true that it incentivizes the business of exploiting people. On the contrary, dismantle part of the so-called business model, part of the so-called \"business model\" of mafias. Because it offers some people, who will otherwise throw themselves into the arms of these illicit trafficking, an opportunity to try without risk and to submit to the humiliation or exploitation of such illicit trafficking that brutally and unscrupulously violates the fundamental rights of the most vulnerable: women and children. We have missed them so many times in our speeches in the European Parliament. It's about time we did something. And for that reason, I am particularly grateful for the voices I have heard from the People's Group, because they denies that the People's Group does not have a sensitivity to this issue — as I heard in the first shift from the Group, which concerns me — and I am grateful that we are able to live up to this long-oversighted challenge by building the majority needed to tell the Commission that it is time for it to incorporate into the puzzle of the without simplification, also this tool. The migratory fact is complex, insorcible, global. It's there to stay and none of the tools can be worth it alone. Resettlement is a valid programme, endorsed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, but has its subjective, quantitative and country of origin limitations. It is also a question of accompanying resettlement with this instrument, in addition to this approach, which we wanted holistic, that includes the so-called 'migratory event' in the countries of origin, in the transit countries and in the countries of destination. But above all, allow people who feel desperate, persecuted, with their security, their dignity and integrity threatened imminently, to approach a friendly window: that of delegations abroad of the European Union, knowing that the European Union lives up to its promise, its commitment to the fundamental rights of the most vulnerable people.

Humanitarian visas should only affect persons seeking international legal protection because of exposure to torture or other inhuman and degrading treatment. Humanitarian visas should be issued as a single sticker registered in the Visa Information System. They should allow holders to enter the territory of the Member State which issued them solely for the purpose of applying for international protection in that Member State. The issue of humanitarian visas may not automatically apply to family members of applicants. They may, after consideration, be subject to asylum policy with regard to the national rules of the Member States. I therefore consider it important that the future regulation carefully defines humanitarian visas and respects the separation of humanitarian visas from other asylum visas, which must continue to take into account the rules of the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 363, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Christine Revault d’Allonnes Bonnefoy (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124287", "text": "  In writing. If the Member States have given in to the populist rhetoric about refugees and if part of this Parliament rejects the inclusion of migrants in our societies, I will defend a completely different vision. These people are only seeking protection and a better life in times of war and conflict. But to do so, they risk their lives on the asylum route and in the Mediterranean and call on smugglers who are nothing but human traffickers. They risk exploitation, abuse and abuse. Everyone remembers the images of thirsty and hungry children in Libya. This situation is inhumane and absurd, because at this stage European law has no provision to remedy it. That is why I am calling for a European humanitarian visa that would allow migrants to travel safely and to fight definitively against the abject trafficking of smugglers who are enriched by the absence of legal channels. I call on all MEPs to vote on this report, in order to formally call on the Commission to legislate on this matter before March 2019.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 364, "date": "2018-11-13.json", "name": "Josef Weidenholzer (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "111014", "text": "  Writing. – With the important legislative own-initiative report, we call on the Commission, on the basis of Article 77(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), to submit a legislative proposal for a regulation on 'creating a European visa on humanitarian grounds' by 31 March 2019. The aim is to provide a legal basis for Member States to issue A European visa on humanitarian grounds to persons seeking international protection. Humanitarian visas are an important and long overdue addition. It should long have been possible to apply for international protection on the spot (e.g. at embassies). This is not romantic, but reasonable. In doing so, we are satisinuating our responsibility as legislators to find pragmatic solutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
