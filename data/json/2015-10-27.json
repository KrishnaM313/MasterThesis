Regulation (EC) No 531/2012 on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union (10788/2/2015 - C8-0294/2015 - 2013/0309(COD)) (Rapporteur: Pilar del Castillo Vera) (A8-0300/2015).", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Pilar del Castillo Vera", "mepid": "28390", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, Vice-President Ansip, ladies and gentlemen, the procedure on the Regulation of the Single Market in Telecommunications is coming to an end. After an intense period of negotiation with the Council, in which it must be said that Parliament has shown great determination, we have achieved the objectives we had set ourselves from the outset. First, the abolition of the oversteer that consumers face when accessing the internet or trying to communicate over the phone when they are outside their country. Secondly, we have managed to establish the necessary guarantees so that everything , I insist: everything – internet traffic is treated equally and that access to an open internet is done on an equal footing, thus ensuring neutral network behaviour. These two objectives are fully reflected in the agreement with the Council on 30 June and endorsed by most of the political groups that participated in the negotiations. As regards roaming costs, they will be abolished from June 2017 and, in addition, from April 2016 there will be a very significant reduction in costs, both in data and voice. It must be said that the disappearance of roaming costs is a long-awaited measure. Expected by all: by individuals, by small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and organisations of all kinds, which today can see in a tangible way that the European Union, the European project, has a clear added value. We have undoubtedly taken another step in removing internal barriers, in the free movement, in addition to people, towards a single digital market. As regards equality in internet access, I have to say that, with this agreement, Europe will be the only region in the world to ensure, by law, an open internet and net neutrality. The principle of net neutrality will be applied directly in all 28 Member States and will ensure that all traffic is treated equally, without discrimination, without restrictions or interference. The agreement reached further ensures that there will be no dual-track internet, prohibiting priority by payment one way or another. This is also, in my view, extraordinarily important. For this reason, where it is necessary to intervene in traffic management, such intervention may only occur where it is linked to the solution of temporary or exceptional congestion problems, to protect users from cyberattacks or in cases where there is an obligation, a resolution that so requires; and, moreover, when such management occurs—where necessary—it will have to be transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate. I would like to mention the various measures that have also been taken in relation to consumer protection in respect of all these provisions to which I mentioned. Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to the presidency of Latvia, during which the agreement was negotiated and closed, and to the current presidency of Luxembourg, which is now managing it; commission, which, for its part, has long made great efforts to achieve the objectives now achieved. Let me make a special mention to Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Kroes, Commissioner Oettinger and Vice-President Ansip, who in different times have helped make this moment a reality. I conclude by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs, and I do not forget the rapporteurs who are not here today, but who had those responsibilities in the last legislature. Everyone's effort has made it possible for us today to ensure an open, non-discriminatory internet and to take a step towards a connected Europe and a single market without digital customs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Andrus Ansip", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank everyone, and particularly rapporteur Pilar del Castillo Vera, for their hard work on this file. We have come a long way since the Commission proposed this legislation just over two years ago. It has been a bumpy road. I would like to thank this House, as it has only been possible to hold today’s landmark vote because of the European Parliament. In April 2014, Parliament showed that it can act decisively and quickly when the interests of the people, the open internet and the single market are at stake. Today, I invite Parliament to adopt this text on two key pillars in plenary so that consumers and businesses can benefit as soon as possible from common net neutrality rules and the abolition of roaming surcharges. They have been waiting a long time for this. Adopting the Telecommunications Single Market (TSM) Regulation will be a major achievement for the Digital Single Market. It will show Europeans that the Union can deliver tangible results. Failure, of course, would have an opposite and demoralising effect. Roaming surcharges will be significantly reduced from April next year and finally banned from 15 June 2017, subject to a fair use policy. This is a historic achievement, and we could not have done it without the leading role of Parliament. Many governments were initially reluctant until they heard the voice of their people and of the people’s representatives here. The package is faithful to Parliament’s first reading position: there is a clear end—date for roaming surcharges and clear steps to be taken beforehand. There is still a lot to do for the abolition of surcharges to be sustainable throughout the European Union. The wholesale roaming market has to be reviewed. The fair—use policies and sustainability mechanisms need to be defined. The Commission has started to work on this. We are committed to making the abolition of roaming surcharges a reality. There is no justification for any further delay. Adopting the TSM Regulation will enshrine binding net neutrality rules into EU law for the first time ever. The regulation will create the individual and enforceable right for end users to access and distribute internet content and services of their choice. The net neutrality provisions also lay down rules on non-discriminatory traffic management and on end—users’ free choice of content, applications and services. These provisions cannot be circumvented through commercial agreements and practices. Common rules on net neutrality mean that internet access providers cannot pick winners or losers on the internet or decide which content and services are available. They mean that the freedom of Europeans to access or distribute internet content will not depend on the country where they are resident. This will increase consumer choice and competition, and will strengthen the Digital Single Market. National authorities will be required to monitor market developments. They will have the powers and the obligation to assess traffic management and commercial practices and agreements, including pricing practices like zero rating. Since this is a regulation, the rules are directly enforceable before national courts. The rules also give the necessary certainty for internet access providers and providers of content and applications to offer specialised services with quality requirements. Adopting the TSM Regulation will help to sustain continued network and service innovation. That will benefit both European businesses and consumers. Let me turn now to radio spectrum. I welcomed Parliament’s efforts to include the spectrum provisions in our original TSM proposal. These could not be retained because of the lack of Council support at that stage. But the need to solve these issues remains, and I rely on Parliament’s continuous support in the future. We have already started working on our telecoms review and look forward to close cooperation with this House. We plan to present an ambitious proposal by the middle of next year. I therefore welcome the call for priority to be given to a coordinated framework for spectrum assignment to boost long-term infrastructure investments. Parliament now has the deal in its hands. It is a good deal, for Europe and Europeans. I urge Members to vote for it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Krišjānis Kariņš", "mepid": "96901", "text": "  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to thank the – Dear President, Commissioner, i would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent work. What is the European Union? Well, we all understand that it is meant that people, goods, services and money can move freely across the borders of the European Union. What is the reality so far? These principles did not always work, but especially when we travel abroad using our phones, we know that we pay dearly for so-called roaming. This house, the European Parliament, has argued for years that we need to abolish roaming charges. The industry has often stood in front of it. What we have achieved now is a lovely thing: it has finally been agreed between Parliament and the Member States of the Council of Europe that we will actually eliminate these roaming charges with June 2017. Consumers will benefit. But, importantly, there is no way that consumers get it and entrepreneurs lose. Entrepreneurs also benefit. Firstly, here is that we clearly and clearly anticipate the principles of net neutrality so as to be a safe investment environment for service providers. Secondly, by 2017, we will adjust wholesale prices. (Just a question, chairman, shall I repeat everything that I said?) In the European Union, we want free borders, but these borders have not always been free, especially when we travel abroad by telephone, we pay dearly for so-called roaming. Parliament has insisted for years that these roaming charges should be abolished. There has not always been a consensus with the Council to achieve this, but finally, in a number of years, we have achieved this, and roaming charges will be abolished in June 2017. Consumers will benefit from travelling abroad. There will be no need to pay anymore. But importantly, not only will consumers benefit, but businesses will also benefit. Companies will benefit, first of all, in such a way that we clearly anticipate what is the principle of net neutrality. This means a safe environment for service providers to invest in the future. Secondly, and it is very important that by June 2017 wholesale prices will also be regulated so that companies do not suffer losses in any country when providing this service to roaming customers, and local tariffs should not be raised to cover the arrivals of tourists. So this is really the case where the consumer wins, the companies win, the Council wins and Parliament wins.

That was our objective, as ambitious was the first reading, and I remember our shadow rapporteur, Catherine Trautmann, doing an excellent job.  I believe that the result we have achieved is very good. I think that we have built a step forward in integrating the telecommunications markets towards a single market with two points of reference: the interests of the citizen and the ability to innovate industries, businesses, their innovation and the competitiveness of the European system in this strategic sector.  As far as the citizen is concerned, I would just like to say one result, which our group has been pursuing for years and years: that of reducing roaming costs. Commissioner, Vice-President, I am addressing you: we will achieve the objective of having the fall in roaming come into force in 2017 if, however, the Commission immediately gets down to work on a review of the wholesale market. We will not accept excuses from this point of view. Do not say on the threshold of 2017 that the market review has not ended, because this is not possible. We know from now on that it is a pre-season, we work to overcome it. Secondly, net neutrality. Well, here we have reconciled the interests of the citizens and the need to grow the system. I want to make it clear – and it has already been said – that there is no legislative system in Europe that affirms these principles. Many people tell us about the United States, where there is a more advanced address. I would like to remind colleagues who always quote us from the United States that there is a decision there by a federal commission, not a legislative body, and therefore a decision that can always change. In Europe, on the other hand, we only have two states, the Netherlands and Slovenia, which have advanced legislation, the other 26 do not.  There are important legislative principles that affirm net neutrality. It is not a definition, but all the elements are there: no to discrimination, etc. But here too our laws are good and must be implemented. I would ask you to ensure that the national authorities take action to monitor, to monitor this system, to ensure that states have sanctions, otherwise our good principles will not be implemented.  There is one point for us that will have to be taken up again, which is that of zero rating, on which we will already be focusing the Commission. For the rest – spectre and other elements that you mentioned – we will be at your side, because these are objectives that we have been pursuing for a long time.  That is why I too believe, as you said, that this is an opportunity not to be missed.

Ending mobile roaming fees will be welcomed by millions of people.  Safeguards have been put in place to prevent excessive usage and to make sure that telecom operators are not forced to offer services at a loss. This is to make sure domestic customers will not subsidise customers who travel. To put it another way, when you travel across Europe, you can use your phone as though you were at home, but those who stay at home will not pick up an extra bill.  The deal also covers the common issue of internet packages not living up to the user’s expectation. Fixed-line customers will be entitled to clear information on the quality of services offered. They will be entitled to take action against their internet provider if the service does not match that which was advertised, for example if speeds are much slower than they expected. Telecoms regulators from across Europe’s 28 countries will agree a new set of guidelines on how broadband performance can be measured, compared and described.  The new rules do guarantee net neutrality. Users will be free to access content of their choice. It will not be blocked or slowed down. Access to start-up services will not be throttled or held back by a bigger company. There will be no two-speed Europe.

Mr President! When the ALDE Group presented a resolution in April 2013 saying that we should abolish roaming charges in Europe, we were met with great scepticism in this House and we were met with great excitement in the industry and some of the governments of some Member States. We were accused of wanting to break down the current telecommunications package, of making too much intervention in the market and of being illiberal in general – and how could a liberal group make such a proposal? At the same time, we were also told that now the internal market was not just about roaming charges.  Firstly, of course, there is to be the saying that if you want an internal market, you have to do some regulation so that we have a common game board. And what is absurd is that we have an internal market in a large number of areas in Europe, but the greatest growth potential we do not have a real internal market for today. That is why the aim of this is to create a single market for digital services, because the overall aim is to create growth and jobs in Europe. We are only doing this by reducing the cost of freedom of movement and by ensuring that we have a common game board in Europe.  I am proud and pleased that we have now agreed that we have a common game board when it comes to roaming, that we are getting rid of roaming charges. I'm also glad we're getting the first few years for an open internet. It should be remembered that if this agreement falls, then there is nothing in Europe. We would have liked us to be able to move forward and want something more, but this is the first step towards creating a single market that guarantees consumer rights and also ensures a high level of consumer protection. This is a huge step forward for Europe, both for citizens and for businesses, and not least for the basis for increasing growth and employment in one of the biggest potential growth areas we have in the coming years, namely the Digital Single Market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Marisa Matias.", "mepid": "96820", "text": "   – Mr President, I do not in any way want to make any of the efforts made by the rapporteur in this negotiation, but no, it is not true, we have not achieved the objectives we have wanted since we started this process.

Announced—if the end of roaming and now we have a promise for 2017. I hope that this promise will not be as flawed as the one that was feit in 2014, on the campaign trail. The neutrality of the Internet has been announced, but what we have achieved is an ambiguous agreement and there are no rights guaranteed with ambiguities.  We have received emails from many european citizens concerned about ensuring internet neutrality. The Internet, despite being recent in historical terms is already a world heritage site. Even before UNESCO has declared it, it will do so without a doubt, sooner or later. Therefore, we can say that attacks on the free, universal and neutral Internet are attacks on the common heritage of humanity. They are, more or less, like the attacks on Palmyra, but in a modern version, and that is why all fundamentalisms become so similar. It is that the fanatics of the market and the privatisation of common goods are also the destroyers of the economy and developed societies.  In this sense, we table amendments to this Plenary to clarify the regulation and to ensure that internet neutrality is indeed a guarantee for the whole of the European Union.

Democracy thrives on being able to talk to each other.  That is why we have freedom of the press, that is why we have created freedom of expression.  The Internet – a neutral Internet – is the most important infrastructure of democracy for the future. If we undermine net neutrality, we will also damage our democracy. Net neutrality is not an issue that can be considered gradually. The net is neutral and the same for everyone or it is not. What we are deciding today – with the majority of conservatives, many social democrats, and liberal right-wing conservatives – is an end to net neutrality, and thus a loss to democracy. Nor is it an advantage for the economy, as is always argued here. Because in a neutral network, small companies can challenge the big corporations. When neutrality is abolished, we concrete the great, the powerful, for all time. That is what is happening here.

Instead, we have succumbed in the negotiations not only to the abolition of delayed and conditional roaming, but also to the fact that telecoms will be able to pass on the lost profits to the majority of Europeans, even those who do not even know what roaming is, those who cannot use it because they are unable to travel abroad, who are increasingly numerous on a continent suffering from the crisis. Yes, colleagues, it could have been a great day! Instead, we have traded a far-reaching abolition of roaming with the lack of a certain and incontrovertible definition of net neutrality, with insidious repercussions on those who may not use roaming, but use the Internet in their own country and often use it every day.

Parliament would have liked to have seen a faster timetable, but it is quite right that a time-out was introduced in order to combine that wholesale pricer with this solution.

Does this text open obvious loopholes that would contravene the principle of net neutrality? I don't think so, although we can still estimate writing ex abstracto a clearer text.

That is why it is important and a step forward with this package, because now we are clarifying that we need a European telecom market. We are taking away some of the hindrances, but we need to do more. One of the things we need to do more is more spectrum, and I think it is important to go ahead and open up the 700 megahertz band, because that will be a precondition for Europe to have the best capacities and higher speeds. To those who are advocating some sort of doctrinaire net neutrality, I would say that in reality you are hindering and blocking the emergence of new services, because you say that different services are not to be allowed to have different preconditions.

The affirmation of the principle of net neutrality and the definitive abolition of roaming charges are two important results.

It is a very important achievement for both the European Union and European citizens, but much more so for society, because there has really been a great distortion here and in this way we are actually restoring an injustice that has existed for so many years.  But another important chapter that should concern the European Union – and I take this opportunity to mention it – is the issue of the Internet. There are countries in the European Union that are isolated and island-based, such as Cyprus, Malta and possibly other regions of the European Union that pay high Internet costs. It is essentially exploited by telecommunications companies, and I believe that my intervention will also take it seriously and regulate it so that there can be tolerable costs for the use of the Internet. My proposal is that in small countries such as Cyprus, Malta and other island regions there should be a \"free wifi zone\", free use of the Internet. And it is a great challenge for small countries to start the European Union, with its support, to implement the free free use of the Internet.

The other aspect is net neutrality, of course, with the management of the data flow, which could also pose some problems in relation to the concept of emergency threat, which naturally risks reopening the possibility of a two-speed internet. Zero-rate practices should be banned. And to that end, I propose to you, to be clear and to avoid a lack of precision that could weaken net neutrality, to support a series of amendments: Amendments 2, 4-9 and 11-23, which could in any case clarify the shadows and guarantee European citizens the best protection, which is still the aim of this text in globo.

In this context, the single European electronic communications market plays a key role in Europe's transition to the new digital age.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is On Sunday, at the invitation of President Juncker, I attended the meeting of Heads of Government on the flow of refugees on the Western Balkans route in Brussels. As I explained to the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, given the drama, I thought it appropriate and justified that Mr Juncker convened all the parties in Brussels to jointly take much-needed operational decisions and to take practical steps. President Tusk and Myself accepted the invitation and attended this meeting.  But, without prejudice to these meetings, we too, and particularly within the framework of the Community institutions, must try to find sustainable responses to the refugee crisis. That is why it is right and important that the results of the various meetings should be debated in full today. Ladies and gentlemen, on Sunday, if I may say so, it became relatively brutally apparent that the situation in the Western Balkans is extremely worrying, including politically.  Tens of thousands are fleeing via this Balkan route towards Western Europe. They have no roof over their heads, they freeze, they starve, sometimes endure for days in the rain or cross our external and internal borders in the middle of the night. Jean-Claude Juncker has called it a humanitarian disaster with the imminent onset of winter. I therefore believe that the 17-point plan adopted the day before yesterday in the early hours of the morning is a good step that must be implemented quickly and must be followed by many more. Nevertheless, like all the other parties involved, I left the previous meeting with deep concern.  The atmosphere at this meeting was partly ghostly. The biggest problem, even after this meeting, remains that commitments are made there, which are subsequently not honoured. If governments, whether right-wing governments or left-wing governments, consider national egoisms to be more important than community solutions, then there are two victims: refugees and cohesion in the European Union.

The crisis, or rather challenge, that we, all of us, as a community, as the European Union, are facing now is perhaps the biggest challenge we have seen for decades. I have no doubt that this challenge has the potential to change the European Union we have built. It has the potential even to destroy achievements such as border-free travel between Schengen countries. What is even more dangerous, it has the potential to create tectonic changes in the European political landscape. And these are not changes for the better. These are truly extraordinary times that require extraordinary measures, extraordinary sacrifices and extraordinary solidarity. To me, as President of the European Council, and I believe to most of us, it is paramount to ensure the unity of our Member States and our European institutions. Together, we will handle this crisis. Otherwise, I do not want to think of the alternative. From the very outset of this crisis, I have underlined the importance of protecting our external borders. We do not yet have an agreement on how to do it in operational terms but at least leaders share the view that our priority must be to protect the EU’s external borders. Unfortunately, the situation will get even worse, as I warned this Chamber in my last intervention. I mean, for example, the new wave of refugees from Aleppo and the region of the Russian bombing attacks in Syria: more than 100 000 new refugees in a few days.  During the last European Council, leaders gave a cautious welcome to the work of the Commission on a deal with Turkey on migration. Here, let me personally thank First Vice-President Timmermans who is working hard on the technical details. Let me stress again that a deal with Turkey only makes sense if it helps stem the migratory flows to Europe. This cooperation will not be easy. We should have no illusion that any third country, including Turkey, can replace us in protecting our borders. Second, leaders took stock of work to make eleven hotspots in Greece and Italy fully operational by the end of November. This deadline is ambitious and requires a significant acceleration of manpower and assets to Frontex, and the European Asylum Support Office. For now, the European agencies have less than half of what they need. When it comes to the role of hotspots, we have started an honest debate on how they should function. This is still work in progress. Third, we discussed at length how to protect our borders. We must end at once this completely unnecessary argument between the proponents of protecting external borders and the advocates of solidarity and openness. We need both. We need to restore effective external border control to start managing the situation on our borders. This has to include stopping the illegal crossings of our borders, registration of all asylum-seekers, and organisation of appropriate reception facilities. This will not in itself stop the flow, but it will reduce it significantly.  In this regard, the European Council agreed that Frontex will be developed beyond its current mandate. It will be able to intervene in border crises faster and more assertively and it will take a lead in the return of irregular migrants. We need Parliament’s help to do this as quickly as possible. The aim is to equip Frontex with the tools it needs to fully protect European borders. I would like to commend the impressive work already done by the Members on financing for both Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office.  In parallel, we will need to work on how to develop further our internal solidarity between Member States. A very first step is to provide Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office with all the resources they need, as well as implementing the temporary relocation mechanism to alleviate the burden from those of our Member States most affected. This crisis does not just concern Syrian refugees. Two weeks from now I will convene a summit of European and African leaders in Valletta. With the help of our African counterparts, it is our goal that this summit will help to forge a real Euro-African partnership on the migration issue. The European Council decided that we want to achieve concrete operational measures, in a fair and balanced manner, on effective return and readmission, dismantling of criminal networks and prevention of illegal migration, accompanied by real efforts to tackle the root causes and to support African socio—economic development, together with a commitment concerning continued possibilities for legal migration. We will aim at exploring possibilities for developing safe and sustainable reception capacities in the affected regions and providing lasting prospects and appropriate procedures for refugees and their families, including through access to education and jobs, until return to their country of origin is possible. Finally, we will ask Member States to further contribute to the efforts made to support UNHCR, the World Food Programme and other agencies, as well as to support the EU’s Regional Trust Fund responding to the Syrian crisis and the EU Trust Fund for Africa. Finally, on Britain: I briefed leaders on the preparatory discussions between my officials and the UK over the last months. We welcomed Prime Minister Cameron’s commitment to set out the UK’s specific concerns in writing by early November.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 71, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Präsident der Kommission. – Sehr verehrter Herr Präsident, Herr Präsident des Europäischen Rates, meine Damen und Herren Abgeordnete, liebe Kollegen! Last week along the Western Balkans route we saw refugees wading through freezing rivers. We saw them sleeping in the rain and mud. Soon this will be snow and ice. Winter is approaching and every day counts. Das ist genau die Ursache, Herr Präsident, wieso und weshalb ich im Einvernehmen mit Ratspräsident Tusk für letzten Sonntag einige europäische Mitgliedsstaaten und drei Staaten, die noch nicht Mitglieder der Europäischen Union sind, zu einem Sondertreffen betreffend die Westbalkanroute nach Brüssel eingeladen habe. Es haben an dieser Sitzung acht Staats- und Regierungschefs, Mitglieder der Europäischen Union, teilgenommen, plus der luxemburgische Migrationsminister, Herr Asselborn, und der niederländische Migrationsminister als Vertreter der zukünftigen Ratspräsidentschaft. Außerdem hatte ich zu dem Treffen eingeladen: Ratspräsident Tusk und auch Parlamentspräsident Schulz, weil es mir darauf ankommt, deutlich zu machen, dass diese Flüchtlingskrise nicht nur die betroffenen Westbalkanstaaten angeht, sondern auch die Europäischen Institutionen inklusive des Europäischen Parlaments, dessen Mithilfe wir ja dringend brauchen, was die budgetären  Auswirkungen der getroffenen Vereinbarungen des Europäischen Rats und dieser Westbalkan-Gruppe anbelangt.  Ich möchte hier noch einmal zum Ausdruck bringen, wie dankbar ich bin, dass das Europäische Parlament allen Vorschlägen der Europäischen Kommission in Rekordzeit gefolgt ist und die Europäische Union ermächtigt und befähigt hat, die haushaltspolitischen Beschlüsse tatkräftig umzusetzen.  Außerdem hatte ich den Hochkommissar für Flüchtlingsfragen, meinen Freund António Guterres, plus Frontex und EASO, zu diesem Treffen eingeladen, dazu Albanien, Fyrom und Serbien, weil diese drei Staaten, die sich an der Peripherie der Europäischen Union befinden, in besonderem Maße von den Flüchtlingsbewegungen betroffen sind.  Die Kommission hat diese Initiative ergriffen, mit diesen Westbalkanstaaten und mit einigen Zielländern der Flüchtlingsbewegung, weil die Kommission mit beiden Füßen im operativen Geschäft steht und tagtäglich dafür sorgen muss, dass die Erwartungen, die Wünsche der Mitgliedstaaten und im Übrigen auch der Flüchtlinge möglichst zeitgerecht erfüllt werden können. Eigentlich hätte es dieses Treffens nicht bedürfen müssen. Eigentlich müsste der Normalfall doch der sein, dass die Westbalkanstaaten, statt übereinander zu reden, miteinander reden. Zum ersten Mal war es möglich, diejenigen, die übereinander reden und nicht miteinander reden, um einen Tisch herum zu versammeln und sie zu bitten – und das habe ich gemacht –, offen und ehrlich die bestehenden Probleme generell, regional und auch bilateral anzusprechen. Diesem Wunsch wurde in fast übertriebener Form Genüge getan. Was wiederum den Eindruck nach außen hin verschaffen konnte, weil es ja auch dauernd Zwischenmeldungen aus diesen Sitzungen gibt, als ob wir es mit einem Zerwürfnis und einer endgültigen Spaltung der Europäischen Union in zwei und mehrere Teilte zu tun hätten. Der Normalfall ist, dass wir miteinander reden. Es ist nicht einmal ein Ausnahmefall, es ist ein „Nichtfall“, dass Mitgliedstaaten der Europäischen Union untereinander nicht über gemeinsame Probleme reden, und dass es eines Sondertreffens bedurfte, zeigt, dass die Europäische Union in keinem guten Zustand ist, denn das, was wir am Sonntag in die Wege geleitet haben, hätte spontan von den betroffenen Mitgliedsaaten in die Wege geleitet werden müssen.  Die Aussprache war eine offene, ehrliche – teilweise anstrengende Aussprache – und nicht jedes Gespräch und nicht jede Wortmeldung entspricht der Qualifizierung eines Dialogbeitrags. Aber es ist uns in dieser Runde gelungen deutlich zu machen, in diesem Format – besondere Umstände verlangen besondere Formate – dass wir nur gemeinsam mit dieser Problematik zu Rande kommen. Deshalb bin ich allen Teilnehmern dankbar, dass sie sich insofern zusammengerauft haben, als es wirklich darauf ankam, deutlich zu machen, dass man Europa nicht gegeneinander aufbauen kann, sondern dass man Europa nur miteinander aufbauen kann. Sunday was not a day for big political statements. It was a day to roll up our sleeves and agree on pragmatic operational measures that can be implemented immediately. Leaders committed to addressing three main challenges. Point number one: they committed to providing immediate shelter for all arriving refugees so that they are not left outside in sub-zero temperatures. They committed to providing food, healthcare, water, sanitation, including by relying on the EU civil protection mechanism where necessary.  As a very concrete follow—up, yesterday Croatia activated the civil protection mechanism, asking for winter tents, beds, emergency blankets and electric heaters. I would expect Member States to contribute to this European solidarity mechanism to provide Croatia with the necessary assistance for those in need. Leaders also committed to increasing reception capacities for refugees by 100 000 places overall in Greece and the Western Balkans. I would like to commend Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras for agreeing to create 30 000 places by the end of the year and, with the help of the UNHCR, places for another 20 000 people. I am grateful to António Guterres, who will ensure the UNHCR lends its full support to these efforts to increase reception capacities by a further 50 000 along the Western Balkans route.  Secondly, leaders committed to managing migration flows together. We need to slow down the uncontrolled flow of people. This means registering people when they enter the European Union. This also means informing refugees about the existing routes and the consequences of their refusal to be registered. I have to say: no registration, no rights. It is as simple as that and refugees have to know this because of course refugees have rights, and I will always defend this right, but refugees coming to Europe have obligations too. (Applause) Managing the migration flows together also means sharing information. Last week we saw countries waving through refugees from one country to the other. We saw fingers being pointed at each other and we saw countries talking about, but not with, each other. That is the politics of panic. It gives the illusion of a solution, while all it does is harm your neighbours and damage European solidarity. We are putting an end to all beggar—thy—neighbour policies. Instead, countries shall help their neighbours by telling each other what they are doing, exchanging information on migration flows and humanitarian capacities available. How many refugees are on their way? Where are they crossing the border? Where are they going? How many tents or blankets are currently being used and how can they be put at the disposal of the neighbour who needs them most?  It is quite astonishing that we had to undertake a huge effort to convince some of our Member States to inform other of our Member States about the refugee flows heading to the borders. For someone who is inspired by basic common sense, it seems surprising that we have to convene a meeting to ask Member States to inform each other about refugee movements. That again shows that the European Union is not in good shape. We need to share the answer to simple questions like those I mentioned. Yesterday, all countries who attended Sunday’s meeting appointed national contact points so we can instantly share information. The Commission will monitor the implementation on a weekly basis and will hold the first conference call already this week on Thursday. Thirdly, leaders agreed to strengthen border management. To protect Schengen we agreed to strengthen the external EU border, in particular between Greece, Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (fYROM) and Albania. By the end of this week, 400 additional police officers will be deployed in Slovenia – this week. Frontex will assist Greece in registration of refugees and migrants.  Countries will step up efforts to return migrants who do not need protection. To this end, the Commission stands ready to work on readmission agreements with relevant countries where we do not yet have any in place, while continuing our work to improve the workings of admissions agreements in place, such as the one with Pakistan, for example.  Un autre élément qui m'a beaucoup impressionné, tout en en ayant connaissance avant d'entrer en salle, fut la discussion sur le point suivant: pratiquement tous les États membres, sans exception, ont attiré l'attention collective sur l'énorme coût de la politique que les États membres doivent mettre en place pour faire face à la crise des réfugiés. Je les comprends parfaitement. C'est la raison pour laquelle, en date du 15 octobre, la Commission, que j'ai l'honneur de présider, a fait savoir aux États membres que lorsqu'il s'agit de qualifier les dépenses budgétaires qui sont affectées à la crise des réfugiés, nous allons appliquer – lorsqu'il s'agit de l'interprétation du pacte de stabilité et de croissance – les règles révisées, les règles d'application du pacte de stabilité, tel que la Commission, en ajoutant une dose de flexibilité à l'interprétation de ces règles, le prévoit.  Nous sommes en face d'un problème d'une exceptionnelle gravité. Alors, je peux dire – et je peux le dire partout, et je peux le chanter sur tous les toits d'Europe –, le pacte est le pacte. Le pacte n'est pas le pacte au sens ancien du terme, dès lors qu'il s'agit de mettre tous nos efforts au service d'une politique communément agréée. Et donc, en fonction d'une analyse pays par pays, nous allons voir dans quelle mesure il doit être tenu compte, plus qu'auparavant, du coût entraîné par la politique relative aux réfugiés. Nous allons donc appliquer le pacte tel qu'il a été modifié par la Commission, mais nous allons le faire sur la base d'une analyse pays par pays. Il y a des pays, y compris parmi les grands, qui ne font pas un effort suffisant. Si un pays fait un effort extraordinaire, il doit y avoir une interprétation conforme à cet effort extraordinaire. Les pays qui ne font pas d'efforts supplémentaires, qui n'arrivent pas à prouver qu'ils sont gravement affectés par le coût entraîné par la politique dont je parle ne verront pas s'appliquer une interprétation plus flexible du pacte. Qui veut une interprétation plus flexible du pacte doit d'abord montrer qu'il dispose du sens des responsabilités nécessaire.  Et puis, mes chers collègues, il faut savoir que le budget de l'Union européenne est limité. Ses ressources sont limitées, ses possibilités de flexibilité sont limitées, et nous arrivons aux confins extrêmes de nos possibilités budgétaires. La Commission a tout fait pour faire en sorte que tous les moyens budgétaires disponibles soient réunis dans un même élan et un même effort. Mais le budget européen est trop exigu pour pouvoir faire face seul aux problèmes auxquels nous sommes confrontés, et j'inviterais donc les États membres, votre Parlement bien sûr et la Banque européenne d'investissement à réfléchir à des chemins et voies de financement supplémentaires, dont nous avons besoin pour pouvoir faire face à la crise. À situation exceptionnelle, financement exceptionnel, et nous allons travailler au cours des semaines à venir à ce sujet. Sunday was a day of unity. For the first time, the leaders of the Western Balkans sat together around the table and discussed the problems they are facing. They agreed on a series of concrete and operational actions to better manage the situation. These measures come in addition to those we discussed at the European Council on 15 October. President Tusk has mentioned all the decisions which were taken that day.  On 15 October – and in line with what I have said in this House – I had one objective, namely to lead Member States back to the promises they made on 23 September at the previous European Council. There has not been enough progress and, in some cases, not enough by far. We need progress in two areas in particular. First, we need to speed up – as I mentioned – operational measures to get the hotspots and relocation working. Relocation is not working in the best way possible. Second, we need budgetary support. I made it clear before this House, and again before the European Council, that Member States need to do more and act faster to keep the promises made on 23 September. This is essential. This is crucially essential if we want the operational decisions to be implemented. At the Council, Member States told me they would stand by their promises, and we have seen updated pledges from some. But the Member States are still moving slowly at a time when they should be running. They are moving slowly. They should start to run. In September, Member States promised to send experts and reinforce our agencies. We urgently need the experts for the agencies to help register refugees, take fingerprints and help refugees in hotspot areas. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) asked for 374 experts. As of yesterday, 20 Member States had offered 145 experts, but we still need 229 more. There is also progress on border guards for Frontex. Frontex asked for 775 experts and so far has received offers of 326. This is good, but it is far from being good enough. We need more. On relocation too, things are moving, but they are not moving fast enough. Member States need to do as they promised: nominate national contact points, send liaison officers to Italy and Greece and notify their reception capacity. 25 Member States out of 26 obliged to do so have now appointed national contact points, eight Member States have appointed liaison officers for Italy, and only three Member States for Greece. Nine Member States have let us know that they can soon relocate at least 700 people. But let us not forget that we have made a decision to relocate 160 000 refugees in need of international protection. The gap between pledges and what is on the table must be reduced, otherwise we will lose all credibility. (Applause) Il y a trois semaines, nous avons décidé de mettre à la disposition des politiques en cours et à venir tous les moyens budgétaires dont l'Union européenne dispose. Le budget communautaire a été pleinement utilisé.  Nous allons consacrer dans le budget européen – nous, Commission, mais c'est l'argent des États membres et l'argent des citoyens – 10 milliards d'euros à la résolution de la crise des réfugiés en 2015 et 2016. Nous avons fait passer de 4,2 milliards à 10 milliards les montants que nous allons consacrer à cette politique, à mes yeux, essentielle. Le 23 septembre, les États membres ont promis de combler les lacunes qui existaient, mais il nous manque toujours, en termes de contributions bilatérales nationales, 2,3 milliards d'euros parce que les États membres, jusqu'à ce jour, nous ont fait savoir qu'ils seraient à même de mettre à notre disposition 486 millions. Il y a donc une lacune énorme, pratiquement la même qui existait il y a un mois, de 2,3 milliards d'euros. Nous devons donc faire mieux, parce que nous risquons de ne pas être à la hauteur.  Nous aurons en novembre – Donald Tusk vient d'y faire référence – un sommet avec les pays africains. Nous le voulions parce que nous pensons que le problème des réfugiés n'est pas seulement européen. Il ne faut pas croire que d'un côté, il y aurait le monde et de l'autre, l'Europe. Je considère qu'il y a l'Europe dans le monde, et nous devons donc agir de concert avec nos amis africains. Mais je ne voudrais pas arriver à La Valette avec des promesses non tenues. Comment pouvons-nous engager un dialogue sérieux et responsable avec nos cousins africains si, nous-mêmes, nous ne sommes pas en mesure de répondre convenablement aux promesses que nous leur avons faites? Il s'agit donc, d'ici La Valette, de faire en sorte que nous soyons au rendez-vous les poches remplies non seulement de promesses, mais aussi d'engagements tenus. (Applaudissements) Herr Präsident! Ich würde gerne – weil ich dabei bin, meine Zeit zu überschreiten, aber das kennen Sie – ein Wort zur Türkei sagen. Wir sind dabei, ein gemeinsames Aktionsprogramm mit der Türkei zu vereinbaren. Die Vorschläge, die die Kommission diesbezüglich vorgelegt hat, wurden vom Europäischen Rat unter Leitung von Donald Tusk nicht nur intensiv studiert, sondern auch positiv begleitet. Der Erste Vizepräsident, Frans Timmermans, hat in direkten, auch nächtlichen Verhandlungen mit der Türkei die Dinge in Bewegung gebracht. Ich möchte ihm sehr herzlich für seine Anstrengungen, für seine inzwischen auch erfolgsgekrönten Anstrengungen, danken. Er macht das sehr gut, wie sich auch der für Flüchtlingsfragen zuständige Kommissar Dimitris Avramopoulos sehr engagiert und sich auch in den betroffenen Ländern für die Lösung dieser Flüchtlingsfragen einsetzt. Deshalb braucht es auch keine feierlichen Appelle aus Bayern und von sonstwo, dass der Kommissionspräsident jetzt endlich die Dinge in die Hand nehmen soll. Ich tue sonst nichts. Wenn andere so aktiv wären bei der Bekämpfung der Flüchtlingskrise, wie die Kommission es in täglichem und nächtlichem Einsatz ist, dann wären wir sehr viel weiter. Die Kommission verdient – ich sage das – keine Kritik in diesem Zusammenhang! (Beifall) Wir müssen, sehr verehrte Kollegen, mit der Türkei an der Umsetzung dieses gemeinsamen Aktionsplans arbeiten. Das tun wir, das tut Frans Timmermans, das tut Johannes Hahn, das tut Dimitris Avramopoulos. Aber wir müssen jetzt schnell weiterkommen. Ich lese und ich teile viele dieser schriftlich niedergelegten Erörterungen, dass es Zweifel gibt, Bedenken gibt, dass es vieles zu hinterfragen gibt im Zusammenhang mit dem Umgang mit der Türkei. Ich sage Ihnen nur Folgendes: Die Türkei beherbergt auf ihrem Territorium 2,5 Millionen Flüchtlinge – mehr als wir und schon längere Zeit als wir. Jetzt gibt es zwei Möglichkeiten: Entweder wir sagen der Türkei: Okay, es gibt zwischen der Europäischen Union, zwischen den Mitgliedstaaten der Europäischen Union, dem Europäischen Parlament, der Europäischen Kommission und der Türkei ungelöste Fragen in punkto Menschenrechte, in punkto Pressefreiheit, und so weiter und so fort. Das bringt aber im Moment nichts. In unseren Gesprächen mit den türkischen Kollegen – Timmermans, ich selbst, andere – lenken wir die Aufmerksamkeit der türkischen Regierung auf diese Missstände. Aber wir müssen jetzt konkrete Schritte in gemeinsamer Solidarität mit der Türkei einleiten, denn die Türkei ist einverstanden, dafür zu sorgen, dass die Flüchtlinge, die zurzeit in der Türkei untergebracht sind, in der Türkei bleiben. Sie sind einverstanden damit, alles zu tun, damit sich nicht neue Flüchtlingsströme in Richtung Türkei und dann in Richtung Süd- und Nordeuropa in Bewegung setzen. Die Türkei ist einverstanden, den Flüchtlingen soziale Dienstleistungen zugutekommen zu lassen, und sie ist einverstanden, dass die Kinder, die von überall her kommen, in der Türkei zur Schule gehen können. Was hat das für einen Sinn, wenn wir Flüchtlinge in Lagern zusammenbringen und nicht dafür sorgen, dass die Kinder dieser Flüchtlinge eine Lebenschance erhalten dadurch, dass sie zur Schule gehen können und sich ausbilden lassen können? Insofern: Ob es passt oder nicht passt, ob es gefällt oder nicht gefällt, wir müssen mit der Türkei in gemeinsamer Anstrengung zusammenarbeiten. Die Türkei braucht drei Milliarden Euro, um der Krise Herr zu werden. Im europäischen Haushalt gibt es für 2015 und 2016 jeweils 250 Millionen Euro, den Rest müssen die Mitgliedstaaten aufbringen. Und diese Beträge kommen zu den 2,3 Milliarden Euro hinzu, die uns seit dem September-Rat noch fehlen. Wir müssen mit der Türkei über Visaliberalisierung reden, wir müssen mit der Türkei über die Beitrittsverhandlungen und die Dynamisierung derselben reden, ohne dass wir auf unsere ursprünglichen und immer noch gültigen Grundsatzbeschlüsse verzichten würden. Ich richte einen Appell an dieses Haus, der Kommission dabei zu helfen, dass wir schnell und zügig mit der Türkei zu verbindlichen, ihr und uns helfenden Vereinbarungen kommen. Ansonsten wird die Lage wesentlich schwieriger, als sie es heute schon ist. Ich füge hinzu, dass ich gern hätte, dass wir uns schnell mit dem Thema gemeinsame Küstenwache beschäftigen. Wir brauchen eine gemeinsame Küstenwache, und wir brauchen einen besseren Schutz der Außengrenzen. Wir brauchen direkte Informationen, die an die Flüchtlinge weiterzureichen sind, und wir brauchen den Hinweis an die Flüchtlinge – nicht an die Asylberechtigten, sondern an die Flüchtlinge –, dass sie wieder in ihre Heimatländer zurückkehren müssen, wenn die kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen in Syrien – ich träume ein bisschen – und sonstwo zu Ende gebracht worden sind. Ich danke für die Aufmerksamkeit und werde gerne im Laufe der Debatte alle Fragen, die die Europäische Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion betreffen, mit Ihnen erörtern. Ich möchte nur sagen, dass wir versuchen, zügig weiterzukommen in Sachen Vertiefung der Europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion auf der Grundlage des Fünf-Präsidenten-Berichts. Ich bitte alle diejenigen, die sich zu Recht – ich denke zu Unrecht – Sorgen machen um eine genügende Berücksichtigung der Einflussnahme des Europäischen Parlaments, ihre Bedenken zu vergessen. Die Europäische Kommission wird vor allem in punkto Einlagensicherung – das ist ein Ko-Gesetzgebungsverfahren, so ist das von der Kommission angedacht – mit dem Parlament so reden und verhandeln und diskutieren, wie es den exzellenten Beziehungen zwischen beiden Institutionen angemessen ist.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 72, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has Yesterday, as I prepared for my speech today, I first wrote down: yes, we are in favour of hotspots, yes, we are in favour of more development aid, yes to the quota, yes to safe countries of origin. And somehow, while preparing the speech, I noticed that I have already made this speech a few times here in this House. That is why I do not want to start today with the factual assessment, but with the political situation. That we have a European Commission that also made it clear on Sunday that it wants to lead Europe, that it wants to bring it together, that Europe can finally get off the ground, so that we can move forward. A Commission that is really leading politically, as we have always wanted. That, too, became clear on Sunday. Jean-Claude Juncker has made it politically clear that the wave-through must be stopped. The political statements on this were correct, the legislative texts of the Commission, from our commissioner, Avramopoulos, are on the table – thank you for that. We in the European Parliament have backed many decisions, on the budget, and I assure my group that we are also making an almost track procedure on the two legislative texts on safe third countries and the permanent quota that we now have before us, in order to make it clear that we are prepared to give the important political answers in order to make Europe capable of action. And then, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are with the Member States – once again with the Member States. The commitments made are not being honoured. I would like to say today that I would like to see the European Council talk about the future, not only to philosophise politically about the future in general, but also to ask as concretely as possible what the commitments have actually been honoured by the Member States. Dear Donald Tusk, I think that you, as President-in-Office of the Council, have a strong responsibility there and play a strong role. In the future, I would like to see the Member States ask in concrete terms what the commitments have actually been fulfilled so far. We need the pressure we are putting in place at the European Council to make progress, especially in the context of the coming winter. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which We are witnessing to a great deal of the failure of the excessive nation-state, of national selfishness, which is failing here. It is the Europe of Farage and Le Pen that meets there and which, at the end of the day, does not bring about any decisions there. It is the Europe of the right that, unfortunately, cannot find solutions in this area, and we in the European People's Party have a clear demarcation on this. We say that if Jordan and Lebanon help, if poor countries help, then Europe must also help. We say that we in Europe are proud – as I have already said here – of human rights and not just of Christian rights. We, as the GROUP of The European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, like Donald Tusk, believe that we want clear, strong control at the EU's external border. Not everyone who knocks in Europe can even come in to Europe. That, too, is part of the truth. If we implement this package together, we will be on the right track. I would like to make a partisan assessment today. because, even as an EPP, I often have to be recalled in the debates about how Viktor Orban is behaving on this. We agree, ladies and gentlemen, that we must remind Viktor Orban of the humanitarian approach. That is what my group says, and it is shared. However, I would also like to point out this in plenary: when the Council of Ministers of the Interior decided on the quota of 160 000, an EPP head of government, Viktor Orban, was against it, and three Social Democrats were against it, namely Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three Social Democrats against and one of the EPP members against it. I have not heard from the Netherlands and Denmark – with liberal Heads of Government – what I hear from Angela Merkel, namely that she encourages people and says that we must also shoulder our responsibilities on the refugee issue. That is why I really ask: let us stop pushing the black Peter between the democratic parties. Everyone has to carry out their duties, and we should all, as Europeans, ensure that responsibility is exercised at home. (Applause) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which Finally, I would just like to say that we are dealing with rising populism and extremism. There are forces that scare people. We in the European Parliament have made a basic decision, namely that the democrats, the pro-Europeans, work together, and we want to prevent extremists from having an influence on legislation. That is what we tried to implement last year. I would ask the other party colleagues in this House to do the same at national level. I am concerned about developments in Portugal and I say quite explicitly that I have great respect for the President of the Republic, who is now trying to make decisions that extremists, in this case from the left, do not have legislative responsibility. We should maintain this consensus that we can hold pro-European democratic forces in Europe accountable in order to tackle the challenges together in these difficult times.

On the other hand, your party colleague Fico in Slovakia has said that he is not prepared to implement European law.

These movements could give themselves a common slogan, paraphrasing the great Antonio De Curtis (Totò, aka): \"I am against regardless\". But I think the best way to combat disruptive pushes is to do things. Europe will have won it when it succeeds, as Mr Juncker did last Sunday, in moving forward with concrete proposals with regard to the situation in the Balkan countries. Europe will have won it when it can demonstrate the readiness of the European Parliament, as witnessed by President Schulz, to ensure speed in the decisions needed to deal with the emergency. Above all, however, Europe will have won it and will be able to show that it is stronger than the viruses of nationalism and fear when it is able to give courageous and convincing answers. I appeal to all the pro-European forces in this Parliament, regardless – and I say this too – of their latitudes. Today we need to put our Europeanism at the centre, because today the challenge is between those who want to destroy, accumulating rubble, and those who want to build, giving impetus and life to the Pro-European plan. We must begin to implement the points that Mr Juncker has listed: the mechanism for the relocation of refugees, combined with a system of hotspots that strengthens the Union's external borders, the confirmation and defence of Schengen, the defence of European citizens not through nationalism and the return to national borders, which is not the solution, but one of the problems. There is a need for greater coordination between states, especially in the Balkans, as decided at last Sunday's summit. It is unacceptable that the rights of refugees – as Mr Juncker mentioned – should not be respected and that they should be treated as an inhuman mass thrown from one border to another. We must not penalise the most vulnerable states financially. The refugee crisis is an exceptional circumstance under the Stability Pact, juncker said, and I call on the Commission to move forward with this indication in order to decomputate from national budgets the expenditure incurred by Member States in the management of external borders.  On Turkey, we cannot leave Ankara to manage the effects of the Syrian crisis on its own. We are therefore moving forward quickly in the implementation of the action plan for Turkey. It must be clear, however, that we will not sign any blank cheques to the Turkish Government. It is not incompatible to implement the action plan with Turkey and to make progress in the field of respect for human rights, respect for free information and respect for minorities. And finally, as President Tusk said, we are heading for the Valletta summit. For too long, a tacit exchange has governed relations between Europe and Africa: Europe gives a few financial crumbs to African governments, which in return slow down migratory flows. This logic is dead. We need a genuine political, cultural as well as an economic partnership.  The European Union must invest in a prospect of Africa's rebirth. This means supporting African democracies to strengthen their institutions, to fight corruption, to invest in education and to redistribute the fruits of growth fairly.  There's a lot to do! All Member States and all of us Pro-Europeans must commit ourselves to doing more. We must commit ourselves to doing our part to resolve this crisis, before it is too late, and quoting a supreme Italian poet – excuse me for this nationalist version – as Dante said: 'Here we will look like our ennobled'.

Mr President, there is no doubt that we agree that the 2.5 million refugees must remain in Turkey, and that is the issue we must focus on.

You therefore agree that the refugee crisis for Turkey is refugee but also that on issues relating to integration, the application of principles and values, the opening of chapters in compliance with the Ankara Protocol, Turkey must implement and implement its obligations, without forcing the European Union to suffer blackmail and threats on the part of Turkey. , which should have supported the European Union in refugee matters?

Let us be clear. We have got to get away from the well-rehearsed arguments of whether you are pro-European or you are anti-European. Let us get away from the arguments of those who want to do nothing, and those who think that we can do everything. Instead of a stop-start approach, let us be clear about what we need to stop doing and let us be clear about what we need to start doing. Stop sending out a signal that anyone is welcome. Start focusing on helping those genuinely seeking refuge. Stop driving refugees into the arms of the traffickers. Start helping people nearer their homes. Stop individual countries opening their borders to all one day, forcing others to close theirs, and start being clear about what each country can do and is doing to help, because we need to face the reality now.  This is not just a migration crisis. This is not just a refugee crisis. It is in danger of becoming a geo-political crisis. In Syria, a proxy conflict is unfolding. Russia is doing all it can to destabilise the EU’s borders to focus our attention away from the Ukraine. The Balkans are in danger of destabilizing, so against this background we have had the Commission 10-point plan, we have the European Council roadmap and now we have the 17-point plan from Sunday’s summit. But all these plans are no substitute for action, so to solve the crisis we first have to stabilise it, accepting only the most vulnerable genuine refugees from the camps, as identified by the UNHCR, returning those who seek to bypass that system. But even with such a system in place, we have to take some refugees into our countries. We have a moral obligation, yet some countries are doing far more than others. Some countries are struggling to cope. Some countries are donating huge sums. Some countries are paying huge bucks while others are passing the buck, so all countries need to understand the scale of the situation and help with coordinated action. When I say all countries, I do not just mean all EU countries. I mean all countries. So while we should acknowledge and support the contribution of Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, we should also be asking when the richer Arab countries and the USA will step up. Closer to home, EU frontline States and the Balkans need to be helped. Borders need to be strengthened. Money and resources need to go into processing and returns. We need to be fair but firm, helping refugees close to their homes, welcoming some to our countries, but telling economic migrants to apply through existing legal migration channels and not being seen to jump the queue over those who have applied legally. Let us uphold these principles to save lives, rather than encourage people to risk their lives.  Our grandparents confronted the problems of their generation, who had fought two world wars. They allowed our generation to enjoy a longer period of sustained peace and prosperity that any generation ever before. Never take that for granted, for now our world is changing: shifting power from West to East, wars on our doorstep, terrorism at home, living longer but reproducing less. These new challenges will need new solutions, and history has taught us that to face the really big challenges we need to work together as allies but stand up to those who seek to dictate to us. Our grandparents had the vision to meet the challenges of their times. Our children will face a whole new set of challenges, so now it is our turn; our turn to do something for our children and grandchildren: face today’s challenges or retreat to the past. So let us stop sending false hope, to the millions thinking of coming here, that they all have a future in the EU. Let us move on from road maps and action plans and get on with helping those in need. Let us stop pointing fingers and setting quotas and start delivering, for the sake of the refugees, for the sake of the citizens of our countries and for the sake of the future stability of this continent.

(Applause from certain quarters) Applause, applause! Thank you.  So the first thing I want to do is say to Manfred Weber that this refugee crisis is not a contest between Liberals, Socialists or Christian Democrats. It is not a contest. Anyway we always lose against you, Manfred, because if you have on your side Orbán, who is a tough guy, and Merkel who shows compassion, you always win and you are always right. In reality it is not a contest between us; it is a contest between those nationalists and populists who want to abuse this refugee crisis to get rid of Europe and to destroy the European Union – that is the real contest, and not between us. (Applause) So let us stop making accusations, saying this government and that government. The problem is all the governments in Europe, because that is what Jean-Claude Juncker has shown – in 25 minutes – and I thank him for doing so in a very detailed way. What he said was a long list of decisions taken at European level have not been implemented by the Member States for months now. When it concerns relocation, not enough has been done. When it concerns the budget, not enough has been done. When it concerns sending civil servants for the external borders, not enough has been done. The problem is not here, between political groups; the problem is that Member States still do not understand that they can only manage this problem at European level. That is what we are facing today. And there we stand together. There is no reason for a battle between us because this battle is only good for them over there, with their blue cards, to attack the European project because this is an existential crisis; an existential crisis that can only be overcome if – based on the Commission, Mr Tusk – now the Council decides on what is, in my opinion, the first thing to do, that is the European border and coastguard so that we can regain control over our borders.  That does not mean that we have to create a fortress Europe. That means that it is together – in Greece, in Bulgaria – that we have to control the border, register the different refugees who are coming, establishing facilities so that they can live in good circumstances and not as in the images that we have seen in recent days and recent weeks. It is there that we can differentiate between those who are economic migrants and real refugees, and it is there where we can organise the relocation.  So if I have one plea to Mr Tusk then it is this: let us work together, Mr Tusk. I know it is not your fault, it is the Council – at least the December Council – that will decide on this European border and coastguard because the Greek border does not exist, the Bulgarian border does not exist. The Greek border and the Bulgarian border: that is also the German border, the French border, the Dutch border, the Belgian border, it is our common border, so that means it is our common responsibility. And that is what you have to decide because it is there where the Balkan route can be stopped; not in the Western Balkans, but on the Bulgarian border. In Greece, there we have to create this European border and coastguard that has to be multinational and that has to deal with registration and at the same time with relocation. The second point is that in the Council – my proposal to you is not to give your colleagues in the Council a Christmas break if they cannot decide now on this common asylum system that we definitely need and on this common economic migration system that we desperately need, because everybody knows that many people are abusing the asylum system in the end to come into Europe. That is at stake. In December, that is in a few weeks, do not give them a break, do not go on holiday, keep them there in that building, that Eastern European—type building where the Council has its seat for the moment, and make these three crucial decisions. Finally – and this is my last plea to you, Mr Tusk, and I know that you are in favour – take the decision once and for all to give a mandate to Mrs Mogherini to start initiatives also at her level, at the level of Europe, on the source of this crisis. Nobody talked about it: the source of this crisis is the ongoing conflict in Syria and we have looked away for years from that conflict. It is time that the European Council gave a mandate to Ms Mogherini to start, really, in the name of Europe, to be involved, because I find it a shame, I find it outrageous that in Vienna – you were there, Mrs Mogherini, in Vienna a few days ago – in Vienna there is a meeting – in Vienna, in the middle, in the centre of Europe – there is a meeting about Syria and who is around the table? The US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but no Europeans are around that table.  At least at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 we were around the table. This time, in the 21st Century, we do it in Europe and we are not even present! It is just like the summit in the Azores organised by Mr Barroso on Iraq; no Europeans were around the table there either, and there in the middle of Europe – that is, not the middle but on the outskirts of Europe – something was also decided. So this time my plea is: let us give a mandate to Mrs Mogherini, and please, Mrs Mogherini, use it fully. Break the door of these meetings open and be present and represent the European point of view.

It was an honor to do so and it was an honor to compete with you for the presidency of this Parliament. I said then that we were a different Europe, a Europe that was a little less harsh on the weak and a little less accommodating to the powerful. I believe that, unfortunately, this statement from fifteen months ago remains and remains in force today. I recalled, in that speech fifteen months ago, the Spanish fighters who fought fascism and horror as my homeland's best contribution to Europe's progress, as my homeland's best contribution to a social Europe, a democratic Europe and a human rights-friendly Europe. When I hear xenophobic cries in this House I remember that, in my homeland, those who insulted, those who were frightened, were told \"They will not pass\". But it also annoys me to hear some hypocrisy in this House in some who weep crocodile tears and defend human rights. Mr Weber, you have spoken of extremism to refer to what may happen in Portugal. You learn to respect democracy. You learn that sometimes citizens vote different things than what you stand for. (Applause) The representative of the Liberal Group - he will forgive me that, after fifteen months practicing every morning in front of the mirror, he remains unable to pronounce his surname - he said that this is not a problem of social democrats, liberals or people. Yes, indeed. Indeed, you have agreed on the fundamental elements that have involved a European foreign policy which we are now paying for and which has to do with the situation of misery and humiliation that thousands of families are living on the doorstep of Europe. Today we are talking again about war and desolation at the gates of Europe, families to which they are responding with wires. And I say that we Europeans cannot forget what a war means, we cannot forget what horror and poverty mean and have to flee from horror and poverty. And we can't humiliate these people, because humiliating these people is humiliating Europe. How it is to humiliate Europe, Mr Weber, to end the welfare state. Such as humiliating Europe by ending social rights. It is humiliating Europe to surrender governments to the arrogance of financial powers and to attack sovereignty. It is humiliating Europe to encourage tax evasion, as you do, Mr Juncker. Like you, who favored secret businesses, when you were finance minister, secret dealings with multinationals so that they had to pay taxes at 1%, while European citizens have to pay taxes. And then you talk about budgets.  And you sit there, Mr Juncker, because people like you, Mr Pittella, have allowed Mr Juncker to sit there; because you, the Socialists, have maintained a great coalition with the populars in this House. So, less to quote Dante, Mr Pittella, and more to side with the people and get rid of this damn grand coalition. (Applause) I return to my country so that there is no more people in Spain, but I want to ask you for something before I leave: change your policy. The refugee crisis is not solved by wires.

If you really want to contribute to a constructive solution in acute situations, then call Mr Seehofer and tell him that he can simply reach for the telephone handset instead of always trumpeting in public and make a phone call with Mr Faymann and Mrs Merkel. I believe that this is possible in his position and would benefit us all. (Applause) First of all, I would like to try to classify one thing in this debate. I do not believe that we should actually discuss, first and foremost, a deep crisis in the European Union. Crisis and war, that is something that is currently taking place outside the European Union. Many other peoples have much more problems than the European Union has so far. If we do not stop talking about ourselves and our difficulties again and again, then we will not be able to contribute to a change in Syria and the surrounding area, or sub-Saharan Africa – or even in the south of the Mediterranean.  For me, it is now almost frightening how self-oriented these discussions are. In my opinion, it is also the case that the very great pressure of the problem that we are now feeling and which we are talking about is actually the result of a false refugee and migration policy that we have been operating for decades, which is very much geared towards us. The European Union had made itself comfortable for too long in the Dublin Regulation, which aimed to foreclose and limit the problem to the border countries. If we were not shaken up by ships that have sunk on the Mediterranean, we have actually set ourselves up in indifference to the problems, particularly in the south of the Mediterranean. It is not easy now to get out of such a mode of shutdown and indifference. But I believe that the European Union is strong enough to do so if we stop destroying the European Union in this challenge.  I think it is right, Mr Juncker, that the decisions have been taken to do more to improve the situation of refugees in Turkey and also in other neighbouring countries in Syria. But what I think is wrong, and this is an old mistake, is that, in order to do something right, you reunite with a man who is doing exactly the wrong thing in your country. I am talking about President Erdogan. While we are debating here, a large media group in Turkey is being occupied by the police, it is to be occupied and placed under the administration of ACP people. So think very carefully about how this can continue with Turkey. I think it is quite right that the Balkan summit took place last weekend. I think it is a breakthrough that it is finally being admitted that, as before in Hungary, we are experiencing a humanitarian disaster along the Balkan route and that the European Union is now responsible for better caring in this situation for the people who have fled to us and who, incidentally, are fleeing to us because their countries are broken and the European Union is an area in which we function for the benefit of the citizens. I can only underline that I also believe that, in addition to the acute management of the situation, we need to think about long-term changes. What replaces Dublin? What is europe's future refugee and immigration policy? How do we organize our borders? How do we organise the borders in such a way that it is not isolation or militarisation, as is partly the case with Frontex, but human rights, European values and international law, and also a new openness, a just openness, are decisive for the development of this new European border policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Nigel Farage", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, as this migrant crisis begins to overwhelm the European Union – and yes, it is an existential crisis – perhaps we should ask ourselves what really is the true nature of this project?  I have heard a lot today about rights. Well what about democratic rights? I think what we are seeing is an increasingly authoritarian European Union that crushes democratic rights and then actually crows about it. Every single time there is a crisis, it is national democracy that loses. Back in 2011, we saw the Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi sounding Eurosceptic, removed and replaced by a puppet prime minister. We saw exactly the same thing happen in Greece in 2011. Mr Papandreou threatened a referendum on euro membership, there was a coup against him and he was replaced by a puppet. In this migrant crisis we have seen four countries – led, I guess, by the strongest, Hungary – making it clear they want no part of EU migrant quotas, only to find themselves crushed through EU trickery and made to accept the very thing that they had said ‘no’ to. I never forget seeing the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Tsipras, sitting just over there, having won a general election, and then come to this House to be told the manifesto was unacceptable and it must be ditched. All of this has reached a new low this week, with Portugal. Virtually unremarked upon by the media, and yet, for those that do not know, there is now, following the general election, a left-wing majority with a socialist plan for Portugal – and yet the President of Portugal, Mr Silva, is refusing them office on the grounds that they represent anti-European forces and is allowing the minority Conservative, pro-EU Prime Minister to stay in place. This is the modern day implementation of the Brezhnev doctrine. This is exactly what happened to states living inside the USSR. What has been made clear here, with Greece and indeed with Portugal, is that a country only has democratic rights if it is in favour of the project. If not, those rights are taken away. Perhaps none of this should surprise us, as Mr Juncker has told us before that there can be no democratic choice against the European Treaties. The German Finance Minister, Mr Schäuble, has said elections change nothing: there are rules. I think for anyone that believes in democracy, Portugal should be the final straw. It should be the warning that this project – to protect itself and all its failings – will destroy the individual rights of people and of nations. My country has always believed in parliamentary democracy so strongly that twice in the last century it risked everything to fight for parliamentary democracy, not just for Britain but for the rest of Europe too.

I understand that many of those coming are fleeing persecution, but I fear that the initial response by some European nations may have consigned even more vulnerable people to trafficking and exploitation by criminal gangs. President Tusk focused this morning on the matter of securing borders, concluding that even though deals with third countries are possible, no third country can replace us in protecting our external borders. President Juncker indicated that we need to slow down the uncontrolled flow of people. If this is a more realistic approach, it is late but welcome. Of course, it is only part of the answer. It requires a dual approach: stability in the region and promoting policies to encourage economic growth.  However, I am perturbed by the tone of some of the leaders’ comments in this debate this morning. Let me address Mr Weber’s intemperate outburst on behalf of my constituents in the United Kingdom. We are not a nation of extremes but a compassionate people who have mandated our government to give aid to the Syrian refugee crisis. In fact, we are the second largest bilateral donor of aid to the refugee crisis in Syria and one of the few countries working to fulfil our Millennium Development Goals.

Others are concerned with saying who is to blame and responsible. Third parties tell us something about what we have done wrong in the past. Then the Council meets, decides on a few very specific measures on the basis of the Commission's proposals, and then nothing happens. That upsets people.  As politicians, we have the job of solving the problems – not to discuss or insult each other, but to solve this.

And then you really only have to do what is normal: to implement what you have decided, what you have agreed. I admit that this is a problem that European policy has not only at this point. We often have that. We would not have some problems if we all adhered to what we decided in the respective bodies. And we don't need to get upset about it every time.

Paying money, providing the Commission with scope for action and, last but not least, ensuring that the Frontex force is fit for work, that it is equipped, that it can function accordingly.

Instead of the European Union demanding that Turkey, which does not meet the criteria of the Copenhagen Treaty, is a country to join, to comply with its obligations and not to promote thousands of illegal immigrants to Greece, it tolerates it blackmailing Cyprus with division if it does not succumb to its pressures and demands, and at the same time, through Mrs Merkel's mouth. , it offers three billion euros to the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Mr Erdogan,despite the fact that he refuses to receive them and wants more and possibly twice as much.

The number of 710 000 migrants who (if this figure is obviously fully true) have arrived in Europe at this time brings with it a number of humanitarian, existential problems. This is a challenge for many of the countries where these migrants have found themselves. However, It seems to me that it is good that the Union has agreed to this and that we should first of all help where there are sources of migration: in Africa and in the Middle East. And these decisions were taken as part of the summit on 23 September. It is good that we have all acknowledged together that border protection should be a priority. It is not possible to help those who are already in the European Union if the border is leaking like a colander. This, in a sense, provokes further emigration, regardless of the fact that places are being created where the humanitarian crisis, such as in Syria, will continue to affect emigration. It was decided to provide eur 1 billion in aid to refugees in the Middle East. The question, of course, is whether that is enough. After all, no money is enough when there is a humanitarian crisis. But It seems to me that the decision to help Turkey is also important. Without this assistance, Turkey, a country with more than 2.5 million refugees, could not help stem this migratory pressure. This is where the Member States have to come.  There is also some hope of improving the situation in Libya. Here we must help, and It seems to me that all forms of assistance and international cooperation, including the UN, are effective in countering this great humanitarian crisis.

You have to register your passes, you can't get them from one border to another. Nor can the migrant choose where he or she will be prosecuted.

We really need this support from the European Parliament, and what we have achieved so far is thanks to this support. We need it also from different States inside and outside the European Union, and we have to help them as well. Sunday’s mini-summit, as it was called, is positive, as States along the Balkans route came to the same table, and the dialogue now is open – but several used their own national narrative. I have to admit there is still not a full European spirit of cooperation. More cooperation, more solidarity, more responsibility are needed, and now we need actions – not only commitments. It is now; implementation is key. This is also the message I got from you here. Implement and do even more on border management, on protection of asylum seekers in an organised way, and on cooperation within countries outside Europe. The role of the Commission has changed with this crisis. Constant monitoring, dialogue and support, and initiatives in a more strategic way and scope, are needed. This is also why the Commission work programme will have to give some answers in relation to borders, Dublin, resettlement, legal migration and relocation already on the table. They are all key, because we cannot afford to fail. Let us not forget that the refugee crisis is used in multiple ways in internal national debates and public opinion. The only solution is to explain to our citizens: to explain to people the need for a common approach at different levels and to demonstrate the supportive role of the Commission to the Member States and neighbouring countries affected.

It is a test of credibility of our principles and the capability of our institutions, and this is what the Commission is doing by having put migration at the top of its priorities from the very first day, taking the necessary initiatives like the Balkan Route Summit last Sunday, standing by the Member States in need, in order to give value and substantial content to the principles of solidarity and responsibility, and enhancing the unity of the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Donald Tusk", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Council. – Mr President, of course I share the concerns of this Chamber: the realisation of decisions undertaken during this crisis is not going as quickly as is necessary.

Internet neutrality means that all data transmitted over this line is sent with the same priority. Therefore, there cannot be a situation where, for example, one data package takes precedence over another based on the content, origin, or type of service. The opposite of net neutrality would be a situation where a company could subscribe to the prerogative for its services at the expense of the services of other companies.

If, by mid-2017, small premiums are still allowed compared to prices in the domestic market, these will be completely eliminated after this cut-off date, thus enabling cross-border mobile communication at no additional cost. The legal anchoring of net neutrality is a prerequisite for fair competition in the digital economy. Given the loss of importance of the European IT industry, it is high time to create a digital single market based on common standards that enables European companies to achieve growth rates similar to those of their foreign competitors. Both the free access of all citizens to all contents of the Internet and the equal treatment of all data packets without paid prioritisation must be ensured. Prioritisation may be necessary for technical, non-commercial, reasons, but only proportionate, non-discriminatory and temporary. The national supervisory authorities remain responsible for ensuring fair competition.

In particular, the Ferber report proposes that the exchange be done retroactively, up to ten years back for the rescripts. Unfortunately, Parliament's opinion here has little weight in the face of the Ecofin Council, which met on 6 October, has taken a much lighter stance in terms of constraints on this subject. The Ministers of Economy and Finance of the Member States have thus buried this principle of retroactivity, leaving the possibility for States with the most opaque practices in this area, such as Luxembourg, to clean up.

It is therefore good that the Commission intends to tighten up legislation and the mandatory automatic exchange of information on taxation matters. For several years, the EU country of Luxembourg has distinguished itself in particular in organising its tax legislation to help big business evade tax in other EU countries.

The Lux-leaks affair has revealed a number of anomalies in member states' control mechanisms in the area of taxation and the brutal practices used by multinationals to avoid tax. Measures are therefore needed to improve the mutual exchange of information to help reduce tax evasion and make transactions that arise from the business of companies more transparent. Tax avoidance causes wider social damage and has a negative impact on people's well-being, since many countries are unable to provide public services to the extent they could due to the loss of income from tax evasion. And, on the other hand, large companies are also increasing profits and rewarding owners at the expense of such neced practices.

That is why the Commission today commits to making bold, focused and pragmatic proposals to allow us to overcome our common challenges and emerge stronger in the spirit of European solidarity and responsibility. President Juncker’s ten priorities, which are both our mission statement and the basis on which we were appointed to office by you, remain the right ones. Last year we said we would do different things and do things differently. We are concentrating on the big things. We have set out our vision and the concrete measures necessary in various areas: investment plan, digital single market, energy union, European Agenda on Security, European Agenda on Migration, capital markets union, action plan for fair and efficient corporate taxation, new trade strategy, deepened and strengthened economic and monetary union. Tomorrow we will present the single market strategy.  Still this year, we will complete the picture with our plans for a sustainable circular economy, labour mobility and better management of our external borders.  The Work Programme the Commission adopted today and its 23 key initiatives is focused on implementing these strategies. It represents a substantive legislative agenda. There will be a lot of work on the table for this Parliament. Members have all received a copy of the Work Programme hot-off-the-press so I assume not all of them will have read it. That is why I would like to point to five important issues which I would like to stress in particular. First, we will continue to prioritise the refugee and migration challenge. The European Agenda on Migration provides a comprehensive response. Immediate actions have been taken and I am very grateful to this House and its President for the speed with which you have acted and for the leadership you have consistently shown. We now propose new measures to improve migration management both to overhaul the Dublin system for asylum and to set out a new approach to legal migration. This will complement the strengthened border management proposals we will table by the end of the year, including a European border and coastguard. Secondly, we have to keep our sights firmly on creating jobs, growth and investment. The Investment Fund is now operational, thanks again to the commitments of this House and the speed with which it has worked, and is delivering high quality investments to further boost the European economy, including in research. We now will focus on improving the investment environment and deepening the single market so that it delivers better outcomes, fewer barriers and the right environment for innovation, especially among SMEs and start—ups. We will present a range of concrete proposals to implement the digital single market strategy. We will also present sectoral strategies on space and defence. Thirdly, the EU being a lead player in the Paris climate talks, we will follow up with three important packages under the energy union. We will deliver a circular economy package to maximise resource efficiency throughout the whole value chain. We will set out a new approach to ensure Europe’s economic, social and environmental sustainability, taking into account the Europe 2020 review and the United Nation’s sustainable development goals. Fourthly, we want to make 2016 a year of real social progress. We will present a new skills agenda aimed at helping people get quality jobs, in particular in the digital era. We will set out legislative and non-legislative action to give a new start to work/life balance for parents, including to support women in the workplace. The labour mobility proposals we will present still this year will help people use the opportunities of free movement whilst addressing abuses in the benefits system and social dumping. Free movement should not be a threat to social protection.  The 2016 European Semester will put a stronger focus on the economic and fiscal situation in the euro area as a whole and on Member States’ employment and social performance. This will be complemented by the development of a European pillar of social rights which will modernise and address the gaps in existing social protection legislation and identify social benchmarks built on national best practices with a view to upwards convergence, in particular of course in the euro area. Fifthly, the Commission will also press for further progress towards fair, efficient and growth–friendly corporate taxation, based on the principle that companies should pay taxes in the country where profits are generated. We will present a set of measures to enhance transparency of the corporate tax system and fight tax avoidance. We will also present an action plan for a more efficient and fraud–proof VAT regime. I wanted to stress these five points to you today as I cannot list everything here. The Commission will, of course, also continue to implement the European security agenda to tackle terrorism and organised crime and follow up on the trade and investment strategy as well as the Five Presidents’ report for a more resilient and prosperous economic and monetary union.  Given all these challenges, it is essential to make the best use of all our resources. The EU budget must be geared to results and the mid–term review of the multiannual financial framework will look at how to make sure that we target our funding better on priorities such as the refugee crisis while also putting a stronger focus on achieving results. The challenges such as migration, access to energy and other resources, and climate change also show the need for an effective external dimension to deliver on major internal policy objectives. Today more than ever before you can no longer distinguish between internal and external – I just want to point to the sustainable development goals, they can no longer distinguish between the two elements. The Commission will make a substantive contribution to the new global strategy on foreign and security policy – also, here, internal and external go hand in hand. Two final points. One: this Commission also said we would do things differently. All the actions we propose are underpinned by our new better regulation agenda. We remain committed to making sure that when the EU intervenes it does so in a way that will deliver results and make a positive difference on the ground. Our Work Programme includes our plans to review key areas of existing legislation such as health and safety at the workplace, to ensure that they are fit for purpose and continue to deliver on our ambitious policy objectives.  We also propose a number of withdrawals of initiatives which have become obsolete or watered down and have no chance to be adopted. The list is considerably shorter than last year which was a moment of political discontinuity. In line with our commitment under the Framework Agreement we will only enact the withdrawals once we have heard your views. My second concluding point is that the Work Programme cannot deliver results without sufficient ownership of the co–legislators. Again, here, it takes, strangely enough, three to tango. The Commission’s Work Programme reflects the Commission’s right of initiative and we take full responsibility for the choices we make. But for the EU to be strong it needs to be able to demonstrate that all our institutions are ready to set Europe’s agenda together and can work together swiftly and in agreement to reach our goals. In preparing our Work Programme we have taken account of the views you have expressed, including in your resolution and I think there is a very broad degree of convergence. I think everyone will agree that our joint working methods for this years’ dialogue were much improved, for instance with the new cluster format in the College–Conference of Committee Chairs (CCC) discussions, and I am grateful for all the input we have received from the committees and their Chairs, as well as the Groups and the Group leaders. I want to thank all the Group leaders for their leadership in this. I want to thank President Schulz for having taken this so seriously and helped us to organise the work better.

Maybe it is because of the agreement that there is not much excitement in the House or in the press outside about this; if it were voted down or there were no agreement, there would be much more excitement. But it is very important that Parliament and the Commission work together on this because this Parliament, or most of this Parliament, was elected so that the message of how the European Institutions work should be changed considerably; they should be more effective.  I can shortlist why the EPP or in what areas the European People’s Party can support the Commission’s line, especially in methodology. We welcome the concentration on the 10 priorities of the Juncker plan. Also in the methodology, the key issues should be in line with subsidiarity and proportionality. We have seen very long Commission work programmes in the past not fulfilled, so implementation and checking red tape impact assessment and all the legislation throughout the process is an important issue which we should do all the time. Still on a methodology line, we asked the Commission to align the legislation to the delegated and implementing act provisions, which is my personal issue, although it is much more important than my single person. This is something which we are still in debt after long years after the Lisbon Treaty. The Commission should focus on the implementation of the existing legislation and a simplification in the area when we are speaking about the common agricultural or cohesion policy.  There are two priorities in this area which the EPP found very important: firstly, the mobility and the flexibility of the labour market has to be improved and youth employment skills have to be developed to keep our savoir faire and to develop innovation. Also, the completion of the internal market is a key priority on the energy field and on the digital area. The competitiveness of the EU industry, especially in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises, remains a top priority to creating and saving jobs in Europe.  However, everyone is overwhelmed with the urgency of the refugee crisis. The EPP believes in a European approach to secure the European external borders and to help those who are in danger, but we must ensure the security of our citizens as our first priority. In this area there is much legislation and Parliament has already demonstrated its readiness to cooperate and act swiftly in this area. I welcome the Commission’s proposal for the Work Programme 2016.

In our opinion, the ten priorities remain valid but they need to be articulated in a completely different way. We can see that our most important challenge now is to address the refugee crisis and to prevent a humanitarian crisis on this front in such a way that we are also able to protect the Schengen Area. We know that this requires a real asylum system in Europe, a real European border and a real immigration policy.  So we will support the Commission in building up these new instruments. But at the same time we need to turn Europe into a real space for prosperity. We believe that this year should be the time for this Commission to deliver a real update of the Europe 2020 Strategy. This is not only about energy transition, but about a circular economy to better manage our resources. This is not only about research and development, but about providing new digital solutions and innovation, again to create quality jobs. We need to make the best of our investment plan, and of the revision of the budgetary instrument, to deliver much better on this strategy. But at the same time we are concerned with something which is happening now in Europe, namely a race to the bottom. There is a risk of a race to the bottom and of Member States competing with each other by downgrading their social standards. That is why we believe that this is the time for a strong pillar of social rights, this is the time for a mobility package to come, but this is also the time to tackle tax evasion in such a way that taxes are paid where profits are made. We really consider these a top priority and we think that the ambition to complete economic and monetary union should be driven by a central goal. The central goal is upward convergence. We consider that, if we want to deliver this upward convergence, we also need to complete the banking union and to build up a real fiscal capacity in the euro area. But then we say that none of these ambitions are effective if we are not supported by a more ambitious external action. Yes, Mr First Vice-President, we agree with you. We need to have an updated global strategy and the first test for this would be for Europe to lead the next Paris conference, for Europe to lead in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, and let me also address the importance of bringing about a real partnership with Africa as our neighbour continent.

There is much in the work programme that I can agree with. I have said that every EU initiative should face that simple test: will it make it easier or harder for businesses to thrive? The Commission has cut back on new legislation; you are making sure that existing laws work, and you have promised to remove more bureaucracy. You have taken 70 proposals off the table. Commissioner, thank you for listening to the ECR.  However, Parliament’s resolution on the Work Programme called for a deeper political union, including European standards on welfare, health care and education. I disagree – these are matters that are better left to our national governments, and I know that many colleagues across this Parliament felt the same.

That is a real achievement for which I congratulate him. So I have not really had time to read it in great detail, but going through it I note a lot of very positive things for which the Vice-President will get the support of my group. These are the border and coastguard proposal and the proposal to revitalise the ‘blue card’ in the chapter on migration and asylum. I also note the proposal on the work-life balance. I suppose that is new eurospeak for maternity leave, which will at least be in there. I also note a proposal for the external representation of the euro, the common currency. We all welcome that, and I am sure there is a lot more in there that the Vice-President will get our support for. There are also a couple of things missing, and a couple of question marks. Regarding the security and counter—terrorism chapter, one of the things that we have urgently needed for many years – and which has been requested by this House – is a thorough, detailed evaluation of security and counter—terrorism measures already in place and their effectiveness. That is part of better law-making. Another thing we need – I do not know if it is in there – is a reference to somehow unblocking the horizontal anti-discrimination directive and the transparency regulation. I will come back to that. Then there is something that this House has been calling for – and I will have the honour and pleasure to elaborate on this – a mechanism for the enforcement of fundamental rights, the rule of law and democratic governance. Finally, on the digital agenda, I very much welcome the Vice-President’s words but wonder how I should then interpret the words of Mr Oettinger, who said that instead of creating an open worldwide web we are going to put a fence around the European cloud and the European internet. I hope the Vice-President does not share his views. One final remark, because we are talking a lot about political topics here: better law—making is not about the outcome of political debates, it is about the process itself. There the Commission could and should do a lot more. I have already mentioned transparency. We need to make some leaps forward because we are still in the era of diplomats and civil servants meeting behind closed doors. We also need to look at enforcement. I only need to mention ‘safe harbour’ and ‘dieselgate’. We also need to look at the quality of legislation and look at ourselves in a more critical manner, because I am sick and tired of passing legislation that we know is legally unsound and will end up before the European Court of Justice sooner or later. There is a whole lot more that can be said about the process, but I would like to see more emphasis on the process, because the final outcome is a matter of political choice, political preference.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I have observed the Commission, and in particular on the challenge of the influx of refugees in Europe, in 2014 and above all 2015, to act swiftly, with a sense of urgency and with ambition. So of course, some will say that it's never enough, but it doesn't stop you being quick to react and, in any case, did not hesitate to break down doors that were closed. I would really like to see you do the same on the issues that Europeans are concerned about. Because I have heard your catalogue of future proposals, the density of which, it seems to me, is matched only by the density of the presence of Members in this room. I would like to start with the issue of social dumping. You did the 2014 campaign. You have felt, like everyone here, how crucial this subject is to Europeans. The Commission was set up at the end of 2014 - well, let's say in the autumn of 2014 - so it is a year later. So far, nothing. In fact, it is not true that there is nothing. Because in the meantime, country-by-country recommendations, under the European Semester, continue to move towards more flexibilisation of the labour market and more weakening of collective bargaining, in other words, to exacerbate social dumping between Member States. So not only do you not stop it, but we are still waiting for the first proposal to turn back. Tax competition: A year ago, we had LuxLeaks. Since then, a small measure: the automatic exchange of information on tax decisions, a measure weakened by the Council, which is conspicuous by its absence here, and therefore everything else is to come. So we have to take your word for it, yes, maana! Tomorrow will come the solution. But in the meantime, I don't feel a sense of urgency or ambition. I would add that on social, fiscal and environmental dumping, what you want to do with TTIP and what you want to do with the better regulation program is more in the opposite direction of what should be done.  On the eurozone: as you know, there is a deadlock in the Council. But what are you waiting for to put on the table the proposals that disturb and put states and this Parliament before their responsibilities? Whether it is the deposit guarantee fund, the automatic stabilisers, the euro area budget and the other, you have the right of initiative. But grab it!  Finally, I would like to finish on the Volkswagen case. I was really looking forward to that. This is a scandal in public health, in terms of the environment, in terms of compliance with the law, in terms of market distortion, in short, nothing but matters for which the Commission is competent, and what Commissioner Bie-kowska tells us? \"Oh, listen, let the Member States do their job, we are watching, but don't count on us to take an initiative.\" Do you actually know what's going on? The automotive industry is a taboo, and we know that it is in Germany that it is the most powerfully established, and therefore it is not touched. Please, sense of urgency and ambition!

I would therefore like to highlight some cross-cutting and strategic issues that will certainly require 'unconventional measures'. Whatever the practical configuration of the 2016 Work Programme, it is nevertheless important to build on some of the lessons that the European Union had in 2015. First of all, the Greek lesson: we must prevent the dynamics that have led a nation of the European Union to experience widespread and penetrating poverty today; We expect strong legislative implementations in this area. The Libyan-Syrian lesson: the inability to act strategically has put us in front of dangerous and urgent situations; we need an effective capacity for initiative in generating crisis moderation actions. The Volkswagen lesson: the large groups need to be better monitored and the controllers, who have failed in this case, must also be monitored. What would have happened if the scam had involved food or pharmaceutical products? We expect a proper legislative initiative. A special reflection deserves three economic issues that will accompany us throughout 2016: TTIP, the MES in favor of China and the use of EFSI. We call for an 'unconventional' impact assessment on macro-economic policies and larger trade agreements. All too often Brussels has shown short-sightedness for wanting to centralise impact analyses in its hands. The same mistake is being made in the case of the ES MES China. We call on the Member States, each for its own competences, to produce assessments of the expected impact on their economies. The Commission will have the task of sum-up and providing the other European institutions with a map of the countries on which the sun will shine and of those on which the clouds will be thickened. And we want the principle to pass that if even one country – only one – were to end up in the storm, this would not be good for europe as a whole. Finally, I would like to mention a fact that expresses the current state of Europe. The latest Eurostat figures show that one in four European citizens is in poverty. We believe that measures such as citizenship income and microcredit are not only the pro-economic development drive, but are now a fundamental instrument for signaling a Europe that regains its identity and its most authentic values of solidarity. And on this we ask that the Commission focus its efforts in 2016. Finally, the better regulation model must take on the challenge of being able to involve the local level, and not just the professionals. It faces the challenge of interpreting geographical differences in terms of the economic impact of legislative policies, and this can only be achieved by decentralise the public consultation process and by aggregating data by macro-regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2826, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Matteo Salvini", "mepid": "28404", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the desert of this House tells us how the Commission of the European Soviet Union lives on another planet.  Immigration is a disaster. This morning, Mr Juncker told us that, after months of chatter and triumphs, the good result is that only nine countries have given their willingness to take in 700 immigrants – a few hundred thousand are missing. And some people think they're letting Turkey into Europe. No: Turkey has never been, is not, nor will it ever be Europe, and no one allows itself to use immigration as a commodity of exchange and blackmail to sell off the rights of European citizens. You can't hear anything about the winds of war that are there. What do this Commission and this Parliament intend to do to exterminate ISIS, which is driving hundreds of thousands of people away? Are we going to go ahead with the crazy economic sanctions against Russia, which this year alone have caused EUR 2 billion in damage to Italy? Are human rights in Ukraine worth more than the Syrian human rights trampled underfoot by ISIS, funded by those who facilitate this clandestine invasion? In my opinion, it is shameful that this Europe, which has asked Italy and all the other countries to make sacrifices for pensions and work, should only regain flexibility when immigrants are involved. Nothing about China market economy, which someone in this building would like to bring to export its machinery and which would produce hundreds of thousands more unemployed. Nothing about the protection of 'made in' and the compulsory labelling of products, which would protect consumers and producers and which, for Italy alone, would avoid EUR 60 billion in damage.  Let's take more protections off our people. This year 80 000 tonnes of rice arrive from Vietnam without controls, 35 000 tonnes of olive oil from Tunisia without controls, there are more unemployed people in Europe and more people landing in Europe: there is something wrong.  Fortunately, when people vote, they choose: they chose in Vienna, they chose in Poland, next year they will choose in the referendum in Britain.

This is something I will cherish and take back to the Commission. Secondly, perhaps I should explain very briefly, this is just a presentation of the Commission Work Programme; nothing more nothing less. We will have ample opportunity in time to discuss all the elements of the Commission Work Programme. I count on Parliament not to make statements about something else or to make big grandstanding gestures on certain political issues, but to take us to the task of looking precisely at the precise proposals the Commission makes, and come to common conclusions on that.  This is extremely important, and sometimes this Commission takes this Parliament more seriously than some of the Members of this Parliament on the extremes of these benches do. This Commission will engage fully with Parliament to make sure that what we do is in line with both your priorities and ours and that we take common decisions that are highly needed. I was just reading a report from the Bertelsmann Foundation, let me quote it directly: ʻtoday in Europe 26 million children and young people are threatened by poverty and social exclusionʼ. This is what should be driving our work. This is what we should be doing, in concrete measures. Do you know how much unemployment there is among young people in so many of our Member States? That is why we want structural reform, that is why we have the EFSI, that is why we want to create opportunities in the digital single market and in the internal market. That is why we need to make sure that people no longer see freedom of movement as a threat to their social position but as an opportunity to perform better and to create careers. That is why we need to put proposals on the table that will lead to better social protection for European citizens, as long as the European Union is competent in these areas. Yes, there are always elements where we could do better, that is why we are here to listen to you, so that we can do better. But in the process, let me end on this. We are now talking intensively with your institution, the European Parliament, represented by Guy Verhofstadt, and the Council to make sure that we do better in the way we legislate together. I hope we can come to a conclusion between the three institutions that shows clearly that we have understood the message from our constituents and our citizens. The message is that we need to do better in the way we prepare legislation so as to avoid making mistakes, and to avoid what Ms in 't Veld was pointing to: that we sometimes adopt decisions knowing full well that they are good because they represent a compromise, but are not good because once you apply them in the Member States businesses suffer and citizens suffer and the Court will have to correct them. Let us try and prevent this from happening by having full and detailed impact assessments before we take a decision, so that we can avoid creating more and more red tape for our businesses and that we can start cutting red tape, instead of the other way around.  This is where this Commission stands, and action is highly needed. I think this is one of the few moments in our common history that the project itself is being challenged in an existential way. Everything has come together like a perfect storm: the economic crisis, the financial crisis, the refugee crisis, international threats, the climate crisis, the environmental crisis and the sustainability crisis. Everything has come together and threatens the very livelihood of Europeans. The European project should be an answer to that. This modest Commission Work Programme is part of a bigger answer we need to give to this challenge. But without this Commission Work Programme, the way we do business between the three institutions would not be as efficient. Let me reiterate that this Commission stands ready to work closely with the European Parliament to make sure that we deliver results for European citizens.

The European Union must be up to the challenges it faces; the European Union must say yes to the agreements it has signed: as I have said several times, pacta sunt servanda, the commitments are to be fulfilled. I am referring to the multiannual financial framework; I am referring, for example, to the payment plan; I am referring to the expectations that have been created in citizens and beneficiaries on these issues.  Of course, we must respect the Europe 2020 strategy and implement the multiannual financial framework. To this end, for the amounts we propose, we do so in view of the absorption capacity of the lines, the interest of the programmes and the policies that are defined, and we want to make the most of the flexibility that we have available in the multiannual financial framework. Employment is the highest priority, the competitiveness of the European Union cannot be forgotten and all the programmes we have to strengthen it must be set in motion.  We want to strengthen horizon 2020 and COSME. Youth unemployment is still high and, therefore, the Employment for Youth Employment initiative must continue. We propose that in 2016, contrary to what the European Commission has done, there should be authorisation appropriations for this initiative to continue. We advocate the three \"E\" - employment, businesses (in particular small and medium-sized enterprises) and entrepreneurship - to strengthen the competitiveness of the European Union.  We have not forgotten the problem of refugees, the refugee crisis, and we have already said so in the various resolutions we have put forward here. In this context, we are advocating a package for this problem which takes into account the internal dimension and the external dimension, and therefore we do not understand, as I have already mentioned here in the last plenary, the Council's cuts to instruments contributing to cooperation and development, such as the instrument for cooperation and the instrument of pre-join , or cuts in combating poverty in the Mediterranean. In this package for the refugee crisis, in order to combat it, we want to strengthen the means that should give dignity and welcome to refugees, as well as internal solidarity, but also this external solidarity, using all the means and financial instruments that we have at our disposal, as well as the agencies. A common policy is required for this purpose; coordination and articulation is also required. Refugees are not to blame — refugees are victims — and for this extraordinary situation we must also have additional means, extraordinary means. It would be unacceptable for the Council not to want to make any further efforts in this area and to want to make re-allocations. If this were not to happen, we would be faced with beautiful words from the Council, but words that never materialise in practice. Solidarity, as I have said many times, is practiced, it is not proclaimed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2837, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Gérard Deprez", "mepid": "1473", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have the responsibility, madam, to present our budgetary proposals with regard to the so-called other institutions.  Among these other institutions, I would start with those which, in our view, have presented the least problems between us, in the Committee on Budgets, and which, according to my information, will pose less with the other branch of the budgetary authority. I am talking about the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee, the Ombudsman, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European External Action Service, for which we have taken up, on our own account, the proposals that were originally formulated by the Commission, because we found them, after examination, perfectly justified. However, there are slight exceptions: one - very limited - in favour of the Committee of the Regions of a few tens of thousands of euros and the other, of a larger scale, for the benefit of the European Court of Justice, whose ability to judge in a reasonable time would, in our view, be undermined by the indiscriminate application of cuts in support and translation staff.  I now turn to the European Parliament's actual budget. And while I know that a number of colleagues will find it difficult to believe me on this point, I consider it a budget of rigour and reform that we have the honour of proposing to Parliament. Since the beginning of its work, the Committee on Budgets has agreed, on my proposal, to set up an exceptional envelope of EUR 15,000. The exclusive purpose of this envelope is to finance urgent and necessary security measures: building security first, as it is true that access to buildings, in Brussels in particular, has demonstrated their deficiency; computer security, then, to adapt our computer systems to technological advances and protect them from possible attacks, increasingly varied and sophisticated.  Apart from this exceptional envelope, the European Parliament's budget will increase overall by only 1.6% in 2016 compared to 2015, a level close to predictable inflation. This limited increase is all the more significant because we have had to take into account very recently the creation of a new political group, which has led to requests for additional temporary jobs and a significant increase in spending, which has also been offset.  To those who would be tempted to believe - and I know there are some - that this increase is still too high in the current context of budgetary restrictions, I want to point out two realities: the first is that before presenting the European Parliament's budget to the plenary, the Committee on Budgets must reach an agreement with the European Parliament's Office. , a forum in which budgetary concern is not necessarily a priority. The second reality is that despite this constraint, the Committee on Budgets has managed to reduce by more than EUR 18 million the applications initially approved by the Office. I would add, and it is not unimportant, that at the instigation of the Committee on Budgets, and this is a point on which your rapporteur has been heavily involved, the Office last night agreed on a major reform of Members' personal assistants, which was budgetarily known as the secretariat allowance, which is inadequate and which we are proposing to amend.  Under the old system, an MP could spend all of this compensation on the payment of local assistants. Some, moreover, had hired an impressive number and did not hire any accredited assistants. I had felt - I was not the only one - and I still believe that in order to carry out his or her job fully as a legislator and to monitor the action of the executive, a Member must have at least one and, preferably, several accredited assistants, that is, carrying out their activities where Parliament does work.  I thought I had six minutes. Or is it only four minutes? (...) The Office, in its decision yesterday, largely takes this concern into account by allocating at least 25% of the amount made available to each Member of Parliament for the remuneration of accredited assistants. This means that this 25% sum will be frozen and not available if no accredited assistants are hired. Other provisions, which I do not have time to detail here, have been approved; they all are in the direction of greater transparency and a more effective fight against abuse. As a result, changes Article 34 propose the application of reference thresholds for the salaries and fees of local assistants in order to limit the risk of remuneration that deviates excessively from the average remuneration in the Member State concerned. In addition, and in order to better manage operating costs, proposed amendments are being discussed on parliamentary matters. This may seem somewhat marginal, but it is not so if we know that since the beginning of the Parliament, our colleagues have already asked more than 16,000 written questions and that each written question costs Parliament and the Commission a total of EUR 780.  Colleagues, I am aware that there are serious controversies in some of the provisions of this budget. I am also aware that the negotiations that will soon begin with the Council will be close, particularly on the staffing table. But it is with conviction and determination that I will defend with the whole delegation of the European Parliament the choices you will make tomorrow by voting on the budget of the other institutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2838, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Pierre Gramegna", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it is an honour for me to be here today for this debate which is part of a relatively favourable starting point, since we have made good progress so far. We have been able to pass seven amending budgets very quickly and one-eighth is about to be. We have a payment plan to clear the arrears, so we have a serene starting point, which distinguishes this year's situation from last year's.  With regard to the political approach to the amendments that the European Parliament intends to adopt, I must nevertheless stress that the Council notes that there is a significant increase in the draft budget presented by the European Parliament and that its proposals would increase commitment appropriations by more than EUR 4.15 billion and payment appropriations by more than EUR 4.34 billion. Certainly, since the Council's proposal of 4 September, there has been the Commission's amending letter No. 2, which arrived on 14 October and is very welcome, as it aims to strengthen headings 3 and 4 of the multi-year financial framework to respond to the refugee crisis. But even in relation to this revision brought about by the Commission's amending letter, which is also very ambitious, Parliament's amendments still deviate from EUR 2 billion in payments and EUR 2.5 billion in commitments.  Moreover, the substantial credit increases proposed by the European Parliament would result in the ceilings of the multi-year framework being exceeded by a negative margin of -1.5 billion in commitments and -1.3 billion euros in payments. If we followed the european Parliament's amendments, the margins of headings 1a, 1b and 3 would be negative and those in heading 4 would be completely exhausted. It seems to me in this regard that the approach chosen by the European Parliament is maximalist or ambitious in the extreme, and the special instruments that the European Parliament would want to use would not even be sufficient to cover the proposed credit overruns for 2016.  We can certainly agree, as a Council, that it is important to address the political and historical challenges we face, particularly in the area of refugees, but it is still fundamental to realis that there are other priorities as well. The Commission has attempted to respond to this challenge with amending letter 2, which proposes to significantly strengthen headings 3 and 4. During the conciliation procedure, we will have the opportunity to discuss together the extent of the structure proposed by the Commission. The European Parliament has not sufficiently applied the necessary rules to set priorities: not all projects, all programmes can be priorities at the same time. The Council, for its part, has complied, in all headings and in all sub-headings, with the ceilings, and this is how it has been able to give itself the necessary and sufficient leeway. This is good not only for fiscal discipline but also for responding to the challenges and emergencies that lie ahead in 2016. Very quickly on heading 1a, the European Parliament decided to backtrack on the agreement that had been sealed in the middle of the year to make the European Fund for Strategic Investments possible, and that is regrettable. On point 1b, Parliament proposes to increase the endowments while the Commission has found a way to increase the necessary appropriations for Greece on existing endowments in 2015 and 2016: this does not make much sense. On the youth employment initiative, there was an agreement to be limited to 2014 and 2015, and if we wanted to plan for 2016, we would have to do it after an evaluation. For agricultural expenditure, Parliament is proposing an increase of 500 million, while here too the Commission, in its agricultural amending letter, has found different means and in fact even expected a reduction of 477 million in commitments and payments. In conclusion, I would like to stress the importance that the Council attaches to respecting the reduction of staff in all institutions, bodies and agencies, as reflected in the agreement that was concluded and according to the workforce tables of 1 January 2013. This reduction should be made without exception and without any particular or unilateral derogation, it is indeed a matter of the credibility of our institutions. Madam President, dear Members of the European Parliament, you can count on the will of the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council to reach a balanced and satisfactory agreement on the 2016 budget, with intend to do so within the time frames set out in the treaties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2839, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, we are here today to discuss how to make best use of the EU budget to respond to the significant challenges the EU is facing. For the draft budget 2016 we have prioritised three objectives: to boost our economies, fill the investment gap and enhance economic recovery. For this we will leverage our budget instruments. I am very happy to report what we have done together. The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is now operational, and we expect that it will trigger EUR 50 billion in additional investments – public and private – by the end of this year, 2015. For 2016 we expect an acceleration of delivery for our economies. Our second objective is to address the exceptional migratory pressures faced by the EU, and our draft budget proposal makes maximum use of the flexibility allowed. We will therefore more than double funding over this and next year to address the refugee crisis. Our third objective remains very important. It is to phase out the abnormal backlog of unpaid bills from the 2007-2013 programming period by the end of 2016. So in our draft proposal we believe we have put forward a sound basis on which to achieve these three objectives.  Let me first address commitment appropriations, including Amending Letter 2. We welcome the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets to restore the cuts made by Council. Life has shown that we need to move forward in 2016, especially given the dramatic impact of the refugee crisis. We need to provide room for collective EU-level action, in Heading 4 especially. We also take note of a number of amendments that increase commitment appropriations above the draft budget proposal made by the Parliament. We will fully employ the maximum flexibility test that is allowed by the current financial framework to respond to the challenges, and we want to do this in a prudent manner.  We all agree that migration should now be given highest priority. This should guide us through the choices that have to be made and the choices we will have to make. We have to be sure that budget 2016 is done in a way that allows us to face what is unfortunately a more uncertain future. I want to stress that for many in this House there has been concern about the Youth Employment Initiative. As a result of the major frontloading that we have done in 2014 and 2015 – and which will continue and even accelerate in 2016 – we expect to see progress on the ground in terms of jobs for our young people. We will make a first assessment of this experience at the end of this year, and that will allow us to have more informed actions in 2016. Let me now turn to payment appropriations. Here there is a large gap of EUR 4.3 billion between the Council’s and the Parliament’s reading. The level of payment appropriations proposed in draft budget 2016, as revised by Amending Letter number 2 (with more than EUR 914 million in payments) allows the proper implementation of programmes and enables us to meet our third objective, the phasing out of the abnormal backlog in line with the agreed payment plan. This will only happen if Parliament and Council agree on the payments requested by the Commission for 2016.  Again I want to turn to the Parliament’s Committee on Budgets and thank it for the restoration of most of the appropriations that we have put forward. It is now time for us in the Commission to take a very good look at the Council and Parliament proposals and carefully review each and every one of the amendments in detail. We will then send our reaction in writing, prior to the opening of the conciliation, so that the three institutions can negotiate with full knowledge of the choices we are making and the implications of these choices. I will conclude by saying that I am confident that we will have successful negotiations. We all recognise how important it is for Europe that we send a clear signal of commitment to serve our people and to meet the challenges that we face.

I think that we need to support EASO in order that people arriving can have their asylum application properly proceed. I also wonder why Europol should receive the same increase in funding and staff as EASO.

There is an urgent need to give ourselves the financial leeway in relation to the issues of the moment: climate change, the energy transition, the advent of the digital society, industrial recovery, youth employment, the refugee crisis, geopolitical instability in the Middle East and, of course, agriculture, an issue for which I was rapporteur of the budget.

Just 20 million have been pledged so far for each of these funds. The Commission expects 501.8 billion further commitments.

From the point of view of the Union's ability to carry out a coherent foreign policy, and implicitly to influence the international scene, I believe that these budget cuts are extremely worrying. These reductions concern the European Neighbourhood Instrument, the pre-accession instrument, but also the development cooperation instrument, which is used, among other things, to finance European action on immigration.  Faced with the many crises facing the countries of our neighbourhood, faced with the challenge posed by the large number of refugees seeking to flee from countries in conflict, disinvesting is, I think, the worst strategy we could follow.

When representing the Committee on Culture, Education and Sport, I would like to emphasise the four most important things: firstly, as expected by the Commission as a whole, the Erasmus plus, Creative Europe and Europe programmes for citizens have been enlarged. This is very important and I would like to thank you very much for that. The second thing is very important: we are coming down from the old commitments, which is also very important, which is to reduce the commitments that citizens are waiting for. Lastly, a little critical: there is still a lack of funding for pilot programmes, and that is the only thing I would like to mention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2853, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Paul Rübig", "mepid": "2278", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I would also like to express my sincere thanks for the Commission's proposal. It is quite simply important that we have this debate on an equal footing. In future, the Council will have to agree better on the political level, so that, when the negotiations begin, there is a mandate that can also be negotiated seriously with Parliament. The European Parliament also attaches great importance, of course, to the fact that the issue of the economy and employment must be an absolute priority, particularly in the areas of programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, in the COSME programme. We need the 16.5 million new commitments here, including for the employment initiative, especially for the unemployed, but also for the refugees, so that new initiatives can take hold here and so that dual training with apprentices is put at the centre. Europe must set an example here, we must take action here. It is very clear that we need to set new standards in this area, including, of course, refugee policy. We must go through all the budget lines and see how we can support this, how we can achieve stability here, and how we can protect the legally stable area in Europe here. With regard to Parliament's budget, I would just like to say that, of course, the entry of the new group with more than 40 posts and EUR 3.5 million would place more burdenons on the European taxpayer. The fact is that we have at the moment taken enormous savings measures to avoid an increase in the budget here, that we are even below the 20% that we normally have, and that, despite the additional wishes of the new group, which are burdening the taxpayer, we have managed to provide a reasonable and long-term budget here. In the context of the employee pay that we have and the abuse limits that exist here, colleagues who do not want to take advantage of their opportunities should publicly disclose to the public which employees they do not need. Because if they are not present much and do not work a lot, then of course they do not need any employees. This would lead to enormous savings potential.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2854, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Jens Geier", "mepid": "96833", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Mr President, Minister Gramegna, Vice-President Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Rapporteur on the work she has said. First of all, I would like to thank our general rapporteur for excellent cooperation in the pre-litigation process of this debate and our decision-making tomorrow. I do not need to repeat his account, which is fully shared by the Socialist and Democratic Members of my group. The Council must now show its colours. This morning, many group chairmen of this House quite rightly criticised the fact that the Council, in one form, agrees on something politically, with the greatest possible violations, and that the same Council, in its financial formation, subsequently does not finance this agreement. The finance ministers now have a chance to heal this. But the trialogue last Monday afternoon said that tackling the refugee crisis is important, but it is also budgetary discipline. And that, ladies and gentlemen, Minister, cannot be your last word, and not for humanitarian reasons, nor for domestic reasons. I really believe that human lives are more important than budgetary discipline. Secondly, when it comes to the budgetary reasons, the Council's and Parliament's approach is now just EUR 4.3 billion apart. The Commission's amendment no 8 lists revenue in the EU budget from own resources and penalties, which would already cover a large part of this money. The same amending budget lists additional savings for the Member States from gross national income, so that we have a net effect of EUR 8 billion. So: money is there. All that stands in the way of an important EU contribution to alleviating the refugee crisis is the dogmatism of the Member States in budgetary matters. My problem when I hear the Council talking about savings and budgetary discipline is that when it comes to its own interests, it does not take it quite so seriously. I have a major problem with this when we are talking about savings in this House, but at the same time the Council is unable to agree on the reappointment of judges in the European Court of Justice, so that instead of twelve additional judges, we get twenty-eight, because the Member States are unable to agree differently from the fact that each Member State has a second judge's post at the European Court of Justice. Ladies and gentlemen, they do not come on foot, they have drivers, they have secretarial staff, they have staff. So the seriousness – as Mr Böge has already mentioned – on the council's point when it comes to savings, is a bit damaged. Verehrter Herr Minister Gramegna!

She is, as usual, disciplined, controlled and sensible and for that she has my thanks and my full support. She spoke of building a budget on principles. May I suggest too, first, European added value. That means a budget which focuses its resources on those areas where it can help the Member States most. For example: of course we must respond positively and urgently to the refugee crisis and of course we can and must help the farming sector through a very difficult period, but at the same time it is important that we neither get deflected from nor lose sight of the single most important thing the EU budget could be doing for Europe’s citizens, and that is creating jobs and growth. The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is our flagship policy here and it is vital that it delivers this year.  The second policy principle is value for money. We do not have limited resources for the budget, but that does not justify Parliament’s call for an ever bigger budget. The size of the budget was agreed under the terms of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and this is not the time to be going back to the Member States asking for more money. Rather, this is the time for us to see more focus and greater prioritisation in our spending. That means taking the tough decisions. It does mean discipline and it means that we have to do more to ensure effective, efficient delivery.

Mr President, Minister, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft budget for 2016 as adjusted by the Committee on Budgets - and I would like, in this regard, to commend the remarkable work done by the rapporteur-general, José Manuel Fernandes, and by the rapporteur for the other sections, Gérard Deprez - is a budget corseted by the 2014-2020 multi-year financial framework. , supposed to address the problem of the time when it was conceived and adopted; in other words, despite our efforts, this budget is largely a mirror of the past.  Faced with the crises, that of the euro and the over-indebtedness of Greece, and then that of migration, the European Union, deprived of budgetary resources and flexibility, condemns itself to show its weaknesses, even its impotence. Beyond our votes, the prevailing impression is that the European Union can only curb migration flows if the causes of migration are effectively tackled, both by ending violence in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa and by committing a genuine development policy in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it is clear that the 2016 budget does not have the necessary funds to act at the root of population movements that converge on our continent.  And yet, Jean-Claude Juncker reminded us here this morning, in an exceptional situation, an exceptional budget. Beautiful words waiting for action. The first illustration of our indigence is the creation of coastguards and border guards at the external borders of the European Union and is proposed by the heads of state or government. Assuming that the terms of command of these coast guards and border guards are settled, where are the necessary funds? With regard to the refugee camps on the borders of Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Mrs Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker, again this morning, agree that an envelope of three billion is required. Where are the corresponding credits?  At this stage, given the financial situation of most Member States, we must be aware of the difficulties that will mark the opening up of conciliation, Minister. Parliament's vote will give strength to the negotiators who will do everything to convince the Council of the merits of our budgetary options.

Regarding migration, while we support the approach, we still believe, as stated in the resolution on DAB 7 a couple of weeks ago, that in particular the European Asylum Support Office needs to be boosted further.

They reflected well the current concerns with the bad management and rising costs of ITER, as confirmed recently by the German Government.

Some of my colleagues who are here today were with me in Sicily in July and saw how difficult it is to manage this emergency which Italy and the other border countries are unable to support on their own.

Among other things, to an airport in Spain where no one has ever landed, or to a sound screen in Poland, somewhere where no one lives. Moreover, the money is also not spent according to the rules.

Ministers who should, within their governments, take the necessary measures to implement European policies, but do not, decide to shrink the European budget because it is not spent. The Council must ask the Member States to implement European policies. The Commission must intervene and speed up the procedures necessary for the implementation of the budget. The Commission must take a proactive position; should not wait for the actions of the Member States. Negotiations will follow.

That is why what our proposal implies is an increase of EUR 3.6 billion by 2016, which, a priori, may seem like a significant figure, but which, if we look at it with the budget, is only a 2.34% increase. A small increase, a small gesture, but that would allow to have a big impact. Because with this extra EUR 3.6 billion, we could make up for, for example, the cuts we were forced to make for the Juncker plan, and thus be able to meet the research and infrastructure objectives we set ourselves. Or we could also renew the commitment to youth unemployment by funding the Youth Guarantee for another year. Or we could compensate our farmers and ranchers, who are being affected by the Russian veto or the milk crisis. And also, yes, with these 3.6 billion we could finance measures to care in minimum conditions of dignity for those thousands of people who have had to leave their homes. But, Commissioner and Minister, today, beyond this conjunctural debate about whether more money is needed here or there, we must go one step further. Because it is not serious that every time an initiative, a new need, a crisis or an emergency arises, the budget is not agile. It is not serious that a political project such as that of the European Union has ridiculous budgetary capacity and, of course, it is not serious that the Union's resources depend on the goodwill of the Member States. Europe cannot live on the charity of states, but on their commitment. And that is why it is my responsibility, my group and this Parliament, to demand it. Jean Monnet said that Europe would be forced into crises and that it would be the sum of the solutions to these crises.

They fought with vigour and tried with great perseverance to overcome all obstacles, even facing some who we expected would be allies in this effort, who used us to be rich and generous in big words. It is the European Council, which has ultimately proved to be very poor in operations, has proved too poor in sensitivity to serve the objectives of the European Union.

I think it is really incredible to try to get the European Union out of the crisis and in this effort not to be all united and not to fight all of us.  And one very important thing: If we have anything else to deal with in the European Union today, it is bureaucracy. I take advantage of the presence of the Vice-President to tell her that bureaucracy, which costs tens of millions, must be stepped down, and we must know that what we are voting for today does not go to business and to the citizens, because a lot of it goes to bureaucracy, and I will be the happiest of MEPs if next year we come here and have achieved more jobs. , more small and medium-sized enterprises to open up and less red tape.

Therefore, the Council has to understand that insufficient funding of the Union in certain areas poses risks to the Union and leaves it exposed, as was shown in the summer of this year. This is why we cannot understand and should not accept that on the one hand the Council calls for more action in order to tackle the refugee crisis and its causes, while on the other proposing cuts of EUR 50 million for action to reduce poverty in the Mediterranean countries. The Council will tell us that the appropriations in this heading are higher than last year’s budget, but the demand for action and funding is also much higher because conditions have worsened in the Union’s neighbourhood over the past year.

Unfortunately, the Commission chose to finance this plan for growth from the part of the budget that is dedicated to building growth.

In closing, I would like to make four short remarks.  One: the debate today has shown that there is indeed a lot of demand for the European budget and there is pressure on the European budget to deliver on multiple objectives. Many of you have said that what this means is that we have to work together, the three institutions, to prioritise and make sure that funding goes where it is most needed. From the perspective of the Commission, we have been working over the last year to execute our budget best to manage the money we have in the best possible way and then, when we hit a wall – when we run out of money – to look for any possible flexibility we have to meet a demand.  We have always been guided by what you, the Parliament, the Council, and our citizens, are saying – what they expect from us. They expect us to help our economy. They expect from us to deal with crisis when it hits, and let us remember that we now have the refugee crisis, before that it was the Greek crisis, and before that we had nature hitting us very hard, as some of you have mentioned. To deal with long—term development for the Union, and at the same time be agile, be able to respond, is what we have tried to get better at. That takes me to my second point, because we will need it. I do not know what the next crisis is going to be, but I know it will hit us because the world we live in is a fast moving world, and it is shock—prone. Shocks that come for economic reasons and shocks that come because of climate change and conflict. External problems then turn into internal ones and we have to have space in our budget to be able to respond. My third point is on the significance, as we work on this annual budget, of also looking ahead. Looking ahead brings the very important subject of own resources. We will have a report coming: it will be in 2016, when there will be a debate on this topic, and will fit into our next multiannual financial perspective and will be part of our discussion on the mid-term review.  This is my fourth and last point: many of you brought up the mid-term review. Yes, it will be a moment in time when we can seriously address the new challenges in front of us, what we collectively can do, but we will be faced with questions of the kind ‘what is to give’, because when we are faced with new challenges we have to recognise that the resources we have are never going to be unlimited. At the point in time of the mid-term review, we have to be guided by how we can get the best value for the money our citizens are trusting us with, in a changing world where new priorities also have to be integrated. We have our work cut out for us, and I am very much looking forward to the days and nights that are coming ahead for Parliament, the Council and the Commission to come up with the best possible judgement, the best possible budget for 2016.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2892, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Pierre Gramegna", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council.

The first is the Council's position, the second is the position of the European Parliament, and the third, of course, is the Commission's amending letter No. 2, which takes into account the necessary reinforcements of appropriations for the refugee issue.  It is around these three axes that we will have to find a compromise. I am hopeful that we can achieve this through three principles - and I agree with Commissioner Georgieva here. The first is that we have to set priorities. Not everything can be given priority at the same time and to the same degree. With prioritization, we will find a solution.  The second, the Commission has shown us in its amending letter, is that we need to redeploy and make the best use of the flexibilities we have. This will indeed allow us to find compromises.

Employment, but this means the competitiveness of the European Union, but for this we need to support small and medium-sized enterprises, reduce bureaucracy and, by the way, I have come to a conclusion. Neither the Commission nor the Council are available to put a euro in the next 2016 budget so that the Youth Employment Initiative can continue. It is a bad sign that they give young people in the European Union that they need this initiative, even if recast, to continue and in 2016 we will continue to hit us for commitment appropriations for this goal. For our part, there will be every willingness to continue to have the job and the refugee crisis as priorities. I welcome what has been said today by the President of our European Commission, which we have written in several resolutions: for extraordinary situations, we need extraordinary money. What they call redeployment, which they call redeployments, means cutting priorities and we cannot accept that refugees are used to cut policies that are important, nor can we place that responsibility on them. And, as I have always said, refugees are victims, are not guilty and therefore for them are necessary sufficient means and exceptional and additional amounts for that purpose.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2894, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Gérard Deprez", "mepid": "1473", "text": "  Rapporteur.

The last time we met here in this chamber to discuss our common work on the Middle East Peace Process and Israel and Palestine was only six weeks ago. Back then we all agreed on something: that the stalemate in the peace process – indeed the lack of a peace process – could only lead to more violence, and this is what we are seeing today. It has happened time and again and it has been happening in dramatic ways in recent weeks. The new wave of violence and terror is affecting innocent Israelis and Palestinians. There is not, and there cannot be, any excuse for terror. Incitement and violence must end. The response of security forces needs to be proportionate and consistent, regardless of who is the perpetrator. It is now mostly up to the political leaders on the two sides to get out of the current impasse and to show leadership, most of all to show leadership. Showing leadership is much more difficult when the situation gets more difficult, but this is also when it is most needed. Both leaderships have a responsibility to contain the violence and to promote calm. They have an interest in doing this for their own people and they have a general responsibility towards the region and the rest of the word to make sure that the situation does not inflame on the religious level and spread across the globe. Last week I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I met President Abbas in Brussels just yesterday evening to pass on exactly the same message. You need to take leadership, strong positions and first and foremost to try to calm the situation on the ground. And the international community is and will be with you in this respect. They acknowledged that they need to work together in partnership to end the current unrest. And this is something relevant, but also something that needs to be tested for real. Obviously our thoughts today and in these days are with all the victims, with all the families, with all the people that are suffering on the ground. But as we try to de-escalate the crisis we must not lose sight of the underlying causes of tensions, the frustrations, the sense of insecurity, the lack of hope and the lack of a political horizon. Without that political horizon any de-escalation that we might even achieve – as difficult as that may be – will only last for a limited time, and we will go back again and again to the cycle of violence. We said this last year at the end of the conflict in Gaza. We are here one year later saying the same thing. Our first priority must be to build the conditions for final status talks based on mutual steps. For this to happen we need significant policy shifts on the ground. We need this policy shift to happen in line with previous agreements that need to start being implemented. We have to find an entry point to the process for it to start again. By this we mean not only restarting the political process, restarting the talks, restarting negotiations. We, the Israelis and the Palestinian people all know very well that talks for the sake of talks, negotiations for the sake of negotiations, would not bring anything real on the ground unless we create real conditions for the people, firstly, to live and, secondly, to live better, their respective lives. When we talk about this we mean concrete steps in the context of a political process: de-escalating the security aspect, ending violence, implementing concrete steps on the ground in line with prior agreements and creating the conditions for the political horizon. These are three elements we need to work on in parallel with the support of the international community. We mean measures that help the Palestinians take control over their lives and uphold Israel’s security, not just negotiating, not just for the sake of doing something, but to reach concrete results. These goals must be pursued in parallel: de-escalation on the ground, concrete steps to implement agreements that have already been signed and keeping the perspective of the political horizon of the final settlement. These three elements must go together, this is more urgent than ever. In New York last month and in Vienna last Friday the Quartet’s principles articulated this message loud and clear. It was the European Union’s choice to use the Quartet as a format for the international backing of these efforts. From this recent round of meetings, including with Secretary of State Kerry in Berlin, I retain the commitment of Prime Minister Netanyahu to guarantee the status quo in the holy sites and the desire of all parties to de-escalate the situation on the ground. I also welcome and support Secretary of State Kerry’s initiative to address the situation in the holy sites highlighting the role of Jordan in this, which is key. In the next few weeks the Quartet envoys will engage directly with the parties. It is now up to the Israeli and the Palestinian leadership to demonstrate, with acts, that their commitment to the two-state solution is real and not fake, not just a slogan. If Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas now fail to work together, if they do not cooperate to stop the violence, if they do not rebuild a credible political process, the situation will only get worse for their own people. The regional context is as tense as it could be, even if this is a sentence we should never say because it could always turn worse. We do not want to see an old conflict such as this one mix with a newer crisis in the neighbouring countries. The conditions around Israel and Palestine are today much, much more dangerous than they were decades ago. This is a risky time, for the people in Israel and in Palestine alike. And if the leaderships do not understand that now is not ‘business as usual’ in terms of managing this long-established conflict in the way we are all used to – although we never have never got used to a conflict that brings so much death and suffering – and realise that now it more urgent than ever to solve it, then there would be little that the international community could do to support a process. And the mix of old and new, of history and religious elements, at this moment in the region would be explosive, not only for the people involved but for all of us. Peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians is in the interest of all of us, in the region and beyond. It is for this reason that we invited – again on a European initiative – key Arab countries to join our Quartet meetings. Think of how relevant Egypt can be for Gaza and Jordan for the holy places – something we are seeing every day – and Saudi Arabia for relaunching the Arab peace initiative and adapting it to today’s world. Only in a renewed regional framework is peace possible. The Arab partners have stressed to me their readiness to work with the Quartet in the coming months. We have already started to work together with them but, like us, they need to see determined leadership by the parties. We can build all the international and regional support imaginable, but they first have to take responsibility for showing leadership in their own societies and communities.  Recent events should serve as a warning. If anyone still believes that we can just manage the current crisis, contain it a little bit and wait for the next one, they are wrong. This is not going to continue like this. Every cycle of violence is going to be worse than the previous one, and this will destroy the Middle East. So now is decision time. Israeli and Palestinian leaders will have to take a courageous, difficult choice, but this is the only path they have towards peace. They can either move forward or watch cowards prevail in their own societies. This is the message we have been passing on – I have been passing on personally – to the two leaders together with my Quartet colleagues and with my Arab friends. This is the line on which we are all committed to work. I have asked both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas to receive the Quartet envoys in the coming days – not weeks – to start working together on concrete steps that can immediately be taken on the ground to de-escalate on one side and to improve the living conditions of the people. We have to find this entry point because in respect of talks, the big horizon today, I do not see the conditions internally in the two societies to allow the leaderships to invest credibly in this at a time when the security situation as it is and while confidence still needs to be built. First and foremost we need to find this entry point, making sure that at the end of the process the two-state solution is preserved and not pre-judged. We have to help them start implementing issues on the ground that can deliver for the ordinary people on both sides who today are seeing their children dying, albeit in different numbers, so that they can start having a future in their lands.

Mr President, Madam High Representative, I would like to begin by congratulating you on your personal commitment to this issue. Your messages today are very clear, although we would like to have more good news.  That said, the strength of your messages is pragmatism and realism. As you pointed out, the recent acts of violence and tensions, they should be seen in a different light, and perhaps not only to say that this prevents the resumption of negotiations, but rather as an opportunity to engage both sides more in favour of the people. Similarly, internal divisions and extremist views on both sides cannot be cited as obstacles to concrete progress.  But I think that today it is equally important to stress that the leaders of each side must show their will for peace, not only in the face of the international community, but also in their internal discourses by committing citizens to a peaceful two-state solution.  On the other hand, you cautioned us that if the Israeli or internal Palestinian national context does not seem favourable, we must look very carefully at what is happening in the regional context. But again, there may be opportunities here. On the one hand, we have the commitment of Arab countries in the fight against terrorism, on the other hand, we recently had the nuclear agreement with Iran.  Perhaps the question is whether there are possible levers for reviving peace negotiations. Moreover, the Quartet recently highlighted Jordan's role, as you said. But let us also think of the Arab peace initiative, launched in 2002, and what could result from it.

And until a solution is found, the Middle East will be like a crooked tree, undermined by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The violence of recent weeks speaks to us of a lost Palestinian generation, born after Oslo, which has never known the hope of peace. The Role of the Union is to revive this hope. And so we do not need rhetoric: we need action.  We agree with your strategy, Mrs Mogherini. You're doing a wise and valuable job. It is right, as you are doing, to focus on two objectives. Firstly, de-escalation on the ground. Secondly, the resumption of political initiative. Of course, the agreement of these hours on the preservation of the status quo on the esplanade of mosques in Jerusalem is a positive step. We cannot lose Jerusalem. I would also like to point out two cornerstones for the resumption of political initiative. Firstly, Europe, Israel and Palestine now have a common enemy, extremist violence. Which, be ware, coincides not only with Isis, but also with the hate practices of the most extreme wings, Palestinian and Israeli. Secondly, we need two states, an Israeli state and a sovereign Palestine, to meet along the 1967 borders with land exchanges and with Jerusalem, the capital of both states.  But if we want to save Israel and Palestine from war, we must first of all save them from themselves, or rather from their worst forces, from those who work as they worked in the mythical Odyssey Penelope, Ulysses' wife, who, in order to avoid a new marriage, waiting for her husband, unraed the canvas she built during the day. There are forces, in Israel and Palestine, that destroy what is being painstakingly built, and when it almost seems to touch the result, the goal of peace, those forces re-emerge and prevent the goal from being achieved. Israel and the European Union concluded an association agreement in 2000, which covers not only material aspects, but in which both sides have committed themselves to respect for human rights and democracy. The European Union must guarantee this commitment and remind all parties of their historic task: to turn the enemy into a sodal, the fanatic into a moderate, the avenger into a friend.

The criminal actions and the retaliations not only bring additional affliction to the population, but they are endangering the peace process. The only conclusion to the stabbings, car rammings and shooting attacks is that the reality on the ground is not viable today. Violence always leads to more violence. Only positive steps, cooperation and concrete engagement on the ground could bring security improvements and reassurance for the population on both sides. Therefore I welcome your recent efforts, including cooperation with the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, and the role of some EU foreign ministers and a very united and effective Quartet Principles’ meeting in Vienna, which shows the need to speak united, to speak in a single voice, in order to be relevant for the two sides.

As US Secretary Kerry speaks of the possibility of a third Intifada now and with the increasing exchange of rocket attacks within Israel and the West Bank, the situation is looking ever more fragile.

Violence is just the symptom, the problem is occupation. Fifty years of occupation is not a normal situation. It is humiliation, it is exploitation, it is an impossible life for people who have grown up, born and continue to grow and be born in the occupation. After that, the oslo road is created, which is the way nowhere. Oslo's plan is now almost twenty-four years old and leads to no conclusion, because it means the impossible equation that the jailer is negotiating with his prisoner. If you look at the map of Palestine from '47, '67, the current one and after Oslo, you'll see that Palestine is progressively becoming nothing. And in the face of this, to think that the solution is to negotiate between the parties is not to realize that, after Oslo, colonization has doubled in the territories. This is reality, not politics or words. Therefore, in the face of an impossible bilateral negotiation, which the years have shown to be impossible, what the international community has to do is to take its responsibility and establish a definitive plan on two States that means the end of the occupation, with recognized and secure borders, on the parameters of 67, bearing in mind that the international community will have to accept the violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention , that is, colonization, and establishing a seemingly equivalent change of territories, that is, legalizing what already means a violation of international legality. But this is realism. As long as we do not establish strong action by the international community and the European Union, which is the main partner of the two, we will continue to talk every day about violence, which is to talk about nothing.

Of course, there is no alternative to dialogue aimed at a negotiated political solution between the parties. Paralysis or blockage is not an option. It is not a question of managing, but, if possible, of resolving the conflict, and the parties must avoid any action that makes it impossible. But on the other hand, the experience of these years shows us that the parties alone are unable to achieve that goal. They need momentum from the international community and we will need this bilateral negotiation to be accompanied by an international architecture involving not only the consensus of the international community, but also the main players in the region. And, in this sense, the format of the extended Quartet will be the most appropriate formula to accompany that negotiation that makes possible a definitive agreement and the end of the conflict. But, of course, first of all—and you have said it—political will is needed; firstly, the parties, who have to realize that the current situation of blocking no one benefits and that, in short, more frustration, more violence must be avoided, in a region where what is left over are conflict and terror.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2924, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Richard Howitt (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "2073", "text": "   – Madam President, the High Representative has the Socialist and Democratic Group’s support when she calls for talks in days not months, and says that this is decision time and that there must be no fake commitment to a two–state solution.

However, sustained de-escalation can only succeed if both sides disarm in their rhetoric.

And let me say very frankly, as I always tend to be, when we say this is not time for business as usual, that is also for us. Because here we see again and again, even within political families and within the groups, the same split. Some of you ask me to speak with a stronger voice when we condemn acts of terror, which we do, and some of you ask me to have a stronger voice when we call for the end of occupation, which we do. We do both. Please have a look – a serious one – not only at my statements, but also at the most recent statement of the Quartet of just a few days ago, which means that these are common positions, not only of the whole European Union united, but also of the international community through the Quartet. This is a common position that we have built. Let me say that the common position of the European Union and of the international community through the Quartet is much more united than Members are able to manage within their own political groups. This is not the time for us only to call for something or to condemn something. Do we realise that we are in a serious, dramatic situation which could be the end of the Oslo framework? So, if I hear readiness from both sides to work together, to restart talks and to work together in implementing some measures on the ground, I ask you in this room what you think our role as the European Union is:  to condemn and to call for something or to try to bring them to do it? I believe our role is the second one, partly because I do not see many actors pushing to play this role at this moment. There are plenty of other crises competing with this one, and we Europeans are one of the few still focusing very much on this. But we have to do it with the right approach: trying to help them to get out of this bubble. I am also a historian through my studies and I love history, but the problem we have here is that there is too much history. If someone does not help the parties and the people – the Israelis and the Palestinians – and not only them, but the whole region, to get out of the bubble of history and try to look at how to manage the common future they have committed to, nobody else will do it.  So I believe our role is a diplomatic one, which is not a nice exercise in good intentions. It is very hard. It is very tough. It is not naïve. It is a reality check that we have to make here. We risk losing the Oslo framework. Someone said at the beginning of the debate – I think it was Gianni Pittella – that we are losing generations. There are generations in Israel and in Palestine who do not believe in those two states anymore. On both sides, there are young people who believe either in no state at all or in one state only. I believe that the Oslo framework is still a valid perspective for both, with all that goes with it.  But we are at the edge. It is not going to continue like this. So this is what I am trying to do: passing the message to the leadership – and hopefully also to the people, but that is not only my job – that if you say you want two states, either you do something now or it is gone. We do not have the safety net of a plan B. We will have to reinvent it if we leave the Oslo framework. It is no longer about what we call for or what we condemn. If it is done, it is a totally different story. The world does not need another complication in the region. That is why, of all the conflicts we have, to me this is one of the most urgent because its global ramifications go everywhere in the world and the presence of the holy sites makes it even more serious. It is, paradoxically, also a conflict that, if there is enough political will, can be resolved, because they have been discussing for decades how it should look in the end, and there is – as someone rightly pointed out – an Arab peace initiative that can provide a regional framework for security and for peace.  I would invite you to go back to the spirit with which you discussed this issue in September, which was a constructive and useful one that gave us strength last month to gather the international community behind our proposals and our positions and to bring the parties to start looking at whether we can do something together. There are moments where violence is higher, like this one, that could also be the turning point in a crisis because the parties realise that they are risking too much internally. Violence in Israel also comes from the inside. The situation inside the West Bank means that, in my view, both leaderships realise that it is in their interests to tackle this seriously. I might be wrong: it could be that this does not lead anywhere, and then we will need to see, together with our friends in the rest of the international community, what we do about that.  But my role at the moment – and I will ask you, as Europeans, to be united on this – is to try to see if there is one chance for the two sides to start doing  something useful on the ground instead of having their people killing each other, and to facilitate this to happen because we are not going to have many chances in the future. I feel a sense of urgency and that a dramatic moment has come. I do not think that this is just another chapter of a long story.  The situation is different today.  We can come back in another month or another month and a half and discuss our statements, our options, our condemning, whatever. In the meantime, we need to try to bring them together again, together with Arab friends and together with the international community. But this is our work and I am sure that this Parliament will support this effort. This is a crisis where the European Union has a lot to spend in terms of political capacity. I said this exactly one year ago in the hearing in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. This is the crisis where we are the biggest player if we want to transform the money we have spent and the economic, political and cultural relations we have with both sites into political capital. This is what we are strongly building. Obviously this is not completely in our hands because peace cannot be imposed from the outside, but what can be done from the outside is the facilitation and the push for a serious shift of policy to happen. I think that in these dramatic conditions the parties all have interests in doing this for real.

Normally it happens at the end of the debates, not at the beginning, so I will try to go back to my normal tone of voice. I would like to start by thanking Parliament for keeping a focus on South Sudan and for organising this debate. I think it is very important that we keep focused on that.  This is a country where huge hopes faded in the space of just a few years. It is a country that could be rich if it fully used its natural resources but, on the contrary, we have a humanitarian situation that is dire. We have some 30 000 people currently risking death by starvation and thousands more that are on the brink of famine, according to UN data. A million people are internally displaced. Over 700 000 have fled the country. It is one of the biggest refugee crises today, and I would like us to focus on the refugee crises that are happening in the world even when they are happening outside our own borders or regions. Innocent civilians continue to suffer human rights abuses. At least 80 civilians were reportedly killed over the last three weeks and a further 150 civilians have reportedly been killed since Friday 23 October in Unity State alone. Meanwhile, humanitarian organisations still have no access to this area. Sexual violence against women and children has reached shocking levels and these crimes go against the commitments made by all parties in South Sudan: commitments to protect its citizens and put an end to the human rights violations.  The people of South Sudan cannot wait. Justice and reconciliation must be central to our efforts to lay the foundation for sustainable peace. For this reason we welcomed the African Union’s decision to publish the Commission of Inquiry’s report and to move ahead with the establishment of the court. The recent peace agreement offers a really unique opportunity, one that cannot be missed. It is an opportunity for South Sudan to move towards a transparent, accountable government: a government that places the interests of the citizen above all else. And, if properly implemented, the agreement will end the fighting. It will install transitional institutions to rebuild the country. The government’s decision to increase the number of federal states in the country goes against the spirit and the letter of the agreement. The same goes for the reluctance of the opposition to commit to the implementation of the security arrangements. The recent clashes in Unity State and the worrying signs of growing crackdown on civil societies are all very worrying events. Just yesterday in Addis, the parties took a first step to move beyond the current deadlock. This gives us hope that the discussion can get to the next stage. But let me say that a positive conclusion of the dialogue is still not in sight. Only timely implementation of the agreement will lead to real peace, end the suffering of the people of South Sudan and stop the humanitarian tragedy. Spoilers on all sides must understand that there are consequences for their actions, and there will be. There are a number of steps that must be taken now: first, a ceasefire must come into place as a matter of urgency, and second, all obstacles to full and unconditional humanitarian access must be removed immediately. With statehood comes responsibility. Hard work begins now with the implementation of the agreement. South Sudan cannot afford this agreement to follow the same path of all past broken ceasefire agreements. For that, we need to sustain international pressure and cohesion. We all have welcomed the continued efforts of the International Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union in reaching this deal and the constructive engagement of Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia and Kenya. I met exactly one week ago in Addis with the African Union’s Chairperson, Dr Zuma, and with the Ethiopian Prime Minister. We agreed to keep working together to help South Sudan. In the implementation phase regional unity is essential and plays a key role. With regard to the regional challenges, I recall the conclusions adopted yesterday by the Council of the EU/Horn of Africa Regional Action Plan 2015—2020 which outlines the European Union’s comprehensive approach to address the key issues in the region. It will also need a strong monitoring body representing the South Sudanese civil society together with regional and international players. In this context, the appointment of President Mogae as chair of the joint monitoring body is good news. His leadership will be essential to guide the implementation phase. The EU will continue to stand by the South Sudanese people during the transitional process. We have done so since the outbreak of fighting in December 2013. We worked to bring an end to the fighting and initiate a political transition and we provided massive humanitarian assistance. In 2014, the Commission’s humanitarian support exceeded EUR 116 million. This year our aid has already reached EUR 107 million. The United Nations calculated that the European Union as a whole, including Member States, funded almost 41% of all humanitarian donations to people in need in South Sudan this year, and in total over 3.1 million vulnerable people benefitted from life-saving assistance in South Sudan this year. But we know very well that humanitarian assistance alone cannot substitute for sound development programmes.  Not only is the EU contributing to humanitarian assistance, it also supports the implementation of the peace agreement across its five pillars. The support will originate mainly from the EDF national programme, but for pillars one and two, namely governance and security, the support will originate from the instrument contributing to stability and peace and the African Peace facility, respectively. We are now ready to work with a transitional government of national unity. We can help establish the transitional institutions and develop sound policies for rebuilding the country. This will include responsible, transparent and equitable management of South Sudan’s vast resources. It is time that these resources are used for the benefit of the population as a whole. Ratifying the Cotonou Agreement would be a sign of South Sudan’s will to announce its relation with the European Union, but right now it is urgent that all South Sudanese parties commit to implementing the agreement. This is the key step we need now, and this is what we have discussed with the regional players last week as our common horizon to work on this together.

It is an ambitious agreement which seeks to secure a permanent ceasefire and to put an end to impunity but also to manage better the country’s oil revenues. However, although the content is good, we all know that the worrying part is that commitment to this deal it is extremely weak and the fighting continues. Political leaders in South Sudan clearly do not care much about their own population but rather, I am afraid, about their villas and bank accounts outside the country.  I believe that a sustainable deal on ceasefire and other elements will only be achieved if we use the threat of targeted sanctions against the political leaders who do not stick to the agreement. The EU should reconsider imposing the arms embargo as well. On the positive side, I am glad that the African Union has released today the report of its Commission of inquiry on South Sudan. My questions to you, Vice President/High Representative, are what is the EU strategy to make sure South Sudan’s warring parties stick to the agreement, and not only to the ceasefire agreement but also to the other provisions regarding impunity and oil management? Also, you mentioned civil society, but does the EU plan to work closely with local grass—roots organisations to monitor the effective implementation of the agreement?

For the security side, both sides must refrain from taking contradictory steps in the spirit of the peace process. Second, the role of South Sudan's regional partners and the international community remains key. On the one hand, for IGAD and the African Union, in order to closely monitor the implementation of the agreement, and on the other hand, to deal with the humanitarian horror. The international community must continue to assist people displaced and threatened by famine. The protection of children must also remain a priority of international aid for this country today and in the future.  Third, the fight against impunity. It is a key element in the construction of South Sudan, including the demobilization of the armed forces and the creation of a single army. Perpetrators of serious human rights violations must not be able to reintegrate into the military or be part of a transitional government, especially given the extent of sexual violence in the conflict.

I hope very much that by raising the issue of South Sudan tonight we are showing that we care and are asking you to help us do something about what has become one of the world’s forgotten crises.  You mentioned some of the difficulties. NGOs on the ground have written to MEPs talking about thousands of civilians killed, thousands of women raped and children abducted. This weekend the UN agencies – the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization and UNICEF – warned of imminent famine. So we have got to do something.

What can we do about it? How can we get tough? Colleagues spoke about arms embargoes, sanctions, and sanctions against the right people; not at the low level, but the most senior representatives. Can we have sanctions and will they bite? Have they been discussed with our partners, like the United States, and also can we have projects to give women a voice in this country? If they had a voice, I think some of the policies could change.

I have found it helpful in relation to the work we have to do.  On the one hand – conscious of the fact that we have a role to play in this crisis, but that our role is very much in support of and in coordination with the regional players, starting with the African Union – I completely agree with all of you who mentioned the work with regional and international players as the strong point of our action in this crisis. There are two sides to the task. Firstly, the humanitarian side needs to remain the focus of our work: we have a responsibility, as by far the leading humanitarian contributor in the crisis, and again I would underline the need to keep our attention focused on humanitarian refugee crises that are apparently far away from our borders. Moreover, this is not only a matter of moral responsibility and human responsibility, it is also a matter of investment in stability and in the future for a large part of the world’s population. Secondly, on the political track, with regard to the implementation of the agreement, I would point out that this is an agreement signed under difficult circumstances, in a very fragile situation. As I said in my opening statement, the international community must continue, and we must continue, to support the people of South Sudan as the implementation of the peace process begins.  More than anything, the leaders of the country have to exercise full responsibility. On both sides – as many of you mentioned – there are spoilers. There are interests opposing the agreement, and they must be told loud and clear that if they do not implement the agreement they will be held responsible for the consequences of their actions. That message has to come clearly and in unison from all of us. Only a concerted effort by political leaders will bring an end to the suffering of the people in South Sudan and enable them to live in peace.

In 2010, these same regions offered in the Committee of the Regions the Strategy of the European Union, which we wanted to have on the Adriatic, along the lines of the Baltic Strategy and later on the Danube Strategy. In 2015, meaning ten years after that, the Italian Presidency launched a strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Seas and today we have this strategy that we are discussing.  We have four member states that are part of that strategy, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia and Greece, and we have four countries that are candidate countries. They are Serbia, Montenegro and Albania and potential candidate country Bosnia and Herzegovina. This only shows how important this strategy is and how partially and complicated it is on the other hand, as of course it is also a kind of laboratory for non-EU countries and for their entry into the European Union.  However, this strategy knows the four pillars. He knows the pillar of infrastructure, as one of the key pillars coordinated by Italy and Serbia, and I would like to emphasize in particular the exceptional importance I attach to connecting the region. Namely, we undoubtedly need corridors such as the Adriatic-Ionian Corridor, both the one on the western part, therefore practically in Italy and the one that is in the eastern part, the one that goes in some way from Trieste to Igumenica, and on to Athens. We also need a connection that goes from west to east and east to west, from the Iberian Peninsula, which connects to the Apennine peninsula and then to the Balkan Peninsula.  Another important pillar is tourism and here I want to highlight the problem of short seasonality of our tourism where it is culture, agriculture and many other new products that can solve this seasonality, which is what we are talking about in our strategy.  Blue growth, shipbuilding is almost forgotten. Let's get back to shipbuilding. Shipbuilding is a good European industry and I think that's what we need to talk about. Of course, aquaculture as something we know well in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. Pillar 4 is environmental protection. We're all very sensitive to the environment. We all care that our Adriatic and our Ionian Sea are clear sea and that we protect it as much as possible than especially exploits that we can some way predict at the moment. In the future we must do everything to protect our Adriatic.  What I want to highlight in particular at the moment is the fact that the area this European Union strategy is talking about is the area where we are dealing with the migrant and refugee problem. And I want to kind of thank all those individuals, ordinary citizens who are helping us overcome this great crisis, this difficult situation. Of course, in this context, all countries participating in this are extremely important and extremely important and it is good that Juncker called this meeting in Brussels because it was important to talk about the refugee problem at this level as well. I repeat, the Western Balkans and on this occasion shows how important it is for the European Union, and that is why I want us all together and how seriously we think about how we will embrace the Western Balkans and all countries that are not yet members into our society called the European Union.  Finally, I would like to thank all my colleagues and colleagues with whom I have collaborated on this strategy, for this report and I hope to continue our cooperation soon .", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2984, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Fernando Ruas", "mepid": "124730", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken this own-initiative report with enthusiasm. I was mayor for 24 years and also president of the National Association of Portuguese Municipalities for 12 years. In these roles, and also, fundamentally, as a citizen of a Member State of cohesion, I have learned to respect and therefore implement the Structural and Investment Funds in my country.  Cohesion policy, aligned in this multiannual financial framework with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, has been the European Union's main development tool. Indeed, its objectives of reducing disparities between European regions and promoting convergence have contributed to a more harmonious development of our Union, and should also stress that, in the previous Community framework, cohesion policy was, in many of our Member States, practically the only source of investment in the territory. That is why, in good time, and in an effort to anticipate the dialogue and interinstitutional reflection that we have started today with the Commission on the revision of the Europe 2020 strategy, the REGI Commission has decided to make its position on the matter known. Commissioner, I hope that this position will also be the European Parliament's position on cohesion policy and the revision of the Europe 2020 strategy from tomorrow.  So, in a nutshell, we would like to have a balanced and intelligent review of the strategy, focusing on a greater interconnection between its five objectives and its flagship initiatives, as well as the possibility of voluntary differentiated regional targets for the strategy, discussed at regional level, greater accuracy in the progress indicators provided by Eurostat at NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 level and a strong focus on multilevel governance and the importance of ownership and ownership implementation, on the ground, of the strategy by all its actors. In this context, moreover, it is important to us to have a pact between regional authorities and the European institutions to ensure the ownership and participation of these important administrative actors in the strategy, as well as the adoption of a code of conduct, in line with the one already adopted in the context of cohesion policy, and the timely involvement of the European Parliament in all relevant discussions , aiming at the design of the policies covered by the strategy, its implementation and also its evaluation. The review of the strategy should also promote greater coordination and strengthening of synergies between cohesion policy and horizon 2020 funds, with a view to achieving the goals and objectives of the strategy itself, as well as the recognition of the important role of small, medium or large cities and urban areas and, in particular, urban people for the future of the Europe 2020 strategy.  It is important to underline the relevance of the european union's new investment instrument, the European Strategic Investment Fund, known as the Juncker Plan, which will already mobilise a maximum of EUR 315 billion in investments, with the aim of reducing the investment gap in the European Union and also maximising the impact of public expenditure, but stressing that it should always be complementary and additional to the European Structural and Investment Funds. In conclusion, I hope and hope that there will be no regrettable delays in the start-up of cohesion policy implementation at the beginning of the current financial framework. Thus, both cohesion policy and the european Union's next long-term strategy should be drawn up before the end of the european Commission's current mandate. On this issue, I would also like to remind you that there will also be elections to the European Parliament in 2019, which will place significant temporary restrictions not only on the co-legislators – for example, on the timing of the negotiations – but also for the next Commission and even the Member States, with regard to the preparation and approval of the new agreements and the partnerships of operational programmes, which is of course expected to happen before the start of the next Community framework.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2985, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "José Blanco López", "mepid": "125044", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, during the last parliamentary term one of the most controversial aspects of the negotiation process of the Regulation on common provisions of the Structural and Investment Funds was the so-called 'macroeconomic conditionality' of Article 23. I would like to begin by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs and their political groups for their availability and collaboration throughout the extensive negotiation process, which has enabled the agreement contained in this report. We are all concerned about the practical implications of rescheduling and suspension of funds that macro-conditionality can lead to.  Considering a moment of crisis such as the current one, which has led to a sharp decline in investment, cohesion policy is key in maintaining the level of investment of Member States and their regions, in particular for improving employment. We therefore understand that macroeconomic conditionality should be considered as a last resort that responds to the sole objective of contributing to more effective implementation of funds. That is, any decision under Article 23 can be taken only in exceptional contexts, and must be well weighted and thoroughly justified, in order to ensure its transparency, verification and review. And so it is reflected in this report. As enshrined therein, the achievement of the objectives of the Structural and Investment Funds should not be hampered by economic governance mechanisms, which prevents them from being recognized in contributing to a stable macroeconomic environment and an efficient and results-oriented cohesion policy. In addition, in this report I wanted to highlight something that was not the subject of the Commission Communication: the role that Parliament had to play in democratising this decision much more. And, therefore, good institutional coordination is essential to ensure complementarity in the interaction between cohesion and good economic governance. In this regard, I have given particular attention to the participation of the European Parliament in the event of the activation of macro-conditionality, lamenting the Commission's guidelines, which do not contain any reference to it. Commission, Council and Parliament must engage in a structured dialogue, at interinstitutional level, ensuring constant and clear collaboration and an adequate flow of information throughout the process. Parliament must be informed immediately of any request for rescheduling and suspension of payments, so that it can express its position in a timely manner and that it be taken into account by the Commission, of whom we will demand accountability. We also call for an early warning approach to the Member States affected by rescheduling, while calling on the Commission to carry out, in close cooperation with the Member State concerned, a comprehensive analysis of all options other than the application of Article 23, which only has to be applied as an exceptional case and at the last minute. These are some of the principles and aspects and demands that I would like to highlight in this first intervention. It is therefore a report which I think is balanced and, moreover, that is aimed — and I set out in particular on this — for the fairest and most democratic application possible of what is contained in Article 23. I was against Article 23. Now is not the time for that discussion. Now the discussion is how Article 23 can be applied to make its application as fair and democratic as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2986, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Younous Omarjee", "mepid": "30482", "text": "  Author. Mr President, Commissioner, it is on behalf of the REGI Committee that I speak to present the question of the simplification and effectiveness of cohesion policy for 2014-2020. I will leave it to my colleagues to give the impression on behalf of our group. With the new multi-year financial framework launched on 1 January 2014, a new period has begun for cohesion policy. Much has been done, as we all know, but just because certain progress - it is true - has not been achieved that we must therefore consider that our work is finished. Our legislative work, on the other hand, is only getting stronger with the implementation of the new period of cohesion policy planning and, with it, a number of concerns have arisen.  For almost two years now, the beneficiaries have told us about the difficulties they face on a daily basis. We, therefore, as legislators, are confronted with our role in observing and monitoring the implementation of this policy in all European regions. We intend to play this role fully, Commissioner, and that is why we have increased the number of hearings, exchanges of views and field missions. We need to do this not only to support the beneficiaries, but also to know what mistakes to avoid in the future and what we could correct either in the mid-term review or for the new programming period that needs to be well prepared.  About two weeks ago, the Committee on Regional Development held a hearing on simplification, and the observation is still the same: it is always very difficult to navigate the maze of administrative meanders. We must recognise, Commissioner, that the Commission is showing good will to solve this problem, and the creation of the group of independent experts is proof of this. The first meeting of this group took place - as you know - seven days ago and identified three main challenges for the coming year. This is a sign that some obstacles have been known to us for a very long time and also that work is progressing very quickly. I also tend to believe that we, the European parliamentarians, have indeed been aware of these problems for a very long time, and these obstacles on the way to an effective implementation of cohesion policy on the ground are still, admittedly, very numerous. This is true for fund management at European level, but it is also true at Member State level, at regional and local level. I would just like, if I may, to quote a sentence heard at our recent hearing. It has been said that each new group, every new group, more explanations and more expertise to navigate each new text, is needed. In reality, very often, no one finds themselves there because there is a tendency to complexity rather than simplification. The Juncker Commission's credo is to legislate less and legislate better, which amounts to simpler and more effective regulation. In this respect, the European Parliament, in its role as co-legislator, will also have to assess where we ourselves have complicated rules that are already complex and added sometimes superfluous layers.  We also know that there is a contradiction between the objective we all proclaim and the growing tendency to strengthen controls, to favour discipline, to monitor and punish. The less trust between the European institutions and the beneficiaries, the more red tape increases. We must also try to ensure that the principle of proportionality is respected. The larger the sums incurred or spent, the more complex the procedures can be, if only to ensure the appropriate use of the funds and avoid any risk of irregularities. And I will end, Commissioner, by telling you how committed we are to establishing a structured dialogue with our committee, of course, but also with all the actors, and in particular the Committee of the Regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2987, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Corina Crețu", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, it is a pleasure for me to be here this evening. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ruas, Mr Blanco López and Mr Jakovčić for the three important reports we are discussing today. I would also like to thank Mr Omarjee for his comments on simplification.  As you know, this Commission has been appointed with a clear mandate to work for a new beginning for Europe, based on ten major political priorities and, of course, the European Structural and Investment Funds actively contribute to many of these priorities, as is reflected in the three reports we are discussing today: the review of the Europe 2020 strategy , good economic governance and the current state of play of the EU strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Regions. Let me start by talking briefly about these reports, after which I will also refer to the current simplification process. Firstly, Mr Ruas's report, the EU 2020 strategy; the strategy targets five specific objectives in the following areas: employment, innovation, climate change and energy sustainability, education, as well as combating poverty and social exclusion. Unfortunately, the consequences of the economic crisis, such as rising unemployment and the very slow economic recovery, have been a real obstacle to achieving these objectives. In this context, the Commission has started a process of reflection on the future of this strategy. Last year we launched a public consultation which showed that the Europe 2020 strategy and its objectives are still very relevant, but also that we still have a long way to go to achieve our proposed objectives. I would like to welcome the suggestions by Mr Ruas, the rapporteur, on improving knowledge and the need for local and regional authorities, Member States and all stakeholders to take responsibility, and I urge you, surely, together, to continue to mobilise national parliaments in this regard. of these funds. These provisions have been established with the aim of increasing the efficiency of European funds and, in this context, partnership agreements and operational programmes have already been gended in line with country-specific recommendations. The European Commission will therefore only use its reprogramming powers when it can have a real impact on the implementation of country-specific recommendations. In the same vein, I would like to remind you that last week the Commission communication on the steps to be taken to complete Europe's economic and monetary union was adopted. As I have said before in this Chamber, if one of the conditions for a possible suspension of the Structural and Investment Funds is met, the European Commission will immediately inform Parliament, and I totally agree with Mr Blanco López in this respect. With regard to the Adriatic-Ionian macro-regional strategy, I am pleased to say that this is the third macro-regional strategy of the European Union. Exactly a year ago I was present in Milan to launch this strategy. It was adopted last year. It aims to promote sustainable economic and social prosperity in the region and contribute to the integration into the European Union of the western Balkan countries, and I welcome your report, Mr Jakovčić, which includes several valuable recommendations detailed. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that we, the European Commission, are ready to help implement the strategy, but, in order to ensure its success, a few conditions are needed. Firstly, participating countries take responsibility and firm commitment in support of this strategy, allocating sufficient resources and administrative resources. Secondly, national and regional policies, investment plans and allocated funds must be in line with the objectives of the strategy and, thirdly, civil society must be effectively involved in the implementation of the strategy, as well as national and regional parliaments. You have also raised the possibility that these macro-regions will contribute more to solving and mitigating the consequences of the refugee crisis. I want to tell you that, indeed, I believe that we can exploit more to the extent that these macro-regions can contribute to this issue. I would just like to inform you on this subject that, together with the auditors, we have made a list of possibilities from the regional development, what kind of projects can be made from regional development funds for refugee accommodation, for mobile hospitals, sanitary facilities, water supply, in the medium and long term, and I want to reiterate that we are taking into account any proposal from the Member States, but it is indeed the obligation of the Member States to tell us to what extent I think it is necessary to change the financial allocations for this purpose. So far, we have only received a request from Italy and already EUR 220 million has been redirected from the Regional Development Fund to finance migrant accommodation centres and coastal patrols. In any case, I sent a letter to all the ministers of the European funds last week, informing them of these possibilities. With regard to simplification, I would like to assure you all and, in particular, Mr Omarjee, who raised this issue, that it is a common concern of us, the European Parliament and the European Commission, we want, like you, to ensure effective and efficient management of European funds. Simplification of funds is one of the Commission's objectives for better regulation and a European Union budget focused on results.  The High-Level Group on Simplification has been created, as you said, precisely for this purpose, has started to work and make recommendations for concrete actions that can maximise the potential for simplification in the current programming period. As you mentioned in your oral question, I can confirm that the high-level group will look at e-cohesion, access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises, which I think is a very important subject, cost simplification and excessive regulation, what we call the goldplating phenomenon at national level. You know very well that there are projects where 20-30 signatures are needed, but this is not a request from the European Commission. But I believe that a simplification of success also depends on the commitment of the Member States to simplify their own rules imposed at national level. I would like to continue working with the European Parliament. As you know, the REGI Committee was represented at the first meeting of the High Level Group by a Vice-President and of course we will inform Parliament of the work of the High Level Group on a regular basis.  I would also like to take this opportunity to launch your invitation, together, from the coming period, to think about the reform of this cohesion policy, post-2020 reform. I believe that this debate must start as early as next year.

Back then, we were in completely different functions, in local, regional self-government. This strategy for the Adriatic-Ionian Macro-Region aims to enable the region's 70 million inhabitants to take advantage of closer cooperation in areas such as promoting the maritime economy, preserving the marine environment, completing transport and energy networks and fostering sustainable tourism. It is worth pointing out today that this is the first macroeconomic strategy of the European Union with such a share of non-EU countries such as Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, which are candidates, and Bosnia and Herzegovina as a potential candidate, and which cooperate with Member States such as Croatia, Greece, Italy and Slovenia. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo issue remains undefined.  I put special emphasis in the opinion for which I was in charge on behalf of the foreign affairs committee on the transport connections of states involved in road and railway infrastructure projects, including the Adriatic-Ionian corridor, and thus the Peljesac Bridge in the south of Croatia with the aim of reducing differences and shortcomings in the infrastructure of these countries.

Firstly, because social and cohesion policy is the only policy of strong solidarity of distribution, of redistribution of income that the European Union has. Establishing, as I say, macro-conditionality in cohesion policy is not only a spectacle, but is an inapplicable error. You yourself have demonstrated this with the latest decisions that have been taken in the case of Greece. Secondly, because withdrawing funds means going against social cohesion means further damaging territorial convergence and also entails charging a countercyclical element of boosting economic growth by the European Union to the Member States that are having the worst time.

We reiterate that the promotion of the region's economic and social prosperity must not be pursued at the expense of ecological balance, biodiversity and natural resources.

The four pillars of this macro-region are basic: blue growth, that is to say, promoting sea-related economic growth, linked to the rest of the economy. Integration in the region, both in terms of transport corridors, rail, road, sea corridors, opportunities of north Adriatic port in the area.  We talked about energy connections, we also talked about the environment as a key parameter for a good living environment and, of course, sustainable tourism.

Thank you, Mr President, Thank you, Commissioner. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Fernando Ruas.  He has presented an excellent report on cohesion policy and the review of the Europe 2020 strategy. On the one hand, this is an important inventory of what has already happened in recent years within the framework of structural policy and this strategy. On the other hand, it is already the beginning of a debate on a future cohesion policy, and we must indeed begin to do so now. With the new funding period, we see very clearly that investments in infrastructure projects, including telecommunications projects, investment in research and technology, support for SMEs, sustainable development, the important components of this cohesion policy in investing in the labour market and also the fight against unemployment are important components of this very cohesion policy, to single out just a few issues. We will continue to need such investments in the future in order to support the regions, towns and cities. This cannot be done only through an investment plan, as presented by Mr Juncker. This really requires the involvement of local people in the regions and the direct appeal of citizens in the regions. Only cohesion policy can do that.  The fact that all regions can participate in it according to their capacity is also an important part of such a cohesion policy based on solidarity, which we need in the future. However, our efforts in the old parliamentary term to simplify procedures in the new funding period seem to have been only partially successful, with complaints coming from both the administrative bodies and the applicants. This cannot be ignored, especially when you consider that we say that we have flattened administrative costs in the European Regional Fund.  If we are then shown in the hearing that we now need a thick book to explain what the administrative costs are, then that is over.

The European approach based on macro-regional cooperation is more cost-effective and effective than the 28 national approaches and it is this report that is of great importance, as it recognises and underlines the importance of macro-regional strategies, which are a tool for European integration and an example of cross-border cooperation with a view to territorial cohesion of areas that share common challenges. In order to achieve a sustainable and stable Adriatic-Ionian macroregion, it is essential to enhance sustainable cross-border cooperation and quality macroregion management. To maximise potential, cooperation between macro-regions needs to be achieved.  This is the only way we will optimally achieve the fulfilment of the core objectives of each macro-regional strategy. Optimal exploitation of the potential of renewable energy sources and transport connectivity within the macro-climate itself contribute to the stated objectives. It is necessary to provide intermodal infrastructure in order to connect states and develop energy, but we should take into account the protection of the environment and the sustainability of individual projects. I am extremely pleased with the compromise reached where my amendment regarding oil and gas exploration and exploitation in the Adriatic has been respected, especially in areas of high risk to the environment.

Our joint effort in drafting the report on these guidelines was to set out the space in which the European Commission can move in the application of Article 23, in particular by naming and responding to the risks that occur. What is crucial is the requirement that the Commission be as judicious as possible in applying this provision and that reprogramming should only take place in the most necessary cases. There should always be scope for expression from local and regional authorities. In the draft report, we also talk about the fact that the Council should be in a special composition for cohesion policy to decide under Article 23.

Among the proposals made in the current oral question, I would now like to draw attention to the need to find an optimal balance between simplification and accountability. It is important that potential beneficiaries of cohesion policy submit all the data and information during the application process that demonstrates their right to UNION support and, where appropriate, in public procurement, meet the requirements of conflicts of interest, while not expecting information that only complicates the process and complicates its implementation, and is ultimately a barrier to effectiveness.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3022, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Massimo Paolucci (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124849", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, macro-regions represent an important institutional innovation, a concrete instrument for reducing the distance between Europe and its citizens.

Madam President, I propose five simple thoughts that will help to increase absorption, especially now that we are dealing with bureaucracy. First of all, the convergence of procedures throughout cohesion policy should proceed quickly, so that we have a single management framework and thus not confuse either the beneficiaries or the managing authorities. Then avoid multiple controls, which also have dubious results in tackling fraud, while at the same time having an immediate and exemplary response to methodical fraud. To have zero tolerance for corruption, to use all means to fight corruption at all levels of the European Union. To proceed immediately with the implementation of the 'e-Cohesion', which will also help to reduce the management burden but will also allow the electronic exchange of data between beneficiaries and managing authorities. Finally, consider setting up a register of beneficiaries and, in the long term, even a register of contractors, in order to reduce the red tape of submitting programmes to the European Union and monitoring funded projects.

Mr Ruas' report, the EU 2020 strategy and discussions on the Europe 2020 strategy and a long-term vision of it are ongoing. Last month, the European Commission held a policy debate within the College and is currently in the process of collecting contributions from stakeholders and, of course, the report is an important contribution in this regard. You will receive them as soon as possible. With regard to Mr Blanco López's report, as I mentioned earlier in my presentation, I would like to reconfirm that we will apply the powers of the reprogramming committee only under the current regulation; You are well aware that this has been voted on by the European Parliament and the Council, as co-legislators, and of course we will be in constant contact, as the European Commission, with the European Parliament.  With regard to Mr Jakovčić's report on the strategy for the Adriatic-Ionian region, I would like to highlight, in particular, one issue that was addressed by Mr Jakovčić: if we want to have results within the objectives proposed by the strategy, then the firm commitment and responsibility of all stakeholders is absolutely necessary. I would like to make a few more comments, because there has been a lot of discussion and I really appreciate all the contributions. I would like to say to Mr Bogovič that, with regard to Slovenia, we are aware of the enormous challenge on the Member States. I believe that Slovenia is remarkably coping with the current situation, and Sunday's summit was indeed an exercise in solidarity between the countries facing this unique situation, and I would like to congratulate the national, local, people authorities, on this effort. The European Commission is at the disposal of all Member States to help and to see to what extent we can contribute to having synergies between the Regional Development Fund, we are working closely with Mrs Thyssen, the Social Fund and also with Mr Avramopoulos, who is responsible for the Asylum and Migration Fund. I particularly wanted to make this point because Slovenia is a small country which, fortunately, is doing remarkably well with this problem.  Many of the speakers, among colleagues, raised the issue of bureaucracy. It is, indeed, a big problem. I would like everyone who can make their contribution to come up with proposals. As I said at the beginning, I think we will have to talk about what cohesion policy will look like after 2020, because now we have this Regulation, which is sometimes very complicated, but we have to do everything we can and, for this programming period, maximise the impact of European funds. I do not agree with those who talk about the fact that cohesion policy would be a transfer or an act of charity, it is an exercise in solidarity, which translates into a lot of visible things and hundreds of jobs, and I would link myself here to the example of Greece that several speakers have raised, Mr Papadimoulis. Greece is the country where we can practically see this contribution of cohesion policy. He asked me how cohesion policy could create jobs. I want to tell you that cohesion policy has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in Greece since 1981, when Greece was a member of the European Union, and you can see in any of Greece's regions motorways made for European money. We have done more than a thousand kilometres in five regions of Greece, not even a single kilometre was made without European funds: motorways, roads, schools, bridges, such as the one linking the Peloponnese with mainland Greece. So the results of cohesion policy are visible in Greece and, as you know, I personally came to the REGI Committee to adopt the exceptional measures. I believe that now, with this 100% co-financing for Greece, there is no longer any excuse to unlock major projects such as the Thessaloniki metro or waste management projects, because, as you know, after you approved these exceptional measures in the European Parliament and were also approved by the Council, Greece received this liquidity injection , so I congratulate you once again for all the reports. I would just like to add that I am very grateful for the European Parliament's support and contribution to the simplification agenda and I would like to sure Members that the Commission will continue its dialogue with Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and other stakeholders because in fact it is a common and our common goal is to have effective implementation. This is the most important thing.

I believe it's a good start. However, our expectations are far higher. Our expectations when we talk about structural or cohesion policy are extremely large, you have mentioned Greece yourself at the moment, but other countries also have a need for what you can do for these countries and for the whole macroregion. Also, I want to point out that perhaps the key basic problem that I see in the future is who will own (owner), how we will solve the ownership of this macro-regional strategy and otherwise macro-regional strategies.  This is a key problem, because after we adopt this report, after everything we have all done together, how we will further manage the processes. In this context, I think we have to make a very precise decision, because we leave everything to the states. leave in some way only to the Commission or only to Parliament, to Parliament most likely not, but leaving it only to the states will not solve the problem.

This is, I repeat, a balanced report aimed at a fair and balanced implementation of the possible mechanism of Article 23. Throughout my political life, if there is one thing I have worked for, it has been for social and territorial cohesion, for the cohesion of people and territories, and this report is moving in precisely that direction. And it is precisely moving forward with broad consensus, since even those groups which, such as the GUE/NGL, have tabled an amendment to the report itself, have abstained in committee, which shows that this report is a fairly balanced, fairly fair and quite advanced report. In addition, I would like to tell you, from my perspective, and this is reflected in the document, that Article 23 cannot serve to exclude from the funds — Mr Juaristi referred to this — in the deterioration of his situation, those who cannot invest or attract investment. That is, those who face socio-economic difficulties and have the funds as a significant part of their investment should not suffer additional damage. I therefore reject, and I want to say this quite clearly, that local regions or authorities — as well as the citizens themselves beneficiaries of the funds — may be paralyzed as a result of macroeconomic non-compliance at a central level of the Administration. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that frequent rescheduling would be counterproductive. It should therefore be avoided in order not to disrupt the management of funds, nor to undermine the stability and predictability of the multiannual investment strategy, while to avoid any negative effect on the absorption of funds.

No European issues are discussed during the electoral campaign and the European dimension of this democratic process is not sufficiently visible. That is why we have proposed a change to the European Electoral Act of 1976. In the proposal, we give the European Parliament the right to decide on the date of the election. We ask Member States to ensure that all citizens working or living outside the European Union are granted the right to vote and enabled to do. We also propose machinery to avoid double voting. We are asking Member States to create the conditions for voting by electronic means, via the internet or by post. People with reduced mobility will certainly benefit.

That is why we are now making a new attempt to make proposals for the next European elections in 2019, in order to make them more transparent and democratic and, it must be said, to make them more European. Mrs Hübner has already pointed out that we want to make recommendations to the Member States and also to change the 1976 electoral act. The recommendations are about broadening access to the European elections. We believe that the young generation should be invited to take part in these elections. Many young people could go to the European elections for the first time at the age of 16. Such a turnout may mark their lives for a long time to come. We therefore believe that the Member States should look at how Austria has already done to reduce the voting age to 16. I also believe that the younger generation is the Internet generation that would rather do an election act with one click than go to the town hall or a school building. This, too, can be examined, into the future. Postal voting is also not allowed in many countries. Not everyone is at home on Sunday or Election Day. Postal voting has helped in many countries. The serious preparation of the European elections is another matter. We have noticed that in some countries the electoral lists are not completed until 17 days before the election. I don't know how to campaign , 17 days before the election. We now say: at least twelve weeks. You can then campaign for three months in the rather large constituencies that we all represent. Above all, we want to highlight the European nature of the European elections. We often have national debates, national disputes, and the European dimension is totally lost. This must be made visible, in TV commercials, on campaign materials, on the ballot papers, and if it is the case nationally that the names of the parties appear there, the European party families should also appear. Above all, the European parties should also determine their top candidates for the office of President of the Commission in good time – at least twelve weeks – before the election. A huge step forward would be gender equality; we think that fifty-fifty can be achieved. Many parties, many countries are already doing this, why not others? Maybe 2019 is a bit early. We think it can be achieved in 2024. We also want to achieve equality of electoral opportunities everywhere. Twenty-six countries have minimum thresholds of 3 percent – why not the other two countries? We propose at least 3 percent, but not more than 5 percent. Some wanted to go much further: transnational lists. I am very much in favour of that. But we have decided to do this in a next step. This is to be enshrined in the report that the AFCO Committee will draw up, because this Parliament has already failed on several occasions. This needs a deeper debate. So, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you will be able to agree to these pragmatic proposals.

The Commission and the European Parliament share the same objectives of strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the European Union.  I congratulate Parliament on the proposal under discussion today for amending the rules for electing its Members. The report adopted in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the basis of the proposal by Ms Hübner and Mr Leinen, has the potential to become a milestone in the democratic evolution of the European project, which – as we all have to recognise – has been a remarkable, though also a long and painful, process. Ahead of the most recent European elections, the Commission – mindful of the strengths of the European Parliament and of its role in the appointment of the President of the Commission under the Lisbon Treaty, and echoing long—standing calls from Parliament – had prompted European political parties to nominate lead candidates for the function of President of the Commission. The European political families did so for the first time, and Jean-Claude Juncker, a candidate able to command a majority in the newly formed European Parliament, was nominated by the European Council and elected by Parliament as President of the Commission. This key novelty of the 2014 elections connected the election of the Commission President more directly to the voters’ choice. Consolidating these new elements for future elections will reinforce the democratic legitimacy of the European decision—making process and will be a significant step forward, fostering the emergence of a genuinely European political sphere.  The Commission supports the proposed reform which will further strengthen our political accountability, as European parties will have to nominate their lead candidates at the latest 12 weeks ahead of the elections. The reforms can also help bridge the divide between political processes at national and at EU level. Showcasing the affiliation between national and European political parties, on ballot papers and in political broadcasts during the electoral campaign, will make the links between the main players more visible to voters and will improve their trust in the process. Here, I think, we have all been victims of the lack of discussion and debate about European issues, which is so very important. National political parties and authorities have also a decisive role to play in helping to increase transparency and to make citizens more aware of the European repercussions of votes cast for national parties. Having further common principles in the organisation of the European Parliament elections, such as a minimum threshold in all Member States for the allocation of seats, will also contribute to strengthening the European dimension of these elections. In substance, the establishment of such a minimum threshold will make the functioning of the European Parliament more efficient by decreasing the risk of fragmentation and by facilitating stable majorities. We have been talking about a crisis of representative democracy, and of disillusionment with politics. Promoting participation is essential for the progress of the European project. That is why I warmly welcome the proposals for extending the right to vote to EU citizens living in third countries; for putting in place more flexible and inclusive ways of casting votes; and for fostering women’s political participation in Union decision making and in European elections. Using electoral lists that ensure gender balance, as proposed in the report, is another important step in the right direction. By the way, I was here, though in another capacity, when we proposed such gender quotas many times in the past. On the basis of experience in the country I know best, I would also advocate action at national level because, as I have said, this aspect is catastrophic in many countries, both at local level and in national parliaments. At least here we have this principle, and that is very important.  Fair and objective media coverage during European election campaigns is, of course, another key element and I wish to stress it, since it is an essential condition for free and fair elections.  I take note of the proposal to establish a European electoral authority where information about elections to the European Parliament would be centralised. Before any further commitment, this would need to be carefully examined and, in particular, we need to examine the timeliness and feasibility of such a proposal, including in relation to the responsibilities of such an authority, possible arrangements for establishing it, and the institutional, legal, budgetary and staffing requirements for its functioning. The Commission, as I said, fully supports Parliament’s efforts to adopt these timely and ambitious proposals. Congratulations.

Every parliament in the world does so, and it adds to transparency and predictability if the systems by which citizens choose their representatives in the EU are broadly similar – similar if not identical, given that there are 28 different political traditions involved. The sensitive issue here is that of a threshold. Should there be a minimum percentage of votes that a party list has to attract before it acquires representation? In some Member States there is no support for this, but in the great majority it is accepted practice. The threshold helps to weed out frivolous contestants whose sole interest is in attracting attention. There is a counter-argument that the institution of the threshold restricts the political marketplace by creating too high a barrier to entry. The answer is a balance between the two: to have a threshold but not to set it too high. That is what this report tries to attain – setting a threshold but not making that threshold insurmountable.

I would like to remind you that since 1976 the Council has refused to amend the text of the electoral law and thus to make the elections more European, as Mr Schöpflin has already mentioned.  The proposals are therefore contained proposals, but they aim to move in the direction of having more homogeneous electoral legislation. I will mention a few of them: in the meantime, the one that aims to give visibility to European political parties, and therefore to make european sense in the elections, to stabilise the nomination of the candidate for the European Commission and to allow the voters to know him through an adequate number of weeks during which the names will be known; gender balance, which is, I believe, indispensable; the issue of transnational lists, which could come under at least one recital, and therefore a small note.

There are two important things to look out for: firstly, the belief that if we encourage a reduction in the voting age to 16, or encourage light voting online, turnout in the European Parliament will increase very much. We are not convinced of these measures. The electoral act has its rank, its seriousness. Do not resort to online forms as common forms.  But it is more important to centralise electoral law, including ideas such as the obligation to use the European party logo on the national party logo.

The reform, in our view, has been uns ambitious to this day. It is surely the example of insufficient or overly prudent use of great opportunity and need, because we are living in a moment of crisis and discrediting our European institutions. Only one in four persons with the right to vote, on average, participates in European elections. And elections are indeed understood in national terms, because public opinions are defined in this way. Because governments play it, too. The big parties are also split between what they say in this Parliament and what they do in the rest of the institutions, especially when they govern. We have not made recommendations in the report to really promote the awareness that is invoked from a European point of view. Elections can be — European elections — more than just a national policy assessment, of course, and they can bring Parliament's institution closer to the citizens. And parliamentarians, their representatives, must submit to accountability on a permanent basis. We must ask ourselves whether this report actually achieves these objectives in its recommendations. We, rather think that there are changes that are positive, some that are cosmetic and some that favor those who have more territorial and social implementation. The reform has improvements such as gender equality or voting in third countries, but it cannot be seriously defended that it is a major step forward to put the symbols of European political parties on ballots, although it is not bad.

Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, for the work she has done. After the election, there is a choice and the further development of European electoral law is therefore, in my view, rightly on our agenda. It can do a great deal politically, but it has to be judged by who it ends up serving. Does it help to strengthen the public space in Europe, to overcome the speechlessness between citizens and european politics that has persisted for years? And does it provide more active and passive political participation to this day, including gender parity? The great shortcoming of the report, dear co-rapporteurs, for all its good intentions – again underlined today – is that it simply does not boldly approach the reform, but is tangled up in anticipating political constellations in the Council and is therefore more self-sufficient in the end.  The report does not follow the proposal to create political spaces and expanded opportunities for participation, but rather tries to manage technically what cannot be controlled: the dynamics of political life and corresponding discourses in the societies of the member states.  For me, democratic changes cannot be reconciled with the identity imply in the report between the interests of the citizens of Europe and those of the German grand coalition in Berlin.

In this sense, I very much regret to have to say that this is a weak reform which has not been capable of encompassing the sense of history. Among many other things, the report should have insisted on proposals reinforcing the confidence of European citizens in their institutions, but it has not done so, at least in the following four areas. Firstly, the report establishes something new, namely an obligatory threshold declared unacceptable by the German Constitutional Court and now introduced as obligatory for all countries in Europe. This measure clearly goes against the spirit of diversity and protection of minorities. Secondly, transnational lists were just mentioned in passing, almost by chance, transformed into a mere recital.

I wish to conclude by reiterating that the Commission fully supports Parliament’s efforts to adopt this timely and very ambitious proposal. In our opinion, to deliver a Union of democratic change we need to build on the concept of lead candidates. The success of Europe as a political project requires an efficient democratic system in which its citizens are fully engaged. Strengthening the link between the elections for representatives of the citizens and the selection and election process of the head of the European executive is a tangible demonstration of the impact of citizens’ democratic participation on the EU decision-making process. As I said at the beginning, it is very important to highlight the importance of a quota or gender balance, to which I gave my full support as a Member of the European Parliament. This proposal is a concrete way to create a new sense of engagement in the construction of Europe and stimulate citizens to play a more active role in European democracy.

To those who consider that we lack ambition with this report, I would say that sometimes in our work, and you all experience this, we want to bring more people on board for the ideas we consider important for European citizens – then, of course, our level of ambition falls to that of the common ambition. To a certain extent, that is why we could not do certain things. Another reason, however, has to do with the procedure involving the Council: we have to go with this proposal to the Council, and the Council, under the Treaty, can completely ignore our proposal. That is why we are trying to build something that will get through the whole system and take us a step forward in the evolution of the European Parliament’s right to decide on the procedure for its own electoral process. These points may constitute an explanation in response to the first group of comments. To all those who consider we are going too far, I have to say that I totally disagree with you. In response to those who say we are moving too far in the sense of taking responsibility for issues that should be addressed at national level, as matters for national sovereignty, I would say that this proposal brings Members of the European Parliament closer to the voters, and also brings European citizens closer to Europe. So through this proposal I believe we are addressing what is today the biggest weakness of the European Union, namely the huge distance between the citizens and the Union. I hope that, as a result of all our discussions, at committee level, here and subsequently in the Council, we will achieve something which, though it may not be milestone, as the Commissioner nicely put it, will certainly take us forward in terms of the European Parliament’s right to decide on its own electoral procedures. As György Schöpflin was saying, we are probably the only parliament in the world that is not currently able to decide for itself about its electoral procedures. Lastly, with regard to the threshold and the recent ruling by the German Federal Constitutional Court, I hope Jo Leinen will explain it but, if I remember correctly, one of the points the Court made was that if there were a European law on the threshold it would be a different story. That is why we are proposing a European law: so that we can avoid all the problems we are having at national level, with differing interpretations by different constitutional courts.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I would also like to thank all those who have taken part in the debate. Mr Schöpflin has indeed said that a minimum threshold is okay, but it should not be too high. Well, what did we do? We have looked at what exists in 26 Member States. There is a minimum threshold of three per cent everywhere by law or de facto, and we have now proposed this for two other countries where this does not exist. This is not too high, but that is the norm in most of our countries, and it is somehow practiced and exists there and is also accepted. Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, our German Constitutional Court has delivered this verdict. But it has also opened the door to a minimum threshold. It said that as long as there is no European law, we will judge our country as we have done. It has also said that we must monitor the development of the European Parliament. With the new powers, in the new tasks of electing a European executive – as we did with the election of the President of the Commission – they would also change their judgment on the zero- percent clause. So, I think there is too one-sided argument. I understand that from the very small parties, but it is also not right to present it so one-sidedly here. I am also encouraged by colleagues who have said that we should have gone much further. However, from the experience of the last period, we have meant that we represent a two-stage approach. The first stage that is possible now, and then again, we come up with further proposals, which will most likely also have to be decided in a Convention in a larger consultation with national parliaments and national governments. Let us not deceive ourselves: European lists also require the amendment of existing decisions. That is not to be found here, as the last period has shown us. I would just like to say that this is a milestone, as Commissioner Creu said, in relation to the decades in which nothing has happened. It has been mentioned here what we are proposing. This is a big step forward and we should not miss this opportunity. Because if we miss them, there will be no reform of the electoral law in this period, and we will then fall back into the old paths in 2019, which have proved to be very deficit-in-the-day. Finally, I would like to say that those who do not accept here that we are elected at home in our Member States, but at the moment when we are here in Parliament, represent the whole of the EU and not just our Member States, they simply cannot be helped.

The most important of these amendments is the introduction of a mandatory limit of between 3% and 5% for the allocation of seats in at least some of the Member States. This proposal is problematic from the point of view of the democratic principle enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Especially when this threshold exceeds 3% and reaches 5%, there is an excessive restriction of pluralism, which is not necessary to ensure the functioning of the European Parliament.

The diversity of views represented in this Parliament is, in my view, a considerable asset and a direct result of a democratic election process rather than an obstacle to it.

In April 2014, this claim deserved parliament's agreement at first reading. However, the Council has never appointed any of these 12 judges because the Member States did not achieve an understanding in the choice of judges, since each State wanted to appoint its judge and the number of judges to be appointed, 12, did not coincide with the number of appointing States, 28.  Thus, in October 2014, the Court asked for 28 more judges, twice as many as the existing ones, as well as the abolition of the Civil Service Tribunal. That is, in April 2014, 12 more judges were needed to resolve the court's alleged problems, but in October of that year, after all, 28 more judges were already needed, as well as the extinction of a court. It is clear that it is not a question of solving any of the Court's problems, but of solving a council problem which is not capable of appointing members who do not coincide with its members. On the other hand, the proposal under discussion is not a mere amendment to the initial legislative proposal, but a new proposal, because it is no longer just about the appointment of 12 more judges, but 28 more and the extinction of a specialised court provided for in the Nice and Lisbon Treaties.  However, in the case of a new legislative proposal, the Commission must give a ruling on its content, which has not happened, since it has only ruled on the appointment of 12 more judges and not 28 more, and has never given any opinion on the extinction of the Court from the civil service. The Treaty provides for the establishment of specialised courts and not their deletion.  The extinction of the Civil Service Tribunal would mean the abandonment of the system of specialised courts provided for in the Nice and Lisbon Treaties, when it is generally known that specialised justice is a better quality justice and, therefore, should face—whether the possibility of creating new specialised courts, in particular for trade marks and patents, rather than trying to extinguish the only one exists , and whose success is recognized by all. Such a reform should be preceded by an impact study, which would enlighten the co-legislators – Council and Parliament – about their need, their breadth, their costs and other consequences. However, this study was never carried out. Due to the irrationality of the Council proposal, I proposed in my report the reconstitution of the position adopted by Parliament at its first reading in April 2014, because moving from 12 judges to 28 judges will not be well understood by European public opinion, as it translates into an increase in the Union's structural expenditure of more than EUR 20 million per year , just because the Council was unable to appoint the judges approved.  At a time when many countries are subject to strict austerity measures and the European Union is proposing to reduce staff and cut public spending, thus increasing the Union's structural public spending would be a bad example for the whole of Europe. But the Council was not permeable to this position, and it maintained its position, and it is now up to Parliament to accept that claim or refuse it on behalf of the European taxpayers we represent. In my report, I also proposed absolute respect for gender parity in the recruitment of judges, but that rule was also rejected by the Council, on the grounds that the treaties do not allow their adoption, replacing it with a mere declaration in the recitals, without any legal value.  If the Council's position is to be accepted by Parliament, we must then assume that, in the European Union, effective gender equality is nothing more than a rhetorical proclamation, without normative content or binding legal force. We must then assume that eu constitutional law does not allow the realisation of a fundamental right which is, moreover, one of the foundational values of the European Union itself.

Five appeals have already been filed for excessive duration, without justice being served, as Ms. Delvaux pointed out, costing $27 million in damages. And we can see here that it's a huge mess by slowness.  The reform of the Court, which is scalable and structural, as I support it, allows us to have three stages. And at the end of each step, an evaluation is carried out to see whether or not to go further. Therefore, I have no fear as to the financial mess argument; in my opinion, it is demagogic.  And finally, I'd like to say one thing. Let us not underestimate the absolutely indispensable democratic function, because if Europe looks like something from the point of view of the peoples, it is an executive, it is a legislative that must go to the people, and it is a judiciary that must have the means to function.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3090, "date": "2015-10-27.json", "name": "Heidi Hautala", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, we are in the second reading of this issue, and since 2011 the Council could not – and, according to my estimation, never will – modify its request for 28 new judges.

This is about ensuring the operating conditions of the EU court system, and the task and role of the General Court is crucial for the judicial protection of the citizens. The Court of Justice of the European Union is the court that constantly fosters the rule of law, transparency and fundamental rights. The quality and efficiency of the EU court system should be our highest priority. In the trilogues, Parliament has also achieved something historical: this is the very first time that the EU co—legislators are including a clause on gender parity into a regulation that governs an EU institution. The gender parity provision in the regulation is pushed as far as the Treaties enable. This is a step; it is a legal innovation that is bound to be only the beginning of a development towards more gender parity in the EU institutions. The Court and the Member States are committing themselves to gender parity, and it is our task to hold them accountable.

At worst, we are faced with unconfessable interests that are behind a mere division of seats.

The judges we have heard in the Committee on Legal Affairs have told us, including Mr. Jaeger, who is still the chair of the Tribunal. We are therefore going to vote on a reform that will cost us around 20 million euros a year for nothing.  Secondly, this reform has resulted in multiple violations of parliamentary procedure: violation of our regulation on the rule of double reading, violation of the most basic rules of parliamentary law in the hasty vote which took place against the will of the rapporteur, Mr Pinto, on 8 October - that day was a sham of democracy, it was hardly that time to debate. Finally, a hearing of the judges which took place in incredible conditions, since I almost had to force my way into my own committee, which claimed to forbid me entry.  Thirdly, a violation of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, since this reform involves the abolition of the Public Service Tribunal - by the way, hello for the respect of civil servants and employees of the European Union - in defiance of this treaty which allows the creation of courts but which does not allow to abolish them in any way (Article 257, for those who would like to check).  In the end, all this shows the weight of lobbying and private interests in the European Union, which should not surprise us. We have already had many examples, here is one more. The bottom line of this case is that there are 28 places of well-paid judges to distribute. That is why I tabled an amendment in the Committee on Legal Affairs which prohibited European parliamentarians from becoming judges. This would have at least had the merit of recalling a great rule that is the separation of powers and erasing any risk of conflict of interest. That amendment was rejected.

The European Union must always be concerned about the image of justice in the long term. A fair assessment of developments is needed to enable the organisation of the means and modalities of the courts to be adapted. They must face the challenges given not only by increasing the number of Member States, but also by a considerable increase in the volume of cases in recent years, which has led to an unacceptable increase in their resolution time.
