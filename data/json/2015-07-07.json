Mr President of the European Commission, I would like to begin by congratulating the Rapporteur Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. Dear Commissioners, First of all, I would like to thank President Schulz for his good cooperation. It is a great honour for me to return to the European Parliament after six months of very intensive work to discuss the work done by the Latvian Presidency. The past period has been a very challenging and dynamic time for Europe, as well as a great responsibility and unique experience for Latvia. Latvia put forward three priorities: a competitive Europe, a digital Europe and an involved Europe. Life brought its own corrections. Terrorist attacks and the humanitarian crisis at Europe's borders required immediate action by the European Union. At the moment, however, all thoughts are on Greece. Although Latvia had to lead the Work of the Council of the European Union in a climate of turmoil and uncertainty, I can be proud of my country, which has successfully run for its first presidency after 10 years of membership of the European Union. We have succeeded in implementing our strategic priorities. I would like to point out in particular that the activities of our Presidency have been permeable of the involvement of civil society and social dialogue. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. During the preparation of the Presidency and in the course of this process, we have remained in intensive dialogue with the European Parliament. It has made an inavertiable contribution to the successful Latvian Presidency. I am convinced that it is only in the institutions that, through cooperation and working together, that we in the European Union can achieve results, succeed and promote citizens' trust. On behalf of the Latvian Presidency, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its excellent cooperation during the Presidency. Good and constructive cooperation has enabled us to advance the priority issues and day-to-day work pragmatically and effectively, as well as to respond quickly to new challenges and crises. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. Together with the European Commission and the European Parliament, we have worked resolutely on legislation. We have made good progress in many areas, reached substantial agreements and achieved concrete results. Today, looking back, I would like to highlight the most important achievements of the Presidency. Achievements that benefit every European citizen. Firstly, the European Fund for Strategic Investments We managed to reach an agreement on the European Fund for Strategic Investments in record time. Already this summer, the Fund will start work on attracting investment to the European economy. I would like to thank the European Parliament and the European Commission for their intensive work on this very important issue for Europe. Secondly, the Energy Union We have laid the foundations for a European Energy Union aimed at strengthening the EU's energy independence and a common energy policy in the European Union. In our work, we focused on the need to ensure stable and affordable energy prices for consumers, more choice in the energy market and clearer information on energy suppliers. The Latvian Presidency achieved substantial decision-making in the creation of the European Energy Union, contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy, thereby enhaning the EU's energy independence. The Latvian Presidency reached an agreement on the submission of EU commitments to reduce climate change after 2020, ensuring a timely EU contribution to the preparation of the Paris Climate Conference. Thirdly, the Digital Single Market We agree that we must go hand in hand with the development of digital technologies in order to be able to adapt society to the digital age. We have therefore agreed on actions that will contribute to the increasing use of digital solutions in business. These will be aspects of digital data access and security, as well as the provision of digital skills. The Latvian Presidency paid particular attention to exploiting the potential of the European digital economy. Further developing the Digital Single Market is crucial for the European Union's competitiveness, growth and employment. The Latvian Presidency made every effort to ensure that the legislation essential to the completion of the Digital Single Market is progressed. I am pleased with the general approach adopted in the Council on the proposal for a Data Protection Regulation, which allowed negotiations to be launched with the European Parliament on 24 June. Data protection is an essential condition for the successful development of the Digital Single Market and the protection of citizens' fundamental rights. In the last few days of the Presidency, we reached agreement on a proposal for a single market for telecommunications, which provides for the abolition of roaming surcharges and for open internet access. This important achievement of our Presidency will benefit every citizen, as the agreement provides for a substantial reduction in roaming charges as early as 30 April next year. We also agreed with the European Parliament on the general principles for the Network and Information Security Directive. I hope that, once the proposal has been clarified, we will soon have a framework at our disposal that will provide better protection against cyber-attacks. Fourthly, migration has become one of the most pressing issues in the European Union in recent months. In accordance with the guidelines approved by the European Council, the Council has made progress in preventing the loss of life in the Mediterranean, combating criminal networks of smugglers, strengthening cooperation with countries of origin and transit, and helping the Member States of the European Union, which are under the greatest migratory pressure. The issue of migration is very complex. A sustainable solution can only be possible within the framework of a targeted, comprehensive and balanced approach, which is systematically implemented step by step. It is very important to ensure that the proposed solution is supported by all the Member States of the European Union. We need to strike a balance between solidarity and responsibility, which are an essential part of the European Union's migration policy. Protection must be provided to those who need it. However, safeguards in themselves will not be sufficient. They must go hand in hand with an effective system for returning irregular migrants. Fifthly, security Security challenges have led us to reassess our understanding of both the Internal and External Security of the European Union. During the Latvian Presidency, the Council has done a great deal to strengthen the internal security of the European Union. In June, the European Union's Interior Ministers approved the renewed Internal Security Strategy of the European Union. As a a follow-up, priorities for the next five years are to raise the fight against terrorism and radicalisation, organised crime and cybercrime, and draw attention to the new security challenges we face, including hybrid threats. The events of recent weeks have once again recalled the terrorist threat facing the European Union. I would like to remind you that we have kept our promise to agree on a Data Protection Pack in the Council. We hope that an agreement on the European Union's passenger name record will be reached by the end of this year. I appreciate the review of the European Union's security strategy by the High Representative, the Vice-President of the Commission. Sixthly, the Eastern Partnership We are pleased that the Riga Summit confirmed the stable relations of the European Union with the countries of the Eastern Partnership. At the same time, in view of the development of a differentiated approach, maintaining the unity of the Eastern Partnership will be an important task in the future development phase of the Eastern Partnership. Together with the European Parliament, the Latvian Presidency succeeded in reaching an agreement on macro-financial support for Ukraine. We are pleased that the EU has remained united on Russia, reiterating the importance of fulfilling the Minsk agreement commitments. I would also like to point out that, during our Presidency, Central Asia has returned to the active agenda of the European Union. The European Union should not underestimate the importance of this region. Seventhly, the transatlantic trade and investment partnership for boosting economic growth also has an important role to play in external trade and attracting investment. I therefore believe that the timely conclusion of negotiations between the European Union and the US on a comprehensive and mutually beneficial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement, which you will be discussing very soon, is very important. We look forward to the European Parliament's support at the conclusion of the treaty, because the transatlantic partnership has not only an economic but also a geopolitical role. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. Together with the European Parliament, we have also worked very other legislative initiatives that are important for Europe's competitiveness, growth and employment. We are pleased that we highlighted issues that have received less attention as a result of the economic and financial crisis, namely the sustainability and quality of jobs, income adequacy, career prospects, a secure transition from one job to another. I would like to mention in particular the promotion of youth employment here. We have reached an agreement to speed up the allocation of European Union funding to the Youth Employment Initiative. Already this year, €1 billion will be available for the initiative to support up to 650 000 young people each year. I would like to mention the new rules that will promote the interoperability and safety of European railways, to the benefit of both passengers and industry. Innovation will also facilitate and protect the agreement reached on the reform of the trade mark system. The new rules will provide better consumer protection and clearer conditions for tour operators for package travel. Also agreed in the fields of agriculture, health and other areas. I am pleased that on 25 June the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council launched negotiations on a new institutional agreement. This is a unique opportunity for the Institutions of the European Union to improve the decision-making process. European citizens expect an effective and well-functioning European Union, and it is our common responsibility to ensure this. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. The Latvian Presidency has been working effectively to build a competitive, digital, engaging and secure Europe. We worked with you, Martin, and members of the European Parliament. We worked in close cooperation with the Commission and Jean-Claude. I hope that our pragmatism has helped to lay solid foundations for the success of the issues during the next Presidencies. With a well-done sense of work, Latvia has transferred the council's leadership to Luxembourg. I wish them luck and success. We live in an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world. It will continue to create new opportunities and new challenges. Therefore, it is only resolutely and working together for all the European institutions that the European Union will succeed.

Mr President, Madam Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pay tribute to the work of the Latvian Presidency. This was, as you said, Madam Prime Minister, the first presidency of Latvia. For a first presidency, what an experience and what a performance! Thank you on behalf of Europe! (Applause) Those who do not like Europe are unable to give compliments to those who serve it! I think you have done an exemplary job and I want to congratulate you on that. In particular, I would like to thank you for taking a number of proposals that the Commission had introduced just before the start, or during your presidency, particularly with regard to the investment plan. What a great job that has been done between the Presidency, and therefore the Council, and the European Parliament, to carry out this ambitious project in a few months. In paying tribute to you, I also pay tribute to Parliament, which has been able to respond when necessary.  Led by an ambitious presidency, the Commission has not hesitated to present a series of proposals - you have just mentioned a few - namely the energy union, the capital markets union and the digital union. All this was possible because the Commission felt carried by the ambitions of the Presidency.  I would also like to salute your negotiating skills. It is true that since the Lisbon Treaty came into force, the role of prime ministers and foreign ministers has changed somewhat. There is a permanent presidency of the Council, so the Prime Minister does not have to preside over the European Councils, the High Representative, who chairs the Council on Foreign Relations, and a permanent presidency of the Eurogroup, so the finance ministers are somewhat relieved of their work. I would have loved to have been able to live my last presidency - as Prime Minister of Luxembourg - under these conditions. I have indeed chaired the European Council, the Ecofin, the Eurogroup, and I am therefore aware of the constraints, honours and misfortunes of a presidency.  You have done so elegantly and I would like to pay tribute to your many negotiating skills and salute the exemplary and elegant work that was done by your permanent representative. We are geniuses, we prime ministers preside over, but without those who do the real work, we suck, so we must also pay tribute to the high... (Applause) I would like to pay tribute here to the Latvian civil service. She's excellent.  Tonight we will have another European Council on Greece. Ich wurde dazu gerne einige Worte - einige schnelle Worte - sagen. Ich lese in der 'berregionalen deutschen Press: \"Juncker ist abgetaucht.\" Ich warne vor jeder Art der Vorfreude. Ich habe mich weder Sonntagabend noch gestern zum griechischen Referendum ge-u-ert. Es muss manchmal auch erlaubt sein - und dasselbe Verhalten tete einigen anderen gut, auch den Zwischenrufern -, nachzudenken, bevor man das Wort ergreift. Ich bin nicht abgetaucht. Ich rede zum ersten Mal in Sachen griechisches Referendum vor dem European Parlament. Yesterday ist der Ort der Demokratie! (Beifall) Schnelle Interviews in der Presse ersetzen keine Debatte im European Parlament. Entweder man respektiert das European Parlament, oder man gibt schnelle Interviews. Ich bin hier im Parlament, denn hier habe ich Verantwortung zu tragen, und hier habe ich Bericht zu erstatten. (Beifall) Ich mechte Folgendes sagen: Man hat - ich mechte nicht damit beginnen, aber ich beginne trotzdem damit - die Rolle der Europeischen Kommission in Sachen Griechenland in einigen Mitgliedstaaten heftigst kritisiert, vornehmlich in denen, die dieselbe Sprache sprechen wie die, die ich. Entweder mechte das Parlament eine politische Kommission haben, und dann muss diese sich auch in politicis 'u'ern derfen, oder das Parlament und andere mechten eine Kommission haben, die sich aus hohen Beamten zusammensetzt. Ich bin kein hoher Beamter, ich bin ein politischer Verantwortungstrom. (Beifall) Ich fànde es trotzdem erstaunlich, wenn sich in Sachen Griechenland und zur Zukunft der Eurozone jeder 'u'ern darf, nur nicht der President der Kommission. Ich weary mir den Mund nicht von anderen verbieten. Ich bin yesterday gew-hlt. Das Gleiche gilt - das mechte ich sofort hinzuf-gen - auch fer das Europeische Parlament und den Presidenten des Europeischen Parlaments. Der President of the European Parlaments nimmt regelm-ig an den Sitzungen das Europeischen Rates teil und tr-gt die Stimmungen und Befindlichkeiten, die Einsch-tzungen des Europ-ischen Parlaments vor, und er tut das in sehr angenehmer - wenn auch nicht immer fàr jeden angenehmer - Art und Weise. Die Vorstellung, dass der President of the European Parlaments in den Rat kommt, vortr-gt, rausgeht und den Mund h-lt, bis er wieder vorgelassen wird, ist eine hirnrissige Vorstellung. Das European Parlament ist kein Papiertiger und hat sich auch zwischen den Europ-ischen Ràten 'ber die Dinge, um die es in Europa geht, zu 'u'ern. Ich bin dem President of the European Parlaments dankbar, dass er sich sehr oft im Namen des Europeischen Parlaments - wenn auch nicht immer durch sein Mandat abgedeckt, das bin ich auch nicht immer - manchmal forsch, manchmal eindringlich, manchmal zuredend, manchmal erkl-rend in die Debatte eingemischt hat. Das European Parlament ist kein Papiertiger, und der President of the European Parlaments ist kein Bettvorleger. Er hat das zu tun, was er getan hat. (Beifall) Jetzt haben wir heute Abend einen weiteren European Rat in Sachen Griechenland - gut so! Jetzt sagt jeder: Wir messen das Votum der Griechen respektieren. Das kills ich auch. Aber ich wurde auch das Votum der griechischen Wàhler und Wàhlerinnen, der Bàrgerinnen gerne verstehen. Man hat dem griechischen Volk eine Frage vorgelegt, die sich nicht stellt, weil man zu einem Votum einen Textvorschlag ... (Zwischenruf: No is the answer!) Ich konnte Sie jetzt mal fragen, mir im Detail zu erklàren, welche Frage eigentlich vorgelegt wurde. Aber so weit mechte ich den Spao yesterday nicht treiben. (Zwischenrufe) Ja, Ja. Ich gehe davon aus.

I don't like to be interrupted. But sometimes I like to be interrupted by those who interrupt me all the time. I really like that. I wanted to say that we need to have a hard conversation about what it means to respect the greek vote. That is why the question of what the Greeks said 'no' to is important. The majority of the Greek people said 'no' to a text proposal from the three institutions, which was long outdated when it was put to the vote. I was in intensive negotiations with the Greek Government and the Greek Prime Minister until Thursday last week, and the Greek Prime Minister is well aware that what was put to the Greek people to vote was not up to date. In this respect, I will be asking the Greek Prime Minister this evening – and I have already done so tonight – to present me with a statement on the Greek vote. After all, the question on which the vote was taken no longer arises, and everyone in charge of the negotiation process knows that. Now, however, it is not so much a matter of right-handedness. We have to put our little ego and also my big ego between brackets and now deal with the situation we find. The situation is that I am still thinking – and I will think so until the end of the days: my petitum is, my will is to prevent a Grexit. I am against a Grexit! (Applause) There are some in the European Union who are openly or hiddenly pushing for Greece to leave the eurozone. I have a life experience. The life experience is that the simple answers are usually the wrong answers. I am against simple answers. There are no easy answers in Europe. Europe is the constant struggle for compromise solutions, and that is also the task that the European Commission has set itself. We continue to take on this task. I would like Greece, this great Greek nation, not to have the impression that we want to throw them and, with it, the Greeks out of the European monetary union or the European Union. No one should want to throw out the Greeks! (Applause) Because that is the case, the European Commission will endeavour to restart negotiations with Greece. What kind of European Union would this be in which people suddenly stop talking to each other? If the European nations stop talking to each other, then we are heading towards the end of the European Union. I believe that the hour has now come for those who sit down at the table again with reason and reason, even with their hearts and souls from time to time, because without feelings it is not possible. I very much regretted the fact that the Greek delegation has left the negotiating table. This is not what we are doing in Europe! In Europe, negotiations take place until the last millisecond. The Greek Government did not do that, and that was a serious mistake.  (Applause) It is a European matter of course that we are now reunited around the table, and we must try to find a solution. This solution will not be possible today. And if there were a solution today, it would again be too simple a solution. Today, however, we will pave the way for us to put things right in a common dialogue and in mutual understanding and also in mutual tolerance. This also means that rhetorical rearmament must be put to a rapid, abrupt end. I do not accept – and I say this here in the place of European democracy – that the representatives of the institutions – and I do not accept this at all for the Commission and its President – are being called terrorists by the Greek government. This is not a way of dealing with it in Europe!  (Applause) Everyone has made a fair effort, the Commission more than others. If everyone had worked as hard as the Commission and its President, we would not be in the position we are in now. So we will meet again tonight and we will try to get things going in negotiations without rhetorical noise in such a way that we can reach an amicable solution. In any case, the European Commission, with all due respect for what the Greeks have said, wants to know what this vote means. It is not a 'no' to Europe, I am told. It is not a 'no' to the euro, I am told. It cannot be a 'no' to the proposals made by the institutions, because they were no longer on the table. So I would like a vote from the Greek Prime Minister. The ball is clearly in the Greek government's camp. The The Greek Government must explain today in Brussels how it intends to make progress in this situation. In any case, the European Commission and its President are prepared to do everything possible to ensure that we reach an agreement at intervals that are acceptable. The Greeks and Europeans can rely on the European Commission!

I would like to begin by thanking the Presidency for the work that has been done.  Roaming, data protection, energy, the Eastern Partnership and, above all, the Investment Pact that has been adopted: a proud track record that has been presented. Congratulations and also personally to Prime Minister Straujuma a heartfelt thank you for the clear course, for the firm hand, but also for the human way. The first three rows also show what modern government we have in Latvia: they are only women in the first three rows. Congratulations on this modern presidency! Yes, Mrs Harms, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also have 50% women in the Bureau. So congratulations, that's a great record. We must apologise for talking a lot about Greece today. But you will certainly understand this, and we can build a bridge, namely the bridge that Latvia has also had difficult times: a few years ago, a 14% fall in gross domestic product. Latvia had the courage to change, had the courage to leave, including cuts in the state budget, and massive cuts in the state budget. Today, Latvia contributes to European growth with 2% growth. They're back. That is why the first thing I want to say is that we can call it austerity or whatever you want to call it. But if Europe is unwilling to reform internally, if we are not able to put our national budgets in order, then this continent will not have a good future, and Latvia is a good example of how to get it right. Secondly, I would like to take up the debate on democracy that we now have. What did we learn on Sunday? 61% of Greeks oppose further cuts. Is that so surprising? What if we vote in Finland? When the people of Finland say: we are no longer prepared to provide our tax money for the rescue of Greece or other states in Europe? Is this a bad democracy, because they are evil and do not want to provide money? What have we learned? We have learned that there are national perspectives. Yes, but that does not help us in Europe.  Europe is the idea of going to the table and seeking compromises with each other. That is the idea: not provoked, not confrontational, but seeking compromises with each other. That is why Sunday was not a good day for Europe. A day when Europe has also suffered. This is demonstrated very strongly by the applause we then heard through the press releases from the right and the left: once again the extremists united in great unity, because it is against Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, there was a debate that this was an unfair deal. I would like to thank our President of the Commission because, in the many hours during which he negotiated with Tsipras and with the Greek representatives, he worked out a fair deal. There were no more pension cuts. There was a proposal to cut back on the military. There was an offer of a 35 billion investment package in the economy of Greece, in the future of Greece, for growth. The Greek Government has recklessly rejected this. So yes, it was a fair deal that was on the table. I say on behalf of my group that we do not have any imagination at the moment as to how we should go beyond these proposals, which were already on the table. We lack the imagination to put even more far-reaching proposals on the table now. Syriza's game is high-risk. We have found Greece in a difficult situation. Greece had made many cuts, had an economic downturn, which was certainly a heavy burden on the country, but in the last five months, unfortunately, the division has continued. The supply of medicines is on the table, the banks are closed, Greece is in a very difficult situation. Syriza, including Tsipras, is partly responsible for this.  Ladies and gentlemen, if we look at Greece today, it is a divided country. That is the record of a government policy of Tsipras and Syriza – not a good record for Greece. Last but not least, I would like to say that Europe, as we all know, is based on values, but it is also based on rules. Both aspects are important. The values are democracy and solidarity, and I believe that Europe is the benchmark in the world there. On the other hand, however, Europe also means respecting rules and laws. Respecting agreements, complying with agreed treaties: that too is Europe. We hope that we will be able to return in the next few years to this principle that rules must also apply.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Latvian Presidency must be given the opportunity to acknowledge that it has moved with good will, competence and gentlemanliness. Important results have been achieved and I am thinking in particular of the approval of the investment plan and the roaming measures. But at this time, there is no denying the feeling of concern that emerges in many citizens. Too many European summits have been successfully resolved; on immigration, the Commission presented an ambitious programme, but it was the Council that tried to distort it; the Member States, all of us, must assume our responsibilities to the full. Never before has Europe been faced with a decisive step. Nor do I believe that there is an alternative to the agreement between Greece and its creditors. Nor do I want to consider a lack of understanding, because not reaching an agreement would open the door to a disastrous scenario that would threaten not only the financial stability of the euro area, but also the future of Europe. I therefore fully share the position of Mr Juncker, whom I thank for his constructive commitment, and I say that we must use every second, to the last, to reach an agreement with the creditors. The result of the Greek vote, for me and for us Socialists and Democrats, is clear: the Greeks do not want to leave the euro. They want to negotiate an agreement that allows them to build a prospect of a dignified life. Governments, all the governments of the euro area, must listen to this message and make an effort to overcome the rigidities because the stakes are too high. To that Finance Minister who said yesterday that Grexit is the only option on the pitch, I say: be ware, we will oppose those who play in the wreck, the sorcerer's apprentices who play with the future of Europe. I say to Tsipras and his government that it is important that they make common sense proposals at the summit today. This is the time of responsibility for all. And the accusations made by a former Greek minister against creditors, calling them terrorists, are unacceptable.  It is very significant that all Greek parties have signed a unitary document to support the reasons for the agreement. On the basis of a new constructive approach, this evening's summit may pave the way for a bridge loan that will allow Greek citizens to breathe and create the conditions for long-term intervention by the State Rescue Fund. In the next few hours, we must avoid a banking panic: the Greek credit system must be put in a position to continue working. Dear President Schulz, dear Mr Juncker, dear President-in-Office of the Council, this is the time for action and solutions. I would like to remind all of us that a possible Greek exit from the eurozone would probably be a point of no return.

Man ir uzticēts gods manas grupas vārdā pateikties Latvijas premjerministrei par lielisko darbu, un Vēbera kungs man īstenībā izņēma vārdus tieši no mutes, ka pirmajās trīs rindās šeit ir sievietes. Šī prezidentūra bija sekmīga tieši tāpēc, ka Latvijā, kā jūs redzat, pastāv dzimumu nevienlīdzība, un tāpēc šis panākums ir tāds, kāds viņš arī ir. Es gribētu teikt arī, ka mana kolēģe ļoti daudz teica labus vārdus par kultūras programmu un daudziem citiem pavisam tehniskiem un svarīgiem jautājumiem, kas parādīja, ka zeme, kura ir arī mana zeme un kurai ir šīs skaistās karoga krāsas, faktiski ir ļoti, ļoti būtiska Eiropas daudzveidībai. The Latvian Presidency has achieved significant progress in a number of aspects of the single market, which of course is a crucial political flagship for the ECR Group, like the Telecommunications Package, which can move forward the whole digital agenda. It is the same for data protection issues and also in other fields of the single market, like the Railway Package in the transport sector, and moves towards the Energy Union. So these achievements are moving Europe in a new direction, although the EFSI stands a little aside from this. Why? In my opinion, if Mr Juncker promises to do something in the six months, then it will be done, whichever Presidency it is, or it would be no Presidency at all. At the same time, I think the Juncker plan brings us new challenges. To be honest, I would not want to experience so-called ‘geographical neutrality’ towards investment turning into a ‘geographical concentration’ of projects in high—return places. But the real priority – and the milestone – of the Latvian Presidency was the Eastern Partnership Summit. Did it really deliver? Ukrainians and Georgians, who chose a risky way to move to a Western future, are disappointed. They feel left in the other sphere of influence. We have to admit that, if the majority of Europeans are not ready to have a heightened confrontation with Russia, then perhaps we have to choose slightly different priorities if we cannot help those new democracies like Ukraine and Georgia. Ending with the Greek deal, I agree that this has to be complex. It is not a simple idea, as the President of the Commission has said.

Let us keep a cool head and go back to common sense, because the number of irresponsible voices I have heard over the past two or three days about the Greek crisis is enormous. People are talking about a Grexit like it is nothing, whereas in reality we are not talking about Greece: we are talking about the possibility of having a healthy monetary union and of being capable, as a monetary union, of solving a problem like this. We are talking about a historic debt of EUR 300 billion – and that is in a monetary union with a gross domestic product of EUR 15 trillion. Nobody outside the European Union understands why we are not capable of managing it. That is the reality today, and so I fully support you. Let us get back to common sense and not start in different ways. There is also the International Monetary Fund, which first of all made a deal round the table and then two days later published a document saying that the deal is not sustainable. How responsible is that? I think, Mr Juncker, that we have to come up with a new approach. We have to recognise that the way we have been dealing with the Greek crisis up until now has not worked. A new approach – and this something that has been said by most of the political leaders in Europe – to me means that Mr Tsipras has to come forward with a credible, real reform package. This cannot just be a number of accounting measures such as we have on the table today, but rather it has to be real in-depth reform. That means ending the clientelistic system – there is nothing in the seven pages today – as well as ending the corruption in the country and downsizing the public sector. It is an enormous public sector, with 800 000 civil servants for the moment. The public banks must finally be broken up, and there must be a private financing sector. The markets must be opened up, and so on. That is the first thing. Let him come now. He has to deliver. He has run away from the negotiating table. Secondly, let us try to manage the debt in Europe together. If we had created a redemption fund a few years ago – and your idea of eurobonds – we would not have the problems we face today, and we would have a real instrument to govern this crisis. Finally, let us also prepare – because you never know what may happen – to help the Greeks. If we do not help the Greek Government, then at least the Commission should prepare a number of emergency programmes to directly help Greek citizens and Greek families if it is necessary in the coming weeks and coming months.

But I think that is a great challenge to represent the 'no' and the 'yes' vote. After all, his first task is to reunite his country. Only a united Greece will be able to negotiate successfully in Brussels. I share much of the appeals to Mr Tsipras that have come in recent days. Today, however, I must also say that there are appeals to Angela Merkel in Germany, which I do not share at all.  That is why I think the tone that Jean-Claude Juncker has struck here is very good. If the Bild newspaper demands today that what we need is the iron chancellor, then I can only say: please do not! Then I would like the Germans to remember that if we had met iron European neighbours – again and again – we would not be this European nation, this Germany, which has a very special responsibility. Mr Juncker, I think the two issues are clear. It is the reforms on the one hand, which, incidentally, are also addressed in the IMF paper. The IMF paper does not only talk about the unsustainable debt situation. The IMF paper clearly calls for social reforms in Greece. On the other hand, the debt to Greece must be made sustainable. Madam President, I was so enthusiastic about your country because it is a country still under construction, with great problems, but with an incredible amount of European spirit. I would sometimes like these young Latvians, the young Baltics and the young Greeks to come to an understanding about what European democracy is, rather than drifting apart.

As far as Mr Juncker is concerned, I see him here for the first time and I can talk to him and ask him questions. The first is, do you know how much a litre of milk costs? A pound of bread? A liter of gasoline? Because you always talk about big things, big figures, you're in the middle of banks, you're talking to multinationals, you've always lived with them: but people, people have more to do, they need more answers!

We must make it smaller: it cannot claim to command Europe, because there was already one who wanted to take Europe with Nazism. We do not want economic Nazism now and therefore, in my opinion, we need to change the register a little.  And again, Mr Juncker, I wanted to ask you: where has the EUR 300 billion in investment gone? Or, there are two cards: this is the euro card and this is toilet paper. In my opinion, this is more important in Europe today, thanks to your work, because you are having Europe go to waste; you are not doing what interests the people and, therefore, you would be the first to resign.

Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. If you look around the global economy, you have to say that we are very similar in a process of globalisation and that our companies, our workers, are in global value chains.  Shaping this process is our democratic task here in the European Parliament: to set standards and rules, to respect the interests of workers and citizens. This is different from previous classic trade agreements, it was just about tariffs. Now it is indeed a question of standards, of rules, and that is why, ladies and gentlemen, a basic requirement for setting standards and rules is that the most fundamental transparency is possible in the negotiations, otherwise we will not be able to play a serious part in shaping them. This is a central demand in the resolution: to be as transparent as possible and also to involve civil society in the context of the discussion. Because it is not about tariffs, it is about sensitive important things.  That is why we are also making a resolution, because I do believe that this is the time of the parliaments and not just of the negotiators, but that we decide what – for us – are principles for standard-setting and rule-setting. If you look at the resolution, it becomes very clear. We want to make it clear that trade agreements must ensure principles of data protection, that our values of data protection must be safeguarded in trade agreements and in the actions of companies. We want to make it clear that our tradition of services of general interest – service in general, in the economic interest – has nothing to do with trade agreements. It is our regional responsibility, for example, how water supply is organised.  We want to make it clear that the issue of services only has to be entered in a trade agreement if it is described positively, that is to say, it starts with positive lists. We want to make it clear that the right of legislation, the right to regulate by no regulatory committees or anything else, or by private arbitration courts, can be called into question. So a clear set of rules for a trade agreement. In particular, it is a question of putting workers in reasonable conditions so that we have fair competition in trade, based on quality and efficiency, and not on social dumping and environmental dumping. That is why you find a strong chapter in the resolution on safeguarding workers' rights. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure that we will eventually achieve this. It can also fail, and we must always be aware of this. We will decide on an agreement at the end of the day. But those who do not argue, who do not start, have already lost. If you fight, you can lose. But if you don't do anything, you've already lost.

It covers traditional trade issues but also many other issues, from medical devices regulation and financial services to sustainable development. To get it right, we need the engagement of the whole of this Parliament, and this resolution is proving that engagement. The fact that 14 committees in addition to the Committee on International Trade were all active, proves that Members are very engaged in this and has enabled the whole Parliament to take part in discussions, in deliberations and in getting to know all the details of this agreement. When President Juncker came here to present the agenda for his Commission last July, he made clear that TTIP was one of his core priorities, and this House at that time voted very strongly for his agenda. Why? Because TTIP is an essential part of the Commission’s strategy to open markets around the world. We are doing that not to benefit a small few, but in order to create opportunities for the whole of Europe: the people of Europe, the consumers of Europe, the entrepreneurs of Europe. One in seven people in Europe have a job thanks to exports around the world. Those jobs are highly skilled and better paid than average. 4.7 million of those jobs are linked to exports to the US. TTIP would help increase that number. It would also make goods cheaper and more varied for consumers, and it would help to make our small and medium-sized companies more competitive. They would find it easier to export and to get their imported components and raw materials more cheaply. Those are solid economic advantages. We cannot afford to turn our backs on them now or in the future. Second, TTIP is also a strategic alliance with the country that most closely shares Europe’s commitment to core values and to a high level of protection of people and of the environment in our regulation. We need an ally like this to shape the globalisation we see deepening before our eyes every day. We are more affected by economic and political decisions made in other countries than ever before. We particularly need an ally, because we know that the strength of our voice in the world is, in relative terms, decreasing. TTIP guarantees that partnership with America for the future, and we cannot afford to turn our backs on that either. There is, honourable Members, as you know, an unprecedented debate about this agreement. That is a good thing. I respect people who have doubts and questions, across the continent and within this House. I take those concerns very seriously and have engaged a lot with national parliaments, with this Parliament, with NGOs, with civil society and other stakeholders to listen and to try to understand their concerns. I hope that all these people see the changes that we have made in order to take account of their views. Since last November, I have opened up these negotiations to unprecedented public scrutiny. I have put EU negotiating proposals on the internet and increased the access of Members of this Parliament and representatives of the Member States to the process. I have visited 14 national parliaments so far to exchange and open channels. I am happy to say that TTIP is the world’s most transparent bilateral free trade negotiation. We have also made clear where we stand on public services such as public health and water concessions. This is a concern I have heard very frequently. I have, together with Ambassador Froman, the US Trade Representative, made a joint statement: the EU and the US are fully united around a crystal-clear vision that nothing in TTIP will change the fact that only Member States choose how their public services should be organised. We have also made it very clear where we stand on regulation. I have put the proposal on cooperating with the US online, and it says that there will be no limitations on the power of this Parliament or any national parliament or of European governments. We want the benefits of shared expertise and we want opportunities for our people. That is all. I have made proposals for a deep reform of investment protection. The result is a completely new approach. We still want to foster job-creating investment but we are proposing a new system that sets down the right to regulate in black and white: a new system that takes us away from the private arbitration tribunals of the past. Instead, we want a future in which disputes are decided in an international investment court, by judges and with a right of appeal. TTIP will be a step towards that goal, not the final result. It is an essential step, given the role of the US as a global investor. Parliament’s resolution is a vital step in those negotiations, but it is certainly not the end of our conversation. The Commission will continue to be flexible and to take account of Members’ views. Beyond investment, we also have important proposals to discuss how best to protect labour and environmental rights and digital commerce. There will be many more issues to debate over the course of these talks, which are far from over. These negotiations are far reaching, and a lot of work is still needed. I will continue to push the US on our offensive interests, including on public procurement, where we expect an ambitious proposal, but also on services, energy and geographical indications, to mention just a few examples. Parliament’s resolution will provide a vital basis for that conversation. It will also be vital for the negotiations themselves. Having Parliament’s priorities so clearly established helps the Commission explain why we need to tackle them in the final agreement. So allow me to thank you for the work done, to look forward to the debate that we are about to have, and to pledge my full cooperation with Parliament as we jointly push for the results that Europeans need: a TTIP that leads to jobs, growth and investment while protecting our values and our democracies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Francisco José Millán Mon", "mepid": "28400", "text": "   Drafts member of the Opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. – Mr President, the TTE negotiations are being held at a crucial moment from a foreign policy perspective.

Enforcing and ratifying the TTIP agreement, as well as other trade agreements, is the key to good work around the world. The second aspect is the principle of policy coherence for development. This must also be enshrined in the TTIP, because trade and development cannot be separated.  A third aspect is Commissioner Malmström's announcement to present an analysis of the impact of TTIP on developing countries and on future sustainable development goals. This is to be produced by an independent institution and to make complex connections comprehensible. There is still far too little information on this.

But fundamentally, it is also a unique opportunity for the EU and US – the dominant forces of the western world – to ensure that trade and investment rules are based on our democratic values and control in a situation of increased competition from non-democratic powers in an ever more globalised world. So the choice of this Parliament is very simple: if we want, we can start taking back democratic control of economic globalisation. The Lange resolution, with its focus on labour rights, democratic values, high standards, sustainability and a clear ‘no’ to the old ISDS system, is crucially important. It should therefore be adopted if this Parliament wants to make a real difference. We all know that there are politicians in this Parliament who will reject any TTIP agreement.

We certainly need to open up the US market to export liquefied gas to Europe, because that gives us a chance, but at the same time we on the European continent need to reflect on the mark-up on all energy prices on our continent. These mark-up is much higher than on the American continent, which puts us at a disadvantage. The second point is the difference between CO2 emissions on both sides of the Atlantic. Industries such as the steel and chemical industries must be protected for a long time to come.

What will happen to European standards as China rises if we are not part of the global decision-making process? What will happen to the 31 million jobs that depend directly on exports, and will Europe continue to have to get its energy sources from authoritarian governments?

The Committee on Agriculture is calling for an ambitious and balanced outcome to the negotiations, which will improve the access of our agri-food products to the US market. At the same time, however, European standards on food safety, human health, animal welfare, environmental protection and consumer protection must not be called into question. TTIP must be an opportunity to set high standards globally.  Europe has offensive interests in the agri-food sector, Mrs Malmström, with a surplus of around EUR 6 billion.

I am pleased that the report highlights the importance of geographical indicators (GIs). My colleagues from Italy and France may have many more GIs than I do in my part of the world, but producers of products with GIs certainly realise the value these have and recognise the benefits of their protection in any free trade. TTIP also has great potential export opportunities for many sectors, and especially for the dairy sector in agriculture, due in no small part to the sheer size of the US marketplace.

That is why we have called for the Member States to continue to have the right to regulate and promote audiovisual media, and to do so in a future-proof manner, in other words, in a technology-neutral way, in other words, also in the digital world.  The Committee on Culture insists that a legally binding clause stipulates that these services will not be attacked by the TTIP. Then we want to make sure that book price fixing applies to books, but also to the free press, and that it will not be affected by the TTIP. What is also very important is that we do not want education to be affected, that member states continue to have the opportunity to promote educational institutions and also to regulate objectives in this area.

What can we say today, which has not been repeated forever in recent weeks and months? We are spinning in circles instead of supporting our negotiators. Firstly, a great deal has happened in recent months. Significant progress has been made in the transparency of the conduct of negotiations and a noticeable increase in the Commission's willingness to engage in intensive dialogue with all stakeholders. A broad public debate has started, and it is more important than ever to communicate facts. In this context, for example, the joint statement that you have already mentioned, Mrs Malmström, and your commitment to the protection of public services were particularly welcome. We have a firm commitment that our standards will not be lowered in any area. That is why the European Parliament should send a strong signal of support. So, what exactly are we discussing in the public debate? There are so far few consolidated texts that produce reliable results. The discussion is very much based on the conjectures, uncertainties and fears of a number of citizens. Much is future music; Concrete work needs to be drawn up. That is why we see this resolution not only as a message to the negotiators, but also as a positive signal to our citizens. TTIP is an opportunity for Europe. Maybe not so much for my generation, but certainly for the generation of our children and our grandchildren. We must not squande this opportunity. If it is not possible to reach an agreement with a similar partner like the United States, then we can wrap up on trade policy. How can we ever come together with much different partners?  We fought hard in the negotiations on this text of the resolution. Overall, I believe that we have reached a good compromise. As the rapporteur spoke earlier of struggle: yes, it is true, Mr Rapporteur: we have fought, we have rallied together, but I think that, overall, we can support this text together. A final word on investment protection. We need a robust chapter on investment, because they are a stimulus for growth and jobs.

There is a view in some quarters, inside and outside this House, that our handling of TTIP has not been our finest hour. I beg to differ. I think Parliament has fulfilled exactly the role that it should play. The rapporteur has performed a Herculean task in bringing together competing and sometimes contradictory views on a wide range of sensitive and emotive issues. In my view, and in the view of my Group, if this report is adopted by Parliament it will provide an excellent blueprint for a progressive TTIP that not only creates jobs but protects public services and the right to regulate, and defends labour and environmental standards. Even on the most sensitive issue – ISDS – we have made progress. I and my group remain opposed to ISDS, but nevertheless, look how far we have come. Firstly, the vast majority of this Parliament, and indeed the Commission, now  accept that the old-style ISDS is dead and unacceptable. The majority now accept that any investor protection must be transparent, must not limit the right to regulate, and must not undermine health, labour or environmental standards. That is indeed progress on where we were six months ago. In this report we have also made it clear that the sustainable development chapter must be binding and enforceable. We have demanded that the US sign and ratify core ILO conventions on workers’ rights; with this report we are also demanding, very clearly and explicitly, the full exemption of public services from the deal, regardless of how they are financed – and, as the rapporteur has said, that includes healthcare, education and water. We also acknowledge that TTIP is an opportunity to help set global standards. That does not mean (again, as others have said) simply accepting all US standards, and the report again makes it clear that GMOs, some food standards and chemicals are not up for grabs. Where we can agree, we should agree common standards with the United States, and again, as others have said, if we do not, it will be the global marketplace that sets those standards. Do we really believe that the human rights standards from Latin America, the labour standards from China, the environmental standards from other parts of Asia, will be up to our standards? Do we really want to be driven down by that part of the world when we could reach an agreement on common standards with the United States that – for all its faults – could drag it up the way, not down the way? My group has been explicit since the outset of the TTIP debate that we want a good TTIP but that we are ready to reject a bad TTIP, and we stand by that position. But this report, if it is accepted by Parliament and implemented by the negotiators, would create a Europe that helps to create jobs but ensures that European standards on workers’ rights and the environment are at the heart of our economic growth strategy.

In turn, the consumer wins, being able to choose from a wide range of products at a cheaper price, while the taxpayer gains from further competition if procurement is opened up too. As we are all too aware, this is not the only debate taking place this week. We will be discussing the situation in Greece, a Member State that has fallen on hard times in one of the worst economic downturns we have ever known.

If we are to have any hope of overcoming this crisis, we must be outward-looking. Other parts of the world are making progress while Europe lags behind. As the Trans-Pacific Partnership nears conclusion with the signing of the Trade Promotion Authority in the US, Europe should lead the global trade agenda and not be led by it. This is not just an option for us: we must do this to catch up. This includes leadership on the thorny issue of investment protection. We have taken part in numerous debates over recent months, and I do not recall having heard anyone deny that ISDS requires change. We must have a dispute settlement mechanism that is transparent and accountable and offers the opportunity to appeal. The compromise agreement that we have on the table takes this into account, and the need for reform is there for investment protection within TTIP.

No, but it is important that this House sends a strong message to the negotiators, and cooperation requires some compromise. I would like to remind our Socialist and Democrat friends of that as well. The text we have agreed maps out what we believe a good TTIP should look like. I am sure it is not the last debate we will have on TTIP and the state of play of the negotiations, which will probably last years more. We call on you, Commissioner, to get clear results from the US side, as results are the best way to demystify and clarify, while not, of course, replacing transparency initiatives, which we also encourage you to take more of. Concretely, we need market access for EU companies in the US, government procurement at all levels, and an end to protectionist measures that seriously restrict the space for our businesses, notably in the transport sector. We need benefits for SMEs so they can more easily expand business across the Atlantic. Most growth in the global economy is foreseen as coming outside of Europe. We are happy to see developing economies succeed, but we must avoid a race to the bottom and do not believe in development and growth at any cost without respect for people and the planet. Our environmental, food safety, labour and other standards are cherished and cannot be lowered. We will also remind you of your commitments on public services. It is key that Europe lead in strengthening rules-based trade globally. We need progress in finding a solution to the outdated ISDS mechanism which, frankly, has no fans left. I support your plans for an international court and hope the Member States and other countries, including the US, can be convinced that this is the way forward.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Supporters of TTIP like to argue that the agreement is necessary because the global economy has changed. It is true, it has changed and it is changing. But from all geopolitical and geoeconomic angles, TTIP is the wrong answer. It is not only naive, but wrong, to want to set standards against the rest of the world. We do not need a confrontational alliance against China, India, Russia. Instead, we must shape our world together with these partners. To this end, trade policy must also be supported multilaterally and democratically. However, TTIP is not only a confrontation externally, but also internally. Citizens see your plans for regulatory cooperation as an attack. What you call barriers to trade are, in fact, democratic achievements. Corporations may not like this, but the legal rules and standards are important for our companies. Hence our rejection of ISDS in principle. That is why We are also in the 'yes' to Amendment No 27. Hence our fight for good work, for healthy food, for the preservation of rural areas, for municipal services, for binding sustainability chapters and against TTIP. My group is re-presenting important arguments from opinions from committees in this Parliament to the House with amendments. We believe, ladies and gentlemen, that much of this work must be reflected in the resolution as a benchmark for the future evaluation of the negotiations. Commissioner, use the time of summer to rethink your trading strategy! The negotiating approaches to TTIP, CETA and TiSA no longer correspond to the current and prospective tasks for the promotion of regional trade, for combating exploitation in global production chains, for combating environmental dumping. To do this, start a democratic process with the citizens of the EU, with their organisations and parliaments, with our partner countries in a common future.

Commissioner, you say you are consulting with the citizens, but listen to them! When you look at them, 97% of them refuse the arbitral tribunals. You say you speak on behalf of the employees, but listen to the employees! Employees do not want arbitration tribunals. They are very critical of TAFTA. You say you speak for consumers, but listen to consumers! Consumers do not want these private courts and they are very critical of the transatlantic partnership.

Finally, for the past three weeks, this Parliament has begun to listen to European society. He was divided, and a new knight appeared in this debate: the knight Schulz who, using the internal regulation, because he did not know how this Parliament was going to vote, postponed the vote. He also acted by creating an amendment today on the arbitration courts with the EPP group, forcing part of the Social Democratic Group. Mr Schulz, you have not only thrown Greek democracy into the technocrats, you also want to sell European democracy to big business. There is not a single economic argument in favour of ISDS! You know that perfectly well. There is not a single study that says ISDS encourages investment. We are constantly seeing American investment in Europe and European investment in the United States.  What is at issue here is a political position that seeks to transfer part of our sovereignty to multinational firms, to circumvent national jurisdictions that first want to protect social rights, health, the environment, public services, and to transfer that power to private courts.  Commissioner, you're not going to make us take butcher's knives for butter knives. Your reforms do not change a system that seeks to circumvent national jurisdictions. So, dear Social Democrat friends, don't let yourself be imposed on a position that is not yours. You have committed yourself for two years against the private courts.

I ask the Commission: why do you want TTIP so much? All the independent studies, the truly independent ones, show that we Europeans will be poorer, with net income losses of up to EUR 5 000 per year per family; with fewer rights, because there will be over a million redundancies; More sick, because GMOs, cloned meat and hormone-treated meat will be legal, and less safe, because we will live in a world where the Euro-American mega-bloc will be opposed to the Chinese-Russian mega-bloc: a world of political, economic and commercial cold war rather than a world of cooperation. You say that, in order to relaunch investment, we need ISDS, that is, private justice for investors, but that is not true! Investment between the UNITED States and Europe is already EUR 3 000 billion even without ISDS and in european countries where it already exists, this system has given rise to EUR 30 billion in claims for compensation that are increasing every day.  How can you say that we will find growth again, when according to many studies there will be a fall in European net exports of at least 2% and a consequent fall in GDP? How dare you say that we will never change our standards when you, in order to facilitate TTIP, have already lifted the ban on the use of lactic acid on meat? And if TTIP doesn't reduce the safety of our food, why have you just withdrawn the bill to limit endocrine disruptors? I know why! Because that law would have blocked 40 percent of American food coming into Europe, and you couldn't afford it. You have sold the health of European citizens in the name of free trade.  How can you believe that a market like ours, where there are controls for 143 000 chemicals, is compatible with one where there are 6 controlled substances? How can you even think that this Treaty will help small and medium-sized enterprises when they mainly export to Europe, and this treaty will strangle intra-European trade precisely in order to promote intra-European trade with the United States? You want us to be anti-American, but that's not true. The United States is an ally of Europe, but that is not the problem here. The problem is in our house and it is the large European multinationals, American and beyond, that are taking advantage of TTIP to create the ideal world, indeed, sorry, the ideal market: a market of 800 million consumers without rights, without protection and without security.  But even more than that, it is you, dear gentlemen of the Commission, who should be a regulator who should protect the citizens and you are the waiters of the bankers and the multinationals. And you, Mr Schulz, should be a guarantor of impartiality: but you want to propose a shameful compromise, which will perhaps bring socialists and the people to an agreement, but which in fact says nothing and sells citizens' rights to international investors, pretending to protect them.

Mr President Martin Schulz, at the last session of this Parliament in Strasbourg, you tried to prevent MePs from voting on the amendments tabled on the transatlantic treaty using an obscure parliamentary procedure. In fact, you were afraid that this Parliament would vote on amendments opposing this treaty. You have failed in your attempt, since in the end all the amendments will be put to a vote tomorrow before this House. But we will all remember that your attitude has revealed a profound contempt for democracy, even as your role as President of this Parliament commands the opposite attitude at every opportunity. You know, the same causes have the same effects. It is precisely this contempt and morgue that the Greeks have just sent you back to the face and, my God, this return of boomerang is doing us a great deal of good! But let's get back to the bottom of our case. We have in our hands a report from the European Parliament on the transatlantic treaty negotiations. Apart from a few amendments proposed by courageous Members of Parliament, this document is a vast sham. Parliament does not set a red line for the Commission on this very dangerous transatlantic treaty. Yet, as you know, this treaty is a bombshell. Our quality agriculture is in danger of disappearing if we allow the European farmer to compete head-on with the American agro-industrialists. They have no qualms about raising 40,000 cows in the Fair Oaks Farms building, injecting hormones into all live animals to grow faster, washing chlorine chickens, spreading Roundup on whole fields of Roundup Ready GMO. Is that what you want? Bringing our agriculture back to this level of quality, sinking the farmers who love their products, selling Europeans a food of increasingly poor quality, mixing white wine and red wine to make rosé?  Moreover, this document does not set any restrictions against the forced alignment of European standards with US standards imposed by the transatlantic treaty. This is outrageous, because the Americans do not have at all the same protective vision of standards as the Europeans, as the negotiators regularly tell us.  What will happen once the standards are aligned? There's nothing left! To change a standard, and therefore consumer protection, a nation will have to get the approval of the Member States of the European Union and the United States, so to speak never. On the other hand, any multinational, supposedly aggrieved in its financial interests, will be able to summon that nation to a private court. This famous arbitration tribunal is made up of specialized business lawyers, and there will of course be many conflicts of interest. It is therefore the superiority of a private justice system in perpetual conflict of interest over a public and independent justice that you want to organize.  It will be a mortal blow, one more, to democracy. Worse, this transatlantic treaty will create a single market between the United States and the European Union, thus dismantling the European project of which you are one of the most convinced ideologues. This whole text is just a broad statement of intent to cover this Parliament against the harmful consequences of TTIP!

The resolution to be voted on is very important because it defines the fundamental lines that the Commission must follow in the negotiations, which are essential points for which the Socialists Group is deeply committed and without achieving which it will be very difficult to vote for this agreement. But I also invite you all to distinguish between truth and deeds today, on the one hand, and propaganda and manipulation, on the other. The resolution calls for compliance with high social and environmental standards, the explicit exclusion of public services from the content of this agreement. The objective of our text is to ensure the competitiveness of European businesses, be they multinationals or small and medium-sized enterprises, and to encourage foreign investment, which we are so short of in the Union.  It is absolutely crucial to ask the Commission for a proposal for a permanent investor-state dispute settlement mechanism to replace the private arbitration services currently available - the old ASDS system. A mechanism that is subject to democratic principles, democratic control with independent judges in public processes and also allows for appeal. This is exactly the compromise that my colleague Bernd Lange will propose. TTIP can and must be a new generation of trade agreement between two states, two global actors with integrated economies that can ensure a common system of high standards for future trade agreements. If we don't create those standards, others will. And, please, take a moment's look at the Trans-Pacific partnership, at the Schengen initiative, look at the Asian Bank for Infrastructure and Investment, to understand that Europe cannot afford the isolation that those who vehemently oppose this agreement are proposing.  And I say one more thing: TTIP can be a response to the current security challenges by introducing an energy chapter for common benefits.

I hope that national parliaments will have the opportunity to endorse, or not give it, approval to this agreement. It's very important.

I refer you to Commissioner Malström’s statement at the confirmation hearings when she said, in prepared remarks, that ‘trade is a powerful foreign policy tool; it must support Europe’s wider international goals’. The intention is that Member States are to be forced to barter – trade away their sovereignty – in order to support the EU’s vanity foreign policy. The EU should not manipulate the UK’s trade, nor that of any other Member State, in order to promote the political pretensions of a wannabe European superstate, not with any trade agreement and not with ISDS either. Now to the detail: first, the British National Health Service (NHS). The British Labour Party has spent months – years even – falsely accusing our party of wanting to privatise the NHS. Incidentally, in these false accusations, they have been consistently and disgracefully aided and abetted by the BBC. But in the Committee on International Trade (INTA), UKIP was the only British political party to table amendments that would have fully and properly protected the NHS. It was the S&amp;D Group, of which the Labour Party is a principal component, that saw to it that no one got to vote on our amendments which protected the NHS. UKIP stands up for the NHS, even as the British Labour Party does not and fails to do so.

And it does so by declining on the substance what transparency means to us, respect for environmental and food standards, work, consumer safety, respect for cultural diversity and the protection of public services. It does not wink at the only protest that takes applause but is not constructive: instead it enters into the substance with realism, placing very clear stakes against distortions and iniquities that un regulated globalisation can cause. It is a good report and that is why we must support it strongly and we must do so because the crisis we are experiencing at this very moment is also, and above all, a crisis of confidence in the institutions. Today there is an automatic equation where everything proposed by the institutions, perceived as establishment, is necessarily negative.  We must break this mechanism because it leads us to the destruction of the democratic structure which, however imperfect, is the best possible form of european government that we have. We must exercise our role as decision-makers to the full and courageously and therefore express ourselves, by adopting the report, because if we do not do so, if we do not set certain conditions, if we do not set priorities, but at the same time give a push for the negotiations to continue, others will fill the gap that we are leaving.

We are not deciding on the TTIP today, but we are giving the Commission what Parliament can accept as a result of the negotiations and what it cannot accept. It has been possible to take up many of the points that have been critically discussed by the public and to convert them into requirements for the Commission. I would like to highlight two points in particular. Firstly, we expect the agreements to establish workers' rights at a high level. This means, among other things, that all ILO core labour standards must be signed and adhered to. And it must be ensured that workers' rights are also enforceable. In other words, there must be a dispute settlement mechanism in which workers' rights can be ensonashed. These provisions are so important to us because it is a contribution to the fact that international competition does not lead to social and wage dumping. Secondly, I believe that this resolution makes it clear that the EP rejects the previous private arbitration tribunals, the ISDS, because this system violates the rule of law and democratic principles. The report presented places demands on the negotiations with the United States, but of course these requirements also apply to agreements which are about to be submitted to Parliament for ratification. It would be implausible to pretend that the proposed agreement with Canada and that with Singapore had nothing to do with our discussion on TTIP. In other words, according to all that is known so far about these agreements, neither the agreement with Canada nor that with Singapore can be approved, partly because the protection of workers' rights is not sufficiently guaranteed and partly because an ISDS is proposed that does not meet our requirements for investment protection.

I respect those who do not believe in the market economy, in trade as an instrument that facilitates growth, and even those who believe that the United States is on the other side of the iron curtain.

The TTIP is intended to break up the US financial market, and European banks and insurance companies should be able to sell their poorly regulated products well over there.

Secondly, we are asked to reject TTIP now as if it were a fait accompli, when in actual fact it says right up there: negotiations for TTIP. That is no fait accompli – it is a work in progress. So let us have faith in our negotiators, let them deal with the issues we are concerned about. In my country, we are very concerned, as Mr Nicholson pointed out, that maybe agriculture might become a bargaining chip. We do not want that to happen.

I think this debate has proven that this has not been the case today. We are debating something that many people around the European Union and elsewhere actually do care about and follow very closely. It is clear that there are many concerns. I also meet citizens who have concerns and who share them with me. But I also want to remind you that overall a majority of European citizens support those negotiations. They might not be as vocal as those who are against, but their voice is also important. That is also democracy. Let me answer some of the questions. There was a question from the Committee on Development (DEVE) on the impact of TTIP on developing countries. We are doing a study on this in the Commission, and it will be published later this autumn. The preliminary results show there is actually very little impact on our neighbours and on developing countries, but we can come back to that once it is published. Regarding GMOs, our legislation will not change. What is prohibited in Europe today will remain prohibited; we will not change our laws on consumer protection; REACH standards will not be lowered, and we will stick very strongly to our precautionary principle. On ISDS, this is a chance we have together to reform an old system. That system dates from the 1950s. You represent – all of you but one – countries who have many of these bilateral agreements already. You might like them, you might not like them, but they exist and we have to face that. So this is an opportunity to really get rid of an old—fashioned system to create something new – something that clearly spells out that states have the right to regulate in order to protect their citizens. This can never be called into question. That brings procedures which are transparent and open, with court-like systems, judges and a system of appeal, leading to an international court – starting with TTIP but moving towards an international court. This is something that is being discussed all over the world. We have the highest number of these – more than 3 000 agreements. So let us take the chance – the world is watching us – to reform this system and create something really new. We can jointly show leadership here.  I also want to address the audiovisual issue. The Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) raised this. Liberalisation of the audiovisual sector is excluded from the mandate, as you know. Book pricing is not up for negotiation, and TTIP will not impose any obligation on any Member State to provide financial support to culture industries. There is also the question of jobs. Of course there are many studies being published in this regard. Most of them point in the same direction. This House – you – in September 2014, less than a year ago, published a paper with an in-depth analysis of the expected impact of TTIP on EU Member States. There was a hearing in the Committee on International Trade (INTA). It underlines that several studies generally confirm the trend that TTIP is expected to lead to benefits for the European Union as a whole, and the results are largely convergent. There are one or two divergent studies, but they use a different methodology. However, in your study you also say that the model used by the Commission in its impact assessment, and by others, is the most appropriate. We are also accused of not listening to concerns. Well, transparency has increased, thanks to your concerns and those of many others. We are about to reform the old ISDS system dramatically. We have made clear statements with the United States on public services. We are highlighting the need for SMEs, because they will be the big winners on this. We will continue to engage with you and others. Let me also remind you that the mandate to negotiate TTIP has been given by 28 countries unanimously and endorsed by this House as well. Why? Because Member States are convinced – and I think a majority of you are convinced – that trade agreements are good for Europe. 90% of growth in the coming years will come from outside Europe. We need to be there. Despite seeing light at the end of the tunnel in the economic crisis, we are still not out of it. We need jobs. We need growth. We need investments. There are many ways to do this, but TTIP and the other trade agreements that we are negotiating are a part of that struggle. Member States, and you, are closely involved in those negotiations now and in the months to come. When I and my team negotiate, we will never – nor will the Member States and nor will you – accept a TTIP that will lower protection for people or for the environment. Nobody will accept a TTIP that will restrict our right to provide new protections in the future. Nobody will accept a TTIP that gives companies unfair rights through secret tribunals. Nobody will accept a TTIP that will undermine Europe’s proud tradition of providing high-quality public services for our people. Instead we want a partnership – efficient, creating opportunities for European workers, consumers and SMEs – that allows us in Europe to be the shaper of globalisation, not a passive observer; a partnership based on close cooperation between this Parliament, national parliaments, Member States, the Commission and lots of stakeholders out there. Your resolution is forward—looking, and if it is voted through – as I hope it will be tomorrow – that will help to give a clear platform for TTIP. It helps us to negotiate an ambitious, comprehensive and balanced agreement. This is what it is all about. This is what we want to deliver for Europe.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to make three points at the end of this debate. Firstly, the resolution is not a resolution on ISDS. We have raised a whole range of issues in the resolution, which addresses the European values that we want to see implemented in a trade treaty. So, ladies and gentlemen, look at the resolution. It is a very broad resolution on cultural diversity, on services of general interest, on services, on data protection, on workers' rights. ISDS seems to me to have become something of a symbol. I would also ask those who are very critical of this to perceive a development. I share the criticism of private arbitration tribunals – no question. But I have not heard anyone in the debate today defending private arbitration courts. I firmly believe that private arbitration courts are dead and no longer belong in commercial contracts. We must enforce this in the TTIP, but also, of course, in the 1 300 existing bilateral trade agreements concluded in the Member States. This will not be an easy task to reconcile with the partner countries. Let us work together to impose a new system that complies with the rule of law. This requires a lot of strength. I have heard many fears – formulated in the subjunctive, because of course no one knows exactly what will come out at the end of the day. We want to discuss this very moment and adopt the resolution tomorrow, so that the concerns and needs do not become a reality. We want to make it clear where we stand. This is not a firlefanz, but a clear mandate for the European Commission, with which we will assess – when there is a text – whether we can accept this text or not. Ladies and gentlemen, not only defend something defensively, but sometimes you can also make improvements! We should also argue about this, for example on workers' rights. If it becomes a bad agreement, we will reject it. If it becomes a good one that is in line with our ideas, we will agree to it. Ladies and gentlemen, I have worked very inclusively. Fourteen committees have delivered opinions, and many of my fellow Members have tabled amendments. I want us to send out a strong signal together. I know that not everyone is 100% satisfied with a compromise, nor can it be.

It is important to bear in mind that globalization is happening without having legal regulations that will follow the reality of the time in which we live. TTIP is also a chance for many large and small businesses that have competitive products and services. I believe that Croatian companies will also have their interest in a new even bigger market because it has been shown that by joining the European Union, a huge market has been opened for our companies that have significantly increased exports.  As the market of the Member States of the European Union has become an opportunity that is successfully used to increase employment in Croatia, so can it be with a new large market that offers entry into the US market.

In a few months, the European Civil Initiative 'Stop TTIP' has collected more than two million signatures in 14 Member States, obliging the Commission to give a formal response to a motion calling for the halt to the TTIP negotiations and the abandonment of ISDS, which the European Parliament must also hear. But there seems to be too much business interests at stake for EU citizens to decide. The two largest ep factions, the EPP and S&amp;D, have had Parliament adopt a report which, by rewritten the original proposal, has not clearly rejected isds, and in fact the Socialists are preparing to support the Commission's pro-ISDS position with a repackaging ploy that is set out as a compromise.

The aim of this was to provide as detailed information as possible and to enable members of the various parliamentary committees to contribute to this important process. MEPs have the greatest influence on the final version of trade agreements between the EU and third countries. The Agreement may enter into force only if Parliament agrees. The rejection of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (TSC) ACTA) has shown that Parliament is very responsible in its role in trade and foreign policy. In the light of the many critical opinions expressed by the European public and the low public acceptance of the agreement negotiated, Parliament should strive for maximum transparency in order to ensure that only a good agreement is adopted that respects European values, promotes sustainable growth and contributes to the well-being of all citizens. Let us also not forget the very important issue for Europeans, the visa requirement.

Ms Jakobsen’s hearing before the CONT Committee demonstrated her commitment to good cooperation between the European Court of Auditors and the European Parliament in general and with the CONT Committee in particular. This cooperation must be based on mutual respect and understanding of the importance of effective European Union spending and policy management.

Based on a 16 billion euro guarantee financed from the EU budget and a contribution of 5 billion euros from the EIB, it hopes to mobilize about three times as much resources through the issuance of bonds used to attract other public or private investors and finance projects of about four times the initial risk-taking capacity (about 315 billion euros).

In addition, supply continues to grow and dairies are bursting at the seams without finding a sufficiently large market for their products.

I remember vividly those days. I remember the outpouring of solidarity in London, in the United Kingdom, and across the world, especially in the European Union. I want to mention this at the start of my contribution today, because I do believe that we, as Europeans – whatever our position may be on European integration, on European cooperation – at that moment had a sense of destiny, of common destiny. Whatever else we may do right or wrong, we have a common duty to fight for the security and safety of our citizens. We have a common duty to make sure that these barbarians, these distorted thinkers, these nihilists, are not in a position to wreak havoc in European society. This is one of the main challengers all our nations face. This goes beyond politics. This is about human dignity. This is about our common values. If I look back at the last couple of years, we have seen that Europe is facing a number of huge challenges: terrorism, as I just mentioned; the migration crisis; the need to create jobs and to create growth; the need to face the changes in the world’s economy and the place of Europe therein; and Greece. This is the backdrop against which we are working on our Commission Work Programme for this year and for next year. Let me say something briefly about this year’s state of play and the Commission Work Programme 2015. Over half of the Work Programme items are fully or mostly fulfilled. Thanks to you, to this Parliament, the European Fund for Strategic Investments has been operational since 1 July. We have set out strategic agendas, including for investment, energy union, the digital single market, migration, internal security and a fairer corporate tax system. These agendas and action plans signal a considerable legislative workload for this House in the months and years to come. Some of these proposals are already before you, and more are coming – starting with the revision of the energy labelling and emissions trading legislation next week. In total, over 40 proposals for legislation will flow from the strategies we have already presented. That comes on top of the 140 proposals which are pending on the table of the co-legislators. So please let us bust this myth that this Commission is not forthcoming enough. Where legislation is the right response to address the big things, we will be big on legislation. We are working on ambitious strategies on trade and investment, on the single market for goods and services, on an ambitious package for the circular economy. We will present an action plan for developing a real capital markets union in autumn, and we will accompany it with the first legislative proposals in the most pressing areas. And before the end of the year, we want to put to you a comprehensive – and clearly much-needed –’EMU package’. The importance of the social dimension – in EMU, obviously, but also more widely – is something President Juncker and I are both very attached to. To speed up the Youth Employment Initiative, we proposed making EUR 1 billion available this year. We are also actively working on a labour mobility package, to be adopted later this year. The College will have a further orientation debate dedicated to social policy immediately after the summer. Before looking ahead towards 2016, I would like to stress that it takes – in this case, oddly enough – three to tango. Delivering results where it matters is a shared responsibility of all three institutions. That is why we are now negotiating a revised interinstitutional agreement (IIA) on Better Law Making, and I am very much looking forward to my first meeting – on a political level as well – with Nicolas Schmit, who is representing the Presidency, and with Guy Verhofstadt, who is representing your Parliament. Our proposal pays particular attention to reinforcing and consolidating the annual and multiannual planning and programming. While respecting the specific arrangements for close cooperation between Parliament and Commission that are set out in the Framework Agreement – we respect and will continue to respect that Framework Agreement – and while respecting each of the three institutions’ roles under the Treaties, it is by working better upstream that we believe we can really make sure our combined efforts deliver effective and ambitious results to address the challenges Europe faces. Let me turn briefly to the preparations for next year. A first orientation debate will be held in College a week from now. In September, we will have an opportunity to take stock of the progress made and of the challenges ahead during President Juncker’s state of the union address. We intend to adopt the 2016 Work Programme on 27 October. In the run-up, the Commission will engage actively in dialogue with Parliament, in full accordance with the Framework Agreement. We will also listen to the input of Member States in the General Affairs Council. To launch and guide our discussion, a ‘letter of intent’ will be sent in parallel with the state of the union address here in this House. So that is for September. You can expect another targeted and balanced work programme, focused on 2016 – and 2016 only – grounded in the 10 priorities set out by President Juncker and agreed with your Parliament. Our strategic agendas – those we have already presented and those still to come later this year – will obviously be the main frame, and we will keep a clear focus on delivering what we have announced there. So please remember that those are the pivotal points in our Commission Work Programme. You know this already. This is the basis upon which we will develop our concrete proposals. And then, of course, next year will also be the year of the MFF mid-term review, which is also going to be a big challenge for both our institutions. There will be a strong emphasis on REFIT, because keeping the acquis up to date and pertinent to today’s challenges requires a permanent effort. And if pending proposals need to be repealed or withdrawn to allow the co-legislators to use their energy on files that have a chance of being adopted, we will flag them. We need to be, I believe, pragmatic and result oriented. If others need to be prioritising and speeding up, we will flag them too. I hope that we can work closely together with Parliament on this. I strongly believe in this, and I think we need to deliver better results for our citizens. In conclusion, Mr President, aligning our political priorities and planning can help make all the difference to whether Europeans look at Europe as part of the problem or rather as part of the solution to the huge challenges they face. I look forward to the resolution that this House will adopt later this week, which will be very useful in guiding the Commission’s ongoing reflections. Let us work together, let us work hard.

This week I think we can rightly say this, but that underlines the fact that we have to work on the effectiveness of how our Union works. The exercise of discussing the Commission’s work programme is something like that. Let us go back a little bit. I am glad that the Vice-President started with a little stocktaking because, here in the middle of the year, we can already see what has been happening. On behalf of the EPP I can confirm that the Commission has made a quick start and a good start. The investment package and many other initiatives have been strong, and on behalf of Parliament we would like to help this process of going forward in these areas. This energetic start should go on. I also would like to comment on the point that many have misinterpreted Parliament’s decision in January about the lack of support or a resolution on the Commission’s work programme. Normally in election years this is not required, because planning is much longer and much more preparation is needed, so it is not a failure to meet our obligations.

For example, in the negotiations which we are now having here in Parliament, we have had to discuss all the things which had been done in this last half year – all the compromises which we are going to foresee in the next year and the second part of this year – which are a little bit too dense, which means that we cannot make the same kind of compromises. However, in exercise of Parliament’s very important power, which is the right of initiative, we have this instrument which we have to use in order to get some kind of ideas on the Commission table, and we expect the Commission to follow those. The first thing is the method. I am glad that the Vice-President has mentioned that we want effective legislation, fighting red tape (including a significant reduction of the cost of the bureaucratic burden), and the transposition, implementation and enforcement of EU legislation. Very often we do not need new legislation; we just need to implement that which already exists in the right way. It obviously should not be a question of vanity whether someone has a report or a piece of legislation. We have to look more thoroughly in this Parliament at whether we can do more with a view to implementation. The Commission has to do the same. So this is why we are fully supporting the better law-making exercise and law-making programme. Another very important matter is the alignment of the legislation to the delegated and implementing act provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. This is a big delay; the Lisbon Treaty has been in force for quite a long time. We have seen resistance on the part of the Council. The Commission should also help Parliament to have full rights in this, otherwise we are falling into a constant inter-institutional fight in this area. We should solve this problem; it is already impossible that we have not gone further ahead on this.  Unfortunately, the Commission has withdrawn this piece of legislation. We hope that in the framework of the better law-making package we can do more. In our view, jobs remain the top priority; mobility and flexibility of the labour market have to be improved, as well as youth employment. The digital agenda has to play a crucial role in our society, especially in creating and re-shoring jobs, improving skills of EU citizens and work and school for the younger generation, giving better access to digital services. The next development of the EMU should be based, in our view, on the existing two-pack and six-pack legislation. We are against any revision of these two main instruments for the moment; we want them to be fully implemented and applied. On taxation policy, which is an integral part of the structural reform of the Member States, we would like to see a development, a shift of the tax burden from labour to other forms of taxation. Concerning the EU budget, the fight against tax fraud and evasion, supporting the better performance of the EU budget, is something very important. So just to sum up, we would now like Parliament to say that we want to have a say in this exercise, and this is what our resolution, hopefully, will be there to do. I hope that many colleagues in this House can support the joint resolutions which we have prepared.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2160, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Enrique Guerrero Salom", "mepid": "96768", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, we are in a double exercise. On the one hand, to check, in some way, what has happened, on the part of the Commission, since the presentation of its investiture programme, and, secondly, to try to provide an opportunity for the European Parliament to contribute to the political direction that the Commission itself has to put in place. Of course, this is an element of the interinstitutional agreement, but I think it goes beyond an agreement. It goes further. Because of its high political dimension, Parliament must be part of the political leadership of the Union. When it comes to reviewing what has happened in this first part of the Commission's action, the assessment I make is frankly positive. The mixing of the investment programme, the EIE, with the flexibility of the growth programme has enabled the Union's economic policy to be turned around and directed towards the elements that we have to solve in the context of the economic crisis: growth and job creation.  But, in turn, the Commission has also come up with a rather substantive proposal on fiscal policy and with action, in addition to a very courageous proposal, on immigration. And it has also come with ambitious positions in energy policy and also in other areas in the economic field. I would also like to point out that transparency has been established, has been installed in the Commission's behaviour and I think this is a positive point. For 2016, my group has sufficiently identified priorities in the social field, in the field of immigration, in the field of fiscal policy and in the field of democracy. In the social field, we want all The Union's policies to be crossed cross-cutting through social approaches. I know that the Vice-President often says that it is not enough to say that we are in favour of a social policy. I believe that we can work together to concrete in what respects. For example, in the fight against poverty and exclusion, in compliance with collective bargaining, in , as the Vice-President has just pointed out, legislation on the mobility of workers and rights, respect for workers' rights in the context of this mobility. In the area where you pointed out that you are going to present a package on economic and monetary union, we also want the social dimension to be a basic point of enhanced economic and monetary union, not only in the Presidents' document, but also in the Commission's action as a whole. In fiscal policy, the proposal can be simplified in two respects. We want it to be taxed in those countries where income is generated and we want there to be a common rate, a common consolidated corporate tax base. And in the field of immigration, the truth is that what I want is for the Commission to maintain the firm pulse it has maintained so far, asking Member States to comply jointly and severally with the burdens that are being generated by humanitarian crises. , also with solidarity, the issue of asylum. As far as democracy is concerned, and I conclude, I would like , my group wants - to put forward a proposal with objective indicators and a mandatory mechanism to respond to the failures and violations of the fundamental rights of the Union, enshrined in its Treaties.

Indeed, in many countries it is worse. Europe does need to change, and the perpetual path to political Union is not the solution, and my group does not support this. In my country six years ago we faced a deep economic crisis, but we now have more jobs than ever before and it is the fastest growing economy in the West. This is due to a long—term economic plan. In Europe, the economy needs to come first, and it is competitiveness that drives jobs and growth. This resolution has some helpful suggestions. The EU should not churn out new laws without thinking about the impact on growth, small businesses and innovation. The Commission has cut back new legislation, is focusing on making sure existing laws work and has promised to remove burdens for businesses and set a target for cutting red tape. This report supports all of that. I have also said that every EU initiative should face the simple test: will it make it easier or harder for businesses to thrive? This report supports that. A generation ago, politicians created the single market to make it easier to trade. This report says we must make it fit for purpose in a digital age, underpinning the digital revolution – not undermining it. This report supports that. We must increase external trade too. Let us sign the deal with Canada, and keep negotiating the one with the US. Yes, we need investment, built on private funds because the crisis in public debt is even more acute today than it has been in the past. We need to sort out Greece and to stop pretending that all sovereign credits are equal. Structural reforms are key. Majorities in this house at the moment are very narrow. Grand plans are easily stalled. We do need less law, but it needs to be very well targeted to get support.

I very much welcome the aim of the Commission, supported by the majority in this House, to cut red tape. I think that is always a good idea anywhere, but it should not become a goal in itself. Quite frankly, cutting red tape – important as it may be – is not the answer to all the big challenges of today. It is not the answer to the refugee crisis. It is not the answer to the crisis in the eurozone. It is not the answer to the dismantling of the Schengen area. It is not the answer to Mr Putin. So we need to cut red tape, but we need more than that. I think what we need to keep in mind is that what we are doing here today is creating the European Union that future generations will be living in. It is not just about us and our little differences, or indeed the things that bind us, it is about future generations. I will make a first remark about better law-making. As far as I am concerned, that is much more about the process than it is about the outcome, because the outcome is a matter of political choice. In the process I think there is a lot that needs to be improved, and the Commission can do a lot there too, for example by introducing a true culture of transparency and access to documents because, despite all the nice words, I find that the three institutions – and that includes the European Parliament – still have a very conservative reflex when it comes to opening up and being transparent. A second point – it is a minor one and is not in the resolution, but I think I am speaking on behalf of all of us – would be getting true and serious responses to our written parliamentary questions, rather than the non-answers that we usually get. It also means responding to legislative proposals by the European Parliament. I think that the Commissioner himself has said that he intends to do this, because there is something odd in the fact that a citizens’ initiative requiring a million signatures obliges the Commission to respond, but this Parliament, elected by no less than 170 million voters who went to the ballot boxes last year, can be ignored. Finally, I think the Commission can – and should – do a lot better on review and evaluation. On the big themes, we are talking about improving the eurozone – and that is not just Greece, that is eurozone governance – and we need to go much further than the five Presidents’ proposals. The Commission should stand shoulder to shoulder with the  European Parliament in avoiding the dismantling of the Schengen area and free movement.

That is why in the resolution that we are going to table and in the amendments we are going to table, we refuse to maintain debt as a pretext for imposing austerity measures and we propose their renegotiation, including their reduction and restructuring, so that debt in the various countries reaches sustainable levels, does not smother the development possibilities of countries and that they are simply payable. That is why we have proposed the repeal of the Stability Pact and the Budgetary Treaty, as well as the legislation on economic governance, giving countries the possibility of having a fiscal policy according to the different needs of each. That is why we propose that the Stability and Growth Pact be replaced by another pact, a pact for development and employment, which benefits all countries and we call for an intergovernmental conference to be held with the aim of repealing the budgetary treaty. That is why we demand a major change in the statutes and mandate of the European Central Bank in order to ensure equal political and democratic control of the European Central Bank. That is why we believe it is necessary to give the Member States the power to decide on matters as fundamental to the development of countries, such as monetary policy. That is why we advocate the repeal of banking union legislation and the need to ensure public and democratic control over the banking system. It is clear that when policies do not serve the interests of peoples and workers they must be changed.

I think all of us in this room can agree on one point, namely that Europe should indeed be big on big things and small on small things. But the debate, of course, is about what we call big and what we call small. That is a political debate and a political decision. Let us not hide between impact assessments, scrutiny boards or whatever. This should be an open political debate on what we call big and what we call small and where we will put Europe at the forefront. There is a lot of criticism about how Europe works at the moment, but is that because there are many rules coming out of Brussels or is it because of the situation in Greece? Is it because of the rising unemployment in Europe? Is it because of the rising inequalities in Europe? I think it is the latter. That is the big thing for me. Europe should become a Europe that is addressing inequalities and moving towards a social Europe and a sustainable Europe. That is the core, the big thing and the big challenge for Europe. I think we should always be united there. Mr Timmermans said that we should get rid of the myth that this Commission is not being progressive and not being ambitious on legislation. Well, I still have to say that we need to see some proof of that. One of the biggest moments when we are going to read that out is, of course, when you come forward with the so-called more ambitious proposal on the circular economy package. We will certainly watch closely to see whether that is indeed more ambitious. Mr Timmermans, you said in our group, ‘let me prove you wrong’, because you know we are sceptical. Well, I am happy to be proved wrong, but we have to see it. The same goes for issues like migration, and also the Commission’s first reallocation plans. These are good and we support them, but we all know that this is just the start of a big debate. The Commission should also come forward here, for example by creating legal routes for labour migration, which is a very important part. The same on taxation. The taxation package until now has not been very ambitious. We should have far more on transparency and country-by-country reporting. It is the same when we are discussing EMU, which needs to be more democratic and more social. We will challenge all these issues and have to look at them. In the end this needs to be done together, so let us indeed look forward to collaborating on the interinstitutional agreement – but let us do it on an equal footing.

The signal from Athens is not just a technical signal, limited to the subject of this question: it is above all a political signal, and no one more than this Parliament, as the direct representative of the citizens, can and must grasp its political significance in the noblest sense it contains. I therefore call on you to encourage the Juncker Commission to set up a work programme that knows: to consider the important events of last week, to show a Commission that is truly capable of holding the power of political initiative, with real benefit for all the peoples of the Union, especially the most vulnerable, for example, by reorienting the Juncker Plan according to criteria that take account of the geographical areas most in difficulty. Because – over and above the merits or responsibilities of governments – we in the European Parliament must have the people at the centre of our thoughts. The Commission has control over the leverage of political initiative: use it with awareness of the present and with attention to the future and above all with concrete solidarity. The individual measures must– in our view – focus in particular on the following elements: high unemployment and low growth, high levels of public debt and excessive bureaucracy, a credit system that is insensitive to the demands of families and businesses, a meapic and ineffective approach to immigration policies and the fight against climate change. Then there are some cross-cutting evils, such as corruption, tax evasion and the infiltration of organised crime, which make more incisive and coherent action urgently needed at Community level. In essence, what we as European institutions cannot afford is to lose the confidence of our citizens even more.

We will have to take decisive action to revise certain treaties which, of course, instead of bringing prosperity as we said a few decades ago, are leading to disaster for certain peoples. It is true that Sunday's signal in Greece was above all a political signal and I invite you, I implore you to change your policies more than what you are doing, because the Juncker plan, which was proclaimed last year, does not seem sufficient at the moment. Above all, however, you must also make us understand what your real priorities are, those that may not be said: that is, we care about our small and medium-sized enterprises, our traditions, our identities; we think that Europe is strong precisely because it is different. On the other hand, there often seems to be political action that looks more like multinationals, big banks and wants to homolote everything and everyone, in order to make us numbers. We do not accept that and sooner or later the people will rebel.  Think, for example, of the fact that the Made in Directive is practically blocked, while we are moving forward on TTIP, which, on the other hand, we know will probably be useful for some large multinationals but certainly not for our small and medium-sized enterprises, at least as it seems at the moment. Look also at the rest of the world: I do not understand why nothing is being done, for example, for our persecuted Christian brothers and sisters.

First of all, I have to say that there is broad support for working closely together on a Commission Work Programme that is targeted and, of course, that chooses political priorities after a debate. Political priorities are something you debate, and you look for majorities to get them, clearly. At the same time I also see the willingness in this institution, just as much as I know it exists in the Council and in the Commission, to reach an interinstitutional agreement – hopefully before the end of this year – on better law-making. Of course, better law-making is not the answer to all our problems: better law-making will not solve the crisis in Greece; better law—making is not the way to tackle Putin. I accept all these points. But better law-making is a way of trying to answer the plea of an endless number of SMEs across Europe which are telling me whenever I go to a Member State: ‘please help us cut red tape; please help us create more clarity; please help us understand that it is possible to create clear legislation, not legislation where Member States then have endless possibilities of gold plating so that we are completely lost.’ These are things that are important. They are important to SMEs; therefore, they are important to employment and to growth. Yes, of course this is not earth—shattering – this is not going to change the nature of Europe. But it is going to make a difference for hundreds of thousands of people who are trying, day by day, to work very hard to create a living for themselves, their families and the people who work for them. Therefore, this is an important thing for me. The way we create legislation is important to hundreds of millions of Europeans. Even if they do not know it is important to them, it still is, because the outcome is something they have to deal with. And let me be very clear on impact assessment. Let me be very clear on more scrutiny. This does not lead to taking away the power of politicians. We do not change that. It leads to better-informed politicians. I do not know what would be the problem with better-informed politicians. Better scrutiny and better impact assessment means that the politicians, when they decide, are better informed about what they can decide. I would say to Mr Eickhout: do not turn things around. Do not use the argument that ‘the politicians should be in charge’ to dismiss impact assessment and to dismiss scrutiny. That would be changing the argument you are using against me completely around. Both are wrong. The Commission does not want to use impact assessment and scrutiny to disempower politicians. On the contrary, we want to help politicians to be better informed. We see across our Member States that sometimes scrutiny or analysis leads to a conclusion, and the experts then say this means that this measure is going to be more costly for this or that reason. Then parliaments still decide, but we think that this cost is justified for bigger political goals, and therefore we do it anyway. But at least people know what you decide, and I think there is nothing wrong with that. As regards more transparency: I am all for it. But one of the reasons why we – the two institutions – need more transparency is also to show our customers, i.e. the recipients of our legislation, where we are responsible – Parliament and Commission – and where the Member State is responsible. There is still a tremendous amount of gold-plating going on. And again here, Member States have the full right to do that. If they want to create stricter legislation, it is entirely up to them – they have the full right to do it. But then do not blame Europe for it. Be honest about it, be transparent about it. I think the proposals we will discuss in our interinstitutional agreement will help us become more transparent. This also applies – and I say this clearly to Mr Szájer as well – to delegated acts and implementing acts. There, I hope we can reach an agreement which will create more transparency. As far as the Commission is concerned, we will put all draft delegated acts on the internet for a period of four weeks, so that everybody in the outside world can see what we are proposing. For the implementing act it is slightly more difficult, because sometimes – like when you change the price of a product – you cannot give that over for public debate for a long period of time. Everyone will understand that. But we will try to put the maximum amount of primary and secondary legislation up for public scrutiny, so that everybody knows what we are doing. Hopefully, then, we will avoid another ‘olive oil can’ disaster or something like that. It might help by putting it in the public sphere. Of course, we will need to act on a number of things that are very important, and migration is one of them. I am sure tomorrow, when the debates are held on the results of the European Council, President Juncker will want to come back to this. But the Commission sticks to its proposals. We believe, also after debate with your Parliament, that we are on the right track with these proposals. If you ask me what the difference between legal and illegal migration is, clearly somebody who is abusing the asylum system because they want a better life in Europe is an example of illegal migration. Asylum policy should be for people who flee because they fear for their lives. I think we have less support in Europe for asylum policy, because many of our citizens know that the system is being abused and because we are not able, if we discover people abusing the system, to make sure they return to the countries they came from. If we want a credible migration and asylum policy, we have to make sure that the rules are actually applied, so that people who deserve asylum get asylum – unfortunately too often the system fails them – and that people who do not deserve asylum are sent back to where they come from, and also that we have agreements with third countries to do that. But we also need – and this is simple demographics – possibilities for the European Union to have traditional, legal forms of migration. There needs to be a possibility for people to apply for a visa, at an embassy in the country where they live, to come and live and work in Europe. They should not be at the mercy of smugglers, nor should they run the risk of drowning in the Mediterranean, but rather they should have a fair chance – if Europe needs people like them – to apply and then come to Europe. In that sense, I believe legal migration is also part of the solution. Let me conclude by saying that for me, the important thing here is that our two institutions work closely together, because I do not think anybody disputes our goal that we should perform better in delivering results for our citizens. Sometimes these are huge – big earth-shattering results – but very often they are small results. But a number of small results will create more growth, more jobs, better social protection and a better future for hundreds of thousands of young Europeans who are still unemployed today.

A key challenge remains the area of justice and fundamental rights. We must take measures to promote the employability of European workers and to address the problems of long-term unemployed people, especially young people.

Climate change policy must be forward-looking, and the reform of the Emissions Trading System (ETS) is also important. A reasonable and balanced free trade agreement with the US is of strategic importance.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my fellow Members who have contributed to this report. They are due thanks and not ritual, because, as they first know, the path has been very long and difficult. The vote was postponed for the first time in committee. Then, after the committee voted, it was sent back to the Chamber following a decision by the Conference of Presidents. The vote scheduled for June in this House has therefore been postponed to July and tomorrow we will finally be able to vote. We have gained time, but I believe that it was a wise choice which made it possible to deepen the substance of complex and controversial issues on which there were, quite legitimately, non-convergent opinions. So thanks to the shadow rapporteurs of the JURI Committee, thanks to Olle Ludvigsson, who was the rapporteur for the ECON Committee, and to his colleagues who worked as shadow rapporteurs. However, before I quickly get to the content of the directive, I wanted to say one thing to the Commission. I regard this directive as part of a larger mosaic, the one that should correctly and effectively define the governance profile of the European company of the future. The intuition even lies in Jacques Delors' 1993 White Paper: we are working in the direction he pointed out to us. However, it is a very good job. Today we deal with shareholders, then we will have to move on to stakeholders to give that social dimension to the company that the then President took as a reference, indeed built with his proposal. For this reason, I expect the Commission to take further initiatives of this kind in this direction.  In the meantime, as I said, we have come to define what the long-term orientation will be on the part of companies and shareholders and, above all, to increase transparency on key elements of the management of the company, of its corporate governance. We have agreed – and this is very important – that companies can identify their shareholders; I am talking, of course, about publicly traded companies. Just as measures are planned to improve the ability of shareholders to vote: it is an element not only of democracy but of effectiveness in the management of any company. The transmission of information along the intermediary chain will also make the work of shareholders more effective and also aware. Then there are the measures that, if applied correctly, can increase the transparency of the relationship between institutional investors, asset managers, and companies, so that the commitment policy defines for companies their return, in the short term but above all in the long term, thus emerging from the risk of being used simply for financial purposes. There are also measures that will increase the transparency of proxy advisor activity, an important function in any system. Now, we have confirmed the transparency requirements that were laid down by the Commission. And this, I think, is an effective and conscious choice. The same will apply to transactions for related parties, which must be subject to controls that will be differentiated according to the legislative system of each Member State of the Union. The changes proposed by Parliament will therefore make it possible to take account of these national differences, without them becoming an element of questioning the unity of European policies. Then there is the issue of directors' remuneration, which has been widely discussed. There was strong convergence between us on this issue, but there were different views on how to give it an adequate consistency. We have found the solution to the case and the shareholders will vote but their vote may be binding or advisory, depending on the decisions taken by each country.  And last but not least, country-by-country reporting. The fight against tax evasion can and must be done through the use of new tools: the annual reporting for publicly traded companies is one of them. The Kaili report had already suggested this: we have used this path, that of the shareholders' directive, as a first legislative appointment to introduce a hypothesis of immediate revision of the accounting directive. Once again, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this report and, of course, I will listen with interest to your comments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2176, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, let me thank you for your strong interest in this proposal, and allow me to recall briefly what our intention was when we tabled this proposal. Remember, the financial crisis hit the world economy and some of our societies very hard. Structural weaknesses in corporate governance have become more evident, and a broad consensus emerged that short-termism has played an important role in causing and deepening the crisis. This directive is one of the contributions to addressing these shortcomings at EU level. It will also contribute to putting the EU back on the path of long-term sustainable growth. Over the last few years capital markets have become more driven by the prospect of quick trading gains rather than by conscious and engaged investment. Even investors such as pension funds, whose very mission is to secure a long-term return on investment, have followed the markets and put short-term pressure on companies. We need to encourage more long-term financing and long-term shareholder engagement. This also means more competitive companies on the global stage. We believe that by enhancing corporate governance, we would give investors the necessary tools to engage and protect their rights. This should make European companies more attractive for investors. I would like to thank Mr Cofferati and all the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts in defining Parliament’s position. I welcome the compromise found, and the Commission is ready to engage in negotiations with the co-legislators. Let me now express some views on several of your amendments. First, concerning transparency obligations on companies about tax matters and tax rulings – the so-called country-by-country reporting. As the honourable Members know, the Commission is committed to fighting tax evasion and aggressive tax planning and will analyse whether additional disclosure of certain corporate tax information should be introduced. On 17 June, the Commission launched a public consultation on possible options, which will feed into the impact assessment work that will be concluded at the latest in the first quarter of 2016. Second, concerning measures to incentivise long-term shareholdings through increased voting rights or dividends: while the Commission agrees with the overall objective, the question is: how best to achieve this? We should avoid discouraging investors, especially cross-border and foreign investors, from investing in European companies, and we should not lose sight of the interests of minority shareholders. Finally, concerning related party transactions, the Commission notes that the amendments tone down the original Commission proposal. I believe that we need a harmonised threshold for the application of rules on related party transactions in the single market. Currently, 40% of shareholders are cross-border based, and the lack of a uniform definition of related party transactions leads to fragmentation and increased costs both for investors and for companies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2177, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "n/a", "mepid": "96673", "text": " rapporteur on the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr I welcome the measures we are now discussing.  It is quite right to encourage institutional investors and other shareholders to step in more actively and in the long term and influence the development of the companies in which they have invested. Not least, it is important to facilitate active cross-border ownership. The package of measures should increase engagement – and thus better functioning companies. It is particularly important that there is now broad support in Parliament to increase transparency around cross-border businesses. Extending country-by-country reporting requirements to all sectors is a natural and effective reform. It is about giving shareholders more transparency and, more generally, pushing back corruption, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning.

This debate is extremely important not only because of the content of the document we are currently working on. We must ask ourselves a few key questions, which are really extremely important in the context of the regulations that we have before us, namely company law, any other legislation that will regulate the functioning of companies and companies operating in the European Union, regardless of their size. Key question: when will people, when the citizens of the European Union be happy, be happy? When they have a job – good work, well paid. Question 2: how will we treat entrepreneurs in the European Union, or just those who want to cheat and not pay taxes all the time, as those who will stiing workers and give them the least possible wages, or whether we will look at it from a slightly different point and deal with it in real terms, rather than looking for a hole in the creation of legal forms in the European Union that will not interfere , and they will allow economic development to create the mythical economic growth that we are fighting for, boasting about the free market in which we operate in the European Union. The free market is another key word in this context, because, I ask you, who creates jobs? Member State governments, European Commission, European Parliament? No, jobs in the European Union and everywhere are created by companies, entrepreneurs, these active people. I would remind you that more than 90% of companies operating in the European Union are small and medium-sized enterprises. What do we suspect of them? That they are oppressors? Let us start thinking logically and, with regard to this free market, we will also address other issues related to it, namely the remuneration of executives, which are, after all, part of the free market. I believe that shareholders should have the right, not the obligation, to decide what remuneration system they choose, a system that is appropriately adapted to the company's operating profile and to the objectives that the company puts before it. I am therefore very pleased and thank you very much to our rapporteur, my colleagues on my committee, that, after a hard and long debate, we have come to the conclusion that this is the right direction. And we have a document on the table today with which we can move on to the next stage: negotiations with the Council, negotiations, which, of course, will not be easy, because we still have some differences.

Mr President, I would like to thank the My thanks are especially due to Sergio Gaetano Cofferati. He has done a truly wonderful job on this report in a situation that has sometimes been anything but easy. It has really improved the content of the draft directive, together with the shadow rapporteurs and all those who have then taken a very constructive part. We in the Committee on Legal Affairs and The Internal Market have certainly made a number of contribution to improving transparency, corporate governance and compliance with tax rules. We have achieved – and here I would also like to highlight the role of social democracy – that important information on the remuneration of the board of directors, tax strategies and risky business of society must now be submitted to the public. Let me send a message, above all to you, Commissioner, but also to some Members of the PPE and ALDE: it is time to wake up. We need more employee participation. Under the original rules, the Annual General Meeting had to approve the remuneration of the Board of Management at least every three years. This is an attempt to unilaterally strengthen the competences of the Annual General Meeting and thus often in the short term the interests of shareholders, but it massively neglects the interests of employees and other stakeholders. In the end, they are particularly interested in the sustainable success of a company. Our changes – the S&amp;D Group – have strengthened the interests of employees in their role as a key success factor in the company.  However, the text that has been adopted now also contains something that is of particular concern to me, particularly in the light of our work in the TAXE Committee: namely, the measures that are capable of actually combating tax evasion. Here, of course, as you have already mentioned, Commissioner, and many others will probably address me, I am addressing country by country reporting, which is so important in order to shed more light on the dark, and this is also right here in this report, and I stress that it is absolutely right. The mandatory country-specific disclosure of essential information is an absolutely important concern for our group and should be highlighted at every point. It is about the good reputation of the company, which is at stake when the pressure to behave correctly increases accordingly, and therefore we should always take this opportunity openly as far as possible.

Mr President! I believe that we all agree that there should be a level playing field for the companies at issue here, but the proposal that has been put forward goes far beyond what is reasonable. This goes far beyond what we in the European Parliament should get involved in. By setting the scope for regulating issues of deals between related parties and the remuneration of directors, we are interfering to an unprecedented extent in how private companies should be run, how their individual management rights should be arranged. In my view, the proposal is based on the idea that the management of Europe's listed companies is generally driven by the desire for short-term gains rather than long-term goals and good solid results. Nothing could be more wrong if you come from Denmark, where we know Novo Nordisk, where we know AP Møller Maersk, which has just proved itself worthy of wearing the confidence that has shown that they can handle these issues themselves.

I am very happy that we have been able to find a compromise, in the centre of this European Parliament, that can gather broad support among pro-European and progressive forces. This has, of course, meant that all of us have had to make concessions and do so in a spirit of compromise on a number of points, but I believe that the end result is acceptable to all of us. For the Liberal group it has been a paramount concern that this directive should improve the ability for shareholders to exercise their rights in cross-border situations and not to add unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy, because let’s face it, European entrepreneurs and companies will not flourish because of the additional rules to comply with, but rather if we create a good business environment where they can focus on their core tasks. We do not believe that we can generate long-term engagement in companies by investors through legislative proposals requiring various sorts of policy papers or creative tax incentives. Shareholders need access to appropriate information, but then it remains their responsibility to engage with the companies that they own. If this interest is not there, it cannot artificially be engineered by politicians or bureaucrats. I think that the focus put to a large extent by the proposals of the Commission on requiring a detailed remuneration policy and remuneration report for the director’s remuneration is, to say the least, difficult to understand, not to say rather populist.

The financial crisis, as the Commissioner also pointed out, has shown that in many cases shareholders have encouraged trustees to take excessive short-term risk, focusing only on short-term returns. Furthermore, I believe that the rapporteur's efforts to increase transparency in companies should be supported by publishing the minutes of the general meetings on the companies' websites. For the first time, the regulation of remuneration policy at European level is mentioned. What I consider to be key to our faction is the anchoring of the principle of country by country reporting.

Mr President, with this proposal to amend the Shareholders' Rights Directive, the Commission has become aware of the need to integrate the issue of long-term investment and this is an excellent thing, because the European economy suffers from the permanent diktat of urgency and, above all, short-term financial profitability. Taking into account - as you do and as you have proposed - all stakeholders, small shareholders, of course, but also employees, who constitute the wealth of a company, is extremely positive. However, it was insufficient and more needed to be done on the issue of opacity, which encloses large groups and their activities.  It is obvious to environmentalists to push the issue of transparency to the question of what is euphemistically called tax optimization and to ensure that we can move forward on this issue. The LuxLeaks scandal has shown us all that the warnings that have been issued for many years, especially by environmentalists, are likely to force us to provide answers. What for? Because this famous tax optimization is a direct attack on fair competition, because large groups can choose tax optimization, where SMEs, SMALL and craftsmen, for example, or the liberal professions cannot do so. It was therefore necessary to act and I pay tribute to Mr Cofferati, for the quality of his work and his listening, as well as to all the groups that have tried to find a synthesis to ensure that this Parliament has the general interest against national private interests and tax competition that some States - the richest for that matter - and the interests of large private groups.

In this respect, and, in our opinion, the introduction of the principle that the commitment of ethically responsible managers on the basis of the programmes and results achieved in the field of corporate social responsibility can be rewarded is particularly important. Another firm point, which is essential for us, is the adoption of rules to combat tax avoidance and evasion, such as the obligation for companies to state publicly in which countries they pay taxes.

However, I believe that the report we had in committee at the beginning of May has made the situation much worse, which we do not really want to have today under the heading of better regulation. We cannot generate strong companies and economic enterprises and growth by selectively strengthening shareholder rights and ignoring existing corporate law systems or by entrusting companies with even more tasks. Today, there is absolutely no objection to having dualistic stock corporation systems, whereby the tasks of the Executive Board and supervisory board should not be diminished by the function of the Annual General Meeting, especially with regard to the design of the remuneration policy.

After all, it is precisely the employees who have a great interest in a company having a good, long-term future!

I would like to thank our shadow rapporteur, Tadeusz Zwiefka, but also the rapporteur, Sergio Gaetano Cofferati, for this. Because I am convinced that the goal, sustainable business development and greater transparency, in any case unites us across all political groups. The only question is how far we can get with this directive at these points. And I know that there is a catchphrase for the rapporteur in particular and for many parts of this House. It's about country-by-country reporting. I am not a specialist in accounting. All I know is that we had a tax law professor in the TAXE Committee of Inquiry last week who pointed out that country-by-country reporting – okay, he came from the UK, but I think he spoke representatively for everyone – would not end up with intra-business transfers. And the problem with the large groups, with the big companies in the world, is not that they do not, so to speak, create transparency per country, but that we do not know how the financial flows for patents and other things within companies are going. That is why I think that there is still a considerable need for discussion here in order to meet the objective of greater transparency. But the first step has been taken with this proposal. Secondly, as Mr Becker has already pointed out, it is, of course, also a question of finding adequate solutions that work in all the Member States.

I would therefore like to ask the rapporteur that we now work together to find other ways of achieving a genuine common goal in the end.

I would like to say that our objective remains what was contained in the Commission's proposal, which we have strengthened and relaunched: on the one hand, to have an incentive for investors who look to the company as a place to produce wealth and not to activate speculation. For this reason, the investor's stay in the company is to be considered a positive choice and as such must be encouraged; on the other hand, we need transparency, as we have all said: transparency in order to combat fraud, transparency to combat illegality, transparency also, more simply, to combat tax evasion and avoidance. Paying taxes is a duty, even if it is a sacrifice for everyone: for individual citizens just as it is for businesses. But what is then paid has a reuse in terms of the stabilization of communities through the development of social protection policies, which are thus paid for. That is why it is an act of civilisation, which must be modulated, but modulation is easier when everyone loyally participates in the objective and the contribution that comes with it. I would like to remind you, with regard to country-by-country reporting , and I say this above all to the Commission and the Commissioner, that the Kaili report that we adopted in this Parliament last March called for country-by-country reporting to be activated through an immediate review of the accounting directive. The Rights Directive amends the accounting directive, which is why this is the right place to introduce this novelty, on which we will all work together, starting with the Commission.

Thank you very much, Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues. I think all eyes are on the Greek crisis this afternoon. Unfortunately, the urgency of this case is to put all the other files into the background. But global warming cannot wait, unfortunately. We must move forward in the fight against greenhouse gas emissions. With the introduction of this automatic correction mechanism (the market stability reserve or MSR), we are – I am convinced – taking a very important step in the reform of our emissions trading system, which was almost capsized under the pressure of the economic crisis. I believe that this will save us the most important pillar of our European climate policy. The MSR must ensure that there are new incentives to invest in energy efficiency and therefore in lower emissions. We are taking a first important step to achieve our ambition to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% by 2030. This will fundamentally strengthen our credibility and our negotiating position at the crucial UN climate conference in Paris at the end of this year. The reform we are now adopting proves that we can indeed reconcile an ambitious climate policy with economic growth and jobs. We are well aware that the transition to low-carbon production requires very important investments. Many European companies today have to compete against competitors from outside the European Union who do not have to buy CO2 emission rights, and so there is indeed a risk of carbon leakage. The energy-intensive industrial sectors, which are making great efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and are subject to international competition, must, of course, continue to be guaranteed that they will not be penalised if they want to increase their production – which of course we all want when economic growth picks up. I would also like to add something in English: ... What is more – and this is often forgotten – in this context, important derogations and important new initiatives have been agreed and are part of this decision – initiatives that are specifically in favour of those Member States with a GDP lower than the EU average. Let me refer to three decisions in particular. Firstly, the derogation for free allowances for the power sector will be continued for those Member States. Secondly, the new modernisation fund of approximately two billion euros will be created for additional investment in those Member States. And thirdly, a solidarity mechanism will be created of which the revenues are to be invested and distributed among the less-than-90% average income countries, and this is all too often not mentioned in this debate and in this context. If all goes well, Commissioner Cañete will come up with a new proposal for ETS reform next week. Of course, this new proposal must also further refine the guarantees against carbon leakage for the next few years. We are counting on the Commissioner and we are confident that he will come up with an ambitious yet balanced proposal. Finally, I would like to express my thanks, first and foremost to Commissioner Cañete and the services of Director-General Delbeke for the excellent cooperation and excellent proposals. I would like to thank the Latvian Presidency, which is unfortunately absent. I would particularly like to thank Ambassador Stalmeistars for the very effective and very pleasant leadership in this dossier. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Groote, Duncan, Gerbrandy, Kyllönen, Eickhout, Evi and their team for their excellent cooperation.

Once this Parliament ratifies the agreement reached with the Council, this reserve will form an integral part of the Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, and this scheme is the cornerstone of the European Union's climate policy. However, in recent years, excess emission allowances on the market have prevented this regime from giving the signals necessary to make sufficient low-carbon investments. The stability reserve is designed precisely to address this problem and make the provision of rights more flexible. This is expected to increase market confidence in the Emissions Trading Scheme and, in the coming years, prices will give the right signals in order to achieve our long-term emission reduction targets. In this way, the stability reserve will ensure that we do not miss important opportunities for efficient emission reduction. I would like to thank all Members for their work. In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belet, and his negotiating team, as well as Mr Tajani and the shadow rapporteurs of the political groups, for their efforts. The commitment reached is a solid solution around the great elements of this reserve of market stability. Let me highlight the most important ones. The Commission's original proposal set 2021 as the date for the reservation to be operational. During the debate many Members requested an advance of this date, which has led to the commitment made to make the reservation operational in 2019. The commitment also provides for the transfer of withdrawn market duties and duties not attributed to the market stability reserve. And so, the nine hundred million rights that were withdrawn from the market between 2014 and 2016 will not return to the market in 2020 as originally planned. Untributable rights are also transferred to this reserve, which will reduce the risk of regime volatility. The importance of innovation — for me one of the essential elements of this agreement — is also reflected in the compromise text reached. It has been agreed that, as part of the revision of the Emissions Trading Scheme, consideration should be given to whether fifty million untributable duties should be used to accelerate investments in low CO2 technologies. The agreed text also recognises the importance of industrial competitiveness and the risk of carbon leakage for European industry. I can assure you that these two elements will be important issues to be addressed in the framework of the proposal for a revision of the Emissions Trading Scheme. All the elements I have mentioned will allow a solid architecture of the market stability reserve, as well as ensure the strengthening of the Emissions Trading Scheme in the future. We have reached an important milestone with this compromise text, which allows us to focus now on the revision of the Emissions Trading Scheme for the period 2020–2030. Last year I committed myself to Parliament to translate the elements of the 2030 climate and energy package related to this Emissions Trading Scheme into a concrete proposal as soon as agreement on the market stability reserve was reached. I am going to fulfil this commitment and I intend to present, in July, a proposal on the basis of the consensus reached by the Heads of State and Government during the European Council last October 2014. This proposal will be an important part of the work we are called to do to achieve an energy union with a future climate change policy, which is a priority for this Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2225, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Antonio Tajani", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Ivo Belet, for his excellent work in reaching agreement and concluding this dossier. Agradezco también el comisario por su trabajo y su cooperación. With the final agreement, we have struck an excellent balance between environmental policy and industrial policy. We have introduced important measures, which will make it possible to balance the additional costs to businesses arising from European climate legislation. I would remind you in particular of the provisions on carbon leakage and the Innovation Fund, to which 50 million co2 quotas will be allocated. In order to consolidate this necessary combination of the fight against climate change and industrial policy, a good compromise will have to be found in the reform of the ETS, in particular on two aspects. Therefore, looking to the future, we will have to take care to reach agreement on the allocation number to be allocated to the energy-intensive industries and compensation for indirect costs due to the increase in the price of CO2. I hope that the number of relocations for the energy-intensive industries will not be revised downwards: we must protect our industries and, above all, those sectors at risk of relocation.  As far as compensation for indirect costs is concerned, we need a harmonised solution at European level. The current system does not work and creates competitive distortions between Member States with negative effects for European industry. I hope that the Commission will take these suggestions into account with a view to reforming the ETS. Of course, it is important to achieve the 40% greenhouse gas reduction target by 2030, but we must also remember that there is another goal: manufacturing must generate at least 20% of European GDP by 2020.

The GROUP of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will, of course, vote in favour of the text tomorrow. It has been a good proposal from Commissioner Hedegaard on the table, and we have also made it even better with the help of her successor, Miguel Arias Caete. The proposal that we now have on the table is more ambitious than what the Commission originally proposed. I say this to all those who criticise the proposal because they say that it is not enough. Not only are we starting two years earlier, but more importantly, contrary to the original proposal, the allowances that were temporarily taken out in backloading are actually permanently in reserve and that the allowances that we have not distributed until 2020 will also be placed in reserve. This is certainly an ambitious approach in terms of climate protection, so that emissions trading really works again. On the other hand – and I fully support this – we have made clarifications that help to avoid carbon leakage. We do not want the energy-intensive industry to leave, but we want it to be up-to-date with state-of-the-art innovation. This is what the benchmarks serve, and that is also the purpose of the fund, which Parliament has pushed through in the negotiations against sometimes massive opposition. We, as a Parliament, have ensured that we help industry along this difficult path. I would ask the industry, this outstretched arm, to accept this outstretched hand now and to reject unambitious climate protection proposals. I believe that this is the path that we should continue along and which the Commission should continue to take next week in its proposal, which I am sure will come next week: ambitious climate protection, but with opportunities for industry to continue to produce in Europe: if we manage to achieve this, we will also be a good example for the rest of the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2227, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Matthias Groote", "mepid": "34728", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

I have to say that Parliament has acted really responsibly on this important issue. After all, the emissions trading system will finally be able to breathe, it has to be said, through the market stability reserve that we are launching here tomorrow – our group will also be voting in favour of it. You can react to cyclical fluctuations. Previously, the emissions trading scheme was static allyed and constructed; this was a design error that we had installed there. In this respect, the emissions trading system with the market stability reserve has now arrived in reality. I think it is very good that we are taking a total of 1.5 billion allowances into reserve – out of the market – which will cause us these difficulties, that we will then really achieve a reasonable realistic price for a tonne of CO2, that investments are made – investments in climate-friendly technologies – but also that clear framework conditions are given, legal framework conditions for those who want to invest now. In this respect, it was very long overdue that we had come to this. I believe that this will create a stable legal framework, but also send out a signal to the rest of the world, including the COP21 conference: the fact that a sensible industrial policy, as Mr Tajani has just described, can be combined with climate protection and environmental protection is not mutually exclusive. In this respect, I am really glad that we – and I repeat at this point – have acted so responsibly and launched the whole thing. For our group, the start date is a drop in the ocean. But it is a compromise, as has already been mentioned. In this respect, I believe that we do not need to be ashamed tomorrow of getting this legislation off the road in this way, but, quite honestly, we can be proud that we have taken European climate protection policy, but also industrial policy, a step further.  Then, Commissioner Arias Caete, we are waiting for your proposal. I hope he will come before the summer. Perhaps you will be able to comment on this again in a while. I asked Mr. Efsovic at the committee meeting at the time. He said: yes, before the summer break. I asked him: In what year?

I take my hat off to Mr Belet, who has begun the journey of trying to reform what has been a dysfunctional but important policy. The challenges that we faced in trying to bring about compromise were not easy. The start date alone created a great deal of tension, not only in this Parliament but also in many of our own individual groups. I think the 2019 start is the right start. I am also aware of the challenge again of those unallocated allowances measured in the billions represented. I am pleased, again, that they have been sequestered away because without that happening, quite frankly, this process would not work. I am also aware that the phase 4 of the emissions trading scheme that we must shortly embark upon will again ask very serious questions about the functionality which we must achieve if the emissions trading scheme is to deliver and if in the bygoing we are going to begin to link that scheme with comparable schemes in the rest of the globe. But I am fully aware that if we get this wrong, and if we do put a burden upon many of our larger emitters, then we will have serious challenges. That is why I am pleased again to see that there are conditions affecting carbon leakage. We must get that right too. We do not wish to find ourselves securing significant reductions in our emissions simply by the exclusion and the loss of industry, which is important in so many parts of our Union. All that being said, I think where we are now is in the right place. I believe we are going to make significant progress if we can put on the table the beginning of a functioning emissions trading scheme when it comes to the COP meeting in Paris.

The greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme is the most important instrument for combating emissions that promote climate change. It is therefore essential to restore full performance to this instrument which, due to the economic slowdown and excess liquidity of allowances that has occurred on the market, no longer provided the appropriate final price for limiting emissions.  Economic incentives need to be in favour of the transition to a clean economy, not against. I therefore believe that this reform is essential to correct the present imbalance. The outcome of the negotiations on this legislative proposal will allow for a more stable and predictable market environment, more environmentally friendly and more investment-friendly in green technologies. I hope that the European Commission, Commissioner, will now work to propose, even before 2020, an innovation fund to promote research and development in low-carbon technologies. The future is built today by betting on tomorrow's technologies. I am pleased that the reserve for stabilising the licence market will be operational earlier than originally proposed by the Commission for 2021, i.e. as early as 2019.

Commissioner, you have made a commitment, we are sure you will honour it, but we are sure that we must give a strong signal before COP21 in Paris from a Europe that still wants to be a leader in the fight against climate change and that wants to give an indication, also with the instrument that we will vote on tomorrow, of a strong will to have sustainability in the future of our industrial system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2240, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Theresa Griffin (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124961", "text": "   – Madam President, the EU emissions trading scheme is the cornerstone of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and covers around 45% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. However, the current EU ETS is flawed, as it fails to address problems of oversupply of allowances in the market, which enable the industry to emit greenhouse gases. It is crucial that we take action to repair the ETS and turn it into a mechanism that both controls emissions and promotes investment in clean technologies such as renewables. We need to give stability and predictability to the EU ETS in order both to achieve our climate objectives and to give more stability to industry. I believe the market stability reserve is the right instrument to achieve stability in the market. It has been the position of the S&amp;D to support its introduction as soon as possible by transferring carbon allowances to the market stability reserves in times of over-supply and releasing them in times of under-supply. The EU ETS will be more flexible and more stable and therefore better placed to achieve our climate goals. We must have a balanced system that will benefit our industries and enable a transition to a sustainable and green economy in Europe, which will provide a model for other countries worldwide.

Firstly, the reserve was adopted on the basis of a bad legal basis and its adoption could have a significant impact on the energy mix in countries such as my homeland Poland. The procedure should be conducted on the basis of unanimity rather than a majority in the Council.  Secondly, emissions per capita in Poland are only slightly above the EU average. It is worth recalling that old Member States such as Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg have much higher emissions per capita, and the introduction of the reserve will mainly hit consumers and industry in Poland due to our specific energy structure. From this point of view, it is a measure with a cost completely disproportionate to the benefits.  Thirdly, I am against attempts to control the price of emissions, such an artificial attempt to control the price.

The aim is therefore to correct the shortcomings of the system in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The creation of a market stability reserve for the existing system will be ineffective if serious and sustainable investments for alternative energy sources are not planned and financed.  Without the above investments, tackling climate change and the European Union's transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy will remain an empty letter.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2267, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Ivan Jakovčić (ALDE).", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   – Mr. President, I want to welcome this Commission proposal because I see it as a step forward, a step in the right direction to try to stabilise the market.

However, what I would like to specifically warn the Commission about, what will we do with those investments that are there, in front of us and that want to be done by further carbonising our industry, especially coal-based energy production – do we have an answer to such demands?

Now it is time to look forward. Allow me to recall the broader context. An important milestone for the European Union ETS has been achieved. We can now turn this page and concentrate on our efforts to complete the architecture of the European Union ETS for the period after 2020. Last year I committed here to translate the ETS-related elements of the 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework into legislation swiftly after the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) had been agreed. I will keep my promise. It is our firm intention for the Commission to present a legislative proposal on the revision of the European Union ETS next week, on 15 July. This proposal will constitute an important part of the work on the achievement of our resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy, which is a key political priority for the Juncker Commission. It will focus on the aspects on which the European leaders gave us their guidance in October 2014. Firstly, free allocation to industry will be continued to ensure that sectors at genuine risk of carbon leakage will be adequately protected. Secondly, the proposal will establish a modernisation fund for modernisation of the energy systems in lower—income Member States. The option of free allocation of allowances to modernise electricity generation in the same Member States will also be continued, but transparency will be considerably enhanced. Finally, support for the development of low-carbon innovation will be continued through an innovation plan which, compared to the current NER300 facility, will see its scope extended to industrial innovation projects. Given the variety of uses addressed in the future proposal, I expect a challenging, yet constructive, legislative debate. I sincerely hope that we will be able to continue the positive cooperation that we have been able to establish through the work on the Market Stability Reserve.

I think we can say that the decision we are going to vote on tomorrow is indeed not perfect. You can't do that. The perfect and the ideal is often the opposite of the good or 'the enemy of good', as they say.

I think we can say that this decision deserves the approval of this House, because it is indeed an important step forward in the fight against global warming. I also remember what Mr Girling said. Those who are critical, here in this House, there is nothing wrong with that. But then you expect alternatives to be put on the table. I haven't heard any alternatives. It seems to me, therefore, a little too easy to give meaningless criticism. So I would say: give this proposal for a decision tomorrow the benefit of the doubt. I repeat that colleagues from Poland and other Member States are all too easily forgetting to mention that there are very important exceptions and also new initiatives and measures in place to assist the so-called low-income countries. I am thinking of Member States where, for example, the coal industry and coal generation still have an important place. The Commissioner has just referred to an exception for the energy sector, to the modernisation fund and to the Solidarity Fund. These are very important funds with billions of euros in them that can help those countries. The next step is indeed next week. The Commissioner has announced it: 15 July, the fundamental ETS reform. The work is obviously not finished. I suggest that we already agree that we are not too defensive in dealing with this, that we are doing so in a future-oriented manner, but also, as the Commissioner rightly pointed out, selectively, that we should indeed build in guarantees for the energy-intensive industry that is subject to carbon leakage, that we should help the industry that cannot, for example, pass on electricity costs.

But what kind of competitiveness is it about? The question must be asked: how does the EU ETS affect the fair competitiveness of Member States? I have doubts. We are therefore faced with a desperate attempt to get out of the previous unfavourable regulatory decisions of the pseudo-market system through further regulation. Let us therefore have the courage to say that this is a system that has not passed the test and that it should be rejected because it does not take into account, for example, agriculture, forestry, etc., and therefore to make money by, for example, absorbing CO2, which could, after all, have a positive impact on the formation of the amount of this gas at auction. The climate and energy package must be modernised by abandoning the existing EU ETS or rejecting it in its entirety. The focus must be on so-called benchmarking and efficiency criteria.

The Market Stability Reserve is a first step in the reform of the European Emissions Trading System. The plan is to reduce the oversupply of emission allowances in order to achieve price stability.

With a certificate price of 7.50 euros, this corresponds to a value of 15 billion euros. Similarly, the 900 million allowances should be moved from backloading to the market stability reserve and not returned to the market. The present compromise provides for the introduction of the market stability reserve to start as early as 2019 and not 2021, as stated in the Commission proposal. There are also different approaches to the upper and lower limits of allowances, from when certificates are withdrawn from the market or returned to the market.

Looking at the issues and concerns raised by the Member States, the Council, the European Parliament, industry, environmental organisations, we can say that the agreement reached should strike a balance between europe's high environmental standards and industrial interests.  While this proposal addresses the problem of surplus allowances to be auctioned, it does not address the issues relating to the allocation of free allowances or the provisions governing carbon leakage. An effective reform of emissions trading should ensure that industry sensitive to energy resources does not transfer their production capacity to third countries outside the European Union where there are no such high environmental standards. It is therefore essential that the Commission submit its proposals for measures to reduce the risk of carbon leakage as soon as possible.

The proposed stability mechanism, the so-called market stability reserve, will regulate the lack of trade in supply and demand of allowances by slowly placing the large surplus of unused allowances in a reserve. However, this cannot be a permanent solution. The allowances that come into reserve remain hanging over the market like a thunder cloud. If we want to stimulate green technology and end our fossil addiction, we need a high CO2 price. We can't get there just by introducing a reserve.

The European Union budget, which, if we want to compare it with that of the United States, is 1 % of gross national income, while that of the United States is about 20 % of GDP. But it is a budget that has a high added value, I would even say enormous added value, given the fact that 94 % of the budget is for investment and only 6 % of this budget corresponds to administrative expenditure and operating expenditure. And it is a budget that represents in many Member States more than 50 % of public investment. A budget also for which we set priorities for 2016. What we called the three \"E\": employment, business, and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, and entrepreneurship. This has consequences in terms of programmes, from the youth employment initiative. We know that there has been an advance of EUR 6 billion for 2014 and 2015, but we in 2016 want this programme to continue and therefore we want authorisation costs for this programme.  It is clear that programmes such as the Cosmos, programmes such as Horizon 2020, or the Connecting Europe Mechanism, which also contribute, which are in rubric 1a, should pay special attention, but we do not forget internal solidarity.  In internal solidarity, we have the cohesion policy which also helps employment, also helps entrepreneurship, innovation and research. In this cohesion policy, in addition to this objective and all the objectives inherent to it, the objective of corresponding to the internal solidarity of helping the poorest regions, the Most Difficult Member States and also of helping the social rise of people can never be forgotten. Internal solidarity is also a goal for us.  As far as external solidarity is not, we must not forget what is happening in the European Union, what is happening in Ukraine, Syria, but also what is happening to refugees, what is happening in the Mediterranean and, in this sense, rubric 3 and rubric 4 are also very important for us in these areas.  And that's also why we say that the cuts that are made to agencies cannot be blind cuts. We also have, when we look at a staff cut, to check the consequences of that cut, the costs that this has. We have financial oversight agencies where, if we reduce staff, this will come at a cost. We have migration agencies, for example, where if we reduce staff, this has a higher cost than the one that comes from the reduction itself.  Then we also demand that commitments be respected, that we respect the plan we have defined in terms of payments, that the Multiannual Financial Framework be respected, that the flexibility that we want and ask for is respected.  And, in essence, we hope that the Council will have an attitude of respect for the commitments, of consistency with the declarations and proclamations that it has made, that it too will put the sufficient funds for the longings, for the objectives to which we all propose.

As you said, many have contributed to coming up with a thorough description of which priorities, why these priorities and how best we can make use of the funding we have at our disposal. We support the priorities that Parliament has outlined. Yes, we need to focus on a revival of our economy. You call it the three E’s – employment, enterprises and entrepreneurship. We need this if we want to see Europe growing again, and growing to a point that allows us to strive for both higher competitiveness and a better quality of life for our people. You have been very supportive of the key initiatives of the Commission, including the investment plan. We have just adopted an amending letter, and I am very grateful that it is based on the agreement we have achieved and that we can put it forward. We also agree with you that, in addition to focusing on growth, we have to retain solidarity at home and with those who count on us in dire circumstances outside the European Union, especially people who are escaping wars and especially when this also turns into an eternal problem for the European Union. This is why, as we have put forward the payment appropriations, we have been very precise in where we need to have an increase in budgets, especially in terms of payments, so we can underpin these priorities. We have EUR 143.5 billion, or a 1.6% increase in total payments, to trim down the shortage of payments from previous years, and we have concentrated on areas where the needs are most profound. For example, in Heading 4 we have proposed a 28.5% increase, and for Erasmus, we have proposed a 30% increase. In the philosophy that we have put forward, what dominates is that we are asking for what is needed – no more, no less – and we count on Parliament to support us in this prudent approach to the budget. I want to stress that, with the encouragement of Parliament, we have been improving our forecast capabilities. This allows us, together, to make the best possible allocation of our scarce resources and to manage payments in the future, so that the drama we had in 2014 will not be repeated. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for this whole vote today on our amending budgets and the payment plan.

Particularly, the area of microfinance is something that can really be established to support SMEs because governments, commissions, councils do not actually create jobs, but they certainly can contribute to creating the environment within which jobs can flourish.

First of all, I believe that we need at least a stable budget, particularly that of agriculture. It is good to set up the European Fund for Strategic Investments, but it is also a pity to draw on the budget lines. I think we need to protect those budget lines, and of course those relating to agriculture.  I also think it is imperative to keep the crisis reserve, because agriculture is going to face, unfortunately, repeated crises, whether it is the Russian crisis that we are experiencing today, the milk crisis that is looming, or that caused by various predators of agriculture. We must be very vigilant on these issues and absolutely maintain this reserve of crisis.  We also need to be able to use ceiling margins and feed a number of programs: I am thinking in particular of the milk distribution programme in schools.  Agriculture is indeed an essential element, as it is the most integrated policy in the European Union. This should not prevent us from being extremely attentive to other policies. I am thinking in particular of heading 1b on the Structural Funds, as has already been mentioned, and on the Youth Guarantee, which is very important for the future of the Union. We have to be able to guarantee that funding. You also know that the issue of migration has been debated for a long time. We need to fund these immigrations or rather find a solution to this problem.

In addition, the 2016 budget should take into account the successes of the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference and, above all, provide sufficient funds for trade-related aid for trade for the least developed countries to provide technical assistance and capacity-building.

Mr President, Vice-President Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. We have had many disputes with the Council in the past, and I have little hope, but a little hope, that we can reach a new era. If we look at the payment crisis that I hope is behind us, the Council has gone through all phases of psychotherapy, from denial to catharsis to the beginning of healing. So I am looking forward to a situation where, a few weeks ago, the institutions agreed in a paper on how the payment crisis will be managed. Now I very much hope, ladies and gentlemen, that the Luxembourg Presidency can remember very carefully what the Latvian has agreed. Against this background, I wonder: if the Council now looks at the draft budget and changes it, does it do so arbitrarily, as we have seen in recent years, or is the Council's policy a recognisable political priority? This is all the more important because, to my not insinuable surprise, the Commission has presented a draft budget in which payments and commitments are as far apart as ten billion. This is certainly not a cardboard stick. And this is happening in a situation where the EU is facing considerable difficulties; we talk about it every part of the week. I am thinking of the crises in the Middle East, I am thinking of the failed state of Libya, and I am thinking of the Ukraine crisis, to name but a few. If the budget is a policy in figures, then the European Union's foreign policy instruments must be effective. This is not only due to money, but also to money. The same applies to the migration policy instruments that we are developing. We are facing an additional challenge because we need to include the EFSI in this budget. We have agreed on funding, which means that one billion more will be taken out of the margins. However, this still means five billion from the current budget. As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, the challenges are great. I hope that we will no longer be talking about deletions, but about the political design of the budget.

The general assessment of the presented budget for 2016 reveals that it abides by the previously-set priorities – employment, enterprise and entrepreneurship. While commitments are going down by 5.2%, real payments are calculated to increase by 1.6%. Thus we expect to melt down the huge pile of backlogs and to reach a sustainable level by the end of 2016. In this regard, we appreciate the cooperation between the Committee on Budgets and Commissioner Georgieva in drafting the budget and in implementing the Commission’s pledges at the beginning of this mandate. The budget supports the political priorities: the Energy Union; the Digital Single Market; the European Programme for Education, Training, Sport and Youth; increasing competitiveness; support for farmers; and, of course payments to EFSI. The EU budget also responds to new developments in Europe’s neighbourhood and beyond. While an increased budget will be available to tackle today’s immigration challenges, we should be very careful, because the increasing pressure of migration flows means that the level of the ceiling set in the MFF could be outdated. At the same time, we should be aware that the above—mentioned increase in payment appropriations, taking into account inflation, reveals that there is almost no increase in real terms. This means that the overall weight of the EU budget remains more or less the same. Furthermore, we must ask ourselves: is it appropriate to reduce, by 4%, the financial resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion when there is a growing division between regions and states within the Union? Generally, we support the main goals of the budget to boost innovation, create jobs, deal more effectively with migration and strengthen  the global role of the European Union.

Let me say, in any event, that an increase of 2.4% and 1.6% in commitment appropriations and payment appropriations speaks to us of overall prudence, but it does not mean appreciable real growth. We are dazzled by a sharp reduction in the volume of outstanding payments, but it is not at all clear what will happen in the following years, when all 2014–2020 programmes are fully performing. We can cite, in a positive sense, the LIFE programme, a first, provisional and expectant attempt to green the budget. Welcome back. But we must also cite, in the negative sense, very negative, the support that continues to be given to a project like ITER: up to more than five hundred million for a project that offers, of course, more doubts than certainties and more concerns than hopes.

The debate on TTE or on Greece, which we have in this House today, perfectly illustrates this inconsistency. The unequal dialogue Europe—the United States—the United States has a budget of more than 20% of its GDP, and Europe, about 1%—speaks clearly to us about this.

The Commission is not left behind, as spending on staff salaries and the pensions of its public servants is expected to increase by 2% and 5.4% respectively.

Firstly, what about the attitude of the Member States? Will the Council finally agree to settle its debts, because unfortunately, as we see year after year, the sense of responsibility, respect for the word given and even solidarity do not always characterize the attitude of the Heads of State and Government. Secondly, there is still a gap of almost EUR 10 billion between payments and commitments. This lag does not bode well for the end of the programming period because, as we know, the plan to resolve the payments crisis is not a trick, but an accounting loophole, while the structural problem of the Union budget remains the same. The accumulation of unpaid bills at the end of the programming period is also a way for Member States to save money on the back of the European budget.

I welcome the fact that higher investment is foreseen next year, and I also welcome the fact that, for the first time, much more resources are foreseen for security and stability in Europe.

I will try to be concise and address questions that have been directed to the Commission. First, there were a number of comments referring to the difference between commitments and payments in the 2016 budget and some expressing concerns that, a with EUR 10 billion difference – with commitments being about EUR 10 billion higher than payments – we might not deal with the gap that existed particularly seriously last year. We are confident that this will not be the case, for two reasons. One is that, because of the very specific measures we are taking as part of the payment plan that Parliament requested, we can bring down the amount of unpaid bills from EUR 24.7 - 20 billion this year to EUR 2 billion next year. EUR 2 billion is normal, and we would be in normal territory. The other reason is that in 2016 we are out of the pressure of the previous MFF, which last year and this year demanded from us significant payments, but we are not yet under the pressure of payments coming from the new MFF. So 2016 is a year where it is normal to have commitments being higher and payments being lower, with a difference of EUR 10 billion as we have calculated them. I can assure you that we will be monitoring very carefully throughout the implementation of the budget whether or not we are properly managing the payment side in particular. Secondly, there was concern on the question of the underlying economic data for the calculation of the amounts to be paid for cohesion. What exactly would be the envelope for cohesion for different countries, given that they are shifting up and down in terms of their relative GDP size? There will be a recalculation in 2016 which would then impact on the envelopes of cohesion. Thirdly, a number of speakers brought up very forcefully the point that we want this budget to be different. We want it to be focused more on priorities and we want it to be focused on performance; Mr Novakov talked about a budget focused on results. We want it to be a budget in which we carefully manage the administrative side and, yes, we are working in that direction. We are, of course, like the Queen Mary – we take time to shift, but shift we will. You will see over time a results-focused, performance orientation of the budget, also looking into multiple benefits from the euros we invest. That takes me to a very important point: investing in innovation in SMEs. Of course we have to do that. This is where growth in employment is going to come from. This is where we are going to see an increased standard of living, especially for countries where unemployment has been persistently high. That is where the thinking of the budget connects not only with what we spend directly for SMEs, for example COSME, but also how we are gearing the investment plan for Europe – how we are gearing up the Juncker Plan to be more effective. There was a very specific question on Hungary. What would happen to people in Hungary as a result of your budget? Obviously we need to come back to you with specifics, and I am already running out of time. But what you will see that is somewhat different from previous budgets is this: we are looking at a composition for the Hungarian budget which would have a strong cohesion component, from the structural funds; it would have a very strong agricultural component, because the country has a sizeable farming sector; but we would also see the impact, hopefully, of the Juncker Plan, of taking money to invest in waking up the sleeping liquidity in our financial sector. I would be happy to sit with you and walk you through what would be in it for me if I were a Hungarian.

We are coherent, ambitious but rigorous, and I expect the Council to do the same.  I expect consistency from the Council and it does not always exist. It should be seen that we all know that, in to approve the Multiannual Financial Framework, unanimity is needed and then there are Member States that successively vote against budgets which are in accordance with that same Multiannual Financial Framework and sometimes are even below that Multiannual Financial Framework. This is not consistency. Unfortunately, we have Member States in the European Union that vote consecutively against all the budgets of the European Union, without public opinion often knowing it.  For our part, we will demand that commitments be made. We want flexibility and it was at the expense or because of the flexibility that we have taken the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, which is lower than in 2007-2013. And flexibility means using the flexibility instruments, using the margins of previous years that have not been used, and we will well need them because we maintain the goal we have set in relation to Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility.

In doing so we could not have envisaged in just how important a context we would discuss the need for increased cooperation of the highest quality to ensure the security of our citizens and to ensure we get the balance right between tackling terrorism, on the one hand, and ensuring that those same terrorists do not disrupt the freedoms we enjoy. It is always the case that Member States provide the first response in terms of internal security, but it is now absolutely clear that cooperation across borders of the European Union and cooperation in the priority areas of counter-terrorism, cyber security and related organised crime have taken on a renewed importance. Let us not forget the terrorist attacks of recent days on EU citizens in Tunisia, in Paris some months ago, in Copenhagen and in Brussels – and, of course, today marks the anniversary of 7/7 in my own city of London, which was the biggest single terrorist attack on UK citizens. So what is Parliament contributing in terms of the Commission’s priorities for a modernised security agenda at this critical and sensitive moment? First we underline that in preventing radicalisation we must search for the best possible models of European practice on so-called ‘foreign fighters’. In monitoring the internet for content which may lead to terrorist attacks, we must stick to the rule of law so as not to end up in the grey zones of censorship. In fighting violent extremism and terrorism we should use our existing tools effectively before creating new tools, and in doing so we should not undermine the very fundamental values that terrorists wish to violate. We want to be practical in this House, and our practical priorities for this Parliament, in terms of existing and new measures, are firstly to update the SIS II system to make compulsory alerts of persons convicted or suspected of terrorism and to help Member States implement travel bans at national level. Secondly, the importance of cross-border access to information and in particular the European police record index system. Third, Parliament is calling for a legal framework for all semi-permanent or permanent joint investigation teams and, of course, the PNR Directive by the end of 2015. We suggest possible solutions to the most sensitive and difficult security challenges – for example, online terrorism threats and online radicalisation. We never say that this is going to be easy, but we welcome new structures within Europol called the European Counter—terrorism Centre and the effective work that it is already doing. We never say that this is easy or without risk or without problems. We also welcome cooperation with IT companies and civil society and law enforcement authorities through an EU forum to develop tools to counter terrorist propaganda online and in social media. The resolution that we present is full of ideas from Members of this Parliament who have great experience spanning many years of dealing with terrorism and dealing with many reports in this House – both legislative and non—legislative. That is why the import of what I am saying today is: please treat the European Parliament as your partner in dealing with the EU Security Strategy. I know that in dealing with this resolution we have had many shades of opinion and political differences, but the most important thing that I want to say as Chair of this Committee is that the expertise, both in terms of security and in terms of fundamental rights and understanding of data issues, is very rich in this Parliament. So please, Commissioner, treat that with seriousness. Please, President—in—Office, see the expertise in Parliament. I say that to both parts of our European Union. I would also say that, from PNR to tackling radicalisation, these are very sensitive ongoing issues, but the European Parliament will play its part. We fully understand that the Union’s internal security has become more complex, asymmetric and difficult to predict, but equally we understand that there has been more value placed on cross-border cooperation, data sharing and cyber security. For these very good reasons you will find full commitment and partnership in the EU security agenda. I look forward to hearing the contributions of my colleagues who contributed to the resolution before the House today, and I ask the Commissioner to respond in as detailed a way as we have contributed to that resolution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2322, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Nicolas Schmit", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my joy first, since I am in a way a revenant. I was there ten years ago, during the last presidency of Luxembourg, and I am very pleased to come back and work with you. The motto of the Luxembourg Presidency is to \"create a Union for citizens\" and I believe that our citizens have every right to the best possible security. That is why security must be one of our top priorities. As you have said, Mr MEP, the events which have shocked us, shaken us in recent months, require us precisely to strengthen and, as you have pointed out, to further adapt our means of cooperation to these new challenges of terror. It is for this reason that the Luxembourg Presidency will concentrate all its efforts on the implementation and follow-up of the renewed internal security strategy for the European Union for the years 2015-2020. If I may, I will outline the broad principles of this strategy and what is planned for its implementation. The renewed internal security strategy was adopted by the Council on 16 June. I think it is important to point out that this strategy is also based on the elements and principles contained in the Commission's communication on the European security agenda of 28 April 2015. It is also important to stress that the renewed strategy must be seen as a common and shared programme of the European institutions, and both the Council and the Commission have taken into account the principles set out in your resolution of 17 December 2014. Let me now quote a few essential elements.  Firstly, this strategy identifies three main priorities in the area of internal security of the European Union for the next few years. The first is the fight against terrorism, as you have just pointed out, as we have made the tragic experience in recent months, radicalisation leading to terrorism and recruitment, and terrorist financing and the prevention of these phenomena. For this priority, special attention will be paid to the issue of foreign terrorist fighters, to the strengthening of external border controls, in a systematic and coordinated manner, using relevant databases and on the basis of risk assessments and risk indicators, and integrating internal and external aspects of the fight against terrorism. The second priority is to prevent and combat serious organized crime. The third is to prevent and combat cybercrime and strengthen cybersecurity. The second element I would like to stress is respect for fundamental rights, the need to respect and defend the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in the context of all the actions taken to create and maintain an area of freedom, security and justice, which is a fundamental principle. A third important element is the need for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, integrated and information-based approach. Access to information and the availability and exchange of information in the prevention and fight against large transnational organized crime and terrorism will remain crucial points for the coming years. We need to pay particular attention to the interoperability of current systems. The coordination of investigations and prosecutions in Member States should be encouraged and improved, including for financial investigations aimed at the confiscation of criminal assets, as well as the effective use of joint investigation teams and procedures for mutual legal assistance and mutual recognition. Finally, justice and home affairs agencies such as Europol, Eurojust, Frontex and Cepol play an important role in the internal security of the European Union. These agencies, which are at the service of the Member States, should continue to be built and supported. As such, our Presidency will continue to negotiate with the European Parliament on the new Europol regulation with the aim of achieving a legislative basis for this agency to deploy its full potential in the service of the Member States. With regard to the other elements to be taken into account, we must first strengthen our operational cooperation and improve our border management capabilities, particularly by using the most modern technologies. Second, we need to strengthen the prevention of criminal acts by paying particular attention to the organized financial crime, forfeiture of criminal assets and the prevention of terrorist attacks, including by preventing radicalization. Secondly, we must adopt a fast and flexible, intelligence-led approach that allows the European Union to respond comprehensively and in a coordinated manner to emerging and ever-changing threats. Finally, we need to consolidate existing legislative tools and ensure their best implementation. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these are some of the essential principles of the renewed strategy. Now let's talk about implementing this strategy, which we are working to prepare a clear and dynamic program of work. Discussions will begin within the Council, including the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security, which is responsible for ensuring adequate implementation and regular monitoring of the strategy. This will be done in close cooperation with the Commission and, if necessary, involving other key players, such as European agencies, such as the European External Action Service. The Presidency intends to discuss for the first time in detail our approach to the implementation of this strategy on 22 and 23 July, when the COSI and the Coordination Committee in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters will meet informally in Luxembourg. In addition to the methodology for implementation, we intend to tackle the work immediately and mobilize all our working groups within the Council to do so. Of course, we will take parliament's new resolution into account, just as we have done in the past. MEPs were invited to the conference organised by the Italian Presidency in September 2014. The chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was a key speaker at the event. The Presidency, the Commission and the Member States used the conclusions reached at the conference to draw up the Council's conclusions on the renewed strategy. We also used the Commission's final report on the implementation of the Internal Security Strategy, which echoed the European Parliament's resolution on this subject. I therefore remain confident in our ability to develop a common approach to the implementation of the strategy. The President of the COSI will inform the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs about this work. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, we look forward to your new resolution. I am confident that many of your recommendations are already reflected in the renewed strategy and that we will be able to take them into account when implementing the strategy. I am thinking, for example, of the best use of existing instruments before creating new ones, the need to adopt a comprehensive and balanced approach taking into account the principle of proportionality, and then the need for more effective and operational cooperation between Member States, the attention to be paid to the judicial dimension and the role of the European Parliament and national parliaments to ensure democratic control over the implementation of the strategy. I thank you for your attention and intend to listen carefully to your debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2323, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you for the opportunity offered by your oral question to debate further with you on the European Agenda on Security. I also want to express my thanks to Claude Moraes for his support. Thank you also for the draft resolution, which is to be voted on two days from now, and which I will of course take into consideration. I hope that the resolution will have the wide support of this House. As I – and many among you as well – have said several times, we need to show our citizens that we all work together on the basis of a shared agenda. Today’s debate happens, as was mentioned before by Claude, on the 10th anniversary of the 7 July terrorist attacks in London. Sadly, it also happens only a few days after another series of unacceptable terrorist attacks. Even if these are addressed specifically tomorrow, as you know, it shows that our security has to remain high on our agenda. One year ago, in June 2014, the European Council asked the Union to renew and update the previous Internal Security Agenda 2010-2014. All the institutions have provided their contribution to this process in a coordinated fashion. Following the last Commission’s report on the implementation of the Internal Security Strategy (ISS), both the Council and Parliament paved the way in December 2014 for the Commission to develop its European Agenda on Security adopted on 28 April 2015.  Last month, the Council adopted, on the basis of the Commission’s agenda, conclusions on the development of the renewed European Union Internal Security Strategy 2015-2020. The renewed Internal Security Strategy is the result of this process, and it constitutes a major achievement for the European Union. It was endorsed at the highest level by the European Council at its June summit, both in terms of content and in terms of cooperation among the institutions. In terms of content, the new strategy sets out the shared vision of the three institutions for the next five years on what needs to be done at Union level to make Europe more secure for the sake of its citizens, societies and economies. It identifies the main priorities for the Union’s actions, namely tackling terrorism and radicalisation, disrupting organised crime and fighting against cybercrime. From the institutional point of view, the Commission, Parliament and the Council have acted together, with each one offering their strategic contribution to the security strategy in line with the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty. As the Commission put it in its European Agenda on Security: successful implementation on renewed Internal Security Strategy depends on the political commitment of all actors concerned to do more, and of course to do better. This includes not only EU institutions, but also Member States and EU agencies. In addition to active engagement, coordinated and coherent action is a prerequisite. I therefore welcome the European Parliament’s call to the Commission and the Council to work together towards effective implementation and to engage in an interinstitutional dialogue. The Commission is fully committed to maintaining a constant dialogue with the European Parliament on internal security matters. The Commission undertakes to update the European Parliament and the Council twice a year on the implementation of the agenda. This will be the opportunity to take stock, together, of both the achievements and the challenges faced, and to exchange views on the state of EU internal security. In addition, transparency contributes to increasing citizens’ confidence in security policies. The Commission will therefore set up an EU security consultative forum to further enhance transparency and participation. This forum will bring together Member States, the European Parliament, EU agencies and representatives of civil society, academia and the private sector. The format of the forum will be finalised in due course, and the European Parliament will be kept informed. In the same context, the Commission will also develop performance indicators for key EU institutions. Now, when speaking about implementation of the agenda, an important aspect is resources, including those of the EU agencies. The European Agenda on Security has set, as one of its key principles, the need to ensure better application and full implementation of existing instruments. Pursuant to this principle, implementing the agenda will centre on consolidating the existing instruments and reprioritising available resources. The principle also applies to the agencies: for instance, the European Counter-Terrorism Centre within Europol is also included. It is meant to bring together anti-terrorism law enforcement capabilities, thereby pooling resources and maximising the use of the existing legal structures, services and tools already available. Of course, ensuring sufficient resources to EU agencies is crucial for them to be able to perform their work and to fully contribute to the goals of the agenda. As envisaged by the European Agenda on Security, the Commission will launch a reflection on how to maximise the contribution of all JHA agencies through closer inter-agency cooperation. The Commission invites the Member States to assign appropriate resources at the national level and to reinforce their efforts in seconding their national experts to agencies. In a situation of limited budgets, all efforts must be made to prioritise and reallocate. Increasing the agencies’ budget is the only other way to increase resources. As you know, the Commission is following the interinstitutional agreement of December 2013 that foresees that all EU institutions and bodies – as well as all agencies – reduce their total staffing levels by 5% over five years. This does not prejudge the budgetary rights of the European Parliament and the Council, but any increase in the agencies’ resources would require the firm commitment and agreement of both branches of the budgetary authority.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2324, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Avramopoulos, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has said. First of all, the security agenda is one of the most important issues we have at the moment. For hardly anyone could have imagined a few years ago that terrorists would move to holiday resorts and arbitrarily seek out European citizens – in this case mainly British citizens – to shoot them on the open beach. Nor would anyone have thought that in France a man who had been a simple, decent worker would ever be bebeheaded. We have now arrived in a security situation which, on the one hand, makes us anxious and, on the other, calls on us to react calmly but consistently. After all, security is a fundamental right, and if this fundamental right is no longer guaranteed, then there will no longer be any freedom for citizens. For this reason, it is essential that the Member States cooperate closely and speed up their cooperation. Requests for mutual assistance, requests for mutual legal assistance must no longer last so long, and the exchange of data must flow. Colleagues, who sometimes have reservations about data exchange, must also be consistent and say that we need close data exchange, because the criminals are networked, while our authorities sometimes still suffer from some restrictions. Security agencies need our trust and support so that they can work consistently. The agencies need adequate financial resources – whether it is Eurojust, EASO, Frontex or Europol – to work accordingly. We also need an effective agreement on PNR data, with which we can work accordingly. Now that it is now known that this instrument is a very important instrument in the fight against terrorism or serious crimes, we must also make use of it.

The same applies to the debate on the European Agenda on Security: respect for fundamental rights distinguishes us from totalitarian systems. That is why we must respond with the confident voice of the European constitutional state. Where changes in security policy become necessary, we must act without falling into frantic actionism.  The following points are particularly important to me. Firstly, the european court of justice ruling on the abolition of data retention must be taken into account in the implementation of security policy: no indiscriminate mass surveillance of citizens. Secondly, we need a comprehensive review of all security policy measures in order to identify concrete improvements. The Commission has so far failed to make such an evaluation. We need better exchange of information between Member States so that existing information can be used effectively.  Fourthly, the work of intelligence services is also important for us, for our democracy, but they too must be within the limits of the rule of law. In order to make a clear assessment of their activities, we need a universal definition of what is meant by national security. Fifthly, escape is not a crime and protection from persecution of international law. When refugees increasingly cooperate with organised crime or come from these circles themselves, we must react. But in return, we also need legal and safe ways, so that refugees do not have to rely on the services of criminal smugglers.  Sixthly, radicalisation in Europe towards crime and terrorism also requires a greater emphasis on prevention. Poverty or permanent discrimination gives many people the impression that they are not part of our society. Stigmatisation and exclusion are everyday experience for too many people. That is why integration, prevention and de-radicalisation are imperative. Finally, we face enormous challenges.

We also remember the families and friends who live with their grief every day, and our thoughts are obviously with them today. Also, recent events in Paris have tragically reminded us that our security and our freedom are never guaranteed, and that maintaining our security is one of the greatest challenges we face. The right to security is a fundamental right, and we have a responsibility, as legislators, to ensure that we protect people and that we detain and punish those who seek to do us harm. Whilst the Commission’s strategy has been welcomed by me and my group, unfortunately, I fear that Parliament’s response and recommendations would insufficiently equip the EU and its Member States to fight the worst kinds of criminality. Ensuring data protection, fundamental rights and self-reflection are, of course, an important part of creating effective policies in the area of security and law enforcement and a vital ingredient in order for measures to be proportionate, necessary and democratic. However, focusing on these elements alone is not sufficient to deliver a strategy intended to keep the EU and its citizens safe for the next four years. Law-making is about balance. I see little balance in the resolution from Parliament. The EU needs policies, measures, resources, expertise and actions which show that criminality and terror have no place in the EU. We need to be talking in serious and clear terms about how we protect children from abuse and exploitation; how we stop radicalisation; how we can better exchange law enforcement information; how we can stop drugs and arms smuggling; how we can help protect victims and how we can ensure that law enforcement agencies have the funding and resources they require to be effective.

I say to my dear colleague, Mrs Sippel, that it is not fear that guides us, but responsibility. I would like to say that the creation of the European Counter-Terrorism Centre within Europol, which I hope will indeed be operational from 1 January 2016. I stress the need to provide Europol with the financial means necessary to carry out these additional tasks. I call for the compulsory registration of terrorism suspects in the Schengen information system, as well as the harmonisation of reporting criteria. I also call for all Member States to organise their border guards' access to the Europol information system, which contains the names of thousands of terrorism suspects. I ask that any new European security tool necessarily include binding mechanisms for information sharing and cooperation between Member States, all of which, of course, respect the fundamental rights of citizens and the principles of necessity, proportionality and legality. Finally, let me reflect on the future. You have spoken, Commissioner, of the Commission's intention to organise a forum where all stakeholders will discuss the necessary strategy. This forum will provide information and that is a good thing. But who will implement it? My conviction is that in the area of internal security, we would have to have someone with the same responsibilities as the Head of External Security of the Union. Today, who really acts on behalf of the European Union and the Member States with Twitter, Google and Facebook when it comes to discussing the removal of terrorist content? Who is really responsible for the management of the Schengen information system? Who determines the strategic directions coordinating the action of Member States, the Commission, the various agencies and the various services in the field of security?

The fight against terrorism is an absolute necessity, but this concept remains to be defined, and not only in its so-called jihadist form, which effectively stigmatizes the Muslim community as a whole.

However, this framework must be filled with concrete and effective measures at legislative and operational level.

There is still no real European governance of the common area of freedom, security and justice that is the European Union. How there is no common defence policy and no European army to intervene for the maintenance of peace when it is in danger in a Member State or in a neighbouring State.  The European Agenda on Security, which we are discussing today, and I congratulate the Commission on its adoption, has three priorities. The first priority is the fight against terrorism and the stopping of European citizens from joining terrorist groups. Another priority is the fight against cybercrime and a third priority is the fight against cross-border organised crime.  Organised crime funds terrorism, brings weapons to terrorist groups and infiltrates the economy. The European Anti-Fraud Prosecutor and the Joint Investigation Groups must work as soon as possible within the Union. Confiscation of the money used, which comes from organised crime, is vital. Black money that travels freely creates death and brings terrorism. We save lives by fighting organized crime and confiscing money.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2350, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Jeroen Lenaers (PPE).", "mepid": "95074", "text": "   – Thank you to the Commission for the European Security Agenda. Security is the most important issue at the moment and I would like to thank the Commission for its clear focus on three very specific issues. I had hoped that we would be able to put the same focus on Parliament, but I am sorry to say that we have not succeeded. In Article 2 of this resolution, we are already sending the Commissioner out into the wider world to combat possible perceptions of unfairness in eu foreign policy, as Don Quixote once tried to combat the windmills. I would have hoped that we as a Parliament could have put a much greater focus on the safety of 500 million people. Three priorities. A great deal has been said about terrorism. I would like to talk about organised crime, particularly in the border regions. Our borders may have disappeared on paper, but criminal gangs still know how to find them in practice. Trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking, prostitution, motorcycle gangs are increasingly literally pushing the borders. I would therefore like to call for better cooperation, better exchange of information between Member States in the area of policing and judicial work, and much more work on cross-border confiscation and asset freezing. A third point: joint research teams are a great tool. They should be used much more often anyway.

It is not clear, there are different legal opinions on this, whether or not participation in the armed forces, such as the Islamic State, is or is not criminal. I would therefore strongly recommend (and it is my advice to the European Commission and the Commissioner) that we really update the Framework Decision on terrorism within the framework of the programme and clearly define that the phenomenon of foreign fighters is criminal, it should be criminal in all the legal systems of all the Member States of the European Union, and we have clearly described what the phenomenon of a foreign fighter means so that we can have uniform arrangements so that we can fight this together effectively. when Europeans leave to fight in the colors of the Islamic State.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2352, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Afzal Khan (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124962", "text": "   – Madam President, let me start by thanking Claude Moraes for the good job that he is doing.

However, crime and terrorist activities are not confined within the borders of the EU. EU internal security and global security are mutually dependent and interlinked. Radicalisation must not only be tackled at local and EU level, through community integration work and education and by having dialogue and anti—discrimination policies; it must also be tackled outside our borders, as the challenge we are facing also has origins outside the EU. Common security and defence policies play an important role in realising the EU’s security goals. The EU has never before faced such a convergence of security crises on its doorstep.

Last December, this Parliament gave useful advice and guidance to the Commission in its preparation of the agenda. Let me tell you that I took note of almost everything that was said, and I want to express my gratitude for your contributions. In April this year, the Commission responded to the European Parliament’s resolution by presenting the European Agenda on Security. As you have seen, the Commission’s agenda took up much of your earlier guidance. In the short period of one semester, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council have developed in a successful way a shared vision of what needs to be done in concrete terms at Union level to make Europe more secure for the sake of our citizens. We have found common ground on the main threats, principles and priorities, and thereby defined a renewed Internal Security Strategy. In the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty it is now time to work closely together towards the implementation of this renewed strategy. One institution alone cannot meet the ambitious goals that we have set for ourselves. Our three institutions are mutually interdependent to deliver. We are all each other’s key partner.

Of course, the right to security is a fundamental right and we all know - and you have repeatedly said this - that our countries and our citizens are facing all kinds of new phenomena of crime or terrorism; the two very often going together. These phenomena ignore borders. They operate on a truly global scale and use and master, sometimes to perfection, new technologies. Hence the real threat that comes from cybercrime. It is also true that terrorism poses a real challenge to us. A challenge to our open societies, a challenge to our states and democratic systems for which security and freedom, freedom and security are intimately linked. That is the strength of our democracies. That is why this strategy is so important and we need to work together to implement it effectively.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the guidelines for Member States' employment policies can be a powerful tool for countering the effects of a crisis that has incinerated millions of jobs and literally destroyed the lives of tens of thousands of people. And the stronger and more shared the document we manage to adopt, the harder it will be for the Council to ignore it. We cannot allow the mistakes of the past to be repeated. The indications of these guides have not been met and the situation has even worsened over the last five years. However, historically, European efforts have concentrated on the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of its peoples: the promotion of employment, the right to work and working conditions, training, further training, social security and trade union law.  Despite this, the Eu ropean Union has put the turbo on the economy and finance, while it has left in the background the urgency of the policies essential to ensure recovery and a dignified life for European citizens. Structural reforms and budgetary policies have produced an unsustainable situation, with stagnation and deflation in many Member States, especially in the euro area, with dramatic realities, as we can unfortunately see in various States, particularly in Italy, Portugal and Greece. The Europe 2020 strategy itself calls on us to lay down the conditions for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, which aims to increase the employment rate, by creating the quality and quantity of lasting jobs, by reducing the drop-out rate and by increasing the level of tertiary education. Support measures are needed for those who do not have a job but also accompanying measures for reintegration into work, through the retraining of skills and actions that stimulate lifelong learning. I also believe that we need to define certain indications of the absolute poverty afflicting millions of Europeans. We cannot continue to talk about the risk of poverty. Misery is out there and it grips the lives of many people, condemning them to an existence of hardship and deprivation. I believe that action must be taken to reduce poverty, with the aim of removing at least 20 million people from the uncertainty and anguish caused by their living conditions. A minimum income must be introduced in all Member States to combat poverty and social exclusion, as Mr Juncker and Commissioner Thyssen have already said. To date, as many as 26 out of 28 countries have adopted forms of income support, leaving the Union unfinished, since in Italy and Greece this right is still denied. Ladies and gentlemen, we can propose effective and shared policies to combat unemployment, with actions aimed at favouring not only small and medium-sized enterprises, but also micro-enterprises, innovative start-ups and businesses that aim for the green economy. We can speak out in order to reduce the segmentation of the labour market through a restructuring of collective bargaining and the involvement of the social partners, combating undeclared work and precarious employment. We can reduce discrimination in access to the labour market. We can facilitate the mobility of workers where this is an opportunity. We can contribute to the development of sustainable, safe, adequate pension systems for women and men, with schemes that guarantee decent income support. We can reintroduce the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy into the guidelines, significantly increasing the employment of citizens. We can put the founding principles of economic, social and cultural union back at the centre by creating jobs, cohesion and inclusion. We can now! I therefore hope that there will be a clear expression from this Parliament, because 500 million European citizens are waiting for an effective response: let us give this answer together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2363, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Jean Lambert", "mepid": "4531", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, I wanted to start by thanking all the shadows for their very serious input to my report and also the opinions from the two committees. We also held a round table in Brussels and a hearing in the committee. I really welcome all the additional input that came from those that participated. While the issue around green jobs was originally to have been published with the circular economy paper with the previous Commission, I really welcome the opportunity to debate it this evening, in particular with a very good report on employment guidelines, which I think makes this discussion more strategic, rather than a small niche area. We know that the European Union needs jobs. We have just heard that being very eloquently put. We can identify a number of new sectors where we can find them. And we have seen resilience, for example in the environmental services sector, during the crisis. We also know we need to respond to global trends, the inefficient re-use of resources, the unsustainable pressure on our environment and, indeed, climate change. We know that we have growing social exclusion and inequalities challenging our societies. So we really need to maximise the employment potential of new sectors. We need to change working practices and methods to increase resource efficiency, minimise environmental impact and take care of those whose existing employment may be adversely affected by change. We also want to ensure that those new jobs are quality jobs that actually pay a decent wage, as the International Labour Organisation has in its definition of a green job. So what does it take to help maximise this potential? We were clearly told in the hearing and elsewhere that we need a coherent comprehensive policy framework which will provide a predictable environment for training and investment. That was recognised at the meeting of EU environment and employment ministers not so long ago. So we need policies that are mutually reinforcing, not running off in different directions. Whether that is within the Semester or within the EU 2020 Strategy and the review of the strategy, we need the ‘Just Transition’ roadmaps which will move from the local level onwards to actually help people plan for the changes that we need. We need this to be reinforced by an efficient implementation of relevant EU legislation with clear and ambitious targets where those are appropriate. We also need this effort to be supported strategically by European Union funds, including as well the 2016 review of the Multiannual Financial Framework, using that as an opportunity to promote the green transition of the economy. We were also told in the background to this report that there are three very effective drivers of change: environmental tax reform (which proved very controversial in the committee), energy and resource efficiency and the development of the supply chain. We are also aware how essential workforce engagement is in initiating, owning and helping to create the necessary changes. There is clear evidence of the value of this engagement. So we should be taking full advantage of the existing experience and opportunities within social partnership and sectoral and social dialogue. There are many companies that want to make changes but are not confident or cannot find people with the right skills. So we need to raise general awareness, to promote stem skills and to make sure that women can also participate in the new economy. We need to look at generic sectoral and specific skills, as well as at supporting SMEs in the changes that they are trying to make.

As we all know, the crisis has brought us further away from our employment and social inclusion targets under the Europe 2020 strategy, with some little signs of improvement coming only recently. It is good news that the economy is recovering, but it is also true that many European citizens do not yet feel it. The Commission proposed its new employment guidelines as part of the integrated guidelines on 2 March. Our goal was to take a comprehensive approach to employment, social and macro-economic objectives. Indeed, the integrated guidelines also frame the scope and direction of the Union’s policy coordination of Member States’ policies and provide a basis for country-specific recommendations. The Commission has opted for more concise, targeted and operational employment guidelines with a view to sharpening the focus on key priorities and improve ownership and implementation by Member States. The guidelines are fully in line with the new approach to economic policy—making built on investment, structural reform and fiscal responsibility. The employment guidelines need to be applied on a national, regional and even local level and, of course, in close coordination with the social partners. Indeed, the employment guidelines provide guidance firstly on boosting demand for labour. This refers directly to the investment plan, with the goal to increase investment by EUR 315 billion and the need to reduce bottlenecks to investment and growth and shift taxation away from labour. Secondly: enhancing the labour supply, skills and competences. Making the most of our human capital is fundamental. We have already acted by injecting one billion euros for the pre-financing of the youth employment initiative. After the summer, the Commission will propose to the Council a recommendation to fight long-term unemployment, and we are working on a comprehensive skills strategy. Investment in human capital is the main approach needed in order to support productivity gains and ensure that future growth is both job-rich and inclusive. Thirdly: enhancing labour market functioning. Member States need to step up progress in labour market reforms, eliminate the segmentation of the labour market, improve active labour market policies and protect workers rather than jobs. Fourthly: fostering social inclusion, combating poverty and promoting equal opportunities. The guidelines clearly put the accent on modernising social protection systems so that they can effectively provide adequate protection throughout all stages of an individual’s life. This affects all pillars of social protection – not only pensions but also access to healthcare, education, childcare and other enabling services. I am delighted that, in general, the European Parliament is supporting the Commission’s approach. I especially note that, in the opinion of Parliament, qualitative and social considerations must find their place throughout the employment guidelines. I feel it is right to say that this has been the concern of the Commission in drafting its proposal. Our aim is to achieve sustainable growth so as to allow upward social convergence and to bring concrete results to the European citizens. This means that job creation will continue to be our number one priority, because it is also what people – men and women – care most about: having a good and decent job. Let me say a word on green jobs. A year ago, the Commission adopted the communication on the Green Employment Initiative, tapping into the job creation potential of the green economy, calling for an integrated approach and supporting employment in the green economy. Generating green growth is good for society at large. The environmental goods and services sector has been one of Europe’s success stories in the last decade and a half. The number of Europeans employed in this sector increased from around 3 million to 4.3 million people between 2002 and 2012. This positive growth in jobs continued even throughout the recession. I would like to focus on two actions proposed in the communication where the Commission may bring added value. Firstly, further investment in green skills. The transition to a circular economy needs to be underpinned by changes to qualifications and national education and training curricula to meet emerging occupational needs. Such a process needs to be based on commonly-defined competence standards in order to facilitate cross-border certification and to ease professional mobility in the sector. Secondly, involvement of the social partners, in particular, in the most concerned sectors, for example: electricity, extractive industries, gas, transport and construction. Involvement of the social partners can also help in overcoming barriers to the circular economy. In this context your report is very welcome. It addresses a number of pertinent issues, like a call for creating the conditions for a fair transition to quality and sustainable jobs, addressing the skills gaps and mismatches, full implementation of environmental legislation and enhancing participation of workers in the transition. My efforts, as well as those of my fellow Commissioners, in respect of the circular economy package or the Energy Union have the potential to enrich the implementation of the Green Employment Initiative. Dear Members of Parliament, both your reports, on Green jobs and on Employment Guidelines, are certainly an additional impetus for us to continue working together on these topics.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2365, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Eleonora Evi", "mepid": "124779", "text": "   Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dichotomy between economy and ecology has been strengthened over time by the succession of logics and policies for maximising profits, production and consumption.

Green jobs are investments for the future. However, in order for women to benefit from green jobs, as has already been mentioned today, we must overcome the blind spot of the lack of a gender perspective and the so-called glass ceiling in the green economy and significantly increase the proportion of women in the green jobs sector through investment in education – green skills, as the Commissioner has already mentioned – and active labour market policy.  Member States and the regional and local level are also called upon to exploit the potential, for example, of public services and public procurement for green jobs, and to promote women's business activities in the green economy.

Since we are not voting on our position until tomorrow, I regret this poor timing, because we cannot therefore incorporate our considerations into the recommendations. Nevertheless, I hope that Parliament's position in the Council will be taken into account. For us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the text contains a number of very important points. For example, it is important to us that the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy are confirmed in a new way. These employment guidelines, which have been revised this year for the first time since 2010 and are dealing with the crisis, this high level of unemployment, this youth unemployment, long-term unemployment and rising poverty are among the most important points on which we attach great importance and which we must address. As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we also support the Commission's new priorities for more growth and job creation without debt, investment, structural reforms and responsible fiscal policy. Commissioner Marianne Thyssen has now made a list and set her priorities. That is absolutely to be welcomed. We also believe that a minimum income should be considered. We stress that, in accordance with the Treaties, it should be done at national level and also in accordance with national rules and practices. Other important points are the reduction of the early school leaving rate, the promotion of businesses – including entrepreneurship among young people – and, of course, the focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, mobility within Europe and, as I said, the fight against unemployment. Qualifications, and in particular the transition from school to work, should also be improved. Finally, I would like to express the hope that the Council will take up our recommendations.

The fight against unemployment must be a top priority, especially the fight against youth unemployment.  In general, I would like to thank the rapporteur. Your report makes really important corrections to the Commission's draft. On the one hand, the mobility of workers is an opportunity – but it must not become an obligation.  For mobility, we also need accompanying measures, such as improving the transfer of pension rights, recognising qualifications, and much must also be made easier for workers.  The second important point is a clear rejection of automatic pensions. The link between the retirement age and life expectancy must be deleted in the Commission's draft.

It is a shame that, in spite of the importance of these employment guidelines, Parliament is involved only in a consultation procedure. I consider this very unfortunate in a time when ‘more Europe’ is needed, which should imply, above all, the European citizens’ representatives. At the core of these guidelines there are two aspects: employment and education. We are struggling with higher rates of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, and the shortage or mismatch of skills. This ultimately points to education again. Therefore, Member States are being asked and encouraged to tailor policies aiming to boost employment and to curb unemployment, especially among the young population. To achieve these goals they should adapt the education framework so as to be able to foresee future changes in the labour market and thus to prevent skill mismatches. We need realistic and pragmatic approaches to take into consideration each Member State’s specificity. Education adapted to the needs of the market, apprenticeships, traineeships, sustainable jobs and quality employment are what we should aim for. On the other hand, I am a strong defender of having minimum wages, according to the economic and social capacities of each Member State, although I prefer solutions that create opportunities for employment, rather than measures – such as the minimum wage – which may risk prolonging unemployment and perpetuate a static society.

We thank My Colleague Laura Agea for her work and for the positive references to the report. Our positions, as the Left, have been clear from the outset: for us we do not mean employment without social security, without decent wages, without securing jobs and without guaranteeing the right to collective bargaining. Employment which does not guarantee a decent living for workers is not understood. The wage dumping observed in Germany and the salaries of three hundred and four hundred euros, promoted in Greece and the other countries of the South, are nothing but a clear attack on the dignity of workers' lives. They result in the poverty of the peoples of the European Union and their impoverishment.  In order to improve the working and living conditions of workers, we have tabled amendments in plenary which ensure at least one safety net for the minimum guaranteed income and we call on colleagues to vote in favour.

That is in fact what I would call future-proofing employment opportunities. In order to achieve that future-proofing we need to anticipate future skills needs. In that context, we should listen to CEDEFOP who propose that adapting curricula and including environmental awareness with an understanding of sustainable development and business efficiency is better than proposing new training programmes. That is down-to-earth and informed advice and we need to take it on board.  I fully support the phasing-out of environmentally harmful subsidies and indeed I support the rapporteur when she calls for the phasing-out of all subsidies by 2020. I also support the call to the Commission requesting independent studies on the costs and benefits of a shift in the tax burden, for example from labour to environmental taxation. While taxation is a Member State competence, the results of these studies can and should inform thinking in the Member States.

With 24 million unemployment in the European Union, there are at least 2 million vacancies that lack adequately qualified people and 30% of employers complain of skills mismatch.  Increasing the mobility of European Union citizens and structural reform of vocational education, which should be more closely linked to the labour market, to the use of new technologies and innovations, are important for improving the situation. The dual education model introduced from the post-primary level to higher education is one of the most promising solutions. It is also important to be able to complement competences on a short course on a day-to-day and to recognise competences acquired outside formal education.

The latter are necessary not only for obtaining information, communicating at work at a distance, but in virtually every profession and at every level of professional advancement.

I can assure you that the deliberations in Parliament have inspired the Commission during the entire adoption process of its employment guidelines proposal. In general, the Commission could accept most of your amendments. The goal of the guidelines is to be operational for policy—making by Member States, and that is why the Commission focused on what Member States can do and on short operational texts. As you know, there is currently a general approach of the Council on the table. In general, many of your amendments are in line with those proposed by the Council. The Council’s general approach includes an explicit recognition that action in line with the employment guidelines is an important contribution for the European Union to the Europe 2020 objectives. It also incorporates further explicit references to quality and social goals. The Commission feels that its employment guidelines proposal is well balanced and that the Parliament’s report generally supports this view. I would also like to thank you very much for your discussion on the Green Employment Initiative report, as well as for the enriching contributions of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). I want to thank Members of Parliament for their support on shifting taxation away from labour onto environmentally harmful activities. As you know, taxation is a national competence. Nonetheless, the Commission has been recommending this shift for years in the framework of the European Semester. I heard many of you talking about skills mismatches, skills upgrading, and transition from school to work and so on. I share your preoccupation, and I am working with colleagues to address these issues. In particular, last month we made efforts to give a new boost to the European Alliance for Apprenticeships by convincing enterprises to make pledges to create more possibilities and more places for apprentices so that they have the chance to have some work-based learning experience. The Commission will be carefully considering Ms Lambert’s report, not only in the implementation of the Green Employment Initiative, but also when promoting green skills and social dialogue aspects in both the Energy Union and in the forthcoming circular economy package. This highlights a strong link between investment in human capital, and the capacity to innovate and roll out innovative, resource—efficient processes and technologies.

I want to see how we can make the green jobs report link with the employment guidelines so that we really do move this forward. One thing I do regret is that I did not get the name of the anonymous Spanish economist so that I can check on the figures we were being given about the job swap, because I really hope that we are not just seeing some jobs go, green jobs come in, and somebody making the assumption that green ones are forcing the others out. We live in a world of change, and the way in which we get through that transition and try to do that in the best interests of all of us and our planet is very important.  The potential is clear – we have heard that from so many people in this room tonight. Whether it is the social impact and the environmental impact of energy efficient buildings, or whether it is working on renewable energies. These are jobs, a lot of which are ‘sur place’ and not offshore, which can make a real difference to people’s lives.  As regards the small business sector, we have figures showing that 93% of small businesses have tried to take some small step towards resource efficiency. It saves them money. They believe it is the right thing to do, and they want to do more of it, but they need support. They need support in terms of the skills, and they need support in terms of actually finding support that might be out there in financial terms. I would like to make an advert here: the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has, I think, put forward a very useful pilot project along these lines that I hope Members will support. The skills development is crucial, but it is not enough; it is about that broad coherent policy framework. So I really hope the Commission is going to take this on board, as we have heard, in the energy union and the circular economy package. We cannot leave this sort of change to chance.

Another thing that MEPs are paying attention to is the need to promote entrepreneurship and to promote its spirit, especially among young people. In this context, closer cooperation between business and education institutions is also crucial.  The document also often includes a proposal to introduce minimum wages as an instrument to combat poverty and social exclusion. In this context, I would like to express my support for such action.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the unreserved fight against tax avoidance and evasion is at the heart of the European debate and is becoming a priority. But at a time when huge capital flows easily move from one part of the world to another with one click, it is clear that these are global challenges and to overcome them we need global law enforcement tools and solutions, to re-establish a very simple principle: taxes must be paid where profits are generated. In this European Year of Development we will take decisions that outline which world we will leave to future generations: the new objectives for sustainable development, the climate conference and, in a few days' time in Addis Ababa, the third international conference on financing for development. These ambitious objectives will only be achieved if we ensure adequate funding with official development aid but also with more effective mobilisation of national resources. And this is where taxation and the fight against tax evasion and avoidance become fundamental. Estimates should be taken with caution, but illicit financial flows out of developing countries are estimated to reach a trillion dollars each year. An impressive fact: almost ten times the total amount of development aid; resources taken from services to citizens. There are many obstacles facing developing countries in the fight against evasion and avoidance. Not to mention that they themselves tend to grant incentives and exemptions in ruthless tax competition that is harmful to them. With this report, we are calling on the Commission to have a genuine action plan to support developing countries in creating stronger and fairer tax systems. We therefore call for increased support for developing countries by providing financial and technical assistance, which is still insufficient. We call for the UN Tax Committee to be transformed into a genuine intergovernmental body with additional resources to finally ensure that developing countries participate on an equal footing in the reform of the global tax system. We call for support for international initiatives to reform the global tax system, such as the BEPS process promoted by the OECD; But more account must be taken of the needs of developing countries. Two instruments are particularly important: we call for the adoption of the country by country reporting standard for multinational companies in all sectors, including the extractive sector, and for complete information to be accessible to all countries and made public. It is time for the Commission to come forward with a proposal to this effect. I would be surprised if someone voted against what we already unanimously approved in committee tomorrow. In addition, when the automatic exchange of information is applied, a transitional period should be provided for countries that have not yet fully developed the necessary capacities to collect and share all the information required. We also call for transparency on the effective ownership of companies, trusts and other similar institutions. There is the long-established problem of tax treaties between developed and developing countries, which do not guarantee the fair distribution of taxation rights between country residences and country sources. In this, the model developed under the auspices of the UN guarantees a more balanced approach. Finally, we call for impact assessments of European tax policies on developing countries, in order to strengthen the coherence for development policy, and we call for a definition of tax havens at international level by 2015 with a black list and sanctions. I was surprised that someone asked for a separate vote, I thought we all agreed here on the seriousness with which this issue needs to be addressed.  Last but not least, we pay particular attention to gender issues: evasion and avoidance affect the most vulnerable part of society where women are often and unfortunately over-represented. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperative spirit and also the secretariat and my office for their support. I hope that tomorrow the report will pass with the largest majority to make the voice of this Parliament heard loudly before Addis Ababa and to show that we are at the forefront of the fight against global evasion and avoidance, in order to have a truly ambitious development agenda capable of hitting the root of the tragedy of poverty and inequality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2412, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Nicolas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Schmit, Current Chairman of the Council. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been almost two years now that we have embarked on a complex process of negotiations aimed at nothing less than to establish a new global partnership to meet the inseparable challenge of eradicating poverty and sustainable development.  This partnership will guide the international community for years to come. The European Union and its Member States cannot miss this historic event. This partnership must be based on the principles of universality and shared and mutual responsibilities. We will have to take into account the capabilities of each and involve multiple actors. This new global partnership should also promote human rights, equality, non-discrimination, democratic institutions, good governance and the rule of law. It should enable everyone to participate actively and ensure environmental sustainability and respect for the limits of our planet.  Women's rights, gender equality, the emancipation of women and girls, which are already a goal in themselves, are essential means of implementation and should be encouraged at all levels. I am thinking in particular of girls' education, which is an extremely important factor for development.  After Monterrey and Doha, which laid the foundation for this partnership, we must continue to develop an overall vision for change in the world order. The Addis Ababa conference, which opens next Monday, should not be limited to assessing progress in implementing the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration. It must be forward-looking, address all means of implementation in an integrated manner, and focus on the mobilization and effective use of all financial and other resources. The European Union and its Member States must continue to affirm this essential principle acquired since Monterrey. National public funds are the largest source of stable and directly available funding for most governments and are therefore at the heart of sustainable development financing. National governments have a primary responsibility to mobilize and make the best use of these public resources. This conference must lead to an integrated approach to the implementation and financing of the new partnership. It will be a question of finding a strong balance between the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. It is a question of encouraging policy coherence and, above all, clearly defining our commitments and the results that all actors will have to achieve.  We believe that the final document of the conference should be the \"means of implementation\" component of the post-2015 programme, which will be adopted next September in New York. The outcome of the summit will provide a solid basis for the COP 21 conference of the parties at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December.  While financial resources remain important, if not essential - national public funds, private funds, innovative financing, international aid - we must also put the non-financial means of implementation at the centre of the game. Creating a development-friendly environment, building institutional capacity, boosting trade and investment, investing in education and encouraging science, technology and innovation are essential.  In addition, this new partnership requires a strong monitoring, accountability and evaluation framework that must be an integral part of the post-2015 agenda. It will be necessary to encompass the national, regional and global levels and involve all government and non-governmental actors in its implementation.  Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and its Member States are determined to play an active and constructive role in all the processes under way and to ensure their convergence. To this end, the Development Council of 26 May adopted a position on official development assistance, which reaffirms the collective commitment of the EU and Member States to reach the target of 0.7% of gross national income spent on official development assistance within the post-2015 programme deadline, as well as their priority commitment to the least developed countries. It should facilitate the active participation of the European Union and its Member States in the ongoing international negotiations and contribute to their success.  The success of this global partnership depends on our contribution to all. We are committed to playing our full role and cooperating constructively with all interlocutors and, in particular, with the European Parliament in order to be able to establish and implement a post-2015 programme that is ambitious and brings about the transformations and inclusion we need.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2413, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Neven Mimica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, there is only one week to go before the UN Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa.

We remain fully committed to ensuring its success, as it will be crucial for the outcome of the Post-2015 Summit in New York and the Climate Conference in Paris later this year.

Together with the representatives from national governments, we will make sure that the European Union and its Member States continue to speak with one voice in these last crucial stages. Let me outline the overall principles and expectations that will guide the EU approach. First, Addis must be transformational. We need an ambitious and coherent engagement and agreement, covering all means of implementation: aid, investment and domestic resources, as well as an enabling policy environment. We need a more strategic, more catalytic role for official development assistance to help leverage other means of implementation and maximise their impact. Second, Addis must promote universality. The old days of North and South, donors and beneficiaries, are over. We need a true global partnership to achieve such a broad agenda. All countries need to act and contribute their fair share – and so does the private sector and civil society. The European Union stands ready to play its full part in implementing the sustainable development goals at home and through our external actions. Third, Addis must embed strong mutual accountability. We need an integrated, transparent and reliable framework to keep track not only of our financial commitments, but also of overall progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals. We all have been working hard for an ambitious Addis outcome document, one that reflects EU aspirations and objectives, and respects the Council conclusions of 26 May. The European Union negotiations have been challenging. The latest draft text is a good outcome for the European Union, but the document is not yet agreed. Differences remain on a couple of issues, including on the exact relationship between the Addis conference and the Post-2015 Summit. Negotiations are still ongoing in New York as we speak, and they may continue in Addis.  The European Union has been well prepared and ready to play its constructive and leading role throughout the negotiations and beyond, including through some concrete figures, for instance, EUR 58 billion for official development assistance. This makes the European Union collectively the world’s largest donor. We have recommitted to achieving the official development assistance target of 0.7% of gross national income within the timeframe of the post-2015 agenda, including an even more ambitious effort for least-developed countries. Regrettably, this commitment has not been followed by other developed and emerging donors. EUR 100 billion is the amount we estimate the European Union can mobilise to finance notably infrastructure investments in partner countries through blending by 2020, leveraged through an EU grant component of up to EUR 8 billion.  More than EUR 16 billion will be dedicated to addressing environment and climate change objectives. And EUR 35 billion is a conservative estimate of the annual value of the exports of the least-developed countries to the European Union, which grants them duty-free and quota-free market access.   Let me now come to Parliament’s report on tax evasion and tax avoidance. The Commission concurs with the general analysis of this very comprehensive report. Having exchanged views with rapporteur Schlein on several occasions, I am well aware of the importance Parliament attaches to these issues. I take careful note of your proposed action plan to support developing countries in mobilising more domestic resources. Improved domestic resource mobilisation can indeed significantly contribute to a more sustainable and reliable sourcing of revenue. Adequate administrative capacity of our partner countries’ tax administrations, and their political will to reform, are key in this respect.  Domestic revenue mobilisation and the fight against illicit financial flows, tax evasion and tax avoidance will have an important role in the Addis and New York conferences. The negotiations on the Addis outcome document have been complex on this point. The latest proposal tabled could in our view be considered as a good compromise and reflects most of the issues and actions contained in Parliament’s report.  There are still difficulties around the UN committee on tax, and its upgrading to an intergovernmental body. We clearly support giving developing countries a stronger voice and participation in the definition of the global tax governance agenda – without necessarily creating yet another intergovernmental body. We should focus on the substance, not on taking decisions on the format at this stage of the process.  The Commission is committed to ensuring that the developing countries which have the ambition for reform are supported in this difficult path. As part of a global partnership initiative, we will be organising a side-event on the margins of the Addis conference and are developing a document as a first basis for discussion under the title ‘Collect More – Spend Better’.  Honourable Members, we are close to achieving a very important result, but we cannot yet take it for granted. In Addis and New York we have a unique opportunity to redefine global development cooperation for the years to come. Let us make it count.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2414, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Hugues Bayet", "mepid": "125002", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Madam President, I would first like to thank our colleague Elly Schlein for the work that has been done and for taking into account the priorities of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. As we all know, tax evasion is a real scourge. It causes a clear shortfall in state budgets, as much money that could be spent on the vital needs of all populations, namely social security, health care, employment, education, the economy or infrastructure. That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has focused on three priorities.  First, we believe that we must strongly support the development of tax administrations in the countries concerned in order to effectively levy fair and equitable taxes.  Second, we should focus on increasing the tax base in developing countries, including initiatives such as the CBCR, the BEPS project or revising double taxation agreements.  Thirdly, we could link the European Union's aid to respect for the principles of good governance in tax matters.  I would like to conclude by stressing that, in order to achieve these objectives, the first step must be to set an example at European level. I think that European institutions, such as the EBRD or the ECB, could avoid working with financial intermediaries in tax havens or reluctant to fight tax evasion. This would allow us to create an effective virtuous circle to combat this phenomenon.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2415, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Paul Rübig", "mepid": "2278", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I would also like to thank Mrs Schlein very much for the good relationship and also for the good cooperation. I believe that it is quite simply important to show that we have been making great efforts for many years to set new standards, particularly in development policy. But the failure of many governments around the world makes it important for us to think about where the causes lie. We currently have migration, we have refugees, and, ultimately, it is not the case that we do not analyse where the cause of all these problems is, and that poverty is not analysed either, why people are poor and why they are getting into trouble.  On the contrary, we note that unemployment is exported to Europe and, in return, the money that the migrants partly earn from us and our tax money is returned to these countries. This has to do with the fact that we must, of course, be clear that we are to make trade possible with the WTO regulation 'Everything but arms'. We should see that family businesses are set up.

If we do not get a deal there it will be harder in those subsequent conferences. Now we have already made our position clear on ODA in the Pereira report – Ms Pereira is going to speak in a few moments – but I want to focus on tax tonight. The OECD has estimated that, if we could increase tax revenue by 1% in developing countries, it would be like doubling ODA. So tax is crucial, and that is why we need concrete measures to tackle tax problems. We need companies and individuals to pay their fair share of tax, and some of these concrete measures are in the Schlein report. We need to stamp out illegal practices like trade mis—invoicing, where companies manipulate tax invoices so they do not pay their fair share. Save the Children has published a report with some shocking figures. In Sub-Saharan Africa, EUR 15 billion a year are lost through these unpaid taxes. That is money that would pay for decent healthcare, and it would pay to tackle childhood malnutrition.  I think those who are dodging those taxes need to know that they are literally taking money out of the mouths of babes. To tackle these problems, we need concrete proposals and we have heard some tonight. We need new accountancy rules; we need country-by-country reporting, and it has to be public. Companies must be made to report publicly on what they are doing so that we can track down those who are not paying their fair dues. I hope we will push for that in Addis and in the subsequent talks.

So far, only the EU has committed to a contribution of 0.7% of GDP to OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE. In addition, we need a new approach to financing development, as limited and insufficient funds should primarily start investing in productive areas, development engines, additional mobilisation of all types of financial resources, both public and private, domestic and international.  One of the biggest untapped opportunities lies in mobilizing the domestic resources of developing countries through more efficient tax systems. That is why I strongly welcome rapporteur Schlein's report on this topic – combating tax avoidance and evasion in developing countries.

This means a loss of huge tax revenues, which could be used to finance the state's social actions. For this reason taxes must be paid where the profits are made.

At this stage, we must also reflect on what the European Union will do to support the implementation of the financing for development outcome and the post-2015 agenda. We are carefully considering how the European Union’s policies might need to be reviewed to help promote the new agenda. The principle of policy coherence for development becomes more relevant than ever.  The European Union must be ready to deliver on a solid set of actions to implement the post-2015 agenda. This includes a comprehensive approach to supporting domestic resource mobilisation in developing countries and tackling tax avoidance and tax evasion. We will take the actions proposed in Parliament’s report into careful consideration, and we welcome your continued engagement in this regard.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2436, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Nicolas Schmit", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Madam President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for this report, which has enabled us to have a good debate, which is an important contribution to the preparations for the Addis Ababa and New York meetings. I would also like to highlight the work of the Commissioner and the importance of the fight against tax evasion. The solutions must, in this respect, be absolutely international.  As your speeches have clearly demonstrated and confirmed, the position of the European Union and its Member States on the purpose of this conference is clear. Addis Ababa should not be a conference on the issue of official development assistance alone. The need for an integrated approach to all means of implementation, financial and other, must be emphasized.  It is clear that official development assistance must remain an important source of funding, particularly for least developed countries and fragile states, provided, and has been said, that it is effective and well-oriented, well-used. I think we need to broaden the scope and reflect on what has been said about the creation of development. Education is, of course, a pillar of development policy, but also the creation of jobs and businesses - and I am thinking above all of the social sector, social enterprises. In addition to official development assistance, alternative financing, such as microfinance, must also be supported.  In this spirit, the Presidency, with these results that have been recalled, is fully committed to ensuring that these international negotiations are successful and that we are able to generate a true international partnership.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2437, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Elly Schlein", "mepid": "124804", "text": "   Rapporteur. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his willingness in these months of work to discuss this report and for his commitment to take our proposals into consideration. I wanted to tell him – he knows this because we have been confronted with this for a long time – that we remain convinced that the creation of a truly intergovernmental body is the only way to guarantee full representativeness to developing countries. Today, the UN Tax Committee has only 25 members. This would be a quantum leap forward for the process of reforming the global system and sometimes, if You will allow me, form is substance. I therefore hope that tomorrow's vote will help to unblock the debate in order to arrive at an ambitious document on this subject in Addis Ababa. I would, of course, also like to thank the Council, as well as Mrs McAvan, for reminding us that country by country reporting is an indispensable tool for a serious fight against tax evasion and avoidance. That is why it is a central point of our action plan and I very much hope that tomorrow all the groups will support it as they did in committee in order to give a strong signal. I would also like to thank all my fellow Members who have contributed to this debate, not forgetting all the aspects which, although not mentioned, are, of course, included in the text of the report. It is not just a question of improving the mobilisation of internal resources: this also leads to a strengthening of governance, transparency and accountability towards citizens, and in this case certainly also the fight against corruption, which is mentioned several times in the text, and therefore, in essence, also to ensure greater independence from foreign aid in the long term. I would like to thank you all once again for your contribution and I hope that the report will obtain the highest possible majority in the vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2438, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Preşedinte. –", "mepid": "37324", "text": "   The debate has been closed.

For the European Union, this will in a way be a poker \"check\" of its commitments to ensuring high-quality development funding. The agreement agreed in Addis Ababa will form the basis for the September talks on the new Sustainable Development Goals, which cannot be achieved without adequate and stable funding.  In view of the need to ensure stable funding, I am of the opinion that the commitment we will make in Addis Ababa must first and foremost be real. It is therefore also important to take into account the fact that very few Member States are currently able to meet the commitment to allocate 0.7% of gross national income to ODA. I think it is right that the objective of allocating 0.7% of GNI to development policy should be treated globally, that is to say, towards the European Union as a whole, so that the different economic situations of individual countries, as well as different traditions in the field of development policy, can be taken into account.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2440, "date": "2015-07-07.json", "name": "Илхан Кючюк (ALDE)", "mepid": "124866", "text": "  in writing. – Dear Colleagues, development aid aims both to reduce poverty and promote human rights, the strengthening of democracy, good governance and the rule of law. The Union contributes almost 60% of the world's official aid, but poverty and inequality reduction can be achieved by mobilising additional funds. In order to achieve these priorities, we must not forget about the private sector as a major actor and its potential to contribute to effective and long-term development. In this regard, I support the Council's conclusion of 12 December 2014. on the need to strengthen the role of the private sector in meeting future Sustainable Development Goals. In conclusion, development policy cannot achieve its objectives on its own, but must be integrated into a broader framework that combines both foreign and trade policy and other foreign policy instruments. Only then will development funding deliver a long-term and sustainable outcome.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
