It can be said with all responsibility that the situation on the milk market is in crisis. The milk market has always been sensitive, as even during the quota period there were also serious distortions, as evidenced by the years 2008-2009. After the elimination of milk quotas, the situation became complicated. Even before the quota was extinguished, milk producers had set out to increase production in order to have a stronger position in the freed market. In 2015, there were favourable conditions for increased production. It is understandable that each producer wants to increase its revenues, hence, under the above-mentioned favourable conditions, there has been an increase in production. Most farmers also have to finance the repayment of their loans.  The milk market is a global market and is therefore influenced by production, supply and demand in various regions and countries around the world. In 2015, production also increased in the United States, Australia. It should be taken into account that significant stocks from 2014 and earlier years were also accumulated. Imports of milk and milk products by China have also decreased. At the same time, there has been no increase in consumption, which is probably contributed by the ongoing media coverage of the harmfulness of lactose to human health. Oversupply over demand has led to a very significant fall in milk prices, they are below the cost of production.  The situation on the European market is therefore puzzling, where just over half of the 420 million earmarked for intervention on agricultural markets was used as recently as last autumn. Commissioner Hogan has given a great deal of room for manoeuvre on the use of these funds to member states in this regard. We have always proposed greater flexibility for countries, as Commissioner Hogan has done. It can be said that, despite the various positive and very important actions taken at Commission and national level, the effects are very little visible. There is now an urgent need to strike a balance between supply and demand. However, there are no proposals for instruments that would lead to a reduction in production. The notion that farmers will do so voluntarily is not confirmed in reality. Farmers are defending themselves against bankruptcy by increasing production. A form of production reduction payment should therefore be used, while ensuring that farms are able to maintain their liquidity so that they do not take up the herd earlier and on a wider scale. The efforts of Member States and Commissioner Hogan to increase sales in third countries should be positively assessed, but at the same time the consumption of milk products on national markets should be increased, especially where it is relatively low. We are also thinking here of using the distribution of free food under the programme that the European Union has adopted in this area, or of increasing the distribution of dairy products to a group of people coming to Europe. The situation described above illustrates how dependent the European milk market is on the world market, on other external conditions, often of a political nature, such as the Russian embargo, or on far-reaching concessions to the detriment of agriculture in trade agreements concluded by the Union with third countries, where agricultural matters are often sacrificed for benefit in other areas of trade. The efficiency of the milk chain from milking to the consumer must therefore be improved in the first place. Many elements need to be improved in terms of vertical integration and the functioning of cooperatives as well, because there, too, various cooperatives are owned by members, the costs are borne by farmers. It is possible to increase efficiency as part of improving vertical integration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Hans Hoogeveen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, it is a great honour for me, on behalf of the Netherlands Presidency, to address the European Parliament and to answer the question. The situation in the agricultural markets in many of the Member States is very difficult and severe, especially in the dairy sector, and the Council is fully aware of this situation and shares the concerns of the farmers who have to cope with these difficult problems. Yesterday, at the hearing of the Agriculture Committee, the dairy sector clearly conveyed a clear sense of urgency, although the views on how to solve the crisis were quite different. Notwithstanding the September 2015 package, mainly directed to the dairy sector, prices are still at a low level and lower than expected. Therefore, the Council continues to work hard to properly address the concerns of farmers and of the Member States, but of course it has to be done within the framework of the Common Agriculture Policy.  It is a European crisis which needs a European answer, but at the same time, the circumstances in different Member States differ from sector to sector and from country to country. You see an average increase of milk production of about between 5% and 6%, but that is not the case in every Member State so whilst stating that we need a European answer, at the same time we need flexibility for the Member States to implement measures which are suitable for the national circumstances.  It is also clear that it should be a joint effort, a joint effort by the Council, the European Parliament, the European Commission, but also by the producers themselves. It is clear that we have to find ways to reduce milk production within the European Union. And of course we took the decision in September 2015 for the package of about EUR 420 million, and of course it was done to directly support farmers and to see how we can leverage the supply and demand. Member States – and Commissioner Hogan will probably say something about it – are still implementing those measures. The Presidency has put on the agenda of every Council meeting the market situation and discussed with the Member States how to act.  In March, we took 16 additional measures, together with the Commission and the Council, and those measures relate to intervention measures, they relate to promotion measures, to exports, as well as the possibility for Member States to give additional state aid. Also, these measures still have to be implemented and implementation is under way, and of course time will tell whether those two packages are up to the task and to see whether or not we can level supply and demand.  As stated in the Presidency conclusions of March, the Netherlands Presidency keeps the developments of the markets under close review and will discuss it of course again at the June Council. It was also stated in the March conclusions that the Council has called on the Commission to consider the availability of additional resources, including the possibility of activation of the crisis reserve as a last resort, to support market measures at the appropriate time. That will be on the agenda of the June Council to be discussed by the Council, Member States and the Commission. But also at the last Council it was clear that many Member States have stated that if we are again going to take additional measures, they have to be linked to a reduction of milk production. They cannot be standalone measures, they have to be linked to a reduction of milk in the Member States by the producers themselves.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I apologise for being slightly late this morning. I welcome the opportunity to return to this House at a time of continued crisis in the agricultural markets in several Member States, but particularly in the dairy and pigmeat sectors. The situation in the dairy sector in virtually every Member State is acute, and the most recent price information available from the Milk Market Observatory (MMO) shows that the average milk price in the European Union in April was 27.62 euro cents per kilogram. This represents a fall of 11.5% since the same time last year.  The situation is, of course, not one confined to Europe, with global supply continuing to outpace demand, which is putting pressure on dairy products in particular and indeed on their prices. Experts in the Milk Market Observatory acknowledged at their meeting on Tuesday that some improvement in market sentiment was perceptible, against a background of slowed—down milk production in the coming months, and global demand remains healthy. However, they concluded that the market fundamentals have not really changed and that an improvement in the supply—demand equation remains absolutely necessary.  Despite my commitment to identify new markets and some encouraging export data, opportunities for increased demand are limited. Accordingly, we have to focus on supply. Before looking at the extensive range of measures which the Commission has put in place, I would like to reflect further on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. Milk deliveries in the European Union increased in 2014 and 2015 by 4.4% and 2.6% respectively but in the first quarter of this year milk collection grew by 7.2%. As a result, an additional volume of 2.6 million tonnes has been collected in just three months.  At a world level, milk production increased by 3.9%, mainly due to European Union production levels, and US production was up 1.2% in April, a lower figure than was expected. Production in New Zealand is expected to be down 2% for this year and Australia down 1.2%. Within the European Union the largest increases in volume in the first two months of 2016 were reported in the Netherlands (330 000 tonnes), Germany (300 000 tonnes), Poland (140 000 tonnes) and Ireland (110 000 tonnes). In percentage terms the largest increases have been in Ireland, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands.  On the demand side, the view of the MMO Economic Board at its meeting on Tuesday was that world demand remains dynamic, driven by butter and cheese. European Union export data supports this view, with dairy exports having increased by some 13% in the first two months of this year. There were particularly good figures for butter, which was up 17%, and cheese, 13.4%, and double digit growth in import data from China confirms its recovery. The Union has increased cheese exports to all top ten destinations up to February 2016, principally by 9% to the United States. Significant increases of butter exports have been reported from Morocco, Canada and Turkey, while skimmed milk powder exports have also increased significantly in Algeria, Indonesia, and indeed in China it is up 71%.  As you know, the 109 000 tonne ceiling for the buying—in of skimmed milk powder at fixed price was reached on 31 March and a tender was operated on 19 April. The maximum buying—in price was fixed at the level of the intervention price and some 27 000 tonnes were additionally bought into intervention. On 20 April, buying—in at fixed price resumed under a double ceiling, up to 218 000 tonnes, which was reached yesterday. In view of this, the Commission will be proposing a further increase in the ceilings up to 350 000 tonnes. When I spoke in this House last month about the broader European agricultural sector, I outlined the extensive set of measures that I proposed last March. Today I will focus on some of the specific measures that are providing significant support to the dairy sector and without which the current situation would be considerably worse. Last year, total private storage aid and public intervention support covered 2.8 million tonnes of product, at a time when European production had increased by 3.5 million tonnes. We have now effectively deployed all of the tools available in the CAP toolkit, including the activation of Article 222 of the CMO, a measure that was never previously used. In that regard, I want to commend the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) of this House for the organisation of last evening’s hearing on the use of this instrument. I hope that those who participated now have a good understanding of the measure and its potential, which I believe should not be underestimated. This measure is part of a comprehensive and broad—ranging response and can play a significant role. It encourages action towards greater market balance in the dairy sector. In order to encourage use of this tool as an effective contribution to the crisis, I have met with COPA-COGECA and the European Dairy Association (EDA) and I will discuss the issue again with COPA-COGECA this week. This is a voluntary instrument and its use depends ultimately on producers. It is now genuinely in the hands of dairy farmers who may, if they so wish, join forces and collectively decide to reduce production. Before turning briefly to the question of the role of the MMO, I would like to say something about the use by Member States of the EUR 420 million targeted aid package, of which 66% was directed at the milk sector. Based on the most recent information reported to my services, just 56% of this money has been spent. The rate of spending is, of course, likely to be accelerated in the coming weeks and Member States have been reminded that they have until the end of next month to spend all of the money or to forfeit it.  Finally, I want to acknowledge the role the MMO is playing in ensuring timely and robust data to all stakeholders in the sector, including Members of this House. Transparent price information and other related data is essential for forward planning and ensures that decisions are taken on the basis of accurate information. The Milk Market Observatory provides a unique portal, where the most comprehensive possible set of market data is available. The role of the MMO is to provide such data and not to substitute for the actions of the institutions. In conclusion, let me once again acknowledge the depth of the crisis that exists in the dairy sector. While this is not a crisis exclusively of our making, we have of course been badly affected by it. But producers must take responsibility as well for the continuing increase in production which I have just outlined and which, given current market conditions, is simply not sustainable. Despite the deployment of a range of available measures, I must emphasise that I can work only within the constraints of the legislation that is available, specifically in terms of the exceptional measures available. This was the outcome of the 2013 reform, in which Parliament and the Council reaffirmed the market orientation of the CAP. I look forward to Members’ ideas about how we can go forward and how we can continue to help the dairy sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Albert Deß", "mepid": "28228", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Commissioner! Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for The current market situation for milk threatens the existence of hundreds of thousands of dairy farmers in the European Union. We have a situation with the lowest prices: milk prices are reported to me from the Baltic States around ten cents, there can no longer be a dairy farmer, even at 20 cents. The Commission has intervened within its capabilities with regard to butter and skimmed milk and has also adopted a number of other measures, but these measures are not sufficient in the current difficult situation. We have a completely new situation and this new situation requires new measures. Commissioner, as you know, I do not think that the current intervention price system is effective. We need an ad hoc intervention system where the Commission has the opportunity to intervene earlier before prices are totally down. In view of the market imbalance, it is necessary, even for a limited time, to withdraw milk quantities from production throughout Europe. We should consider whether it is possible for every farmer to take a certain quantity out of production for a certain period of time. I do not believe in a voluntary measure! Only the weakest areas will be phased out of production here, and production will be expanded in other areas. In my opinion, the current situation is also being brutally abused by retailers and by large corporations. I am told that it is precisely now that these groups are using the situation to dictate new requirements to the legislators to farmers, and here too it is necessary for us to take action with antitrust legal measures. I am sure Mrs McGuinness will say something about this, she is working on this problem. However, we must also ensure that sales are increased. Here, Commissioner, an immediate measure would be to reintroduce butterfat support. I believe that we could re-house a few billion kilograms of milk here and replace other fats with butterfats, which would also be in the interests of environmental policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Paolo De Castro", "mepid": "96891", "text": "  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the crisis that has been going on for months in the dairy sector has taken on continental, if not global, dimensions. In view of this situation, the measures implemented so far have proved not only ineffective, but even in some cases counterproductive. This is demonstrated by the worrying data on production levels in recent months which, despite the constant fall in prices, continue to rise. The latest analyses prepared by the Commission show an increase in production in the first three months of the year, on an annual basis, of 7 %. Last autumn's EUR 500 million package was followed last March by the proposal for national, or even local, measures that can be implemented on a voluntary basis in the Member States and financed by them from their own resources. Instead of exploiting the potential for coordinated use of resources to curb European production, the idea of identifying measures to be managed at member state level is proving to be unsuccessful and has the direct consequence of the risk of a progressive renationalisation of the CAP, the only policy that has always been a factor in European integration. In order to deal with a continental crisis, we therefore need instruments with a European dimension, which will make the Union regain the role that has long distinguished it. The time has therefore come for the Commission to implement an urgent procedure without further delay in order to arrive as soon as possible at the definition of a legislative act which, on the one hand, provides for emergency measures to contain supply and, on the other hand, responds with structural responses that improve crisis management instruments and mitigate the impact of price mode on our production chains.

We had a debate last night in the Parliament and in the committee, and I have to say I found it one of the most pessimistic debates I have ever sat through. I listened to the experts and I listened to the Commissioner. There was only one real truth and that was by the Deputy Director—General, Mr Korte, who said the situation was not good, and there was no need to beat about the bush. That is what your own Deputy Director—General said last night, Mr Commissioner. Now I have to say to you, we have to recognise some realities here. It has been mentioned this morning, if you have an increase this year of an extra 6% or 7% of milk, a market has to be found for that. The producers in the Member States who are producing this milk need to be aware that they are continuing to stoke the fire, and that they are continuing to make the problem worse not better, and certainly voluntary cutbacks will not work. And let us be honest, some Member States are positively going out encouraging their farmers to produce more milk regardless – they are going for market share. There is only one way that this can be resolved, which is that a lot of good farmers and family farms are going to hit the wall.  There is a big difference between producers and processors, and there are processors in serious difficulty as well. We have a situation where the retailers, Mr Commissioner, are getting away on a coach. They are laughing all the way to the bank at the cost of the producer, of the farmer and the sweat of his brow in the production of that milk. What we need is to sit down and to get some new ideas on the table. We are not going to go forward and it is not good enough, Mr Commissioner, in the depth of this crisis to blame producers; it is not good enough. I remember the reform coming forward from the old Commission. I remember Commissioner Fischer Boel and I remember we fought her hard when she talked about her soft landing and we asked her where it was going to be. Where is the soft landing today for those who the banks are going to foreclose on, Mr Commissioner? And to the Council I have to say it is time you woke up in Council.

Madam President, if we in the European Parliament and from the sidelines say that we are going to improve the market situation, we are offering false hope. The most important thing is to give farmers and gardeners tools to strengthen their competitiveness, first of all through better regulation. It is precisely by giving space to innovation and entrepreneurship and regaining confidence in farmers that we reduce costs and can meet societal challenges. In addition, we need to look at how we can improve the farmer's position in the chain and focus on tools that enable farmers to absorb their risks and price fluctuations. There is an interesting initiative in Ireland. A fund has been set up from which dairy farmers get money when prices are very low and where they return when prices are high.  Let's face it: it's been a long time coming, even though there are signs of recovery. However, it is a thorn in my side that the differences between the Member States in the EU are widening because everyone is going to go about their business now that agricultural prices are low. Real action is therefore needed at both national and European level. Better regulation, a level playing field, but no empty cheques to the farmers' accounts.  For example, the Netherlands is working on structural measures. Specific elements of this plan are subject to the necessary, but that is not the point. Haste is required, but there is no point in frapping plans.

Mr Hoogeveen, it is not true that the crisis will be resolved by the States, that more state aid is needed. The crisis is European and needs European responses. More state aid to resolve the crisis means condemning farmers and ranchers from southern states, impoverished European Union states on the periphery, impoverished and intervened by the troika. There are political solutions. It depends only on political will, and I will point out some proposals: reduction of compulsory production, balancing supply and demand, redistributing production among producers in the European Union, prices that cannot be below production costs, sustainable production models, looking at the internal market.

Yes, you may not have caused the crisis yourself, but the crisis was foreseeable and this crisis was warned, years ago. It is, of course, very sad now that this late realisation – which I think everyone now has – that there is too much milk on the market, that our farms here in Europe have to pay and have paid for at a loss of more than EUR 30 billion – money that is also lacking in rural areas. This has actually brought about a dramatic structural breach, both economically and humanly, and we have watched and have not taken the warnings seriously. It is true that ordinary decisions have now been taken at the last Council meeting in March in order to reduce the volume. But now we have the end of May, and we are no further. On the contrary, the situation has become even worse. Why? Because there is still a lack of political will to reduce production and tackle overproduction. We discuss here again and again in circles. It is then again about intervention prices, a bit of support here, a bit of support there, opening up new markets. After all, I am glad that everyone is now talking about reducing quantities, but the dairy industry and its interests are always well-considered. I wonder where the farmers who stand in the barn, milk the cows and keep the farms afloat will stay. The processors do not have the same interests as farmers. We now also have good findings and studies that show that the value added of the dairy industry is not reflected in the milk price – there is nothing to be seen. It is the eternally same concerns that hinder effective steps to reduce volumes. As has been said several times now, the reduction in quantities must be binding, it must be Europe-wide.

They are market-focused, producing for a defined market in close collaboration with their supply chains. It is all about markets. Public policy should not aim to control prices but to help farmers develop resilience to manage the risks. The point is that government should really only be thinking in terms of helping to overcome catastrophic and extreme events on farms, such as floods or drought, and not meddling in pricing or controlling supply and demand. One—off support packages can help to counter the impact of extreme natural disasters or catastrophic events that are beyond individual farmer’s control. However, the 2015 dairy support package, for example, after endless discussion, etc., resulted in a payment of just GBP 1 500 to each UK dairy farmer. Really that is just tokenism.

The learned predictions of incompetent technocrats, who explained that everything would be better after, proved to be false. Surprising, isn't it? You wanted an unregulated deal. Regulation, however, is the only viable policy to reduce unstable price fluctuations. Why make decisions that ultimately only benefit the industrial sector? The policy of market deregulation has inexorably led us to this crisis, as for other agricultural sectors. Yet you persevere again and again in this dead-end path. Incredible! The increase in volumes since the end of quotas causes prices to fall, and the export price is not enough to compensate for the losses. Even Germany is affected: the end of quotas has caused a drop in revenues to 27 cents per litre, with a forecast of 22 to 23 cents. In France, the price per litre is now 28 cents. A third of German dairy farms have disappeared in ten years. All professionals in the sector are asking for a regulatory policy. The \"milk\" package adopted last year, although insufficient, made clear observations by recognising the problems caused by the end of quotas and the serious imbalances between producers, industrialists and distributors. Do not stay at the simple stage of the observation, take courageous decisions: the decisions that are necessary, unlike those that have accelerated the disappearance of peasants and the increase of the phenomenon of concentration.

Labelling can help ensure that a fair price is paid to the farmer. Second, the CAP should boost its risk management instruments designed to even out the effects of market volatility. Participation in income support tools should be encouraged and supported with contract-based supply chain relations with the retailer.

I have said many times that only mandatory and not voluntary regulation of milk content can help to solve the milk crisis.  Another important problem is the uneven and unfair system of direct payments. After all, their purpose is to reduce the negative impact of market fluctuations on the performance of the farmer and thus stabilise their incomes.

Milk is indeed one of the most important agricultural sectors for the European Union. Its production accounts for about one-sixth of total agricultural production and it is natural that the milk crises at one time or another affect its producers, and the biggest problem here is milk buying prices and bankrupt farms. As Mr Turne has just said, Lithuanian dairy producers are in most small countries, three quarters of the milk market is placed on farms that keep fewer than five cows, and the buying prices dictated by processors do not fit today within the limits of common sense. Nineteen euro cents are taught per litre of milk in Lithuania. The purchase price fell by seven per cent in a month. In my meetings, people ask if it will happen that our grandchildren will see cows not without fields, but only in photos. All the more so because payments to Lithuanian farmers are significantly lower than for farmers in other countries – European countries. As a means of keeping milk buying prices, existing milk quotas have served well enough. Somehow it is strange that we are leaving when no quotas are required, but it is necessary to strictly protect the external borders of the European Union, I mean migrants, then we are introducing those quotas, and where they are needed – we are taking and eliminating, thus causing another crisis. In this situation, it is not only the financial payments that milk producers need, but also temporary tax and loan relief. It is necessary to review the legal provisions of processors and milk suppliers. Define the possible price range as low as possible in contracts with processors.

We should encourage higher production of dairy products, because it is evident that we have a significant increase in cheese exports to various countries outside the European Union. We need to maybe look at the Dutch model which is just interesting and gives some news and help to milk producers.  Also, what I want to emphasize is certainly the possibility to help those milk producers who want to give up production financially to repurpose production or simply stop production.

If only because there are two consequences, they are all evidenced by embassic facts. One is that budget revenues would increase in all countries, as vat fraud would be significantly reduced.

Why do producer groups not have a special right of termination in the event of price changes by dairies? Why do farmers actually supply milk to dairies where there is definitely no sale?

I wanted to thank MEPs Köstinger and Kumpula-Natri for their Forestry meeting at 8 a.m. this morning. I am glad that Mr Flanagan will be able to get that information. Today’s dairy crisis is not, as some would have us believe, a factor of the abolition of dairy quotas; rather it is something of a perfect storm, as Mr Selimovic said earlier on, which reflects increased production throughout the world at the same time as access to the Russian market was lost and demand in China had been reduced. But I can assure Mr Nicholson and others that I am not at all blaming producers for over-production, but I am agreeing with him that producers have to take their share of responsibility in terms of bringing about balance in the marketplace between demand and supply. And that is what Article 222 is about. It is a voluntary measure, but I have doubled the state aid ceilings in order to allow Member States to incentivise Article 222 measures if they so wish. Mr Blanco López has mentioned earlier that I have taken no measures in the last few months in order to deal with this particular crisis. In fact I have taken 23 measures since last September. And I have already told you that a significant number of Member States and regions, in respect of the targeted aid package last September, have not yet spent their money. I would remind Mr Dantin that it is very difficult to seek more money if eight Member States, including France, have not spent their allocation yet from last September. I think it is important as well that we have to be realistic about the possibility of new money, when you consider that in recent days one German minister suggested that 10% of all programme expenditure should be diverted directly to address the refugee crisis. So is this the view of the German MEPs? You can see how difficult it is to get additional money when that is the particular message being advised in the system. Mr Häusling advises me to put a cap on milk production, but he also advises me to give more support to the farmers in the ANC areas in order to produce more – slightly contradictory, and it therefore indicates how difficult it is to get solutions. I think a number of people have mentioned the possibility of the crisis reserve. Any further financial support would inevitably raise the issue of the activation of the crisis reserve, which could generate in excess of EUR 400 million. Its activation has been suggested, and I have been reluctant to propose its activation in the past because it represents nothing more than a redistribution of farmers’ payments. However, it is something that I am prepared to consider, and the ultimate decision, of course, will be yours. In relation to the MMO, your vote today and on previous occasions proposed a strengthening of the Milk Market Observatory, and I have done that. I believe that the MMO is now playing a very important role in providing up-to-date, reliable information, on the basis of which, operators and other stakeholders can make important commercial decisions. I have not been able to go into full detail today in relation to those Member States who are generating the largest increases in dairy production, but all of that information is readily available on the website of the MMO, proving that it is a credible source of transparent information. As well as turning to the Commission as a source of additional support for a sector which is clearly in crisis and for a longer time than would reasonably have been anticipated, I would invite Member States to consider if they have exhausted the full range of measures under the rural development programme. It is up to Member States to trigger these mechanisms. At a time of crisis, cash flow is important, and this is one of the reasons why I have been frustrated at the slow roll-out by a number of Member States of the targeted aid, and also the fact that I am aware of the challenge that it will be for some paying agencies to have some payments made that are outstanding by the end of June 2016. For this reason I am looking carefully at how best the Commission can help those Member States, and by extension the farmers, without the application of any penalty. Finally Mr President, while we are in the midst of this crisis, it is difficult to take time to stand back and assess the adequacy of the toolbox for which we must work, but we have to do that sooner or later. Perhaps in the context of proposing any changes to the existing CAP that will help to deal with risk management would also help to target measures better.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 68, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Hans Hoogeveen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament for their remarks but also for their suggestions, and certainly the Presidency will take them with us to our next discussion in the Council of June, because there we are going to discuss again the very severe situation in the dairy sector as well as the need for additional measures. I would like to reiterate what was said by Commissioner Hogan: that the Commission and the Council were not resting on their laurels. Many measures have been taken, not only in September but also in March, and of course we see some effects of those measures – perhaps not enough, but there are effects of those measures, and the situation could have been worse if we did not have taken those measures. And yes, I would like to reiterate that we need a European approach. But the Council also clearly stated that we have to take into account national circumstances, and the Council is very much agreeing with remarks of Mr De Castro and Mr Deß, that we at the same time have to ensure that there is a level playing field within the European Union. It is also clear that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution. We have to be creative, but also what was said by Commissioner Hogan, we have to work within the current framework of the common agriculture policy. And it is clear that the Council also stated that we do not want to go back to a quota system. I agree with what was said by Mr Huitema, that we have to improve the situation of the farmers in the supply chain. We have to give them a fair price for their products. Therefore the work of the market taskforce installed by the European Commission is so important, and in the June Council we have the first report of this taskforce and hopefully we get some interesting and creative ideas. Also I and the Council would like to reiterate the words of Mr Ashworth as well as Mr Huitema: that we have to make sure that the farmers maintain the position as drivers of the dairy chain. They are the first responsible persons to take action. But at the same time, of course, we have to support those farmers and see how we can help them balancing supply and demand. In this respect I also would like to thank Mr Jakovčić for referring to the Dutch model. It is not the Dutch model of the Dutch Government but it is also the Dutch model of the Dutch dairy producers, and they are looking into niche markets, into improving quality, into new market concepts. But they are also now at this moment discussing possibilities of reduction of the milk production in the Netherlands on a voluntary basis, and I think it is up to the Council in June to see how we can support those initiatives of farmers’ organisations to reduce the milk production. Last but not least, I would like to reiterate and underline the words of Ms McGuinness as well as Mrs Schreijer-Pierik: that also the banks and industry have to take their responsibility. Also they have to give their support to measures to be taken by farmers and governments, and in this respect I think one of the measures which were taken in March to support the banking sector to be involved is the possibility of Member States to give some support to liquidity problems in close relation with the banks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Mario Borghezio (ENF)", "mepid": "21817", "text": "  in writing.

These are undoubtedly very important steps towards overcoming this crisis, but the current situation shows that they are still not sufficient.  In order to compensate for the low prices, farmers produce more, leading to overproduction of milk, which does not go hand in hand with increased consumption.

This is particularly important also in the context of reduced demand from China and the Russian embargo.

In the current situation, the granting of direct financial support to milk producers is the necessary solution that would at least reduce the increasing burden of losses and prevent the producers from going into mass bankruptcy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank and greet the Commissioner, and I would like to extend a very strong thank you to all my fellow Members who have participated in the single market strategy. You see, today with the approval of the single market strategy, we are responding to the needs of our businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, and to our consumers as well as our citizens.  The internal market is the real means of increasing the concept of Europe as a single economic power and not always divided by the 28 egotises represented by the Member States. Today we are going to give a strong signal not in words, but in deeds to the economic crisis. In order to overcome it, we must be close to our productive sectors, to our families, which are intended both as workers and as consumers. What the Member States have not been able to do in recent years, well, we are completing it much more quickly. I will move on, point by point, quickly, to what we are going to achieve. Firstly, compensation between public administration debts and company taxation. A state cannot demand payment of taxes when it is not solvent with companies itself, so we want an automatic change in the difference between giving and having. You see, in my country alone, more than 5 000 companies are now bankrupt because of claims not collected by the public administration; we cannot accept that the state should be the architect of this, because it is incapable of being solvent. There is also the law of the market for the public administration, as is required of companies. We do not want a suicidal state of business, but a state that supports businesses. The second chance is that if a company has gone bankrupt because of unclaimed credits or natural disasters, we have a duty to help it by financing its reconstruction. Europe, as far as we can believe, is much closer to its citizens, and we are demonstrating this through action. Thirdly, the diversity of tax systems. We in Europe have different tax regimes that complicate the lives of our businesses and our citizens. I welcome the Commission's proposals for the harmonisation of tax systems, and I welcome the proposal we have put forward, namely the possibility of introducing a single tax in the e-commerce sector. I reiterated the need for better access to European funds by small and medium-sized enterprises, facilities for translations and shorter submission times. We must make it easier for businesses, especially small ones, to receive money and to submit projects. Service passport: it will look like a miracle, today we realize it. A simple and equal way for everyone to present documents and create businesses across Europe. You see, this is less bureaucracy, the same law for everyone and the best wins: it's the law of the market. And finally, dear President, the famous made in, you as an Italian can understand me well. And here, Commissioner, we are playing our credibility: several impact studies tell us that citizens want more details about products, traceability, transparency and real protection, and I believe that traceability is the element of protection of our quality, an important and fundamental quality also for our economy. You see, allow me to be blunt, it's time for this matter to be unblocked. The European Parliament and the Commission have already given the go-ahead for market surveillance and we await the Council's approval. It is not we who have to go backwards, it is the Member States who have the courage to overcome their national self-interest and finally approve made in. People need to know who is responsible for always blocking our work; we pass laws in support of businesses and citizens, laws that reduce bureaucracy, but there is always a stop to the Council. It is time to stop, because this stop is Europe's real failure. We have seen this with immigrants, I will end, Mr President, with the late payment directive, with the data protection regulation, that is enough. Today's vote, Commissioner, will no longer give the Council any excuse for not approving made in. We trust you and Mr Juncker because, you see, we propose and approve real and useful solutions to the problems of our citizens.

I would like in particular to thank personally Ms Comi for all her hard work as rapporteur, and of course the shadow rapporteurs.  We know that the single market is a great asset in Europe. It is the best available instrument to improve the investment climate, business environment and productivity of the EU, the whole EU economy. The report clearly recognises that. We need to create more opportunities and dismantle unwarranted barriers. The single market must work and this is very important, both for the citizens, for the consumers, and for businesses. They must see it is an opportunity, not as a threat. We talked to citizens and businesses to understand what is really keeping the single market from reaching its full potential and, based on that, we proposed steps forward in our Single Market Strategy adopted last October. We are focusing on the real—life problems. I really want to underline this: the real—life problems. Our strategy is about targeted initiatives to tackle practical barriers and obstacles. I welcome very much the support in your report. I cannot cover all the good points that you make in your report, so let me just focus on three issues that I think and I know are of importance also to you: on geographical discrimination against consumers; the services passport and the collaborative economy.  First, geographical discrimination. Article 20 of the Services Directive is very clear about it. European consumers are not to be discriminated against based on their nationality or residence but we still, unfortunately, see this kind of discrimination all over Europe. Four out of five consumer respondents tell us that they have experienced geo—blocking in their lives, so yesterday we came forward with an ambitious but very realistic proposal about this. With your help we will address the discrimination against our citizens and companies based on their nationality or place of residence. I therefore welcome very much your support for our legislative proposal which you have voiced in your report.  Second, the services passport. It is still far too complicated for companies to offer their services cross-border. There are too many bureaucratic hurdles and too many delays so we are designing the services passport, a voluntary instrument for service providers who want to access other Member State markets. I am very much aware of the discussions you had on the services passport for the Comi report. I appreciate the compromise you have found and I really want to hear your views and the views of the citizens, and of course economic operators. That is why three weeks ago we launched a public consultation on the subject. This consultation will run until the end of July, until 26 July. Stakeholders need to be informed of this consultation and encouraged to take part in it. I would welcome also your support and your help on this. Third, the collaborative economy. This is really a fundamental transformation of our economy. This is not going back. I have always repeated that resisting it would be like resisting the printing press and steam engine in earlier times. It is also a major opportunity for Europe. We need to get it right. We need to find a way to embrace these new business models; otherwise we know exactly what will happen. Five years from now our successors will complain and regret how Europe lost the collaborative economy.  I fully understand that some people are uncertain about what this all means. We need to respond to their questions. We advocate a balance. I want to really underline this: a balanced development of the collaborative economy within the single market. That means clarity of the rules, clarity for businesses that apply and how they apply. It means avoiding market fragmentation in Europe. Next week we will provide more clarity with a communication on the application of the existing EU law in this area and we will make a number of recommendations of course to Member States.  Thank you for welcoming and supporting our approach on the collaborative economy in your report.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The EU's Internal Market Strategy is a fundamentally useful project and can help to strengthen growth forces. The report admits that some 22 million people in the Union are without employment and the consequences of the euro crisis have not been overcome. Growth-enhancing measures are therefore very useful. In this report, I find it helpful, for example, to facilitate market access by introducing a service passport, which has already been mentioned here, or to create legal foundations for new business models in the field of e-commerce. Unfortunately, I must also point out weaknesses in the report. In my view, the recurring demand for a uniform or high level of protection for products or job security or social standards is particularly problematic. We must be aware that it is precisely in poorer countries that companies with weaker capital cannot afford every level of the more developed countries. So if we demand an evenly high level of protection, it will lead to more unemployment, more intra-EU migration and a call for more transfer payments. At the same time, we should prevent workers in developed countries from losing their wealth as a result of ever-increasing low-wage competition. The level of protection should depend on the performance of the countries. Germany, for example, must therefore impose a high level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 89, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Andreas Schwab", "mepid": "28223", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to begin by congratulating the GROUP of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on this successful report. I believe that we have been able to include a great many points in this report, which were also raised by the European Commission in the internal market strategy. For example, the fact that we need European insolvency law, which can make a great deal of contribution to simplifying economic structures throughout Europe, is emphasised once again here. However, Mrs Comi has also mentioned the importance of the internal market, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. This is also a matter of the heart in my constituency, which we pursue in the internal market legislation. I believe that if we adopt new rules in the internal market today, these rules will actually have to contribute to an improvement for small and medium-sized enterprises. Everything must be measured by this standard. The behaviour of public administration in many Member States with regard to payment obligations for public contracts is indeed appalling. The report also makes this clear. In my view, the product safety package is also about finding an undogmatic, pragmatic approach to finding solutions that will ultimately help small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. Commissioner, when you talk about real life problems, I think that is the common sense approach that we need. Commissioner, you have now also mentioned geo-blocking in your presentation. Yesterday, we discussed this sufficiently with Vice-President Ansip. That is why I would like to say something about the services passport, the legislation of which will also come to Parliament in the next few weeks. Anything that entails the simplification of the cross-border services market, Commissioner, will be welcome if we manage to ensure that legitimate safety standards in individual professions are not simply thrown overboard. When I look at the situation in my constituency between Germany and France, I believe that in many places we can find pragmatic solutions that we can achieve without having too much difficulty with the professional participants, with those involved in public.

The main problem is that, in the average citizen’s eyes, the market is more concerned with vested interests than it is with their needs. We need to start working towards a fairer single market that is politically supported, economically viable and socially accepted by European citizens, a market that stimulates sustainable economic growth and job creation, but also considers citizens’ hopes, fears and expectations.  The Comi report is an important step towards achieving a strong, green, knowledge-based social market economy which by turning its focus back to its people will become a common asset of all its citizens, reduce unemployment, poverty, inequalities, social exclusion and wage dumping, promote respect of fundamental social rights, fair mobility and improvement of living and working conditions in Europe.  As a shadow rapporteur, I have striven to ensure that essential elements are added to the text aimed at improving the well—being of European citizens. Therefore, I urge MEPs to support the report, and in particular the measures aimed at endorsing a highly-competitive social market economy, providing consumers with the highest level of protection, promoting innovative start-ups, SMEs and social economy enterprises, opposing abuses in the single market, which are trying to circumvent existing rules and lower worker and consumer and environmental standards, highlighting the economic , social and environmental benefits and challenges of the sharing economy, calling for a single European system for the protection of geographical indications for non-agricultural products, and supporting the ‘Made in’ labelling, which is of crucial importance to protect consumers and provide them with the information they need.

Also, the draft report recognises the overall support initiatives of the single market, which is important. We need a single market for services. The service passport initiative should not only address administrative obstacles, but also tackle regulatory barriers and advance mutual recognition of priority sectors. So we really need to focus on this passport initiative.  You should also look at useless labelling of products. We tend to have this problem, so we need to fix this and we need to think about digital solutions in the labelling area. An overload of information does confuse the consumers. We also need to tackle geo—blocking. The proposal that was proposed by the Commission yesterday is definitely a step in the right direction.

But it's not enough. The great monopolistic capital wants more and the objective of deepening integration in the Single Market and contributing to structural reforms is explicit, read the liquidation of the social functions of the State and labour rights.

Where exactly have you seen the single market, when in each country we have different basic wages, different indirect and direct taxes and largely different regulations on the functioning of the market? How can you still mention the term 'single'? All the Union has created is a para-economic system, structured to benefit the largest companies in particular, especially multinationals, which have the means to overcome legal and fiscal obstacles to ensure greater profits.  In addition, you have condemned those countries that have weak economies to a permanent and lasting loss of valuable human resources for the benefit of the strongest states.

I would remind you, as the Commissioner has already done, that, alongside Schengen, the Single Market, which is one of the greatest achievements of the European Union, which European citizens feel in their day-to-day lives and which has completely transformed the way we trade, how we consume and how we circulate within the European area.  The potential of this market with more than five hundred million consumers is not fully exploited. Potential efficiency gains of €615 billion are estimated as the single market is deepened. However, obstacles to the free movement of goods and services remain, such as unjustified non-tariff regulatory requirements and several Member States that do not apply part of the important legislation in force. There is also a mistrust of consumers about cross-border contracts and some digital illiteracy.  All this represents unnecessary waste for the real economy and hinders greater growth and more job creation.

I would like to stress the fact that the social content of the internal market plays a decisive role, as has already been said. European citizens must identify with these strategies, they must see them as effective, because they improve their living conditions, their status as citizens when they work or simply when they live in their community. Then we must stress and then make the advancement of their rights and material conditions workable. That is why it is very important, for example, to recognise that, for the same work, the pay is the same. It is a fundamental right, it is the recognition of a condition of uniformity, which I do not understand why it should be called into question. Then those citizens must be guaranteed as consumers. Their fundamental rights are those of awareness through knowledge. Made in this serves, to guarantee companies fair competition, not made up of activities between them, carried out in distant places and peddled for activities instead of the neighboring territory, and to those who buy and to those who consume it is very important to let them know what they buy and what they consume. Finally, I believe that it is precisely for the benefit of the company and, at the same time, of those who work, that it is very important that in an economy there are decisive procedures for loyalty in tax behaviour, such as those that are called for.

Mr President, I consider the report on the Single Market Strategy to be a very important and comprehensive report, which I believe will be a milestone for years to come. It is a sufficiently comprehensive, very important report made by my dear colleague, Mrs Comi, in which she really deserves congratulations for this comprehensive work on such an important issue.  It is a report which is essentially aimed at the development of the economy, which will also lead to the prosperity of the peoples of the European Union. But it is much more aimed at more opportunities for citizens and for small and medium-sized enterprises. For us, since this report essentially gives particular meaning and value to both small and medium-sized enterprises and consumer support, it fulfils its objectives and mission.  For consumers in particular, it should be stressed that it is inconceivable that products marketed in the single market do not mention geographical origin. Essentially these products do not have the well-known \"Made In\", their identity. Products cannot be marketed and consumed and effectively marketed without their place of origin, geographical indication.  After all, this is a basic right of consumers.

Of these, 17 % are over 55 years of age and face a higher risk of long-term unemployment and social exclusion. The Moryglobal affair, linked to the bankruptcy of Mory-Ducros, is the result of what can be described as a price war in the freight sector, with a drastic reduction in physical production in Europe and the consequent compression of the volumes to be transported and the operating margins of companies. Once again, it is up to the workers to pay the price of the crisis.  The financing of the EGF of tailored services for job search and retraining, combined with an initial application of the \"social contract\", will therefore make it possible to implement individual and collective actions to protect redundant workers, with particular attention to workers over 55, who account for 19 % of redundancies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 392, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Jens Gieseke (PPE)", "mepid": "124807", "text": "  Writing.

Following the redundancies following the liquidation of the French road transport company Mory-Global, France has requested assistance from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund (5.1 million euros) with a view to reintegrating 2,132 laid-off workers into the labour market. The French government argues that since the 2008 crisis, the road transport sector has shrunk by 14% in the European Union and by 21% in France. At no time is there any reference to unfair competition by the posting of foreign workers in France, and by road coasting, which accounts for 10% of the transfers of goods made in France. The application of the minimum wage to seconded workers does not solve anything since the average wage of French road hauliers is much higher. In addition, the social security contribution differential can account for up to 30% of the cost of labour. This fund therefore acts as a disempowering mechanism both for the leaders of companies who can more easily relocate, but also for national governments that do not dare to face the real problem of unfair competition.

Under the scheme, Sweden is expected to take in nearly 6,000 refugees from the two countries. However, the Commission has come up with a proposal that Sweden should be temporarily removed from the scheme. In the Commission's view, Sweden is facing an emergency situation due to the increased number of applicants for international protection, which puts unmanageable pressure on the Swedish asylum system. Today's number of asylum seekers in Sweden is causing practical problems, as refugees cannot be given adequate conditions for life and their applications are processed late. Sweden received a total of more than 170,000 applicants in March 2016, of which more than 70,000 were children, according to the latest figures.

I welcome the fact that the EU-US Privacy Shield is significantly different from the Safe Harbour Framework, as it provides for much more detailed documentation imposing more specific obligations on companies willing to join the framework, and includes a new control system that ensures that EU citizens have their rights respected when processing their data in the US. In addition, I hope that the agreed independence of the U.S. Attorney will be guaranteed.

The pay and pension gap, the glass ceiling, the lack of conciliation policies, as well as the absence of equal and non-transferable parental leave are some of the reasons for this inequality. This report contains several aspects that make our vote decisive in favour, such as the need to ensure public services, education and social security to combat poverty, the need to promote conciliation to avoid precarious and \"atypical\" contracts, the defence of women's economic independence by fighting for equality in wages and pensions, strengthening maternity and paternity leave and combating gender-based violence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1287, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Dominique Bilde (ENF)", "mepid": "124771", "text": "  In writing.

Many of Parliament's resolutions call for the causes and consequences of this deprivation to be tackled in various aspects. However, it should be noted that, despite efforts, little progress has been made on this issue in 2015. The economic crisis, which has led to a gradual recovery in the EU, has led to an increase in the number of people (men and women) at risk of poverty and social exclusion. On average, however, more women than men experience poverty, all the more so if they are single mothers, pensioners, immigrants or people with disabilities. A very large number of women work precariously, end their careers, work in so-called women's areas (health care, chores, etc.) and work part-time more because they are obliged to take care of their loved ones rather than because of their choice. The difference in pay compared to the salary paid to men and the different pensions (which are part of a career that has sought to harmonise their private lives and work harmoniously) put a heavy burden on women in financial difficulties and the daily uncertainty about their economic independence.

Precisely because of the important role that women play within the family context, women are in fact often forced to work part-time and precarious jobs, and are also suffering, helplessly, the unbearable injustice of recurrent and shameful unjustified wage differences. This is often underestimated, but appropriate responses must be given in good time. In this respect, the current austerity policies are playing a key negative role, which, by encouraging the privatisation of public assistance, contribute to increasing the burden on women in relation to the care of their families.

Finally, while the effective completion of the single market can really be a great opportunity for economic development, particular care must be taken not to jeopardise, in the context of the removal of existing unjustified non-tariff barriers, the regulations established with a view to protecting consumers and the environment, which must be absolutely protected and, indeed, strengthened.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1484, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Steeve Briois (ENF)", "mepid": "124757", "text": "  In writing.

In short, in our opinion, the failures of the EU single market were not caused by supposed 'non-tariff barriers' raised by Member States and regions, but by excessive regulatory activity (including in detail) which, without in any way respecting the principle of subsidiarity, makes life complicated for the national legislator and the fabric of small and medium-sized enterprises.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1487, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Cristian-Silviu Buşoi (PPE)", "mepid": "38420", "text": "  in writing. \\u2012 In 1992, the European Union launched the concept of a 'single market', removing non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and opening up trade in services within the Union.

In recent years, important progress has been made, but the current situation requires an even more pragmatic and incisive approach. This report proposes measures such as: a VAT action plan, a legislative proposal on business insolvency, the creation of a passport for services and a legislative initiative to prevent discrimination against consumers on grounds of nationality or country of residence. These are concrete measures that will certainly have a direct impact and a leverage effect on the market and on strengthening consumer protection. In order to achieve a more modern, innovative and fair single market, policy priorities should be to strengthen business competitiveness, improve budget implementation, better regulation and strengthen consumer protection. In fact, this work needs to be continued swiftly and effectively, which is why I voted in favour of this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1825, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Tokia Saïfi (PPE)", "mepid": "4345", "text": "  In writing.

One of the main objectives of European integration remains the strengthening of deregulation to enable the completion of a single market following neoliberal logic. While this report takes note of the rise in unemployment and in particular that of young people and the decline in the competitiveness of companies, it does not call into question their causes, that is to say first and foremost the austerity policies largely responsible for this situation. On the contrary, the report encourages us to keep the same course and to continue in the same neoliberal logic with the consequences we know of it. Unsurprisingly, it recommends reducing administrative and tax barriers in order to free up capital. Strengthening competition, removing The sovereignty of Member States in this area, encouraging public-private partnerships and finally not tolerating any breach of the rules of the single market are the way to go. It is always the same with the same negative consequences for the rights of workers and citizens.  Like all members of my group, I remain firmly opposed to the construction of this so-called single market and the widespread deregulation it entails, so I voted against it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1862, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL)", "mepid": "125100", "text": "  in writing. \\u2012 These mechanisms, such as the Single Market, accentuate the dismantling of sovereign regulation instruments of economies, promote economic dominance and cause divergence and development asymmetries. They are also promoters of tax avoidance and evasion and the transfer of profits to tax havens, privatisations, deregulation of trade relations and capital concentration. The Single Market has eclipsed propagated concepts such as convergence, cooperation and solidarity, deepening neoliberalism. In his name and the famous competitiveness, the attack on workers' rights, social inequalities, labor deregulation, wage devaluation and wage devaluation of labor was promoted, and more redistributive and fair erredistributive fiscal policies were destroyed or contradicted.  Citing so-called concerns such as lack of growth, high levels of unemployment, the inability to finance SMEs and the very low levels of investment, the European Commission shuffles and re-launched the Single Market Strategy.  Unlike most, we firmly reject it. It serves capitalist objectives of further deepening the concentration of wealth in the major powers and economic groups, makes it standard for deregulation, liberalisation and exploitation in the economies of the Member States, imposing a single socio-economic model on peoples and workers, contrary to their interests, rights and legitimate aspirations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1863, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Harald Vilimsky (ENF)", "mepid": "125001", "text": "  Writing.

I did not agree with the European Parliament's resolution on the strategy for the internal market. The report points out that the creation of the internal market, which ensures the free movement of goods, people, services and capital, is a fundamental objective of the Union. It stresses the need to remove the remaining barriers in the internal market in order to achieve tangible and rapid results in terms of competitiveness, sustainable growth, research, innovation, job creation, consumer choice and new business models. However, the report considers that, in order to achieve these objectives, efforts should be made, where necessary and appropriate, to strengthen the harmonisation of legislation. That is the wrong way to go. Rules should not be harmonised, nor is it necessary to create an internal market.

I appreciate that in recent years, very important steps have been taken in various areas during the term of office of the Barroso Commission. On the other hand, the current situation forces us to take an even more pragmatic and decisive stance. I believe that the European Parliament can make a significant contribution to making the single market strategy more ambitious, through proposals in individual areas. Parliament should also concentrate its efforts on creating a more modern and innovative, stronger and fairer market. Personally, I believe that political priorities should be to strengthen the competitiveness of businesses (and, consequently, increase employment), as well as better enforcement, better regulation and the promotion of consumer protection.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1867, "date": "2016-05-26.json", "name": "Kosma Złotowski (ECR)", "mepid": "124884", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. \\u2012 The Single Market is one of the few indisputable achievements of European integration which, in the face of many of the crises affecting the EU today, is an example of the success of the cooperation model adopted by the Member States. Creating a level playing field and non-discriminatory rules for the functioning of economic operators in all Member States is a historic opportunity for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to catch up economically with their Western European partners.  The world is constantly changing and the shape of the single market, designed in its current form in the early 1990s, must also change. The growing role of SMEs in the European economy or the digital revolution are issues that we need to better include in the definition of the Single Market. Strengthening the principle of the free movement of goods and services should be one of the priorities of the current European Commission. This is particularly important in the context of actions taken by countries such as Germany and France, which are hitting the freedom of transport companies to operate Polish. The Commission's proposed amendments to the Posted Workers Directive, which may restrict the freedoms of the Single Market, are also of concern. There should be no consent to such actions.

On the subject of the sharing economy, which is already aware that it must safeguard the legitimate interests of those operating in the market, the Commission is asked to coordinate and manage the needs of this new market so as not to allow regulatory fragmentation to prevent society from reaping the full potential benefits.  I have fought for the Commission to establish a system of protection based on geographical indications for non-agri-food products. A system that will allow the excellence of our continent to see its peculiarities recognized and to be recognized as a competitive advantage over low-cost products from emerging economies.
