After the proposal made by President Tusk yesterday, the European Council will discuss and agree a set of arrangements to address the concerns of the United Kingdom as set out by Prime Minister Cameron. However, given the urgency of the refugee crisis, EU leaders will also assess progress in implementation of earlier decisions and address any immediate issues ahead. The meeting will also take a new step forward in the European Semester 2016 with the examination of the recommendation for the euro area, so a recommendation for the euro area as a whole. First, the United Kingdom. I think we all agree that the upcoming EU referendum in the United Kingdom is a political event of the first order for both United Kingdom citizens and the rest of Europe. It will be up to the British people to make their choice. In this light, the current negotiations mark an important step in securing the UK’s long-term relationship with the European Union, and although there may be difficult issues at the table it is of paramount importance that we continue our constructive dialogue to make the European Union work better for both the United Kingdom and all other Member States. Building on the fruitful discussion held at the December 2015 meeting, EU leaders will explore solutions to address the concerns raised by the UK Prime Minister in November. All involved have shown a readiness to work hard towards a mutually-satisfactory solution. I believe it is in our common interest to adequately respond to the United Kingdom’s concerns in a way that benefits all of the EU Member States and institutions, and of course with full respect for the European Union’s fundamental principles. As you know, yesterday the President of the European Council put forward a proposal for a new settlement of the United Kingdom within the European Union. It covers all four areas of economic governance, competitiveness, sovereignty, and social benefits and free movement. This proposal will be discussed later this week and next week by EU ‘sherpas’ and permanent representatives. Your Parliament will be represented at these meetings. Obviously it is first and foremost for the heads of state of the European Council to decide on the President’s proposal. Therefore, I cannot comment on this in detail today. All governments will now study the proposals; yet I do believe that it paves the way, this discussion, for an agreement in the European Council. Further discussions are of course needed and some of the issues are particularly complex, but I am sure a solution can be found if there is ample political will. The Council looks forward to working with Parliament as a partner in the follow-up of what we hope will be a good outcome of the discussions at the European Council for the European Union as a whole. Ultimately though, the final decision will not be in our hands. It will be for the British people to decide whether the United Kingdom should remain in the Union. You had a long and comprehensive debate on migration yesterday. I think it was a good debate. It is indeed essential to make progress on this key issue which is mobilising all our institutions. The Presidency, the Commission and the EEAS will report on progress before the European Council meeting. You showed the urgency of this matter yesterday. You took a number of important decisions last year. Implementation of these decisions is now our priority and many of you have repeatedly made that point as well and again yesterday. Further developing a policy to secure the borders is of crucial importance. We should also make full use of the tools at our disposal to ensure humanitarian assistance where needed. The Presidency is fully committed to ensuring that we improve on the results achieved so far. The central issues remain well-functioning hotspots which are crucial in our efforts to address the migration flows; progress in relocation and resettlement; coordinated efforts between institutions and Member States – this is crucial, in particular to engage with key countries of origin and transit on all aspects of migration, including return and readmissions. We are engaged with Turkey to implement on both sides joint action plan commitments. Agreement should now be carried out fast. As President Tusk and Prime Minister Rutte stated at the last plenary, it is also crucial that we get Europe’s borders under control. Work in the Council has therefore started rapidly on the Commission border package proposals presented in December. The Presidency is committed to ensuring the best and closest possible cooperation with Parliament on these proposals. We are convinced that they must lead to tangible results as soon as possible. The February European Council will be an opportunity to take stock of the situation in all areas and to address immediate issues ahead of the upcoming European Councils. Finally, the February European Council will examine the recommendation on the economic policy of the euro area as part of the European Semester 2016. You have discussed the matter several times, notably last December in the presence of Eurogroup President Dijsselbloem. As you know, for the first time, this examination will take place in February rather than in June. We welcome this innovation proposed by the Commission as part of efforts to improve and streamline the European Semester. The new timing means the discussions on individual Member States will be informed by challenges common to the euro area. The European Council in March will, as usual, discuss priorities for the 2016 exercise and provide guidance to Member States. I thank you very much for your attention and look forward to our debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "President of the Commission. - Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the next European Council will be devoted to two questions which crystallize many concerns about the future of Europe: the question of refugees and that of the United Kingdom. Our conclusions will be scrutinized closely, while many observers abound every day in comments which are sub-categorized, roughly speaking, between those who claim that, from psychodrama to psychodrama, Europe is gradually falling apart and those who expect from European leaders a burst of energy, foresight and long-term vision. It will be up to us to prove the former wrong and give hope to the latter, starting with our management of the refugee crisis, about which everything has already been said, but where much remains to be done. For that, we have to pull ourselves together, because, for the moment, we have nothing to be proud of our collective performance. The refugee crisis is turning more and more every day into a crisis of European solidarity where there is a need for more coordination, cooperation and union. If I decided last year to bring together around the same table the leaders of the countries affected by the migratory flows on the Western Balkans route, it was so that they finally talk to each other, that they understand. better than the problems of some are also the problems of others. Since then, a process of virtuous cooperation and regular exchanges has taken place. Blaming each other for not doing enough or doing it badly gets nowhere and gets nowhere. We have a joint responsibility in the face of these challenges and it is this shared responsibility that must be put into action by all. Everyone must respect the common rules, in particular the rules concerning Schengen. There is only one way to save Schengen: we must apply all these rules. We will save Schengen by applying Schengen. (Laughter from the British EFDD members) I am happy to contribute to your good humor. This is why the proper functioning of the Schengen evaluation mechanism is a priority for the Commission: not to punish where deficiencies are observed, but to quickly define corrective measures. This is what is happening with Greece, where visits made last November to the sea and land borders between Greece and Turkey revealed serious shortcomings, which Greece must absolutely remedy. It is not a question of isolating Greece - as some say -. That does not make sense. If I have never considered a Eurozone Grexit, it is not to consider a Schengen Grexit. Neither is it a question of stigmatizing the Greeks, who are subject to very strong migratory pressure and whose numerous gestures of individual solidarity with regard to refugees we too quickly forget, as well as the lives that have been saved from the drowning, again in recent days, thanks to Greek rescuers. It is not a question of isolating or stigmatizing the Greeks but of helping Greece to respect its obligations by helping it to correct the failings which may exist. This is what the Commission has already done, in particular through significant financial assistance and logistical support on the spot. Since last December and in response to Greece's request, Frontex has deployed a rapid response team to the external border of the Aegean Islands. Frontex is also helping Greece identify and register migrants at the border with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. While further efforts on the part of Greece are clearly essential, their scope will remain limited until the other Member States apply the decisions that have already been taken, in particular as regards the reinforcement of staff for the proper functioning of the centers reception and registration and acceleration of relocation. The scope of these efforts will remain limited until we create a European corps of border and coast guards. It is the responsibility of all of us to help protect our common external borders in a more optimal way if we want to avoid seeing internal borders reintroduced on a lasting basis in Europe. It is obvious that the control of refugee flows and the future of the Schengen area are not only played out in Europe, between Europeans, but also beyond our common borders with our partners in third countries. On the issue of readmissions, it must be clear to everyone that we are going to step up our efforts to ensure that all those who do not qualify for international protection are returned promptly. As regards, in particular, the return of irregular migrants from Greece to Turkey, until the readmission agreement between the European Union and Turkey enters into force, the Commission stands ready to work closely with the Greek and Turkish authorities, in order to speed up these returns within the framework of the bilateral agreement existing between these two countries. It is essential to strengthen our return policy across Europe: it is an essential element in restoring the confidence of our citizens in our management of refugee flows and in devoting our energy and resources to those who have right to international protection. Herr President, es kommt selbstverständlich in erheblichem Maße darauf an, dass wir den Aktionsplan mit der Türkei mit Leben erfüllen. Die türkischen Behörden haben jüngst der Kommission versichert, dass sie alles tun werden, um die eingegangenen Verpflichtungen einzuhalten und gegen Schlepperbanden zu kämpfen und um die illegale Einwanderung zu kontrollieren. Aber auch wir müssen unsere Verpflichtungen, die wir gegenüber der Türkei eingegangen sind, erfüllen. Die Türkei beherbergt auf ihrem Staatsgebiet nahezu drei Millionen Flüchtlinge, und es ist deshalb eine ausgemachte Sache, dass die drei Milliarden Hilfe für die syrischen Flüchtlinge in der Türkei von der Europäischen Union undes ist deshalb eine ausgemachte Sache, dass die drei Milliarden Hilfe für die syrischen Flüchtlinge in der Türkei von der Europäischen Union undentüdenat den Mitiedung. Ich begrüße es ausdrücklich, dass die Italienische Regierung sich inzwischen auch zu dieser notwendigen Solidarleistung bekannt hat. Es ist ein wichtiges Anliegen der Europäischen Kommission, alles zu tun, damit die Flüchtlinge möglichst nahe an ihren Herkunftsländern leben können. Deshalb müssen wir die Länder, die den Flüchtlingen zur Seite stehen, nicht nur unter die Arme greifen, Sondern ihnen tätige Solidarität zuteil werden lassen. Dies gilt nicht nur für die Türkei, dies gilt auch für Jordanien und für den Libanon, die sich in einem sehr erheblichen Maße und viel stärker als wir mit den Folgen der syrischen Kriegsauseinandersetzungen auseinandersetzen müssen. Diese Länder, Jordanien und Libanon, haben die höchste Flüchtlingsdichte, die es zurzeit weltweit zu beobachten gibt. Und es ist so, dass sich diese Länder gefährlich dem Sättigungsgrad nähern; das dürfen wir nicht aus den Augen verlieren. Das gesamte Problem - Flüchtlinge hier und dort, auch Flüchtlinge in Griechenland - hat natürlich mit den kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen in Syrien zu tun. Solange es uns und der internationalen Völkergemeinschaft nicht gelingt, den Krieg in Syrien zu beenden, solange werden wir mit den Folgen dieses Krieges leben müssen. Deshalb hat die Kommission auch ab Januar die humanitären Konvois nach Madaja kofinanziert. Aber es gibt viele Madajas und es gibt hunderte Orte in Syrien, in denen Menschen sterben, weil Hilfe sie nicht erreicht. Dies können wir so nicht hinnehmen. Wir haben einen Treuhandfonds für Syrien aufgelegt. Die Kommission hat 500 Millionen Euro Finanzmittel zur Verfügung gestellt, und die Mitgliedstaaten sollten das Gleiche tun, haben es aber bis jetzt nicht getan. Es fehlen auf der Seite der Mitgliedstaaten immer noch 448 von 500 Millionen Euro. Dies kann so nicht bleiben. Ähnliches gilt für den Dringlichkeitsfonds, den wir für Afrika aufgelegt haben. Die Kommission hat hier geliefert, in gemeinsamer Anstrengung mit dem Europäischen Parlament. Die Mitgliedstaaten haben das bislang nicht getan. Dies muss schnellstens nachgeholt werden. Symptombekämpfung ist wichtig, weil es um die Erleichterung für das Leben der betroffenen Menschen geht. Aber Ursachenbekämpfung ist wichtiger. Wir müssen beides tun: Hilfe vor Ort aber auch Ursachenbekämpfung. Yesterday, President Tusk presented his proposed new settlement for the United Kingdom in the European Union. Let me be clear from the start: the European Commission has been fully associated with the work on this settlement. The Commission’s best experts have worked over many months to find creative solutions. I have worked closely with President Tusk and Prime Minister Cameron to shape the proposal presented yesterday. Therefore, the Commission supports this text. I have always said that I want the UK to remain a member of the European Union on the basis of a fair deal. The settlement that has been proposed is fair for the UK and fair for the other 27 Member States. It is also fair for the European Parliament. The European Parliament has a key say in the process and a crucial role to play. Many of your Members have been involved already. I salute the contributions of President Schulz, Manfred Weber, Gianni Pittella, Syed Kamall and Guy Verhofstadt, amongst others. As of Friday, your ‘sherpas’ will take part in discussions leading to the decisive European Council of 18 February. President Schulz will be sitting at the table in the European Council. All understand that the European Parliament must be fully signed up to the new settlement. If the citizens of the UK deliver a positive verdict, you will be called upon to deliver crucial legislative elements on the settlement. I will not take you through the main elements of the settlement. That is, by the way, a duty for the President of the European Council and not so much for the President of the European Commission. However, like Prime Minister Cameron, we all want the European Union to become more competitive and to create more jobs. We must not stifle innovation and competitiveness with regulations that are too prescriptive and too detailed, notably when it comes to small and medium-sized enterprises. That is why the Commission has shortened and streamlined its Annual Work Programs, withdrawing a greater number of legislative acts than it proposes. That is why it is so important, as the Commission and the Dutch Presidency are saying, to complete the single market, to build our Energy Union, to complete the Digital Single Market and to establish a Capital Markets Union. This is the program of the European Commission, and I appreciate the support of the United Kingdom in this respect. The settlement proposed by President Tusk recognizes that not all Member States participate in all areas of EU policy. The UK benefits from more protocols and opt-outs than any other Member State. This is why, as a matter of law and as a matter of fact, the concept of ever closer union has already assumed a different meaning in its case. The settlement recognizes that if the United Kingdom considered that it is now at the limits of its level of integration, then that is fine. At the same time, it makes clear that other Member States can move towards a deeper degree of integration as they see fit. In this way, we have addressed the prime ministers concerned while respecting the Treaties. I advocated, from the start of my election campaign, that national parliaments should play a greater role in our democratic system. I included this pledge in the political guidelines, on the basis of which you elected this Commission. The settlement presented yesterday provides for this. Monsieur the President, I wish to preserve the integrity of the internal market while deepening our Economic and Monetary Union. The agreement proposed by President Tusk respects these two imperatives. President Tusk's proposals aim to protect the legitimate interests of Member States participating in the internal market without being members of the euro area. It is legitimate to give these Member States the opportunity to refer the matter to the European Council if they consider that the principle of non-discrimination could be violated. It is legitimate to remove these Member States from financial responsibility linked to measures taken to ensure the stability of the euro area. At the same time, the red line - the possibility of having more Europe within the euro zone, in order to strengthen the single currency - has been respected. The euro remains the single currency of the Union and the European Parliament remains the Parliament of the euro area and of the Union as a whole. As you know, the most difficult discussions we had with our British colleagues related to free movement. The settlement addresses situations in which large-scale movements of EU nationals are related not to the attractiveness of labor markets but to the structure and the generosity of social security systems. We propose to create a safeguard mechanism, tailor-made to the concerns of the United Kingdom, that would allow it to restrict the access of EU workers newly entering its labor market to in-work benefits in a graduated manner for a period of up to four years. The duration of the mechanism will be limited in time. That is a crucial characteristic of a safeguard mechanism, necessary in order to make it compatible with the Treaties. It will apply in exceptional cases, as all derogations from the Four Freedoms should. In 2004, the UK did not use the transitional periods that would have allowed it to phase in the right to free movement of the citizens of eight new Member States. As a result, over the past decade the UK has attracted a record number of mobile EU citizens. In effect, we will enable the United Kingdom to use the safeguard mechanism to address the consequences of that decision. In einem Wort wie in tausend: Die Tagesordnung des Europäischen Rates für die übernächste Woche ist dicht gefüllt. Ich weiß, dass ich wie immer auf die tatkräftige Unterstützung das Europäischen Parlaments zählen kann, wenn es darum geht, als Kommission, aber nicht nur als Kommission, europäische Interessen vorrangig zu behandeln. (Beifall)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Gentlemen Presidents, dear colleagues! The goal is clear, also for my group, the European People's Party: we want the UK to stay on board, we want to convince the people of Great Britain that it is better to stand together as a family. Therefore I would like to thank Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and also David Cameron for the efforts of the last weekend. Respect to David Cameron! He fought hard for British interests. As the EPP Group, we do not want a British Europe; we want a proposal that will make Europe better for everyone. That must be the focus of the deliberations that will be held over the next few weeks. Our group fully supports the issues of better regulation, less bureaucracy, more competitiveness, including the euro. Thank you for making it clear that the euro is the currency of Europe, but that we are improving the coexistence of currencies and that Great Britain is also prepared to support the deepening of monetary union, even if it does not concern itself or itself Put away. These are positive aspects. In all honesty, there is one point that the President of the Commission pointed out and that we knew would be the most difficult, and that is the issue of free movement, the fight against abuse of welfare systems. The balance is difficult. It is difficult to explain why citizens who work in Great Britain, EU citizens who work there, who pay taxes there, who contribute to insurance there, like every British person who works there, should be denied access to certain welfare systems. On the other hand, we understand that there are also elements of abuse that we find and have in all countries of the European Union. Finding this balance is one of the most difficult subject areas. I can promise the EPP Group that we will support the next talks constructively and that we want a solution in the end. We want a result in these negotiations. But that is admittedly the most difficult area. Cameron fought hard now. But I believe that leadership is now also required to go one step further. What is the British question actually about? Is it really about child benefit, is it really about the issues of the working time directive, bureaucracy issues? For the British, I think it is about something completely different, namely whether in times of globalization it is better to stand alone or to stand together in the European family. When we see Putin imperialism - is it better for Britain to stand alone or be part of the family? When we see the TTIP negotiations with America - is it better to negotiate alone or to negotiate Europe as a large economic area? When we see the questions of the City of London, access to euro laws - is it better to be out of Europe or better to be in and have a say? Those are the questions that citizens have to answer. And I believe that people can be convinced: If you are a good patriot, if you love your country, then in a globalized world it is better to be a patriot in Europe. The second big issue is the general mood in the European Council. Today I would like to make a general shout, because perhaps the European Council should introduce a new item on the agenda, namely \"The future of the European Council\", as one sees the institution in the first place. It has become a meeting of the fearful, it has become a meeting of the despondent, it has become a meeting of politicians who unfortunately get stuck in the small, in national egoism, on the question of \"Will I be re-elected or not?\" secret mood, that you might even be happy when another head of government sometimes has problems and maybe fails at home. That is the mood we have there. That is why the council should look at itself and what its job actually is. If you see previous generations of politicians in the European Council, then they had the courage to take decisions on the internal market - overcoming a lot of obstacles, but creating millions of jobs - they had the courage to create the Schengen area - many, many worries and Overcoming resistance and creating a future for Europe - they had the courage to get the euro off the ground - a historic decision with the question that we have one of the world's leading currencies on this continent - and they had the courage to To overcome the division of this continent, to manage the reunification of Europe in the last decades. It all took courage. That meant that you sometimes stand up against populists and show leadership. That is why this generation of politicians, who will meet again in Brussels in two weeks' time, really has the question of whether they can build on these historic decisions of the European Council. I see more of a historical failure in many areas that we unfortunately have to attest to God. And so my plea, my great plea to the Council, is to take the lead and move forward in our times of responsibility today. Dear Colleagues! Finally, I would like to address one point that moves us internally, namely the question of the reform course in economic policy. One thing I am concerned about is that we are getting more and more governments at the national level who are doing common cause with extreme forces, that it is not democrats who work together, but extremists. In Portugal we have seen that unfortunately God's parties, which completely reject NATO and the EU, are now responsible. In Spain there are unfortunately God's tendencies that separatists, national separatists who want the division of Spain, can take responsibility. That is why I appeal to everyone: We must take responsibility at all levels - in Europe and at national level. Democrats have to stick together so that Europe has a bright future!

Unfortunately, today in Europe the wind is not good. The neo-Nazi raids in Sweden and Germany in recent days, the shameful calls from political leaders to shoot refugees, even children: all this tells us that a virus has infected Europe, the virus of fear. Jean-Claude Juncker spoke of psychodrama. No country, no political party is immune to this virus. Too many taboos have been broken in recent months: Schengen, the duty of humanitarian assistance, respect for human life. And so today this House no longer has only the duty to discuss technical solutions to respond to the migrant crisis. There are solutions, the European Commission has put them correctly on the table. We already have measures to strengthen external border controls, identification with hotspots, redistribution in all European countries. But this system does not work and does not work because it is blocked by selfishness, by fears, by electoral calculations. So the problem is political and cultural. Selfishness, fear and nationalistic calculations would never have led to the construction of the European Union. So, if we want to give effective answers, we have to change the direction of the wind and start from the values. It is the blackmail of the populists that prevents too many governments from assuming their responsibilities. Instead of talking about issues that frankly have little to do with this debate - the reference to Spain and Portugal frankly seems to me a pretext given that in Spain and Portugal the political leadership always march in the direction of strengthening European integration, on this there are no doubts - let's focus instead on the real dangers, we do not mislead, we do not miss the goal, otherwise we divide ourselves and play the game of others. We have a duty to clearly tell our citizens that it is a moral duty to welcome those who flee the barbarism of ISIS and that we will do everything to ensure that those who arrive here can integrate, speak our language and find a job, because this is the only answer. that works. And we must clearly say that Schengen is the solution to this crisis and not the problem. So let the European Commission go ahead on the immigration package and also on the Dublin review. As for the UK, Tusk's letter can provide useful clarifications on the UK's role in the Union. During the negotiation we may ask for some further clarifications especially on the issue of workers' rights, on which our concern is great, but it must be clear that our commitment as socialists and democrats of the European Parliament is for the United Kingdom to remain in the Union. European. It is essential for the European Union and, as Jean-Claude Juncker said, it is essential for the United Kingdom. The UK outside the European Union is weaker. It is in the interest of British citizens, especially weaker citizens of the UK, to remain in the European Union. We will have to be able to speak the language of clarity with regard to the advantages and benefits that British citizens have from their stay in the European Union. Only if we rediscover our values, the values ​​that brought us here as representatives of the largest democratic forum in the European Union, will we be able to resolve our crisis. Here this is my appeal.

As we stood here in this Parliament and considered the implications of those ‘No’ votes, I was shocked by the number of MEPs who simply wanted to ignore the results and push on with further European integration. But perhaps the most shocking moment for me was when the then leader of the PPE Group stood up and said: ‘nothing must be allowed to get in the way of the European project. Nothing must be allowed to get in the way of European political integration. Nothing must be allowed to get in the way of European economic integration.’ As a British MEP, the belief in the European project, where the eventual goal was to build a United States of Europe or a Federal Republic of Europe, was news to me. There and then, I realised that there was a massive gap in the perception between many in EU institutions who believe in this European project, and the people of Britain, many of whom tell me that they believe that they voted to stay in a common market. Reading more about the history of the EU, I realised that the political dimension of the EU has been played down by politicians of all parties in the UK for the last 40 years. It is still being played down. In my first few weeks here in Parliament I was approached by a British MEP who asked me to join a cross-party group – a cross-party federal group – to support the European project. When I asked him: have you told your voters this? I found out he was saying one thing here and a different thing in his constituency. So unless this gap in perceptions is resolved, the UK will continue to have an ambiguous relationship with the EU. This is why David Cameron was absolutely right to call this referendum to give the British people a say, because we should never be afraid to ask the people what they want and then to stick by the outcome. A large number of voters I speak to say that they do not yet know how to vote and that they will wait to see the details of the deal. Rather like going to a shop and someone promising you a great deal in a couple of weeks and asking you to commit now: they want to read the small print. Donald Tusk’s letter to the European Council and his draft proposals are a good place to start on the four areas set out by the British Prime Minister: mutual respect between euro area and non-euro area countries; the EU becoming more competitive by opening the single market, cutting red tape and increasing global trade; ever closer union not applying to all countries, with national parliaments playing a larger role; and freedom of movement to work, and not to claim, and those people who move should only get something out of the system once they have put something in. It is hard to see how these are just British questions. These are matters that should benefit all European Union countries. For the next few weeks we will see a lot of travel, a lot of papers being read, a lot of persuading being done. And as the Council seeks a final deal, and once a deal is done, the real debate begins. Because for this referendum to be meaningful, it needs a full, frank and honest debate, with both sides being clear what remaining in the EU means and what leaving the EU could mean for Britain and for the EU. Those of you who want to build your project of a United States of Europe, come to Britain and tell the British people if that is what you believe. Do not hide your views until after the referendum. Mr Verhofstadt is an example, as you say. But at the end of the day it does not matter what we say, it does not matter what Donald Tusk or David Cameron says, it does not matter what politicians on both sides of this debate may say, it does not matter what we say in the European Parliament or what they say in the Westminster Parliament.

Mr Koenders, I am pleased that now – at the request of the Commission – the refugee crisis will be the main topic on the agenda of the summit on 18 and 19 February 2016 because, despite the importance of the British issue, let us be honest, the refugee crisis we are facing is far more important. We have to show our citizens that we are capable of solving this. Mr Koenders and Mr Juncker, my request to you is to put two proposals on the table on 18 February. First of all, regarding the rapid response force: why not, using Article 78(3) of the Treaty, advance the European Border and Coastguard? We can do that without a change of legislation. We can also immediately start to send the 2 000 civil servants from the national border agencies. Mr Juncker, the Commission’s latest report said that there was a disaster on the border between Greece and Turkey. Four of the five hotspots are not there. There is no fingerprinting control and there is no appropriate registration. Those are not my findings but the findings of the Commission. So my proposal is to do that, to propose Article 78 as the basis to launch this rapid response force immediately. Secondly, let us also consider the idea that the EUR 3 billion will now be directed as financial assistance to the people in the refugee camps instead of giving it to the Turkish Government. I completely agree with Mr Weber when he says that if the Council is not capable now of taking such decisions in such a situation, then we have to ask ourselves: why have we created the European Council? In the Treaty, it says that all strategic options are a competence of the European Council. You are not capable of taking strategic options. You demonstrate and illustrate that every time. I hope I am wrong; I hope that Mr Weber is wrong and that the European Council will surprise us this time by taking decisions that really make a difference. That brings me to the official topic of the summit: the request of the United Kingdom to renegotiate its position. Let me be very clear: it would be a huge mistake for Britain to leave the European Union. Not so much economically, Mr Kamall, but most of all geopolitically. I think Britain without Europe will be a dwarf. Let us be honest, we Belgians know that we are dwarves, but maybe they will know it too. On the other hand, Europe without Great Britain does not count and is not a counterweight against China, against Russia and against the United States. In fact, Mr Kamall, it is Putin who will win in this game in the end, because Putin likes a divided Europe. Mr Farage and Mr Putin: they are the ones who want a divided Europe. I am very sympathetic to David Cameron’s request with the aim of reforming Europe. The question is only whether the paper we received yesterday from Mr Tusk is really what we need.  In any case, I do not have so much of a problem with the four points, but only with one of the four points. That is the point, Mr Koenders, that, in my opinion, you have to completely rewrite – in the days to come in the ‘sherpa’ meetings, and in the European Council – the part where Mr Tusk says that an ever closer union is not an ever closer union. That is in the text. It has nothing to do with sharing values; it has nothing to do with more political integration. I think I should tell you that Magritte and surrealism were not only part of Belgian culture, but I can now see that it is also a part of Polish culture and of Mr Tusk’s culture. You know that painting of Magritte’s where we show a pipe and then we put in French ‘Ceci n’est pas une pipe’? It is little like that in this proposal of Mr Tusk’s. An ever closer union is not an ever closer union. In one page, he explained what the difference is. I have to tell you that, not only is it in contradiction with Article 352 of the Treaty, but I think that it is perhaps better to have another option. Instead of really destroying our project of political integration in one page, why is it not better to give a new opt-out to Britain? They have an opt-out on Schengen; they have an opt-out on the euro; they have opt-out on police coordination. They have an opt-out on at least seven different elements today. Well, create another opt-out. The reality is that we have a two-tier Europe today. Okay, if they want another opt-out, I think that is better than to do the opposite and to destroy the idea of an ever-closer union, because Britain has to stay. No, I think it is better to be honest with the people and to create an additional opt-out. Finally, on the emergency brake: this will be discussed in the normal legislative procedure. However, let us be honest, Mr Juncker, I hope that this is the last time. We got an emergency brake from Mr Sarkozy on Schengen. Maybe tomorrow, Mr Renzi will ask for one for the Stability Pact, and maybe the day after tomorrow Mr François Hollande will ask for one for the internal market. I think that is enough. Okay, give Mr Cameron his emergency brake, but then stop destroying the Union with emergency brakes in all directions.

The upcoming summit has the two tasks that have already been mentioned today, namely to talk about the overall position of the Member States on the negotiating package that was drawn up with a view to the referendum in Great Britain and, secondly, the refugee issue. And I think in both the central point is actually the question of the future of the European Union. How do we imagine this? And how do we answer them? Will the decisions that have been taken there be practically unilateral preliminary decisions that will shape the future path of the European Union? Namely the question of the extent to which the citizens of the European Union can continue to identify with this project. And then I would like to begin with the proposal that was put on the table and reached us yesterday. I think a basic criticism must be: if we want more democracy in the European Union, then it cannot be that essential decisions are made practically outside of the formal framework that the European Union offers. You said earlier, Mr Juncker, and also the representative of the Dutch Presidency: the European Parliament is involved. I think that's great! I just don't find a single word about the European Parliament in the documents submitted by Mr Tusk - not a word! The European Parliament does not matter! And it was said earlier that the European Parliament will be included in the follow-up process - great! When the decisions have been made, then we can participate and, Mr Juncker, the European Parliament is not just made up of individual gentlemen, whom you mentioned earlier, and a few political groups. The European Parliament and the Parliament's position-building emerge from a joint discussion, and there is a lack of that. But if that is to open the door to how decisions will be made about the Union in the future, then we will continue to lose credibility. That has nothing to do with the fact that citizens have the feeling that we are asked here and that we have to represent the interests of the European Union here. And the second point I have to make: the idea of ​​social union is being buried. This is clear to me after what I've read here. This is not a compromise that has been offered, it is the kneeling before the City of London that we are getting here. And I don't know whether everyone is really aware of what it means if I only turn one of the four fundamental freedoms into half. If I make it clear in principle: Dear people, especially when it comes to the question of mobility, the demand “equal pay for the same work in the same place”, we will make a difference in the future - what does that mean for future social development, for employment protection Great Britain, but also in the other Member States? We are making an opt-out on a path where everyone can choose what they want in the future. And we are already stipulating that these changes - and also very democratically - will be included in the next treaty change. And when the point is that we want to exert an influence and want to make it clear that there is added value, also for the citizens of Great Britain, to remain in the European Union, then it is a terrible mistake if we are precisely concerned with the social question start big dismantling. Because some will look at it. Don't just look at those representing the City of London!

But since it is about the European Union it matters for all of us, and I sometimes do not know whether everybody in the United Kingdom is aware of the fact that the result of the vote will matter for millions of citizens across the European Union. So you decide in the United Kingdom, but it is very important that you know that the majority of citizens across the European Union – not only the Germans – want the UK to stay in the European Union. So how can we have an honest exchange on this issue between the citizens in the UK and in the European Union? We recently held discussions on Poland, before that we discussed Hungary, and before that we had years of discussions on the values of the European Union in the context of Greece and the euro crisis. For me it is again one of those moments where we have really to talk about Europe: where we came from, for example. And the answer is very simple: we really came from war, and we achieved peace. And so looking to the east, looking to the south, looking to our neighbourhoods, do not forget what we achieved, where we are. So looking to the Minsk Agreement, looking to the Iran deal and looking to the climate deal achieved in Paris recently, European strength is visible again and again. And let us look to challenges still ahead: Syria, growing terrorism, soon probably hundreds of millions of refugees globally. So what are you really saying in the UK? Do you think you will deal with all those challenges better outside of the European Union? Some Members shout but, I am sorry, shouting is not at all about arguments. Yesterday my colleague, Mr Smith, from the UK, from Scotland, said let us look at the wood and not only the trees. So let us become serious about what keeps us together. I have an idea; I do not know whether it is too small an idea – it is maybe not convincing. When I go home to my region – and I cannot go often – I sit together with my neighbours, I have a cup of tea and we talk about our gardens and about Europe. So let us be honest: there must be more exchange between the citizens of the UK and us. So invite us for this famous cup of tea. Let us create possibilities before the vote to talk about lilies and about roses. I like to do it as a gardener, and I really appreciate the British as a nation of gardeners.

They are slightly over enthusiastic. It was not supposed to be like this, was it? Mr Cameron’s renegotiation began with really big intentions: Treaty change – blue cards going up already, this is going to be fun!  – he was going to control the free movement of people, he was going to achieve a fundamental change, not just in Britain’s relationship with the European Union, but he was going to reform the EU itself. What we got was a letter from Mr Tusk in which there is no Treaty change, no powers returned to the United Kingdom and no control over our borders at all. In fact, it was hardly worth the wait. It is really rather pathetic. But there is one more chance for the Prime Minister, because he goes to the European summit in a couple of weeks’ time. Like Oliver Twist, he will parade in front of the other leaders and say, ‘please can we have some more concessions?’ I find it rather humiliating that a British prime minister has to do this, but I am certain of one thing: he will not get another thing. Just look at the substance of this: we have an emergency brake on migrant benefits. Wow! It was supposed to be a total ban on migrant benefits for up to four years, so it is hardly an emergency brake. It is more of a handbrake turn. Also, the Prime Minister is saying we have got a red card. Isn’t that wonderful! Well, what that means is that a majority of parliaments in the European Union can say to Mr Juncker that they do not want one of his directives. Is that a cause for celebration? If 15 parliaments could not stop a piece of law, we would be living in a communist dictatorship. What I have gone through here are the good bits, but the most bizarre thing is that Mr Cameron said that with this deal, he would now vote for Britain to join the European Union. So let us have a little think about that. If the question in June is: ‘should we join the European Union?’ we would have to tell the British people: ‘you must surrender the control and sovereignty of your parliament and have 75% of your laws made somewhere else. Your Supreme Court will not be supreme. You will be overruled by a Court in Luxembourg made up of people who are not even judges. You will have to give up your fishing grounds, including in some places 200 miles of the North Sea, and you must cut your links with the Commonwealth and the wider world because you are no longer fit to negotiate your own global trade deals. Oh, and by the way, for all of this you will be paying GBP 55 million a day as a membership fee.’ Would the British people vote for that? Not a snowball’s chance in Hades. All we have to do is recognise that, whilst the politicians and the big banks and the big businesses will in this referendum defend their own vested self-interests, it is people power that will win this referendum. After we have won this referendum, I hope that it will win in many other countries in Europe too.

I want to remind you that it was under the presidency of a socialist government that Spain entered the European Union; a Government led by Felipe González, one of those leaders that you yourself, this morning, have claimed as necessary for the European Union to take on its near future with ambition. Now I want to point out that an important topic of this meeting, of course, is the subject of immigration. A fortnight ago, both the Council and the Commission pointed out that we only had two months to solve this problem. Two weeks have passed, a quarter of the time of the countdown we have to face. Have there been changes? Has there been progress? Have the measures previously adopted been applied? The answer is no. Yesterday we had Commissioner Avramopoulos here, who told us that in the month of January there have been more admissions, there have been more deaths.

They say Britain is too small to take a leading role in the EU and that we are constantly pushed around, and then they claim that outside the EU we would be a world leader, taking on the rest of the world. This is a complete contradiction. We know that Britain can only play a bigger role in the world by playing a bigger role in the EU. Britain has always been an influential member of the European Union. In the 1980s the UK led the creation of the single market, which has increased competitiveness across the EU and increased British-EU trade by 55%. Only in the EU can we get the best deal for British consumers, driving down prices and allowing British businesses to grow and prosper with our neighbours. Being part of the EU is better for Britain under all circumstances: better for our prosperity, our security and our environment. But the renegotiation should not be only about getting a better deal for the UK but for all the countries in the EU.

By amending the legislation, which will allow the country to use braking mechanisms and prevent workers from other countries from accessing social transfers, it will legalize discrimination and give the green light for different concessions to different countries. Because if we do this in the case of Britain and foreign workers, tomorrow we will be forced to give a discount to, say, Bulgaria in enforcing environmental policy measures or Germany in food safety standards. What will be the limit in the case of the UK with an increased number of migrants? How quickly will the internal market be threatened and how quickly will fundamental human rights be violated? However, the Union operates on these principles. I sincerely want Britain to remain in the Union, but not to satisfy British selective appetites in any way. The UK already has quite a few exceptional rebates anyway - from Schengen to a budget rebate. Because of the latter alone, my country pays at least 30 million euros more into the budget each year, which it could spend, for example, on resolving the migrant crisis.

In fact, when the Prime Minister's chief adviser yesterday compared the European Union to the Soviet Union, everything is said about this government's European convictions.

Ich gebe mir immer Mühe, treu und brav, der ganzen Debatte hier beizuwohnen. Das tun nicht alle Abgeordneten, aber ich gebe mir Mühe, dies zu tun. Mir fällt auf, dass jeder sich darüber beklagt, dass Europa immer nationaler wird, dass die Regierungen sich mit ihren eigenen Problemen beschäftigen statt mit den Problemen Europas. Es werden hier dauernd feierliche Appelle an die Adressen der Regierungen gerichtet, sich endlich wieder auf das Europäische zu besinnen. Alle die, die das sagen, haben Recht. Aber glaubwürdiger wäre es, wenn die Abgeordneten dies auch täten. Ich stelle fest, dass hier fast nur noch innenpolitische Debatten stattfinden. Diejenigen, die zu Hause die Opposition stellen, nutzen das Europäische Parlament, um ihrer Regierung am Zeug zu flicken, und diejenigen, die Regierungspartei in ihren Ländern sind und diese hier vertreten, beschäftigen sich mit den Vorschlenigen der National Oppstosition in. Dies ist nicht das Europäische Parlament, von dem ich mir gewünscht hätte, dass es seine Rolle in Europa spielen würde! Ich werde auch diese Fragen nicht mehr beantworten, denn das sind keine Fragen, die Sie an Rat oder Kommission richten, das sind Scharmützel zwischen Fraktionen, primitive Parteipolitik! Ich bin nicht der Meinung, dass man dies so weiterführen sollte, wie es inzwischen hier eingerissen ist. (Beifall) For the rest, and as I have to deal with the main principles only and not with each other's oratorical games, I will emphasize two or three elements. Some of our colleagues have argued that the Commission should not be concerned with national budgets. This is not true! There is a treaty, there is a growth and stability pact, there are country-by-country recommendations, there are debates within the Eurogroup and the Council, and the Commission must play its full role. . This is true for the budgets the Commission is examining and, in general, for all the budgets to be monitored. The Commission will play its role, without falling into a policy of strict and stupid austerity. It has also introduced some elements of flexibility in terms of the interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact. These elements are more than enough to allow the various Member States, even those grappling with the worst difficulties, to come up with budgets which correspond to all the rules and all the requirements. I will not say anything more about Brexit, because everything has been said. I will allow myself to make just one remark: apart from the representatives of UKIP and other political parties - located rather at the extremes of this Assembly - all the deputies, all the parliamentary groups have constantly pleaded for the maintenance of the United Kingdom into the European Union. If we really want this maintenance, it should come as no surprise that President Tusk, the President of the Commission and a few others have negotiated with the British Prime Minister. The idea that it would suffice to say that the United Kingdom must remain a member of the European Union and at the same time refuse to engage in dialogue with representatives of the British government is an absurd idea. We will have to discuss and speak with the representatives of the United Kingdom if we want the latter to remain in the Union. For the rest, to make things clear, I would like to add that the fact that the United Kingdom will organize a referendum debate, which will be important and of size, should not lead us to cease all other activities of the European Union . During the Greek crisis, we were already very often invited not to do this or that, to abandon such and such an initiative, not to propose such another initiative. The UK will have a democratic debate - to which it is honored - but the Commission will continue its work, which is why, in the field of social policy, we will, over the coming weeks and months, develop a number of initiatives.We will come up with a mobility package, and don't tell us not to do it, because our British friends are discussing it among themselves.We are going to propose a base, a pillar of social rights, launch a wide consultation in March and we will propose amendments to be made to the directive on the posting of workers.It is an absolute necessity and we will do it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 111, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Bert Koenders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for this debate and for the many questions that were raised. It is true that the next European Council will be crucial for very important aspects of the definition of our Union. It will deal with the two elements that determine our collective will to confront common challenges. One is obviously the debate on the United Kingdom, and I will come back to that in a second. It is true, as Mr Weber said, that it requires a certain amount of courage and leadership to deal with these two issues without any cost to discussing the many other challenges in the European Union. The position of the United Kingdom in the European Union, as well as the improved management of the refugee crisis – we talked about that for many hours yesterday – is obviously crucial for the decisions that we will have to make in February. First of all, I think it is important to say that I am encouraged by the level of support that I hear about the type of package that has been proposed by President Tusk. Of course, the devil is in the detail and everything has to be weighed up, but nevertheless I feel a large majority of Parliament here feels that it is in our interest to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union – not at the highest price. But in a reasonable constructive debate, these are important views. You are partners in this; you will be consulted; you have your ‘sherpas’, and you will be part of the Council meetings. Of course, it might involve changes to secondary legislation. Therefore, your role is also essential and your concerns need to be addressed. This package has to be fair not only to the United Kingdom, but also to all citizens in Europe. It is vitally important to underline that in all aspects, including the most complex part, which deals with social benefits. We have to talk about a deeper and a fairer internal market and we will have to see what the conclusions are in the Council discussions in February. Many elements in the package benefit us all – such as more competitiveness and a deeper internal market – but, as I said, fairness is also an important point in this. I would also like to say that it gratifies me to hear Mr Kamall speak. He qualifies this package as at least being a good starting point, and that gives me hope that the negotiations will be constructive. On the issue of ever-closer union, which was mentioned by Mr Verhofstadt, it would not be a good idea for there to be an opt-out for the United Kingdom. I would like to remind you that, in Article 1 of the Treaty, it states very clearly ‘an ever closer union between the peoples of the European Union’. That is what is written in the Treaty. For some it might mean a federal Europe and for others there might be another connotation, but what we do in the draft European Council decision is to clarify that, in itself, it does not offer a legal basis to transfer competences to the European Union. That is a statement of fact, nothing more and nothing less. At the same time, the draft European Council decision states that the Treaties allow for a deeper degree of integration. I think that is your point. So the Treaties do not represent an obstacle to your vision of Europe, but neither do they oblige us to transfer competences. Therefore I do not think that it would be wise to look at an opt—out. On the refugee crisis, I will not take up your time. We discussed it at length yesterday. Regarding Article 78(3), I would say that this is a possibility, but do not forget that at the moment we have a borders package which is being discussed every month in detail to make sure that we come to the quickest agreement on this. The EU Interior Ministers discussed these issues at their informal gathering held in Amsterdam on 25—26 January 2016, and this will continue to be done consecutively. So we do not need the Article to do it more quickly. What you need is the reality on the ground so that we have the right people from the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and Frontex in the hotspots. In conclusion, let me stress the importance of Schengen. The continuing flow of migrants over the past months has seen several countries temporarily re-impose border controls. I would like to say here that the Presidency is committed to securing the preservation of Schengen – a system which is at the heart of the European project and one of the greatest achievements of European integration. We will do all we can to find a solution to the current problems on the basis of the expected Commission proposal and in cooperation with the Commission, Parliament and the Member States concerned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 112, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "28242", "text": "Thank you, Minister.The debate is closed.Written statements (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 113, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Κώστας Χρυσόγονος (", "mepid": "125061", "text": "GUE / NGL), in writing. - The letter from the President of the European Council to the Heads of State and Government of the Union on the British question raises many questions. There is talk of a legally binding decision of the European Council to meet the demands of the British government, without specifying what will happen if the referendum that follows is in favor of Brexit. There is also talk of \"enhancing competitiveness\", which is supposed to be achieved by simplifying legislation and reducing the burden on business. I am afraid that these can translate in practice into further deregulation of the labor market and worse degradation of labor and other social rights. In fact, Mr Cameron's \"concerns\" may in fact be merely a pretext for making it easier for the dominant political forces in the Union to advance the implementation of similar plans of their own. The European Union can only meet the enormous challenges it faces with more solidarity, both between its Member States and within each of them, by redistributing from the rich to the poor.

In fact, while I believe it is necessary to address the discussion of the reform of the European institutions, as proposed by the British government, I am also convinced that this will have to take place in a shared and coordinated way at the European level, and not on the basis of the request of a single Member State, to how \"special\" it is. For this reason, the proposed agreement presented by Tusk today risks leading us in a dangerous direction for the future of European integration.

The Luxembourg compromise of the 1960s, the reintroduction of the Member States' veto, then delayed the development of the Union for two decades. Half a century later, we cannot allow this to happen again. The President of the European Council recently unveiled a proposal to meet British reform demands. Among other things, the Council proposal would allow Britain to restrict the rights of EU citizens working on its territory and turn the European Community back on the bumpy path of nation-state existence. No one is claiming that the European Union is perfect or infallible. However, free employment and equality regardless of nationality are fundamental values ​​of the European Union, which cannot be the subject of political bargaining. The answer to the challenges facing the Union, the Greek crisis, the refugee crisis, the Russian aggression cannot be 'we will solve it alone'. We should finally forget the ideal of national sovereignty, which was very fashionable in the 19th century but is now obsolete.

The system of benefits for European workers can be partially revised and adjusted, but its fundamentals and achievements cannot be changed in any way.

At the same time, of course, we want to support the reforms in the country. And we are ready, especially here in the European Parliament, Mr President, to help ensure that investment is made in the Nigerian economy and that we can expand our common trade.

I am honoured and humbled at having been selected to make an address on this occasion. Let me also bring to the European leaders, parliamentarians and the good people of Europe, a goodwill message from my fellow countrymen and women. The Nigerian people acknowledge with deep appreciation the material and financial sacrifices the European Union, and individual friendly European nations, made towards the conduct of elections and institutionalisation of democratic norms in Nigeria. As it had done before, the European Union has supported the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the smooth conduct of the last general elections in Nigeria, the outcome of which received worldwide acclamation. Nigerians noted the huge contributions that Europe has made towards the realisation of acceptable, free and fair elections in our country. Today I will tell this august gathering that European investments are beginning to bear fruit. I am one of the returns on the European investments in the democratisation of Nigeria. Indeed, the present regime is the product of a democratic choice consciously made by the people of Nigeria through the ballot box. Democracy has come to Nigeria to stay – sooner than many of us would have imagined. Nigeria will be counted among the most stable, strongest and most virile democracies in Africa. There may be strife and stresses, but these can be contained by the safety mechanisms of an electoral democracy. The events leading to the general elections in Nigeria in the early part of the year 2015 gave strong indications that the country was in trouble. Seeming anger, expressions of vituperation and open animosity, as well as threats and violence unleashed against the electorate, aimed at forcing them to vote for the status quo, were unpalatable developments that brought the stability of Nigeria into question. The drama that took place at the National Collation Centre was a momentarily frightening situation, unleashed by desperate agents of the status quo with the purpose of maintaining their grip on the national resources for their selfish interests. The maturity and patience with which the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission under Professor Attahiru Jega handled the matter saved the struggle for democracy and the huge European contributions. We must thank God that Nigeria survived this drama. As I have stated in other fora, the actions of Nigeria’s former President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, are commendable. For the first time in the history of Nigeria, a presidential candidate and sitting President conceded electoral defeat in defiance of calls by strong forces, including agents and benefactors of the regime, not to do so. I do appreciate the special relationship that exists between Nigeria and the European Union. The European Union is Nigeria’s main development partner and the pillar of support for the consolidation of democracy and the economic development of our country. We in Africa appreciate that your problems are mainly managing prosperity and competition. However, our problems are poverty, disease and technological backwardness. It is not too difficult to appreciate the kind of challenges these problems pose: internal strife, refugees, boat people, drug and human trafficking, etc. Chaos is not a neighbour anybody would wish to have. It is therefore in our collective interest to cooperate and tackle these serious problems in Africa. I am pleased that we already have the Nigeria-European Union Annual Political Dialogue, which has continued to strengthen our cooperation based on shared values and interests, especially in the areas of peace, security, democracy and good governance. Through this forum we have been able to continue, on a regular basis, to share perspectives on important regional, continental and global issues, with a view to forging common positions. We are committed to intensifying political dialogue and cooperation in the context of the Nigeria-European Union Joint Way Forward. Both of us believe in peace and security, respect for human rights, democracy and good governance, equality and tolerance, as ways of developing prosperous and strong societies. Furthermore, in the context of these European Union-Nigeria relations, I wish to acknowledge that the European Union had, severally, condemned the activities of extremist groups, including Boko Haram in Nigeria and in the entire Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The European Union had noted and commended Nigeria’s development of a National Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the amendment of the country’s Counter—Terrorism Act in demonstration of the Government’s commitment to finding a lasting solution to the threats posed by Boko Haram terror elements. Nigeria appreciates the EU’s collaboration, especially in the area of technical support, capacity-building for security services and provision of development assistance. For our part, we have updated our rules of engagement in fighting terrorism, and we pay very close attention during operations to the treatment of captured terrorists, to civilians caught up in the conflict and, in general, to safeguarding property. Our aim is to use the minimum force necessary in our fight against terrorists. In light of this, I wish to seize this opportunity to thank individual European Member States for their assistance towards the success of the Nigerian military onslaught against the Boko Haram terror elements. Many European Union Member States have pledged to support our efforts in the rescue of the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls. It may interest you to know that in a recent meeting I had with the parents of the Chibok girls, I assured them that the Government would not rest until all the girls are rescued alive and reunited with their families. I remain fully committed to this pledge. (Applause) Since my assumption of office in May last year, we have reorganised the Nigerian Armed Forces and repositioned them to deal decisively with the Boko Haram terrorists. Indeed, all the Local Government Areas that were hitherto under the control of the Boko Haram terrorists in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States in the north-eastern flank of Nigeria, have been recaptured. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are gradually returning to their communities. The Federal Government is committed to rebuilding schools, hospitals and other vital infrastructure destroyed by the fleeing terrorists. Currently, the activities of Boko Haram have been reduced to the Sambisa Forest, and their capacity to launch major offensives has been degraded. Boko Haram has now resorted to attacking soft targets, such as markets, mosques and churches, using innocent, under-age, hapless children to detonate locally-made improvised explosive devices (IEDs). I must express our serious concerns about the alarming situation in southern Libya, which is becoming a strategic time bomb for Africa and indeed Europe. The ungoverned swathe of land of southern Libya has become a thriving arms bazaar which threatens the security of the Sahel region, as well as the West Africa region and beyond. We must therefore intensify our efforts to find a lasting solution to the Libyan crisis. Nigeria is a peace-loving nation and has played a critical role in conflict management and resolution within and outside Africa. Peace-keeping and peace-building have been part of Nigeria’s foreign policy since independence. Nigerian troops have participated in almost all United Nations sub-regional and regional peace-keeping and peace-building operations. In spite of our current security challenges, Nigeria is among the 10 top troop-contributing countries to the United Nations peacekeeping operations around the world, with huge financial and human commitment. Nigeria’s first outing on peacekeeping operations was to the Congo, as part of the 20 000—strong United Nations Operations in the Congo (ONUC) in July 1960, of which I was privileged to be a member of the contingent in 1963 – barely three months before Nigeria’s independence. Nigeria participated in United Nations operations in the Congo for only three-and-a-half years. It contributed the third largest national force in the Congo, after India and Ethiopia. Since then, Nigeria has maintained a presence in global peacekeeping efforts. Nigeria has indeed participated in the maintenance of law and order following a mutiny in Tanganyika in 1964. In 1979 and 1982, soldiers of Nigeria’s 21st Infantry Battalion and the 202 Reconnaissance Regiment were deployed to Chad as a peacekeeping force to monitor a ceasefire and inspire confidence in the ongoing peace process. In addition, it contributed to the largest contingent when the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) was moved to Sierra Leone on a peacekeeping—cum—peace-enforcement mission. The Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group recovered most parts of the country from the rebels and returned the ousted President, Tejan Kabbah, to office on 10 March 1998. Under the mandate of the African Union, Nigeria embarked on a peacekeeping mission in São Tomé and Príncipe, where it succeeded in persuading dissident soldiers to subject themselves to constitutional authorities. Besides this, Nigeria has also deployed its personnel in Rwanda and in the Darfur Region of Sudan in order to maintain the peace in these two countries. Nigeria has additionally deployed its contingent to the following African countries: Angola (United Nations Angola Verification Mission); Namibia (United Nations Transition Assistance Group); Mozambique (United Nations Operations in Mozambique); Western Sahara (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara); Somalia (United Nations Operation in Somalia); and the Auozou Strip (United Nations Aouzou Strip Observer Group). On migration from Africa to Europe: Nigeria wishes to acknowledge and share the concerns expressed by the European Union with respect to the influx of migrants from Africa through the Mediterranean Sea, with its attendant loss of lives. In this regard, Nigeria will collaborate with the European Union to address illegal immigration to Europe. The Federal Government of Nigeria is making concerted efforts to address the push factors that propel migration, especially from Nigeria, as both a destination and a transit country. In this year’s budget, the Government has provided for over 500 000 graduate employment positions in the teaching profession alone. We are also collaborating with the states and local governments to strengthen Skills Acquisition Centres, in order to train the teeming youth in various vocational skills so that they can be self-employed and eventually become employers of labour. We are also making efforts to diversify the economy, giving impetus to agriculture and solid minerals exploitation, to create wealth and employment. Nigeria welcomes the outcome of the Valletta EU-Africa Summit on Migration, including the launching of the EUR 1.8 billion Emergency Fund to address the root causes of migration from Africa to Europe. Nigeria will work with the countries of the Sahel and Central Africa to submit to the Board of the Emergency Trust Fund the projects that we have identified for funding in due course. The Common Agenda on Migration and Mobility (CAMM), which Nigeria signed on 12 March 2015 and was indeed the first country to sign from sub-Saharan Africa, is a demonstration of the positive spirit of our cooperation with the European Union in the field of migration and development. It is in the light of this understanding that I wish to propose the reciprocal visa waiver for holders of Nigerian diplomatic and official passports attending official meetings and conferences in Europe. Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs): the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, collectively endorsed by the Economic Community of West African States, is yet to be signed by Nigeria and a few others. During Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations, Nigeria raised some pertinent technical issues that are yet to be addressed. Giving due consideration to the mismatch of the two regions, Europe and ECOWAS, in terms of technology and manufacturing experience, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and Associated Trade Unions raised concerns over the negative impact of EPAs on Nigeria’s industrialisation programme. Nigeria is working towards addressing its own side of the issues. I am therefore urging our European Union partners to also address our own concerns to allow for Economic Partnership Agreements that are mutually beneficial and contribute to the prosperity of our people, in the context of our shared values and interests in promoting cordial bilateral trade relations. On oil theft and illegal bunkering: Nigeria is facing the challenges of oil theft and illegal bunkering in the Niger Delta, as well as the recovery of illicit funds. It is therefore expedient to raise these issues with you, distinguished parliamentarians. In this regard, Nigeria solicits the cooperation of the European Parliament to support the efforts aimed at stemming these vices. Our attempts to restore security, curb corruption and fight crime will result not only in improving social stability in Nigeria but will re-open the doors for full economic relations with Europe and the outside world. Those who wish to invest in our country have vast opportunities, and we intend to guarantee the security of people and investments brought to Nigeria. The whole world recently converged in Paris, France, for the Climate Change Conference (COP21). A positive approach to the issue resulted in mutually-acceptable decisions. The world leaders have forged a common platform in addressing the devastating effects of climate change, particularly in the underprivileged countries across the entire length and breadth of the globe. During this all-important global event, I declared my country’s position on climate change. I reiterate here that it portends serious threats to Nigeria’s security and development. Nigeria is watching helplessly as Lake Chad dries up. This has monumental consequences for the people living in the Lake Chad basin, whose livelihood has, for generations, been dependent on the resources of the lake. These resources are fast dissipating, throwing communities out of jobs. It is pertinent to mention that all the states contiguous to Lake Chad are facing the effects of climate change. Collectively, we are under an obligation to face these common challenges. Our collective efforts may not be enough, as we are constrained by the dearth of funds, technology and manpower to initiate the right solutions. We are therefore calling for quick global action to address the issues. Indeed, these will serve in part as panaceas to the issues facing the countries sharing Lake Chad’s resources. In an effort to find a lasting solution to this problem, Nigeria has contributed the sum of USD 5 million, which has already been used in the conduct of a holistic study on the inter-basin water transfer from the Congo basin to Lake Chad. The study has revealed that the project will require the sum of USD 15 billion to reach completion. I wish to state that this study has indicated that the proposed Lake Chad project would be able to pay back this huge investment if it is private-sector driven. Against this background, let me invite Parliament to use its good offices by lending its support to the realisation of this laudable project.

The Commission will get supervisory powers, and we will make sure that Member States enforce the rules. So there will be no new Volkswagen cases in the future. Now let me go onto the official Commission statement. COMMISSION STATEMENT The Commission is fully committed to putting very robust emission-testing procedures in place, as of September 2017, to measure real driving emissions (RDE). The Commission counts on the European Parliament’s support in this respect. On 28 October 2015, the Technical Committee for Motor Vehicles (TCMV) voted on a draft Commission Regulation introducing RDE limits for light duty vehicles. The Commission is aware that the final result of the vote at the TCMV raised criticism from the European Parliament as to the level of conformity factors. The Commission considers the review mechanism of the draft regulations to be a very appropriate tool to address this criticism. The annual review of the second conformity factor is explicitly included in the enacting terms of the draft Commission regulation. The objectives of this revision clause are to bring the conformity factor to 1, as soon as possible and at the latest by 2023. The Commission is committed to making use of this revision clause to reduce the second conformity factor by 2017 already, and on an annual basis. Due to this revision clause and the technical improvements which can be expected, manufacturers will, as of today, have to design vehicles that will comply with a conformity factor of 1. The Commission welcomes the report on the reduction of pollutant emissions from road vehicles (DESS report) and agrees with the European Parliament on the need to ensure that the Commission is empowered to adopt measures and requirements on RDE test procedures, including conformity factors, through delegated acts following the revision of the Euro 5/6 legislation. The Commission is committed to working closely with the European Parliament and with the Council to reach a compromise to this end without delay. The Commission will, in any case, ensure that the European Parliament is duly and closely involved in the setting-out of the RDE conformity factors. The Commission believes that the joint work by both co-legislators will allow the establishment of a new, efficient and reliable approval framework for motor vehicle products.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 132, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Giovanni La Via", "mepid": "96816", "text": "chair of the ENVI committee. – Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Bieńkowska for her presence today in the Plenary, and also Vice-President Šefčovič, for their important work.

The Commission should present without delay a legislative proposal respecting the law of the Member States – and the willingness of consumers – to owe the introduction of GMOs for food and cultivation on its territory, taking into account the risks to food sovereignty, the environment, biodiversity and public health, as it is not possible to guarantee scientifically credible the harmlessness of transgenic products in food and feed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 788, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Jiří Pospíšil (PPE)", "mepid": "125706", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 I supported the objection because I have doubts about the use of genetically modified foods, and this also applies to FG72 soybeans.

The WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a substance \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans\" in 2015. Since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, authorisation decisions have been adopted by the Commission without the opinions of the Committees of the Member States and, in the case of GM food and feed, it has become common practice to return the dossier to the Commission for final approval. I agree that, even if produced on the territory of a Member State, trade in GMOs crosses borders. Thus, the national 'sales and use' ban proposed by the Commission could not be enforced in the single internal market. I supported the withdrawal of the regulation and for the Commission to present a new legislative proposal based on a high level of protection of human and animal health, the environment and consumer interests in genetically modified food and feed, while ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1146, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Dario Tamburrano (EFDD)", "mepid": "124813", "text": "  in writing. \\u2012 I have contributed with my yes to the adoption of this resolution.

Subsequently, the limit values must also comply with the new test procedure: the adaptation of the NOx limit values to the real test procedure is carried out by means of conformity factors according to the comitology proposal: New diesel models will be allowed to emit 168 mg NOx/km from 1 September 2017, and from 1 January 2020 only 120 mg NOx/km. This is an ambitious target, given that real emissions are up to four times higher. The automotive industry in Austria inindirects employs 370 000 people. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular depend on being able to know the regulatory requirements in a timely and clear manner. Rejection of the proposal would mean a major delay in the introduction of RDE tests. RDE tests enable the detection of limit values and provide clarity and transparency in terms of customer confidence and environmental protection.

It is clear from the leaked TiSA Annex on Financial Services that TiSA’s extreme deregulation agenda would apply to virtually the entire financial sector.

However, public and cultural services, fundamental rights to data confidentiality and fair working conditions, as well as the right to regulate, are non-negotiable and should be unequivocally excluded from the scope of the agreement.

Greater participation of women in the labour market based on the principles of equal pay for equal work and fair promotions is the best recipe against women's poverty, the pension gap and the chance to make full use of talent in the economy. However, the path to full equality between women and men does not only lead through the labour market, but is primarily based on ensuring that women respect fundamental human rights.

Another issue is access to vocational education and training for women throughout their lives. Women are more likely to take breaks in their working lives for various reasons.

This now puts concrete substance on the accession process and clearly marks the way forward. I think this progress is the result of our common efforts and commitment, so it is positive news. In particular, the Council has taken positive note of Serbia’s submission of its action plan on the rule of law. We are now looking forward to their solid implementation and a clear track record in these areas. Let me also underline that, in line with our new approach, the Rule of Law Chapters 23 and 24 will be addressed early in the negotiations. Progress under these chapters would need to be made in parallel with progress in negotiations overall. Among the chapters that we opened in December, Chapter 35, dealing with the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina, is key. The landmark agreements that were reached in the EU-facilitated dialogue in August are an important achievement. We know that it has not always been easy politically and we have encouraged Serbia to keep up its constructive engagement by swiftly implementing its part. The Council will closely follow these developments. Progress in the process of the normalisation of relations with Kosovo needs to be made in parallel with progress in Serbia’s accession negotiations. Serbia is playing a very positive and constructive role in handling the refugee and migration crisis, which it is seriously affected by. It will be important for us to continue and to increase our close cooperation on this critical challenge for the European Union. We will, equally, continue supporting Serbia technically and financially in this field. The Council notes with satisfaction Serbia’s increasingly constructive engagement in regional cooperation and strengthening good neighbourly relations. Serbia’s role remains central for stability in the region. Serbia is an important foreign policy partner for the European Union. We commend Serbia for its successful OSCE chairmanship in 2015. It now remains essential that, as a Union and together with Serbia, we address the numerous challenges we are facing, in particular in our neighbourhood. The Council therefore calls on Serbia to progressively align with the European Union Common Foreign and Security Policy. A European Serbia is part of our common vision. Overall, we can conclude that our enlargement policy with Serbia bore fruit last year. We have made clear from our side what we now expect from Serbia, namely for legislative reforms to be intensified and effectively implemented, in particular in the key areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime, as well as freedom of expression and the media. Moreover, we look forward to seeing further progress in the implementation of the agreement with Kosovo.

I would also like to congratulate David McAllister for his resolution on the 2015 Report on Serbia. This is a balanced and comprehensive assessment of service progress on its path to the European Union and is overall in line with the findings of our own 2015 report. Serbia has taken major steps on its EU path. I share your view that Serbia has indeed achieved a lot towards this strategic objective of EU membership. It has made concrete progress in implementing an ambitious economic and structural reform programme. Serbia remains committed to improving regional and bilateral ties in the spirit of reconciliation and good neighbourly relations. Serbia is also making progress in the reform of its public administration and strengthening the rule of law by adopting comprehensive action plans and further normalised its relations with Kosovo with key agreements reached in August last year. I am also impressed by the very positive and human manner in which Serbia and Serbian citizens are handling their unprecedented numbers of refugee and migrant flows, under very difficult circumstances and in full respect of EU core values. All these efforts required courage and commitment, and the opening of the first two negotiating chapters – namely 32 and 35 – in December last year is a well-deserved acknowledgement. Serbia should now build on this progress with a renewed commitment to moving decisively forward with reforms, in particular in the areas of the judiciary, the fight against corruption and organised crime, freedom of expression, public administration, anti-discrimination, the protection of the most vulnerable groups and minorities and the economy. Of equal importance for Serbia is to continue its constructive approach and to continue making further progress in normalising its relations with Kosovo. This should run in parallel with the accession process, with a view to reaching the comprehensive normalisation of the relations targeted as the ultimate goal in our negotiating framework. I also look forward to the next step, namely the opening of the Rule of Law Chapters 23 and 24. I hope, together with the rapporteur, Mr McAllister, that this can happen in the first half of 2016. This will, of course, depend on Serbia’s ability to deliver on its commitments. In this regard, I welcome the presentation of Serbia’s dedicated action plan on minorities today in Brussels. But this will also depend on the Member States moving quickly to agree about the next steps on this. We should be careful not to add requirements not provided for under the EU acquis or the negotiating framework. It is important that bilateral disputes do not hamper the overall accession process. Finally, we have taken note of the Serbian Government’s announcement to hold national elections. We are confident that, during the run-up to the elections and after the establishment of a new government, Serbia will remain committed to its reform agenda and the dialogue with Kosovo.

Two years after the start of the accession talks with the European Union and only a few months after new agreements with Kosovo, the first negotiation chapters were opened. The Serbian Government, like the Minister for European Affairs, Ms Jadranka Joksimović, who is with us here today, shows commitment to the EU integration process. I would like to stress four main points of this year’s resolution on Serbia. First, the rule of law. The European Union is based on the rule of law. When a country respects the rule of law it is beneficial for its citizens, its businesses, its state institutions and the economy as a whole. Serbia should fight organised crime and corruption with determination. An independent judiciary must be guaranteed. Second, democracy. This resolution stresses the importance of an active role for the Parliament and the participation of constructive opposition forces that are so vital for a democratic society. Third, media freedom. The freedom of the media is a constituent element of democracy that cannot only be achieved by adopting laws. It is also about creating a friendly environment for an independent media. Fourth, regional cooperation. Regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations form an essential part of the Western Balkan countries’ process of moving towards our European Union. Serbia’s engagement and role to promote regional cooperation and reconciliation in the Western Balkans is most welcome. The latest agreements in the framework of the Brussels dialogue marked a significant step forward to further normalising relations between Serbia and Kosovo. Both sides must now fully implement the agreements which have already been reached.

Based on the experience of my country, Slovenia, I can say that it is important to maintain the dynamics and rhythm of the negotiations. I therefore very much hope that early parliamentary elections will not affect the speed at which the reforms are implemented. Serbia needs a united and clear position at the moment on the European Union, the direction in which it is going, excellent experts, motivated officials in the civil service and the will of all citizens to achieve a common goal – a modern and economically prosperous country that plays an important role in the Western Balkans region. Serbia does not need to politicise politically diverse areas at the moment and put selfish political interests ahead of the interests of society. Responsibility to citizens will be borne by the leaders themselves. Who bears responsibility for the situation in which the Serbian media is located? As a former journalist, I cannot pass the events that marked the end of the past year in Serbia. The minister's inappropriate statement about the reporters who \"easily kneel\" was just a fire on... oil on fire. It has led to a protest by journalists demanding more decent working conditions. I am concerned about the state of the media in Serbia. And that is not the future I indulge in serbia. It is precisely the young people that we must make the future as promising as possible and prevent the mass abandonment of the country.

The report shows, nevertheless, that there has been progress in a number of areas of the acquis and that there is reason to be optimistic about Serbia’s ability to continue along this trajectory, in spite of the stresses coming about from the refugee crisis but aided by the fact that there are better relations in terms of dialogue with Kosovo. Serbia-Montenegro relations continue to be strong and are developing. The Joint Centre for Police Cooperation continues to develop and is an institution that has the potential to be further utilised in the fight against cross-border crime and corruption. I agree with David that Chapters 23 and 24 must be opened soon. An agreement regarding the exchange of social security data is also a welcome step, whilst the implementation of the existing 2015 agreement aimed at reducing mobile roaming charges across the region will also help sell the practical benefits of better cooperation.

Let us keep our eyes that we are assessing each of the western Balkan countries that want to enter the European Union on the basis of its concrete achievements, and their progress is also a contribution to the common European perspective. Based on the principle that the rule of law is the cornerstone of the European Union's enlargement policy, and when we find that Serbia has made progress in the area of judicial reform, we cannot get past the fact that there is too much policy-in-point in this area. Political interference is also recorded in the media area. Starting from the rich traditions of Serbian journalism and culture, it would be expected that all political factors in the country will be interested in media freedom, for diversity, and that the media scene will not be in the function of promoting the respective authorities. Civil society must, more than it is now, be recognised and accepted as a creative part of democratic processes, rather than something above which power can shake its discontent and desire for domination. We expect Serbia to align its foreign policy and security priorities with the European Union, because for integration into the European Union and for the common security policy, Serbia has no alternative with which to flirt.

Moreover, its accession path has been linked to progress in relations with Kosovo and the recognition of Kosovo, which, as we know, is the historical cradle of the Serbian nation.

There it tolerates the violation of a basic principle of the Republic, the separation of powers and the Parliament of the country to circumvent and not accept decisions of the Constitutional Court.

This is an important point in the European course of this country.  I would like to mention in this context the situation of the Romanian minority in Serbia. The McAllister report contains a substantial paragraph on the topic of minority protection, a paragraph to which I contributed through amendments.

The first two negotiating chapters were opened in December 2015. Chapter 35 is also about progress in normalising relations between Serbia and Kosovo. It is true that this chapter should be opened as one of the first, because for Serbia and Kosovo to be successful in the EU, it is essential that relations between the two countries allow constructive cooperation both on all issues of neighbourly cooperation and within the EU institutions. I believe that it is at least as urgent – and it has already been mentioned several times – that accession negotiations for chapters 23 and 24 should now be opened quickly. Since the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro, the Commission has rightly argued that these chapters should be opened first and finally closed.

However, they cannot be implemented from one day to the next. Successful reforms are based on the long-term entrenchment of the principles of the rule of law, such as the limitation of state power by law, the independence of the judiciary, and the granting of fundamental and freedom rights.

At the same time, serbia still has important tasks to do in order to catch up on a number of topics. Among the priorities, I would like to mention the provision of the rule of law and human and minority rights, in particular because the Commission and the Council will examine the steps taken in this area in the coming months to give the green light for the opening of negotiating chapters 23 and 24. Serbia has drawn up many promising law action plans in recent months, but we are well known that implementation is the key, and this is important not only because of the opening of the negotiating chapter, but primarily so that the citizens of Serbia enjoy a rule of law at European level as soon as possible.

That is a good sign, and Serbia has taken steps ranging from normalisation with its relations with Kosovo to reducing the government budget, and it is good to see that. At the same time, opening negotiations and opening chapters is not the same as closing them or closing the negotiations. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done. Let me highlight two of the points. Last September I was at the Gay Pride parade in Belgrade, and there was a cordon of policemen. I do not think they were there to protect the participants in the Gay Pride; they were there rather to protect the population of Belgrade against the LGBTs. This only shows that the position of LGBTs is still very poor in Serbia. Secondly, freedom of the media, which is essential for any democracy, is still shaky. I have read the Human Rights Watch report and there were many molestations of journalists and media workers reported in Serbia. So a lot of work needs to be done.

It is essential that Serbia continues reforms in the area of two key systemic chapters -- Justice and Fundamental Rights and Justice, Freedom and Security. I am pleased that the report clearly emphasises the need for judicial independence and ensuring media freedom, as key European values and preconditions for Serbia's further journey on the road to the European Union.  It is therefore important that the report correctly warns against the need to depoliticise public administration and to protect minority rights in accordance with international treaties and bilateral agreements. Adequate representation of minorities in local, regional and national representative bodies should be achieved and the possibility of using minority languages in media and education should be ensured. Therefore, the shutdown of minority media programmes due to privatisation and the unresolved issue of textbooks is worrying.

A stable, democratic and economically prosperous Serbia is a guarantor for young Serbs to see a bright future at home in Serbia, and such Serbia is a prerequisite for a stable whole Western Balkans. Serbia must help Serbia along the path of urgent economic reforms and improve transport and environmental infrastructure with sufficient pre-accession assistance.

I have the impression that this has been a very useful debate. Serbia now has a clear path for moving ahead in the accession process and, most notably, in the area of the rule of law and the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. Mr McAllister mentioned the need to open Chapters 23 and 24. Let me also underline from my side that, in line with this new approach, the rules in Chapter 23 and 24 will be addressed early on. Of course we have to discuss this in the Council, but I think it is important that we are already working hard in the COELA working groups to get agreement on this. Some Member States would like to see additional progress on minorities. I think the National Action Plan on minorities that is being presented today in Brussels by the Serbian Government will help in this respect. From my side, I would also like to underline the importance of continuing to solve bilateral issues. As stated in the last Council Conclusions on Serbia, the Council encourages Serbia to further intensify its reform process. I think these issues were also mentioned by many Members here today – an independent judiciary, building up a track record in the fight against corruption and organised crime. Moreover – some Members have mentioned this and I think it is important – particular attention needs to be paid to full respect for fundamental rights, including protection of the most vulnerable groups – in particular the Roma – as well as to the effective implementation of legislation on the protection of minorities, tackling discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and further improving the business environment and the investment climate. Some concerns were mentioned about deteriorating conditions for the full exercise of freedom of expression. It is important, of course, that, within the context of reform, progress continues to be made on this issue, as well as – as Commissioner Hahn mentioned – to deal proactively with the issue of war crimes. Serbia needs to maintain an active and constructive engagement in the normalisation process with Kosovo, which has made significant progress. I think there has also been a productive approach from Serbia towards the issue in Kosovo. We will come to that later on this afternoon in the debate on Kosovo. On the issue of foreign policy, which some Members have mentioned, the European Union closely follows the alignment of candidate countries with European Union external policies and actions, including the EU’s relationship with Russia. According to the Commission’s last progress report, Serbia’s alignment rate was 65%. In line with the negotiating framework, Serbia needs to progressively align its policies and positions with those of the European Union in the foreign and security policy area, which will be assessed within the screening of Chapter 31. As we know, Serbia did not align itself with the European Union sanctions towards Russia. That was also rationalised, if you like, during their chairmanship of the OSCE in 2015. We hope that we will see alignment on this file as well in the foreseeable future. Let me underline again that, in line with our new approach, Rule of Law Chapters 23 and 24 will be addressed early in the negotiations.

The Stabilisation and Association Agreement – the first comprehensive agreement between the European Union and Kosovo – sends, in my view, an important political signal of support and it is of critical importance for the future of Kosovo. A lot will now depend on how the Agreement will be implemented. The people in Kosovo will feel the concrete benefits from the Agreement if comprehensive reforms are undertaken.

The Council is concerned about the current political standoff in Kosovo which, in our view, needs to be urgently resolved. We condemn all use of violence and we have clearly called on all sides concerned to address the challenges through political dialogue and to engage on the implementation of Kosovo’s European reform agenda. Strong political will is required from all political actors now to overcome this difficult internal situation and move Kosovo far forward. Political stability is an essential ingredient to consolidate the European process launched with the SAA. Association and stabilisation go, in the end, hand in hand. Stabilisation in this context also includes moving forward on the normalisation of relations with Serbia, as we just discussed in our previous debate. Unless stabilisation is clearly visible, it will be difficult to move forward on association. We have seen very encouraging developments in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue over the last year. The key agreements that were reached in August are an important achievement, and we know that this has not always been easy politically. It continues to remain a very politically-sensitive issue and a divisive issue, and I think it will now be important for Kosovo to swiftly implement its part of these agreements, despite the internal difficulties it is facing. In this sense, I am encouraged by the meeting last week between Prime Ministers Mustafa and Vučić, by which they reaffirmed the importance of the dialogue for both countries. The Council will closely follow these developments and we will continue to support Kosovo. We will put particular emphasis on furthering Kosovo’s socio-economic reform agenda, including through financial and technical assistance. Economic growth, and specifically, I think, creating employment, is a main concern of the Kosovo people. Let me add just a few comments on the visa liberalisation process, which is a top political priority for Kosovo. The Commission’s recent report considers that Kosovo has been steadily and effectively progressing in all areas covered by the visa liberalisation roadmap. At the same time, it also notes eight outstanding requirements which will need to be fulfilled, of which four important areas remain key priorities. I think it will now be central for Kosovo to work on these areas. Once all these criteria have been fulfilled, the Council will revert to this issue. Let me finally underline the important role EULEX continues to play to support reforms and further the rule of law in Kosovo.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1876, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, only two weeks ago I addressed this House to thank it for its support in the continuing development of EU-Kosovo relations and its support for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) we negotiated with Kosovo. I would like again to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs and in particular rapporteur Ulrike Lunacek for their support. This House’s overwhelming vote in support of the SAA on 21 January was welcomed in both Brussels and Pristina. In Brussels it should allow the Council to adopt the agreement later this month, and in Pristina it reminded everyone of the support Kosovo has in this House. I look forward to the SAA entering into force in April or May. Implementation of the Agreement will not only deepen our political relations, it will also ensure a more predictable business environment, leading to much-needed jobs and growth. I hope that political leaders in Kosovo take the opportunity of the adoption of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement to sit around the table to discuss their differences and find a way out of the political stalemate. The political paralysis in Pristina has lasted far too long and has caused a great deal of damage. It is high time that the opposition renounced violence and obstruction and got down to business. Our 2015 report on Kosovo confirms that Kosovo needs to address structural reforms to tackle key economic reform challenges. Unemployment is unacceptably high and economic development is not sufficient. More focus is needed on delivery of results in the fight against organised crime and corruption. The same goes for the independence and capacity of the judiciary. Improvements in these areas should provide the people of Kosovo with a perspective for a better future. As reflected in the SAA, we attach great importance to the normalisation of Kosovo’s relations with Serbia. Kosovo needs to implement the agreements it has reached and continue to work towards further agreements. Kosovo also needs to ensure that the specialist chambers become fully operational quickly. Kosovo’s cooperation with the chambers will be of critical importance to the country’s image and international standing and therefore to its European future. Similarly, Kosovo needs to continue to work with our European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) in the execution of its mandate. This is a legal obligation under the SAA. We fully understand that visa liberalisation is a key issue for Kosovo and that Kosovo’s progress in this area is important to this House. The Commission’s third and final report on Kosovo’s visa progress last December noted substantial progress but also concluded that eight requirements still had to be fulfilled before it could proceed with the proposal. Kosovo is working hard to fulfil the remaining recommendations and therefore I hope this will be possible very soon and then we can indeed have a positive report.

In two weeks it will be eight years since it declared independence after war, after very difficult times, and there are lots of young people there – younger and older ones – who are sure they want this country to become a member of the European Union, a fully-fledged member of this European community. It is a very pro-European citizenship there, and there has been progress over the last years, as you have mentioned, Commissioner, and also you, Minister, for the Council. The Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) was adopted just two weeks ago in this House and this will come into force very soon. There is also progress in the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia: not good enough yet, but there is progress. Kosovo will soon, if things go well, have a telephone code of its own, which it has not had yet. So there is progress, but still it is not enough. This Parliament has been supportive of Kosovo’s statehood, of its independence, since the beginning, and we need to move forward on that with the Commission and the Council, because this country is still not fully recognised by all EU Member States. Five are still blocking, for example, Kosovo from becoming a member of Europol or Interpol, to increase the fight against corruption and organised crime, or also blocking things as important to citizens as the International Football Association or UEFA – or even the Eurovision Song Contest for those who like it. So, these things are important for citizens here. More needs to be done, and most of all visa liberalisation, as has been mentioned, because of this feeling of being locked in. Just imagine you live in a very small country; all citizens of countries around you can travel freely to the European Union to visit friends and families, and to visit the beautiful sights etc., of this European Union, and you cannot, although your parents and grandparents in Yugoslavia, more than 25 years ago, could do that. So this is something where efforts need to be improved. Kosovo has to do a bit more yet, but so has the Commission – and here I directly address the Commissioner – to move forward as soon as the Commission gives a green light, and I would also call on the Council Presidency: please give the green light to make sure that Kosovo citizens can travel freely. Coming to the domestic crisis in Kosovo: last week we had the European Integration Committee of the Kosovo Assembly here – all parties, government and opposition. This is the way forward, and I have called on the opposition time and again to stop blocking the Assembly, to stop using violence in the Assembly – and also outside, demonstrations are fine, but peaceful ones please – and to go back in, and I would also call on all of them to follow the call of President Atifete Jahjaga to get around the dialogue table and to find a non-violent solution to the domestic crisis. When it comes to the implementation of the dialogue agreement between Kosovo and Serbia, I need a couple of sentences more, thank you. It is important to implement it, but also, for the association of Serbian municipalities, in line with the ruling of the Constitutional Court of Kosovo. This is possible. It is about the laws and the statutes, whereas the agreement is only on the principles. The Constitutional Court is part of the statehood of Kosovo, with three international judges on it, so this is something I appeal also to this House to vote in favour of. Many other details are in the report. I have no time to go into details on that. I would like to thank all the shadows for their good cooperation, and I hope from this House there will be good support for Kosovo in its European process, strong support from this Parliament as in all the years before.

This Parliament has just voted positively on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, an agreement that is not only important for the economy but also for Kosovo’s integration within the EU. Despite this, new and further steps need to be taken. Two examples: firstly, visa liberalisation. Many of us hope that the Commission will find the necessary criteria fulfilled as soon as possible, not least because we know that such a move would send an important signal to the Kosovars that the country’s pro-European alignment generates results. Secondly, the establishment of an association for communities with a Serbian majority is for the moment one of the most pressing issues facing Kosovar politicians. A successful implementation will hopefully mean further steps on the way to normalisation with Serbia and a return to a constructive relationship between government and opposition in Pristina.

This progress report in Kosovo captures the current situation of full transition. As has already been said, the signing and then approval by the European Parliament of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which confirmed the European perspective for Kosovo, is an important fact. We believe that the conditions are in place for Kosovo to move towards consolidated objectives of rapprochement with the European Union. The Lunacek report indicates what commitments need to be made to make this happen. The important steps towards normalising ties with Serbia must be consolidated and a policy of reform must be developed more quickly. The efforts made to reform public administration are important, but politicisation continues to give rise to enormous concern. The main economic problems include factors such as low competitiveness, the black economy and high unemployment, which objectively hamper the country's chances of growth and development. The issues of the rule of law, the fight against corruption and the fight against organised crime must be taken seriously.  We expect progress on all this. We must be aware that they are the essential condition for building a positive perspective for Kosovo, sheltered from the violence that we have witnessed recently.

Undoubtedly, I am pleased with the text drawn up; many of the country's problems have been addressed and constructive criticisms and recommendations have been made. The issue of ethnic minorities has also been addressed and we call on Kosovo to step up efforts to protect and guarantee the rights of all national minorities, including foresters or Bulgarians, especially in the area of Prizren, as we made clear during our meetings and talks with the Kosovo delegation. However, I would like to draw attention to a call with which I do not fully agree, namely visa liberalisation with Kosovo.

Let's not forget that the so-called \"Balkan battalion\" of The Islamic State is actually made up most of fighters from Kosovo and then Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It is not the Commission, but Kosovo that needs to step up its work and, in this respect, show real progress, real and real results in the fight against organised crime, media freedom, freedom of justice, etc. Thank you again, Mrs Lunacek, and I hope that Parliament&apos;s resolution will be adopted by a large majority.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1881, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Hilde Vautmans", "mepid": "130100", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – There are countries that want to leave the European Union and there are those that are making efforts to get in.

We have been able to work together with all our colleagues in a good atmosphere, Mrs Lunacek, and the result certainly takes into account the latest developments. Those talks on 27 January show that both sides are serious about reaching out. We have therefore added an additional amendment to this end. If it goes well, it can also be said.  We are adopting a very important resolution today, ladies and gentlemen, a few months after the association agreement was concluded. We're seeing progress. We can hold out hope. Only 15 years ago, ladies and gentlemen, I was standing on that border between Kosovo and Serbia. Where we now let students do an exchange, hostilities were exchanged. Kosovo has made a lot of efforts over the past year. They have even passed a law on gender equality and developed a vision, something we cannot even say about our European Commission today. But, of course, many points remain: freedom of the press, the fight against corruption.  Mr President, we are living at a time when many states in the EU are reacting to the refugee crisis and closing their borders. A time when refugee children - and I insisted on this yesterday - were wandering around without their parents - 10 000 children are missing - and becoming victims of traffickers. Also a time when people are just looking for a better future. Kosovo is our partner in this and we must help them.

A state that produces Islamic extremism, corruption, crime, hosts and trains jihadists and cultivates hatred towards other peoples of the Western Balkans.  A region that has been violently separated from Serbia and on whose territory an international military peacekeeping force is still operating.

Unfortunately, riots on the streets of Pristina and members of the Kosovar Parliament in breathing masks have shaped the public image of Kosovo in recent months. It is quite clear that tear gas has nothing to do with a parliament, it cannot be part of a functioning democracy.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I think that the majority in this House is aware that we need the full integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union. Peace, stability, reconciliation, reconciliation, integration and economic development are only guaranteed in the setting of the European Union and that all the uncertainty and irritation that some have expressed today can only be resolved if there is inclusion here, if there is a European perspective. I honestly cannot imagine, for strategic and security reasons, that there is, so to speak, a white spot or a black hole here in the Western Balkans, where European rules and competences and the rule of law are not guaranteed. It would probably have much more serious consequences.  We must work on the development of these countries here. There is no question that we are already where we want to be. But I think that there is no way around this necessary process – and the concept of process is to be seen and less negotiations – that these countries must be brought closer to the European Union economically, in their social development, in their development under the rule of law. For Kosovo, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is, for the moment, the most appropriate instrument for promoting this route accordingly. What is important now is implementation, implementation, and here we can only appeal to all the political forces in Kosovo to devote themselves to this task, to face up to this task.  With all due respect to the political disputes that we are used to here in this House, there are, so to speak, national common objectives, and the European perspective should at least be one of the vast majority of the political actors in Kosovo. That is why this point, too, can only appeal to those responsible in Kosovo to sit down here, to make the political decisions in the interests of the country in the discussion, in the debate and in the debate, and to refrain from any form of violence or insurrection.  The Commission will continue its efforts to bring Kosovo closer to the European perspective, to Europe, as it can.

Kosovo has a very long history, as you know, with lots of violence, and I think some of you were referring to that this afternoon. I think that is correct. If we look at the situation since 1999 we see enormous progress, and that progress has to be reinforced. It has sometimes gone in cycles up and down, but I can tell you that the European Union will continue to assist Kosovo, including through its strength and presence on the ground. But obviously the primary responsibility for progress lies with Kosovo, with its leaders, with its institutions and with civil society. Reforms are crucial, and they will require the political leaders to live up to their responsibilities for the good of Kosovo and of its citizens. Key EU- related reforms are essential, not just to please the European Union but because they are in the interests of Kosovo itself. On the political crisis we are obviously following the situation with concern with many of you. We have made it clear that violence for political purposes is not acceptable and have appealed to all sides that challenges need to be addressed as part of a joint effort through political dialogue. Madam rapporteur, I think you were referring also to the Kosovo Constitutional Court. As we all know, it has ruled that the Association/Community of Serb majority municipalities is to be established, as provided by the First Agreement in accordance with the Constitution. It will now be essential to work concretely on the drafting of the statute of the Association/Community in the framework of this dialogue. You also spoke about the European aspirations of the people of Kosovo. Of course I have heard some of the language again, I think, from some of the representatives on that side of the corner with a known anti-Islamic language which has, in my view, nothing to do with the issue we are discussing today. When I represent the Council here, I would really like to appeal to you to confine yourselves to arguments that have to do with the case itself and not with religious discrimination. We should also acknowledge that visa liberalisation is a process based on conditions. I would say that. Of course we hope it will be possible. As Ms Lunacek states, there is progress but it is not enough, and now the work has to be done to make it enough. I understand it in the prospect for the young people of Kosovo: they want to travel. The visa can help there, but at the same time I think Commissioner Hahn mentioned that combating corruption and organised crime, and the independence of the judiciary and the specialist chambers, are really important elements in this. This is a conditions-based policy. We will continue to support Kosovo in its reform efforts with financial assistance and expertise through EULEX, and if Kosovo delivers on its obligations then of course we can consider and honour the commitments. Ultimately that, I think, will mean that the people of Kosovo will be able to travel freely like all other Europeans. Lastly, I wanted to mention the importance of the entry into force of the SAA.

It is planned for 12 February and then the Agreement enters into force on the first day of the second month following notification that internal procedures have been completed.

The situation in Haiti is of great concern and we believe it is fully justified that we address this issue today. The recent postponement sine die of the second round of the presidential elections, originally scheduled for 27 December and subsequently for 24 January, has opened a phase of instability and created the risk of an institutional vacuum. Above all, it risks depriving the Haitian people of the right to democratically choose their leaders. Against a background of a general lack of confidence in the Haitian institutions and low voter participation, preparation of the second round of presidential elections took place in a polarised environment, characterised by accusations of electoral fraud by a number of actors. The provisional Electoral Council, faced with the resignation of several of its members and the danger of further escalation of violence, which tragically has already cost several lives, decided to postpone the voting. I do not need to stress the risk that this situation generates, especially in a country like Haiti, affected by widespread poverty and many vulnerabilities. This crisis could jeopardise the reconstruction efforts and the results achieved after the disastrous earthquake which hit Haiti in 2010. These results were achieved thanks also to the major contributions made by the European Union to the development of the country. In July 2015 the EU fielded a large electoral observation mission, headed by honourable Member Elena Valenciano, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the sterling work carried out by Ms Valenciano and her team. They provided an invaluable service to Haiti and to the EU through their vigorously independent and professional observation and analysis. The EU election observation mission reported several irregularities but also concluded that no massive fraud took place at the 25 October election, and that results announced in the first round of the presidential elections were substantially correct. Unfortunately, the candidates who did not come first in the first round of the presidential election refused to accept this result. They made known substantial accusations of massive fraud and increased the widespread lack of confidence in public opinion. This led to the current deadlock. The Haitian voters could not exercise their political rights in full. As a consequence, there will not be an elected president by 7 February when, according to the Constitution, President Martelly will step down. The Constitution does not precisely provide for this, but of course it contains provisions for cases of incapacity with guidance given. Negotiations are currently ongoing in Haiti. We are all following the developments very closely. The Organization of American States (OAS) sent a special mediation mission, and a similar mission by the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) is also planned. We hope that a general consensus will emerge in favour of a swift completion of the electoral process on the basis of the will expressed by the Haitian people on 25 October and with practical improvements to the process. The work of the EU electoral observation mission could again be extremely valuable in this context. There is, however, the risk that an agreement may not be reached in the short term and that the transitional government finds itself faced with a legitimacy issue. This could have serious consequences for democracy and for the country. The EU is a long-standing and committed partner to Haiti. In these difficult times we call on all stakeholders to refrain from violence and to accept political responsibility in a democratic way. Democracy is necessary for sustainable development. I very much look forward to hearing the views of the honourable Members.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1920, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Davor Ivo Stier", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Madam President, I would like to first and for all congratulate Mrs Valenciano and her colleagues who participated in the observation mission in Haiti, who found that the elections were fair.

Therefore, taking into account the work of our colleagues from the observation mission, and convinced that any other position would call into question the credibility of this Parliament and our election observers, in the European People's Party we feel that the results of the first round of the presidential elections must be taken into account and a runoff held as soon as possible in order for Haiti to get a new head of state to succeed President Martelly. In doing so, we call on all political actors, state institutions and all relevant political and social factors to be prudent and dialogue so that an inclusive approach can ensure institutional stability and peace in the country, which is particularly important after President Martelly's term expires on Sunday February 7th. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and one of the poorest in the world in general, with a poverty rate of 77%. The dire economic and social situation was further marred by a severe earthquake in 2010. Faced with such a difficult socioeconomic situation, haitian citizens no longer have time for political bickering and antics. The people of Haiti need a government that will implement the necessary structural reforms to complete Haiti's democratic transition and that will enable sustainable growth and development, and thus ultimately eradicate extreme poverty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1921, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Elena Valenciano", "mepid": "4334", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, the first thing I want to do is confirm the European commitment to the people of Haiti and its constitutional authorities, a European commitment which we translate and which is the solidarity of the citizens of the European Union with that country which has suffered so much. So, first of all, commitment to Haiti.  The second thing I want to say is that I have had the honour, I have the honour, to lead a team of professionals of the highest quality, very committed to democracy in the world, who have done an excellent job in monitoring the electoral process which, unfortunately, has derailed, for the time being, in Haiti.  The work has been serious, rigorous. You can all be calm and, if you are not, you can check our website and our reports to see that we have the capacity to say that the elections on 25 October, the first round of the elections in Haiti, were surely the cleanest and least violent elections Haiti has ever had in its history. And therefore, we confirm that the outcome of those elections, from the first round, could have accompanied the holding of a run-off.  Right now, there is an institutional crisis in Haiti, there is a political impasse in Haiti that Haitians must solve. It is the Haitian authorities and the people of Haiti who have to resolve this important impasse, whose analysis Mrs Creu has done perfectly and which I will not insist on. That impasse has to be solved by haitians.  I hope that they will do so through dialogue and consensus, but our recommendation – humble recommendation – based on serious, rigorous and committed work, is that the second round of the elections in Haiti be held. It'll be the most legitimate thing we can do.

But, as responsible for the European Parliament's observation mission in this presidential election in Haiti, I believe that our main contribution, from the European institutions, is to support the holding of the second round, suspended on 24 January, to choose between the two candidates who on 25 October moved on to the second round. At the conclusion of this process democratically, it is the best way to overcome the period of interinitiality that will open on Sunday, following the march of Michel Martelly, and which may include the election, by consensus as well, of an interim prime minister. On October 25, Haiti experienced the first round of these presidential presidencies calmly and calmly, overcoming the violence experienced in the legislative ones on 9 August. On the ground we could see problems such as poor participation, discriminatory legislation to be able to formalize nominations, or improved judicial review, or the absence of sanctions against perpetrators of violence offences in previous elections. But both the day of 25 October and the scrutiny have been an unprecedented step forward for the country's democratic culture. As you know, Haiti is one of the poorest countries on the planet. Its inhabitants deserve and need to give up the time of the subsistence economy and the pain of a society still sore by a history of domination and violence. And achieving this is about generating the union and hope that arises in societies that, with that background, try to succeed by betting on democracy, dialogue, agreement and the rule of law. Haitian citizens need reasons to feel that they are the protagonists of their future and need to verify that their votes are good for something. Children who looked at us curiously, adults who were looking for a reason for hope in the interest with which we follow, from the European Parliament, those elections, people punished by uncertainty, and too often by extreme poverty, deserve that opportunity. They deserve democratic institutions focused on lighting a fairer and more prosperous Haiti, and a good way forward is to be able to democratically elect, in the second round of elections, a new leader that people feel close and legitimized to improve governance, strengthen the rule of law and reach the consensus the country needs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1923, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Marie-Christine Vergiat", "mepid": "96858", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. Madam President, the second round of the presidential elections in Haiti has just been postponed once again. This political impasse is worrying, but it would not be wise to over-dramatize. Building a stable democracy is not a long, quiet river and the Haitian people are coming back from afar. I took part in the European Union's election observation mission which took place on 25 October. I thank everyone who has accompanied us. I have seen the distrust of Haitians in the electoral process and the discredit that afflicts politicians in the country, as evidenced by the very high level of abstentions: more than 70%.  It is imperative to address the root causes of this discontent. It is based first of all on the non-treatment of the social issue in the poorest country on the continent and one of the poorest in the world. However, the country has a strong potential in agriculture and tourism, in particular. The issue of water must also be addressed. Six years after the earthquake, about 80% of the 12 million promised aid for the reconstruction of the country would have been disbursed, but it is enough to travel through Port-au-Prince and Pétionville to realize that much of this aid had not had to reach the population. It also fuels mistrust of international actors, whose interference has left its mark - I will not mention anyone. Helping Haitians improve their daily lives, to restore their confidence in the electoral process, in the institutions, is the key to breaking the current deadlock.

We can declare, without any hesitation, that the 2010 earthquake was and continues to be a business for part of international cooperation and for part of politics.

The country has many contradictions, but in spite of everything it strongly claims its right to free and democratic elections. We have ensured that this happens. Thanks to our presence in Haiti, the elections of 25 October were held regularly and without fraud, in a climate of legality and respect for the rules, as my fellow Members have also testified. The people welcomed us with enthusiasm, making our presence on the island even more significant, despite the low turnout in the election, I must admit, due to the lack of confidence in local institutions. Since these elections, the Haitian people have expressed two candidates. We must acknowledge and recognise the will of the people and, above all, we must carry out our mission: to ensure that, in the short term, Haiti has democratic and stable institutions capable of bringing the country out of the precarious situation in which it has been in the country for far too long.

That is why he is dealing with the very population of Haiti, which has been uprooted.

We have seen considerable progress since the last debate in this Chamber. The Libyan political agreement was signed in Skhirat on 17 December, a Presidency Council has been formed and is meeting and working, and the Government of National Accord has been announced and the Temporary Security Council has been appointed. As soon as she could, on Friday 8 January, the High Representative travelled to Tunis to meet the Presidency Council to express the EU’s political support for their action and to discuss with all its members, all together, about the immediate and longer-term assistance the European Union can provide to the new Libyan authorities. She reminded them that the European Union’s EUR 100 million aid package for Libya has been ready for a while and that all it takes for its full implementation is for the Government of National Accord to start working in the country. On the ground, promising new truces were signed recently between the municipalities: between Misrata and the neighbouring Tawergha, finally putting an end to an enmity dating back to the 2011 revolution; and between Zawiya and Zintan west of Tripoli, in Sorman, again just west of Tripoli and in the south, although it remains shaky between the Tebus and the Touareg, who have been fighting for months in Obari. The House of Representatives voted on 25 January to approve the Libyan political agreement, albeit conditionally. The recognition of the UN-brokered process is the sole genuine political process in Libya. At the same time the House of Representatives did not approve the ministerial appointments in the proposed GNA. Further discussions are required, but eventually we hope and expect that Libyan decision-makers will realise that there is no alternative to a Unity Government representing all the regions and all the social and political groups and that only such a government will give real hope to the Libyan people that their country can finally tackle, hopefully once and for all, the spread of terrorism, an economy on the brink and threats to Libya’s integrity and development. When the Unity Government is endorsed by parliament, the priority will be the security of the population and the fight against Daesh. Tripoli’s security must be essentially enforced by the Libyans themselves. Libyans will provide the core of the new security apparatus and the international community can provide further training and assistance should the new government request it. The European Union is also actively engaged in this security effort. Our liaison and planning cell in Tunis has been active and will continue to support the United Nations and the new Libyan authorities in drafting plans. Member States have agreed to bolster the cell and also to reinforce civilian planning capacity through a reactivated and expanded EU-BAM mission. It should become operational in the next few weeks and provide capacity on a broad spectrum of police support including counter-terrorism, customs, border security and migration. Mr President, honourable Members, the democratic transition in Libya is a difficult and complicated process, but a UN-brokered Libyan political agreement has made important progress and deserves our continued support. The alternative is simply chaos – a country on the brink of economic catastrophe – and all this can still be avoided. It is our duty as Libya’s neighbours to continue supporting the United Nations process and the GNA, and we are fully committed to continuing doing exactly that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1935, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Mariya Gabriel", "mepid": "96848", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Minister, yes, the priority in Libya today is the formation of a government of national unity. We can only support Martin Kobler's unparalleled efforts. The government's installation in Tripoli is also a key element in ending the political vacuum and the symbolic and geographical division of the country, which allows terrorism to spread. In the immediate future, the situation in Libya is at a major turning point and it is worth recalling the responsibility of the Libyan parties, not only towards Libyans but also with regard to other countries in the Sahel region, including Burkina Faso and Mali. We have known for a long time that the situation in Libya is a regional and international security issue. The responsibility and conscience of the Libyan parties are now the decisive elements. In the short and medium term, the European Union and the international community will need to be ready on various fronts, once the government is back in place, in order to redeploy the border management assistance mission and to rapidly deploy a new civilian mission. Apart from these priorities, we must work to mobilize the international community for economic reconstruction, because political peace will be in vain if the country's economy collapses and the government is powerless. Third, the coordination and complementarity of the support of the international community must be organised.

The humanitarian situation is disastrous and needs immediate relief. Daesh has managed to put down roots. It used to have only a few hundred fighters on the ground, now there seem to be thousands. It is easy to understand what it means in terms of eradicating them. A political solution with a government of national accord is essential – imperative – and we call on the House of Representatives to show a spirit of compromise and to endorse the new list of ministers once it is proposed, hopefully in the coming hours. But this will only be a small step in the right direction, because the challenges ahead are many and all of them are urgent. Let me not miss another important point: until now, sanctions against certain people were threatened but never put in place. It is now time to be more concrete and effective and to apply sanctions against those people who undermine the political solution for Libya. The new government will have to tackle the disastrous humanitarian and security situation in the country, which is already in the wind. To do so, it needs the help of the EU and the international community. As the President of Nigeria, Mr Buhari, mentioned this morning, the situation in Libya is not only a local problem, it is becoming a major regional one, with huge consequences for a region which is already confronted with too many crises.

It has already been said today that President Buhari has reminded us of the situation not just in the south of Libya, and not just in Libya, but in the whole Sahel region, which is in crisis. It also has to be said that there is now one of the highest concentrations of arms that has ever been seen in the region. It is also a matter of fact that human trafficking has been present for years and is further intensifying. The situation of the people, as well as of minorities and migrants, is just devastating. It is tragic. So it is high time that we were able to arrive at an agreement, but of course we need that agreement to be supported. What can we do apart from assisting Libya in this respect? I think that it is a condition sine qua non that we will be communicating only with those entities that are party to the agreement. This is absolutely necessary.

We should therefore avoid making the mistakes of the past and make the best of the opportunity today. It will not be easy, but it needs to be supported.

We observe that in the chaotic Libyan conditions the so-called Islamic State has been able to spread further and further. That is why every effort must be focused on combating it. But anyone who thinks that this can be achieved by military intervention at the moment is mistaken. In view of the chaotic situation, such actions would not only be doomed to failure; they would also be water on the mills of those groups that are propagandistically using any international action as an attack on the country's sovereignty. In this context, the planned third phase of the EUNAVFOR MED operation, i.e. an armed operation against smugglers on Libyan territory, is also more than questionable. Such an approach would further fuel the conflicts. With regard to human rights, we are noting that there is a constant deterioration. People are being arbitrarily abducted, tortured, violence against journalists and human rights activists is on the increase, refugees and migrants are living in appalling conditions. We cannot accept that! If the international community does not want to create a second Syria, it must support the future government with humanitarian aid and strengthen civil society organisations. And we must work to ensure that those responsible for serious human rights violations are held accountable to the international criminal justice system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1941, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo Castaldo", "mepid": "124812", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, politics today suffers from a terrible evil: the syndrome of doing. Do anything in order not to give the impression of being immobile and therefore surpassed by competitors or at least overwhelmed by events. One of the chronically ill of this evil is the current prime minister of my country Matteo Renzi. But to make choices with very serious consequences, such as starting military intervention without having a clear political objective to pursue, is unforgivable for a statesman. Worse, it's flag-waving one reason to chase another, that's just a crime. A crime that, for example, took place in 2011, and everything that came next was the direct responsibility of those who intervened recklessly at the time. According to the Blumenthal official of the Us Government, that intervention was pushed by Sarkozy to pursue two-sided economic and commercial interests: to get his hands on more oil concessions, taking them away from the Italian ENI, to increase French influence in Africa, to reaffirm military and also internal prestige – in this case Sarkozy –, but above all to prevent Gaddafi's possible plan to supplant the African French franc , the CFA, with a new pan-African currency guaranteed by libyan reserves. There were so many suspicions and now there is the word of the United States diplomatic corps. When I hear the itchy interventionists of France, Great Britain, Italy and the United States in Libya, I think certain lessons have not been understood. I am thinking of those leaders who care too much about the media responses to the Paris attacks, to show their muscles. I think that the only real fear that afflicts them, and that Daesh has understood well, is simply to defend the oil infrastructure, certainly not the rights of libyans or the security of Europeans. All the more, they are aimed at not losing the elections.  The priority objective is to stabilise Libya and resume the transition. If we go to bomb and deploy our armies we will only end up co-joining the Islamist militias around the catalyst of Daesh. The capture of Sirte is nothing more than what happened in Tikrit after the fall of Saddam Hussein: the exclusion of a community in retaliation, the logic of revenge instead of reconciliation. And daesh grows with the former elements of Gaddafi and the tribal elements, not for ideological choices but for political mistakes. If action is taken without a clear political agreement, the factions and militias that will approach our forces will then become portrayed as collaborators of the invaders, they will be discredited, and then the reconciliation process will be further undermined. Instead, the regional powers should be expected, in the face of growing chaos, to finally stay away from interfering and stop being seized by the logic of strong men like Aftar who have only complicated the negotiations. If the factions do not want to negotiate, let the talks be to be addressed to local realities, to municipalities, to tribal leaders directly.

Why has the European Union done nothing in Libya so far to really help libyans fight Isis and let it expand to Europe's doorstep?

The Libyan Government inherited the embargo to which the Gaddafi regime was subject. But has the European Union realised that Gaddafi is no longer there and that the situation has therefore changed? We call on the European Union and the Member States to sign readmission agreements with the new government, such as the one that Italy already had with Libya.

The Libyan political agreement represents a unique opportunity to deal with the current untenable situation and to lay the foundations for the construction of a civil and democratic state. The agreement reached in Morocco aims to guarantee the Libyan people a government based on the principle of the separation of powers and to strengthen state institutions, in particular the government of national accord, so as to address all the challenges facing Libya.  Our task today is to put in place all the political and diplomatic action necessary to ensure that not only is the agreement approved, but that it is implemented and that the foundations are created for greater inclusiveness of all actors within the framework of the necessary process of national reconciliation. In this context, I would like to highlight three elements, in addition to those already present in the resolution, on which it would be appropriate for the Council and the Commission to work. The first is the important role of neighbouring countries, a role that they are in fact already playing, to help the stabilisation process, and we must invest in this role. Secondly, it is important to give the municipalities a further role. Precisely because of the way in which the libyan reality is conformed, starting with the tribal reality, local institutions can play a vital role in the process of democratic stabilisation. Finally, there is a further message that I think it would be useful to give here to Parliament: avoid the mistakes of the past.

Recently, Daesh terrorists, who have consolidated their influence in the country since Gaddafi's overthrow in 2011, continued for a second day the bombing of the port and oil station Es Sider, causing a large fire in an oil tank.  The result of this war situation in Libya is the forcing of thousands of people to leave the country, thus intensifying migration flows.

Thank you for this interesting debate and for the important remarks made by Members. I think we all agree – and I am speaking here on behalf of the High Representative – that Libya is absolutely crucial for our common foreign and security policy. Libya is close by. It is close by Tunisia and Egypt and it is close by Mali and Niger; and I also agree with those of you who said that there are risks, and increasing risks, of a Daesh presence in Libya. We also agree that the political process, although advancing, is not proceeding fast enough, that there are plenty of hurdles ahead, and that the new authorities are fragile and need all our support. I think we also agree, if I listen carefully to Members, that the European Union, so close to Libya, is confronted with serious threats; that terrorist groups are expanding and must be contained; that Daesh is posing a growing threat, for instance to Libya’s oil industry; that the threat reinforces even more the urgency of finding a political solution through implementation of the LPA, enabling Libyan forces themselves to unite against Daesh; that the Libyan economy and its social fabric are in a perilous state; that there is a serious humanitarian crisis – I shall return to that in a second – that needs to be tackled; and that smugglers must be confronted and illegal migration brought under control. It is important to say that we all know that the real solution to all these daunting problems would be a Libyan Government endorsed by all Libyans and working for all Libyans and benefiting from all the support the international community can give. If you look at the different entities, the many militias and the presence of Daesh in so many parts of Libya, is it possible still to come to a compromise? It will not be easy. We have no doubt that the vast majority of Libyans are not radicals; they do not support Daesh in any shape or form. The new authorities represent much more a relatively moderate majority and we have the obligation to encourage and support them for that precise reason. The European Union will continue to do all it can to contribute to this effort and to make sure Libya emerges a safer and stronger country after five years of upheaval and disappointment. I think it is important also to say that I understand the reasoning that many of you want to talk about plan B. But we firmly believe – and I think the international community as a whole firmly believes – that a unity government at the stage where we are right now, accepted by all Libyans as a result of wide-ranging negotiations, is now the only chance to restore peace and security in the country and prevent a total economic collapse. That is not a matter of naivety; that is where we are right now in negotiations, and going along any other track, in my view and in the view of the High Representative, would not be wise. It is important to say also that, obviously, we are ready to support not only the negotiation process – we do already, the High Representative is active on this; we work very closely with Martin Kobler, whom I would like (and I think many of you said that) to applaud for his work. He came into a very complex situation in December and has immediately taken up the initiative to work not only with the parties in the country but also with the municipalities, which I think is extremely important. Those of you who are closer to the situation in Libya know how important it is to work on different fronts, if you wish, and he has been working on that. He knows the region; he knows how to negotiate, but we have to support him. A special representative cannot do this by himself or herself; it needs the support of the international community, the European Union, but obviously also the members of the Security Council in New York. I think many of you mentioned also the issue of the humanitarian crisis. I think it is important because, in a fragmented security situation, what happens always is that the citizens of the country are victimised. They pay the price, and there is no doubt that the complete disregard for international humanitarian law and limited access make the delivery of humanitarian aid a real challenge. In spite of this, the Commission remains the main humanitarian donor for the Libyan crisis. Besides ECHO, several projects funded from other instruments have been revised in order to respond to the most urgent needs of displaced peoples and migrants, both in terms of humanitarian assistance and protection. It does not mean that we can reach everybody, but the European Union is, I think, the most active actor in responding to this very important humanitarian imperative. That also refers to the issue of human rights abuses. When we work towards a political solution, when we think through the risks of Libya, obviously we realise that human rights abuses are tremendous. You see how many of the militia groups are present in Libya and how they actually, in many instances, control the populations and also abuse their rights. It is important that we keep not only drawing attention to this but also doing the maximum we can do. I have no doubt that it can only be done if we have further progress on the whole discussion of this new government: on the discussions around the formation of that government – how many members – all these issues that play right now and that are in the middle of the fire of the discussion, so to speak, so I do not want to go into them in detail. But an EU human rights mission has taken place in order to at least know exactly what is going on. We work also in the media sector. That also includes training people to ensure that these kinds of things are actually reported, and there are several projects dedicated to transitional processes. To save time, I will not go into all the details. I would like to close with these remarks, realising that I feel very much that there is broad support also in the European Parliament for continuing without any naivety. I realise that: without any naivety. But I also realise that in the end, a political solution, as elsewhere, is actually the most effective one. It is not a soft approach. It is an approach in order to bring some order. It will not be automatically a Denmark or another democracy in Europe in a few years, but it is the only way to bring about stability and to fight, with the support of the European Union, also the threats of Daesh and other extremists.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1982, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Președintele. –", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   We have received eight motions for resolutions, tabled in accordance with Rule 123(2) and (4) of the Rules of Procedure.

Two months after the legislative elections of 6 December, it is timely to debate what impact – or lack thereof – the very significant result of those elections has had on the political and economic course taken by this important country in its very difficult situation. Let me first thank Parliament for the continuous attention you have been paying to the worrying situation over the last two years since 43 people died during the violent street protests of February and March 2014. The resolutions adopted on three occasions since then gave a strong expression of our common conviction that the current crisis can only be overcome by means of a peaceful and constructive dialogue and in respect of human rights and the Venezuelan Constitution. The elections of 6 December, with a high turnout, produced an unequivocal result. A strong majority of the Venezuelan people have given a clear mandate to parliament for taking political decisions in order to address the country’s challenges. The people of Venezuela are suffering. They suffer from rampant violence and insecurity, with Caracas being a city with one of the highest murder rates per capita in the world and an even higher number of kidnappings and other violent attacks. They are suffering shortages of basic goods and food, medicines and medical care. With their peaceful and clear vote on 6 December, the people have requested a political response to these challenges. All political actors and institutions need to respect this democratic vote for the National Assembly as well as the legitimacy of the current government. Now is the time to work together in finding pragmatic and workable solutions to these difficult challenges. Ideological confrontations or institutional standoffs will not bring these solutions, and there is not much time left to lose in political manoeuvring as economic and financial resources are running out, the oil price is not likely to recover soon and inflation and shortages are getting more acute by the week. Initiatives for a national economic dialogue and for a certain process to address the issues of the victims of 2014 have been put forward by the executive. They will be useful if they are inclusive and conducted in a spirit of genuine openness for compromise and new solutions. This requires careful and critical reflection about what has not worked. It is important not to forget the plight of several dozen protesters who are still in jail or have been sentenced in questionable trials. I will only mention the most publicised case of Leopoldo López. Victims of violence must be protected. To achieve this, it is essential to ensure that those accused of having committed acts of violence during the protests get a fair and speedy trial based on objective evidence. All of these issues together form a complex reality that must be tackled. These initiatives should now be embraced as opportunities by both sides – executive and legislative, government and opposition – in a spirit of constructive cooperation and in full respect for the Venezuelan Constitution. It is the Constitution that offers a lawful, peaceful framework in which the Venezuelan body politic can operate as a democracy. Those on either side who feel tempted by non-constitutional methods or parallel structures must know that they have a heavy responsibility. Let us be clear. If the current absence of real dialogue persists, there is a distinct risk of new street protests and violent confrontation, which can easily get out of hand. We know that society is polarised, and there is no escaping that fact. There is a history. Both sides must accept that the other side has a role to play. Neither side is in a position to solve the multiple crises on its own. This is the message that Europe has been giving to our Venezuelan friends. Dialogue and compromise are the only way forward. The European Union and its Member States are working closely together in Brussels and Caracas to convey this message, and we join the considerable number of regional organisations and partner countries that have voiced the same call for national dialogue. Europe has legitimate concerns. There are more than half a million EU citizens living in Venezuela. EU companies are important investors and the European Union is also concerned about regional stability and the negative impact the worsening situation will have on the region. Europe has close ties to the region, and we are cooperating in many ways: from trade to security and from the fight against drugs to education and human rights, to name just the main areas of our cooperation with the region. We stand ready also to step up our cooperation with Venezuela. We know that many Venezuelan citizens are looking to the European Union as a good friend that can help to rebuild constitutionality and economic prosperity. This is the offer we have been making in various ongoing contacts both in Caracas and Brussels. That is also the message that I have expressed in quite a few public statements. Let me take this opportunity to thank you for the strong support that I have felt from the House in taking these positions, and I thank you for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1988, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Esteban González Pons", "mepid": "125027", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Mr Minister, Venezuela was once synonymous with progress, well-being and hope.

And this Parliament welcomes this democratic holiday and claims that only democracy and only democracy will be possible solutions to the problems of the Venezuelan people; first message. Second; the Government of Venezuela cannot reduce the powers of the new National Assembly. This is a legitimately constituted assembly and parallel assemblies cannot be created and the powers of the legislative branch cannot be reduced by conscaying artificely and illegally powers in the executive branch. That, at the moment, would mean a violation, a clear violation of the democratic mandate of 6 December.

I want to claim here today something that the Dutch minister has just said very correctly. The popular mandate in Venezuela is a mandate for dialogue. There's a reconciling mandate. There's a town that demands solutions. There are two legitimate powers, the power of the executive and the power of the legislature. And they have to talk. And they have to understand each other, because the people want solutions, because citizens want there to be arrangements in the very serious problems that Venezuela suffers from insecurity, lack of supply, deteriorated macroeconomics.

I regret, however, that this Parliament has not approved the move of an official delegation, contrary to what the Minister has said, the European Union has not been right in this matter.  Venezuelans relied on opposition forces to President Maduro's regime and that trust was translated into a significant absolute majority of the opposition. This is indisputable.

The new Assembly, despite threats to block the politicized Supreme Court of Justice, was faced with a humanitarian crisis resulting from the country's dramatic economic and social situation, with the declaration of national emergency and the food and health sector.

The importance of this debate is, first of all, that the elections of 6 December produced an unequivocal result: a strong majority of the Venezuelan people have given a clear mandate to the parliament to take decisions in order to address the country’s critical challenges. We have heard a lot of debates on how we can assist from the European side to accommodate a process in which really we can assist the Venezuelan people to come out of the crisis that they are in right now. First of all it is important to underline the importance of the Constitution. The Constitution offers a lawful, peaceful framework in which the Venezuelan body politic can operate as a democracy. Those on either side that feel tempted by non—constitutional methods – and the temptation is there – or by parallel structures to organise the consultations, must know that they are taking a very heavy responsibility at the moment, when the situation in the country is obviously very serious from an economic and security point of view. If the current absence of dialogue persists, there is really a risk that things will get out of hand. Therefore I find it important that we are putting forward these two issues: constitutionality and dialogue. There is no alternative. You cannot have one without the other, and it is important that the European Union underline that in its policy towards Venezuela. It is also important to mention human rights, and I appreciate the presence today of a Venezuelan delegation, which is active not only in showing support for, but also interest in, the fate of political prisoners. We are here in the European Union to defend human rights and it is important to put that forward also. From this debate I conclude that we all share a common interest in supporting the Venezuelan people in addressing their difficult economic and security situation and in overcoming the political polarisation that stands in the way of solutions. What Europe can now do to help the Venezuelan people in tackling these challenges is to keep calling on all the political actors to understand what happened: look at the elections, look at the constitutionality, see that nobody can decide this on their own and work on a constructive dialogue. There is no alternative. In this regard I think Members’ own parliamentary contacts they have been developing are of great importance. I would like to thank the honourable Members who travelled to Venezuela last year in order to listen, to support dialogue and to carry this European message of support for peaceful and constitutional solutions. That is a very important role they can play. They are particularly effective when they are representatives of the full geographical and political diversity of this House and, in this sense, I would of course encourage – to the extent that I can do that – the Foreign Affairs Committee delegation to see if they can visit Venezuela.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank the President-in- Recently, a member of the Trade Committee said: \"ISDS has a few friends left in the European Parliament.\" ISDS is controversial for many reasons because commercial considerations are applied in private arbitration courts and this can have significant consequences for public budgets, because democratic decisions are attacked and and and. There are many critical points of view. But the key momentum, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that there is a lack of transparency. The procedures are indeed behind closed doors and completely opaque. In this respect, it is hardly surprising that scepticism is growing. In the debate on TTIP, the European Parliament has also made clear proposals for reform on all these issues. Incidentally, this applies to new treaties, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, but this also applies, of course, to the old Treaties, where we have a large number of ISDS regulations, particularly from the European Union, from the Member States, which are completely non-transparent. There is, of course, a certain contradiction. On the one hand, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Council stresses that its members stress transparency in all sorts of areas, particularly trade agreements. But on the issue of bilateral ISDS treaties, the Council is walling up. And I think that is particularly important for the EU and for the Member States, because the EU, the Member States, are virtually the world champions of ISDS treaties. Now there is the Mauritius Convention, which has been adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and creates more opportunities for transparency. The EU's signature would be the signal of transparency in the Energy Charter. The Energy Charter is, after all, the only treaty where ISDS is provided for by the European Union – incidentally, since 1994, well before the Treaty of Lisbon – and the signature of the Member States would then be a signal that the bilateral ISDS treaties would also become transparent. At the moment, there seems to be some dispute over the competence of the Council as to who is responsible for what. I cannot understand this, and it really baffled me, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that such conflicts of competence are blocking the signatures of both the EU and individual Member States, thereby signalling to the outside world that the European Union is not, in fact, interested in transparency. This is contrary to our common objectives. And then again, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on the Energy Charter: this is often not discussed in public, but the Energy Charter is the Treaty where most ISDS cases take place. There are currently 89, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, 89 cases. That, by the way, is what the secretariat of the Energy Charter says. They don't really know that either, because it's very secret. There is no obligation to notify these cases, which can only be drawn from public publications. So there are at least 89, maybe even a few more. I find this state of affairs totally unacceptable! Some Member States have signed: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, but the EU is not. Hence the three questions, Mr President-in-Office of the Council: firstly, does the Presidency of the Council not agree that we must convince the Member States that this blockade will finally end and that the EU can sign up? Secondly, does the Presidency not agree that this blockade has caused immense damage to the image of the European Union, because transparency is, of course, formulated everywhere, but the world champion of the ISDS Treaties does not make that transparency? The third question is this: will the Presidency motivate those Member States that have not yet signed up to do so quickly so that we can say at the end of the year: yes, we stand by transparency, we also want this in the case of existing ISDS treaties?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2021, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Bert Koenders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Thank you very much, Mr Lange, for your three questions. I could be very short and answer, ‘yes’, ‘yes’ and ‘yes’, and then we would be finished, but I guess you need a little bit more language around that. But I would just say three times ‘yes’. Transparency is the key for the Dutch Presidency and it fits into our priorities of focusing on the essentials and creating simple and more reliable legislation, as you also mentioned. Let me recall that the Council, in its conclusions on the EU’s trade and investment policy adopted in November last year, recognised that a responsible EU trade policy must be accompanied by a high level of transparency and effective communication with citizens and better involvement of all stakeholders in the preparation, negotiation and implementation of initiatives in the area, while respecting the institutional balance and the applicable rules. But that is a long sentence to have the second ‘yes’. In the context of investor-state dispute settlement, enormous efforts championed by the European Union have been made globally towards improving the level of transparency under which disputes are conducted with the aim of providing maximum access to the public on documents and hearings, as well as allowing interested third parties to make submissions. Also the Commission announced its intention to contribute from the EU budget to increase transparency in ISDS by financing UNCITRAL’s publicly-accessible register on documents that supports the implementation of the ISDS UNCITRAL transparency rules. The EU is committed to systematically incorporating these transparency standards or comparable rules into all trade and investment agreements under negotiation, and in order to facilitate their application to existing agreements, a multilateral convention – as you mentioned – was negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations: the Mauritius Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration. In February 2014 the Council authorised the Commission to participate in the negotiations on this Convention on behalf of the Union. The Convention in question would apply in respect of the EU for one treaty only, namely the Energy Charter Treaty you mentioned. The decision of the Union to sign the Convention has, however, proved more difficult, as you also mentioned. Despite a number of discussions within the Council last year on the basis of the proposals by the Commission for decisions on the signature and conclusions of the Convention, not all Member States who remain competent for matters covered by the Mauritius Convention agree that this convention should be applied to the Energy Charter Treaty. Let me stress that the Presidency is committed to making progress on this very important file. It is among the priority issues on which we would like to advance discussions during the next six months. In this regard, bilateral contacts with the delegations concerned continue in order to iron out the remaining differences, because I think there is also the risk that you mentioned to our image in the outside world, and we encourage all Member States to assume a constructive position on the issue in order to allow the EU to sign a convention with respect to the Energy Charter Treaty. We have already gone a long way with the formulation and reform of the EU’s investment policy, which is an area of shared competence and responsibility. Rest assured that the Union and the Member States’ expertise in investment protection and dispute resolution guarantees their solid image vis-à-vis third countries. In this regard, in November last year the Council welcomed the Commission’s innovative and ambitious approach to modernising investment protection. The Council has further taken note of the Commission’s intention to consider this approach, where appropriate, in other EU trade agreements and to work towards the establishment of a multilateral investment court as a final goal. The Council also welcomed the renewed pledge to respect the governments’ right to regulate. Regarding the application of the transparency convention to Member States’ bilateral investment treaties, the Presidency remains unreservedly committed to the objective of increasing the transparency of the investor-state dispute settlement system. We as the Presidency cannot, as you know, easily interfere with Member States’ competences. We cannot force Member States to apply the UNCITRAL transparency rules to their own bilateral investment treaties concluded before 1 April 2014. Against this background, I am truly hopeful that we will be able to find a solution within the Council on this important dossier.

These two elements are extraordinarily important and central to us in the PPE. That is why I am addressing the Council here today – the answers that have been given in part – to overcome as soon as possible this stalemate that has arisen between the institutions, because it would be a question of ratifying the rules of the Union, the first convention that will finally reform and improve the law of international investment. Both the Council and my fellow Members present here, as well as the Commission, are well aware of the fundamental, central and priority for the future of the credibility of international trade agreements, where the Union invests, where the Union represents a project that is achieved through a fundamental element. This deadlock at Council level can therefore give rise to a worrying situation. We regard it as such because at the moment the only agreement that has been signed since the convention was adopted is the Energy Charter, which is currently excluded from the scope of the UNCITRAL transparency rules.

Of course, what we now want is for you to ‘do, do, do’. That is the next stage. I am sure that the Council is very aware of the Socialist position on ISDS. We reject the old Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs), and we rejected the Commission’s attempt to continue to use secret courts. In the long term, we are demanding a multilateral solution to investment disputes, but while we push for this, we strongly support bringing more transparency to existing ISDS provisions worldwide. We therefore welcome the Mauritius Convention at the UN level on new minimum standards, which we believe apply to existing Member States’ BITs, as well as to the Energy Charter. The blockage in the Council on progressing with this is unacceptable. I accept that it is not the Presidency’s fault, but it is unacceptable. It is important to continue to clarify that investment is a European Union competence.

It is also troubling to hear that, within the Council, some Member States do not support these transparency rules.

We are calling for the Council to authorise the Union to sign the Convention as soon as possible so that it can apply to the Energy Charter immediately. We also demand that all remaining Member States, when authorised, sign the new rules to apply them to all their bilateral agreements.

This leads to greater transparency and access to information in ISDS cases, the controversial mechanism that allows interstate and investor arbitration. It is therefore crazy that the Council, in which Member States together included 1 300 of these controversial clauses in trade treaties, is not moving forward with transparency initiatives. The Netherlands, which, as President of the Council, claims to focus on transparency, but has not yet signed up for more openness in the affairs themselves, more access to documents and a greater role for civil society organisations.

I would like to use this rostrum now to read to you the words of the United Nations Special Rapporteur, Alfred de Zayas, who says: \"Over the past 25 years, bilateral treaties with ISDS have eroded the basic principles of the United Nations, state sovereignty, democracy and the rule of law. The impartial observer can only produce a moral vertigo.\" The problem is not transparency, gentlemen, is the very existence of isDS, which directly attack the foundations of democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2036, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Tiziana Beghin (EFDD).", "mepid": "124777", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, so far 127 known ISDS cases have been initiated by powerful multinationals against EU states and have led to EUR 3.5 billion in compensation already paid.

But even more so, these figures do not take into account many other causes that remain secret. In order to avoid these situations, there is a United Nations Convention which obliges information on ongoing ISDS cases to be made public, but the Eu ropean Union and many other states are not party to it. This causes serious problems, particularly with regard to the Energy Charter, a treaty which provides for ISDS and which is giving rise to a very large number of causes.

In this context, we appreciate the efforts of the UN Commission on International Trade Law, which has focused its work on introducing the concept of transparency in international investment arbitration, culminating in the adoption of the UN Convention for the Application of Transparency Rules in State-Investor Arbitration. Therefore, the signing of this convention would also lead to increased investment security, with positive implications for economic growth at Member State level and, of course, a substantial increase in jobs. I also believe that Member States should be authorised for the individual signature of the Convention, but taking into account the bilateral investment treaties concluded by them.  Today, unfortunately, the negotiations on the TTIP, which the European Union so badly needs, are experiencing a not at all favourable development, precisely because of the issues relating to dispute resolution through arbitration.

Initially, what the ISDS system has achieved so far is to allow multinational undertakings to take action against specific States for damages suffered by those undertakings following a public policy decision. In other words, the existing system of judicial protection is abolished and companies have the possibility through ISDS to be handsomely compensated by the States.  At the same time, in order to be transparent about ISDS, the European Union must incorporate the transparency standards of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law into all trade and investment agreements, including talks with the United States on TTP.

So I can only prove that once it happens, and that is for you to judge. When I listen to what most Members have said, there seems to be no difference of opinion. As I have said, transparency is key for our Presidency. It fits into our priorities on focusing on the essentials and creating simple and more reliable legislation. I mentioned the Council conclusions last year. Let me stress that the Presidency is committed to making progress on this very important file. It is among the priority issues on which we would like to advance discussions during the next six months. We are all ready. The question was there in the bilateral contact with the delegations concerned, and they will continue to iron out the remaining differences. There was a question: why have we not signed the Mauritius Convention yet? First of all, we are 100% in favour of the transparency rules in the Mauritius Convention. There is a difference of opinion – it was also mentioned by you, I think, from the Socialist Group – on whether a Member State needs prior authorisation from the Commission to sign. We have decided to wait with our signature until the moment that this issue is resolved. But I must admit that we are getting pretty restless. My Minister for Trade is also getting very impatient, because we want this transparency. We therefore find the current deadlock in the Council regrettable. That was my second ‘yes’ to Mr Lange. It reflects badly on the image of the European Union on all these points. We also hope that the conclusion of the Court of Justice on the issue of the ‘mixed nature’ is quickly resolved. We are looking forward to receiving the opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to the division of competence between the Union and the Member States under the EU-Singapore FDA.

The basic principles of commercial arbitration are very helpful for investor-state dispute resolution. As these disputes often concern public policy issues or public finances, greater transparency is needed in their resolution by ensuring public access to documents.  Efforts to improve transparency have been ongoing since 2010. In addition, it has helped to induce the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) to establish global transparency rules and to apply these improved rules to the 3000 investment agreements currently in force.

I would like to remind you that the confidentiality of arbitration proceedings is regarded in doctrine as one of the most important and valuable features of such conduct. At the same time, subjecting the dispute to public judgement may result in pressure on its course and its politicisation, which makes it difficult to consider amicably and to conclude smoothly.

As you know, this issue is a priority for the Commission. We cannot, of course, accept or tolerate any kind of violence. Also, I need to point out from the very beginning, very clearly, that matters of public security and order are not within the competences of the EU but of the Member States. Gender-based violence violates the fundamental rights of the victim, and this is an expression of inequality between women and men. Violence against women, including sexual harassment and sexual violence, is unacceptable wherever it happens, whatever the circumstances, and regardless of the background of the perpetrators. Everyone in Europe must respect the law and abide by the common values upon which the EU is founded. Sexual assault and sexual violence are not new or imported crimes. In fact a survey by the Fundamental Rights Agency has shown that half of the women in the EU have experienced sexual harassment. More than one in ten women in the European Union say that they have been victims of sexual violence and one in 20 has been raped. We must ensure that our streets, squares and stations are safe for women and girls. We must create an environment where the victims are not afraid to report sexual harassment and violence, like they would if they had become victims of robbery. And we must make sure that perpetrators are prosecuted and convicted. The events in Germany on the last night of 2015 have put a focus on the special challenge of sexual assault in public spaces. We welcome the measures proposed in Germany to address this via stronger provisions in the National Criminal Code. We are considering exchanging detailed views on this through discussions among Ministers of Justice. The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, called the Istanbul Convention, sets legally-binding standards at international level, as the parties must protect women and girls against gender-based violence, including sexual violence and sexual harassment. The Commission is at an advanced stage in its considerations on a possible accession to the Convention. A first concrete step was the publication of a roadmap by the Commission in October 2015. The EU has adopted legal measures that provide for protection and support for victims. One problem is that currently, not enough victims of sexual violence report the crime to the police authorities. Here the new Victims’ Rights Directive can make a difference, as it will strengthen support for victims in the Member States. Member States have to apply the Victims’ Rights Directive, which grants rights to victims of crime and their families concerning information, translation, support and protection, while police investigate the crime and during court proceedings. The specific needs of victims of gender-based violence and sexual violence are highlighted and addressed. They should have access to specialist support, and special measures have to be put in place to protect them from further harm during criminal proceedings. The Commission will closely monitor full and correct implementation of the directive. We all know legislation alone is not enough. Therefore, we finance projects that make a real impact on the life of women and girls in Europe through our rights, equality and citizenship programmes. Currently there are two open calls for proposals. We have over EUR 3 million available for national and transnational projects to enhance the rights of victims of violence, and we have another EUR 3 million available for transnational projects to combat sexual harassment and sexual violence against women. Equality between women and men is one of the fundamental values of the European Union, and we remain strongly committed to achieving gender equality. Our efforts to combat sexual harassment and sexual violence are therefore part of a larger strategic engagement for gender equality. Let me reassure Members that in the coming years we will take a series of actions to improve equality in the Union and, through that, decrease violence against women.

Through the events in Cologne, the topic of \"sexual violence against women\" has taken on a new dimension and, thank God, a new public discussion has also found. In Cologne, it was mainly perpetrators from North African backgrounds, especially from Morocco and Algeria, who attacked, sexually coerced and sexually harassed women. Although this was the case in Cologne, it should not be forgotten that in discotheques with knockout drops there are also perpetrators who are not North African identity and do not have a migrant background, but that sexual coercion and sexual violence against women occur again and again in many places and in many places. In my view, it is necessary in Germany to punish such crimes very consistently and therefore to revise this law nationally. I think it is very good, Commissioner Creu, that you have pointed this out, because it is still the case in the national legislation of many countries that women have to prove how the attacks took place and not first hold the perpetrators to account, and that the situation in such a case is for women who are already reluctant to reveal themselves and talk to someone else about it. , is particularly difficult and particularly complicated and particularly precarious. On the other hand, however, it was also clear that there are no no-go areas. We must enforce the law, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators and the reason for which the acts are committed. We must also ensure that women are not expected to have to potentially take the perpetrators to an arm's length, that they are no longer allowed to go to a swimming pool in a miniskirt or swimsuit, because our standard of living includes freedom, democracy and the rule of law, and equality between men and women is part of it, unlike some totalitarian states or, unlike some states, , which also legally approves violence against women.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2051, "date": "2016-02-03.json", "name": "Maria Arena", "mepid": "124936", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of President, one in three women in Europe is, has been or will be a victim of violence, and the vast majority of women are victims of violence, and the vast majority of them are the work of a spouse, friend or family member, not necessarily a migrant.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I am very pleased and impressed by the sudden rise of feminists across Europe. At last, everyone seems to have understood that a woman's 'no' actually means no. However, I am now beginning to wonder why, according to a Eurostat survey, 25% of Europeans still believe that a girl in a miniskirt is causing problems or challenging problems. Unfortunately, this answer is very simple. The Cologne attacks were used in a populist way to incite hatred against refugees. Women's rights play only a very minor role in this. Let me give you an example: women have been complaining about sexual harassment at Munich's Oktoberfest for many years. What is the consequence of this? Virtually none, and no media attention. So I say, thank you for your feminist support. But the last thing we need now is a bunch of opportunistic feminists. There is no doubt that the events in Cologne are the result of a lack of integration and existing problems in the legal system. However, there is a need for a fundamental change in perception of the role of women, not only in the context of the migration debate, but also in our European society. Offenders must be punished, regardless of who they are or where they come from. We need a European framework and national implementation to combat violence against women by all means. It is also clear that there are cultural differences, and this cannot be denied at all – cultural differences within the European Union, but also, of course, outside the Member States. However, migrants are no more likely to commit a criminal act than nationals. Instead of falling victim to our own fear, we should respond with positive action and confidence to deal with the wave of refugees and to integrate people into our society in the best possible way. What Chancellor Angela Merkel is saying is true: if we compare the numbers of refugees with the European population, then, believe me, we will realise that the problems can be solved.

Everywhere there is harassment and threats of violence generated by a destructive, sexist and patriarchal culture of violence.  As a public figure and a woman, I often receive sexist or threatening messages from men. In my case, it's from white offended men. There are two things that need to be said clearly in this debate.

If we want to change the situation of women and girls in the European Union for the better, we need to tackle the legal shortcomings that still exist with regard to sexualised violence and violence against women. Yes, of course we have to speak about patriarchal masculinities. We have to speak about the fact that emancipated free women taking decisions over their bodies and lives threaten dominant, patriarchal, heterosexual masculinity norms. Let us address these challenges, be it in the democratic arena, in education or in the academic field, but let us do this without scapegoating specific groups and fuelling racist ressentiments. The same man who was spamming me with hate mail half a year ago saying that I should finally stop complaining about this feminist bullshit is now threatening me because I am not doing enough to protect women from violence. What a cynical situation. I am sick and tired of people, discourses, religions or cultures trying to instrumentalise my freedom and my body for their own political agenda. If we want to be successful in our struggle against violence against women and for equality for all, we have to dig deeper.

But people in the real world are being hurt. It has even been reported that the Commission will not accept that there is any link between the migrant crisis and the sexual assaults in Cologne and elsewhere. Indeed, in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) two weeks ago, a Labour MEP called me racist for saying that migrants and refugees were involved in the attacks. If it was your mother, your daughter or your friend, would you still deny that anything happened? This is what happens when you open the door to other countries and cultures that treat women as second-class citizens. Then we have the attempted cover—ups by the police, the politicians and the press. To hear Swedish police say they will not report what happened because it might benefit some political parties, and for a German politician to say that women should act differently in public, is disgraceful. The people we vote for and the authorities we expect to protect our safety are cynically turning their backs on ordinary women and men for the sake of political correctness. And what happens when the people who have committed these crimes get EU passports or are given nationality from EU countries? They will have the right to come to Britain without any criminal background checks. In 2015, 100 000 illegal migrants were stopped trying to enter the UK. This shows the scale of the problem heading towards Britain. But what happens if we look at the other side of this crisis? Over 10 000 migrant children are missing. Europol has said that these children and young people are being forced into sexual exploitation and slavery by criminal gangs. The International Organisation for Migration said it was to be expected that many of these will be caught up in exploitation. That is without mention of the thousands dead and missing in the Mediterranean. So not only are these EU policies putting women under threat at home, they are also having horrendous consequences for women and children trying to seek safety. Of course we must open our hearts and help innocent women and children, but this is not the way. For the EU to expand the meaning of the Geneva Convention through the Qualification Directive to mean anyone fleeing armed conflict has led to one million people arriving in Europe in 2015, many turning to criminal gangs to get here. The EU free movement rules allow them to be trafficked all across Europe, because there are no border controls and no criminal background checks between countries. Free movement is a huge security risk, which was exploited in the Paris terrorist attacks. Weapons, criminals and terrorists can move freely around Europe and attack public places, all thanks to the EU. The EU is putting women at direct risk, and clearly they cannot cope with this crisis. For the safety of our own women and men, for the sake of innocent victims, and for other countries, we must get control of our borders and we must leave the EU.

It was a gesture of defiance against the whole of society, against our culture, against our own freedom. Identifying only foreigners and all migrants as a potential danger to women will not help us in the battle against violence and harassment of women themselves. That episode shocked the world, just as unfortunately it still does not happen sufficiently when women in our cities are daily victims of violence, harassment in public and even in private, or when it is necessary to become aware that, unfortunately, a woman's mentality and culture are still rooted as an object.

We all want to put an end to sexual harassment and violence against women, not just in public places. One in three women in the EU has experienced physical or sexual violence since their youth. That's about 62 million women. Across Germany, every 68 minutes, a woman is the victim of a rape – an issue that is all too often silenced. Cologne has definitely changed something. The sexual assaults on New Year's Eve have sparked a debate about protecting sexual self-determination, especially in public spaces, which as such was long overdue. I am glad that we in the European Parliament are giving the impetus to this debate throughout Europe. What is clear is that anyone who wants to conduct the debate objectively and help the victims needs reliable facts. However, it also needs clarity on the legal situation, and this varies greatly from one Member State to another. For example, sexual violence is at best an administrative offence in Germany and is only considered a sexual offence if the woman was legally in a helpless situation.

Instead, we use empty phrases like harassment, violence against women in public places and the like. But this debate is well-intentioned at its core. Its aim is to do everything to ensure that events in Cologne and many other cities are never repeated. Today, it is quite clear that this sexual violence against women was not spontaneous. This was an organised and massive attack. The attacker sent a message to the European public about what he thought of the system – our system of values. We need to be determined at this point. We need to return a clear message – no one will change the way we live, nor our values, which include gender equality, tolerance of otherwise religious or otherwise minded. I regret the fact that many, even women, NGOs have remained a nem nouous in this terrible event.

But we cannot deny either that it was mostly immigrant men that mugged, sexually harassed and assaulted more than 600 women outside Cologne station. What was different in this case was that the attacks were not carried out in a hidden way; the perpetrators were making a public spectacle of instilling fear and humiliating the victims, being well aware that what they were doing was not acceptable in Western European culture. This is why we should not minimise the significance of what happened in Cologne and make sure that those who commit such acts are brought to justice. It does not follow from this that we should not offer asylum to those who are truly fleeing from persecution and death, or that we should not condemn, in the strongest way, attacks by the extreme right on immigrants, which could lead to an unstoppable spiral of violence.

It restricts their access to basic services, in cultural and recreational activities and negatively affects health. This discussion was initiated by recent events in Cologne.
