It is gratifying that so many young Europeans are showing interest in volunteering in solidarity with our social coexistence: 25,000 young people have already applied for the European Solidarity Corps on the relevant online platform. However, by publishing its online platform and sending the first volunteers, the Commission created facts without having a legal basis for it and, above all, without having clarified the funding. The Committee on Culture and Education welcomes the Commission's initiative to put young people more at the center of European politics. At the same time, however, we are asking ourselves a number of questions relating to the format, functionality, funding and long-term sustainability of the ESC. In our resolution we therefore point out the many weaknesses and errors of the initiative and point out the conditions that must be met in order for the ESC to be a success. The organizations responsible for youth work and voluntary services must in future be closely involved in the development and implementation of the ESC. Through their involvement in voluntary service, they have extensive experience and specialist knowledge. It would be downright negligent not to use this for the ESC. It must therefore be ensured that the achievements made so far with regard to the European Voluntary Service are not weakened. The creation of double structures would not only be ineffective but even harmful. New initiatives need fresh money. Despite the increase in funding, Erasmus + is chronically underfunded, good projects - especially in the field of youth work - have to be rejected en masse because there is not enough money. To overload Erasmus + with a new idea, Parliament cannot accept it without saying where the necessary funds are to come from. The ESC must not be at the expense of existing program lines in Erasmus +, and the youth guarantee must also remain sacrosanct. It could be a positive side effect of the ESC to increase the employability of young people, but it is not a labor market policy instrument. It is therefore important to ensure that regular jobs are not replaced by cheap volunteering. We expect a convincing and sustainable concept for the ESC from the Commission. Otherwise, the enthusiasm of young people can quickly turn into frustration, especially when it is clear that not even half of all interested parties will have a chance this year. Against this background we ask the following questions: First: How could the ESC further strengthen the European Voluntary Service? How will these two initiatives coexist in parallel and complement each other in the short and medium term? How do you avoid unnecessary overlaps between the two initiatives and how are the organizations currently involved in the European Voluntary Service involved in the process? Second: With which EU funding programs will the ESC be implemented in its initial phase, and what are the budgetary effects on these programs? What are the Commission's intentions with regard to the short, medium and long term financial sustainability of the ESC? Third, how will the Commission ensure that volunteering is not systematically exploited to replace regular jobs, whether full-time or part-time? I look forward to the Commission's replies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Marita Ulvskog", "mepid": "96672", "text": "   author. – Mr President, on 7 December 2016 the Commission adopted a communication on a European Solidarity Corps. By voluntarily joining the European Solidarity Corps, these young people will be able to develop their skills and get not only work but also invaluable human experience. That is how it was spelled out by Mr Juncker. In this communication the Commission states that the European Solidarity Corps will bring together two complementary strands: volunteering and occupational. The occupational strand touches upon subjects that fall directly within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ areas of competence, and this committee wishes to put a couple of questions to the Commission. How does it intend to differentiate between volunteering – which can provide very valuable experience but is unpaid – and traineeships or apprenticeships, which should be paid? How does it intend to ensure that volunteering is not misused to replace regular paid forms of employment? How will it guarantee that the initiative reaches out to all young people, in particular those in more vulnerable situations? How will it guarantee that the traineeships and apprenticeships offered under this scheme are of a good quality? How will formal and informal skills be recognised? How will it rely on, reinforce and complement existing initiatives such as Erasmus+ and the Youth Guarantees that have already been mentioned? Which share of the Employment and Social Innovation Programme and the Youth Employment Initiative and what additional funding does it envisage to allocate for the ESSC? Existing funds are already much needed given the social and employment situation in Europe. Does it consider resorting to other funds and programmes such as, for example, the ESF? How does it intend to avoid the duplication or replacement of existing programmes and tools such as Erasmus+, the European Voluntary Service and the European Youth Guarantee? We also have concerns that this is replicating already existing grassroots initiatives. The Commission has to consider already existing initiatives and respect their autonomous organisation. It is not the role of civil society to act as cheerleaders for the European Union or any governmental body. Strong, independent grassroots organisations are at the heart of European values. Finally, we would like an explanation of how it is possible that the initiative is already running, recruiting young people without the legal instrument. These questions I would like to have answered.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 33, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the European Solidarity Corps is at the heart of the Commission’s focus on youth. I am therefore pleased to discuss this important initiative with you today. As we debate the future of the European Union, I think it is appropriate to talk about an action which addresses young people. They have a key role in building the Europe of tomorrow and in strengthening central European values, such as engagement and solidarity. The European Solidarity Corps is a unique opportunity to put European youth, their commitment to solidarity, and their potential at the very centre of our EU agenda.  Within a few months, as Ms Kammerevert mentioned, more than 26 000 young people have signed up and the first placements have started. But as with all decisions, we need to make sure we have considered all options and heard all voices. The Commission therefore welcomes your questions and your draft motion for a resolution which raised relevant concerns. These are shared by many of the stakeholders we are consulting. Let me reassure you that we take these concerns very seriously. They are part of our ongoing reflections as we prepare the legislative proposal, setting up a dedicated framework for the Corps. We have to make sure that our proposal is spot-on and meets the expectations of young people and participating organisations.  Regarding your question about how the different programmes interact within the Corps, the European Solidarity Corps currently builds on a broad range of programmes: Erasmus+; Employment and Social Innovation; LIFE; the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund; Europe for Citizens; the European Regional Development Fund; Health; and the Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. There is in a sense no need to reinvent the wheel. We want to use this experience and the existing structures of these programmes as a basis. Our aim is not to duplicate actions or discontinue what works well. On the contrary, we want to build on the strengths of existing programmes, to increase their visibility, create synergies and offer more opportunities, because the whole is more than the sum of its parts.  Most of the volunteering activities will build on the European Voluntary Service, which looks back on 20 years of experience in developing high-quality volunteering placements for young people. All stakeholders involved consider the European Voluntary Service a major success. Solidarity jobs and traineeship placements will build on the success of ‘Your first EURES job’ and are currently mainly supported by the Employment and Social Innovation Programme. A special call for proposals has been launched to get proposals from consortia that will provide solidarity-related placements. The future legal base for the European Solidarity Corps will further improve, innovate and simplify the current approach. The Corps will bring together the activities available under the current programmes, add new activities addressing unmet needs, and use synergies wherever possible. The European Solidarity Corps portal as a single entry point for interested participants and organisations will ease access to volunteering opportunities, and it will provide digital tools to connect youth eager to express their solidarity with organisations looking for committed young people.  The key point is that with the Corps we create more opportunities for young people and make it easier for them to access these opportunities. The Corps will thus help to meet the real societal needs for solidarity across Europe, both within individual Member States and across borders. It will also harmonise and modernise the support services on offer. This includes, for example, preparation courses, language training, insurance packages and quality labels for organisations. It also includes participation certificates, as well as tools to recognise the skills acquired by young people during their placements.  We share your concerns about reaching out to young people in vulnerable situations. We believe that the European Solidarity Corps should be accessible to all youth. To reach out to those from less privileged backgrounds the Corps will ensure equal access and cater for the needs of under-represented groups by providing targeted and tailored additional support.  The forthcoming legislative proposal will be accompanied by appropriate communication and outreach measures. As for the risk of using placements as unpaid work, let me reassure you that organisations wanting to participate in the European Solidarity Corps need to be accredited. The arrangements to apply under the second phase will be proposed in the draft legal base. What I can tell you at this stage is that for the second phase we are currently considering three different types of placements: volunteering placements, job offers and paid traineeship placements. This way, the Corps will also complement the efforts made by Member States to implement the Youth Guarantee. It will provide additional opportunities for young people to make a start on the labour market by engaging in solidarity jobs or paid traineeships.  As to skills recognition, participants in the European Solidarity Corps will be entitled to receive a certificate when they have completed their placements. This could be complemented by a youth pass certificate. The Commission will work towards the recognition of the European Solidarity Corps certificate and related certificates at all levels.  You also raised the issue of the quality of placements. This is as important an issue to me as it is to you. Participating organisations have to comply with criteria that ensure that they provide only quality offers. In particular, organisations must commit to respecting the European Solidarity Corps Charter in which they pledge to foster the personal, socio-educational and professional development of participants; that they guarantee safe and decent working conditions; and that they provide adequate training for participants.  Employment offers under the occupational dimension are real jobs that will comply with national laws, regulations and collective agreements. Moreover, the principles outlined in the quality framework for traineeships will guide trainee placements offered under the Corps. Finally, the appropriate funding for the second phase of the European Solidarity Corps covering the period 2018-2020 is currently assessed by the Commission as we prepare the legal basis. Honourable Members, in conclusion let me thank you again for your interest in this initiative. We can only make it a success together for the benefit of the many enthusiastic young people all over Europe eager to make a difference.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 34, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Sabine Verheyen", "mepid": "96756", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mister President! In principle, I welcome the proposal by the top of the Commission to introduce a European Solidarity Corps, which by 2020 should motivate more than a hundred thousand young people to volunteer for projects and help out. These solidarity projects will benefit communities and people across Europe and are intended to help social communities to better act and respond to crisis situations or emergencies. As the EPP, we naturally share and support the aim of the European Solidarity Corps to promote a feeling of solidarity among young people in Europe and to create a more inclusive society. At the same time, however, I would like to make three main points: Firstly, there must be no competition between the ESC and the existing European Voluntary Service, which has already made efficient use of young people in voluntary work. The European Commission must quickly clarify the aim and framework of the European Solidarity Corps and ensure that it does not interfere with the well-running European Voluntary Service program. Second: As a program dedicated to youth, I believe it is urgently necessary to involve the youth organizations more closely in the development of the regulatory framework and to define the administrative framework together with them. Thirdly, we believe that the financing of the European Solidarity Corps is still completely unclear. In my opinion, new money must also be made available for this new program, and it must not be taken from funds that are already under great pressure from the medium-term financial framework. Our concern is that the funding will be taken from the Erasmus + budget. This is \"left pocket, right pocket\" and in the long run leads to frustration, because if the programs are in If the Erasmus + area is cut, the new Solidarity Corps will not help us any further.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 35, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Silvia Costa", "mepid": "96917", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Navracsics, we welcomed Juncker's proposal for a European Solidarity Corps in his State of the Union address, as a response to the need to strengthen the common sense of belonging and responsibility of young people Europeans in situations of help, social commitment, responses to specific needs of local communities or emergencies, on the basis of a public appeal addressed directly to young people and in collaboration with national and European NGOs who, however, have gained specific experience in the field civil service or civil protection, or voluntary work, and that allow them to live a period of commitment in countries, I hope, different from theirs or, to a certain extent, also in their country. But I remember that the conclusions of the Council under the Italian Presidency had called for the birth of an additional European civil service to EVS, but distinct, for which in 2016 a pilot project had already been launched, with the acronym IVO, which includes three countries participants and four observer countries. Perhaps it would be helpful to see this experience as the basis of the new body. It is important to listen to European NGOs, as our resolution wrote, before defining the nature and tasks. We ask, with our resolution, that this initiative be launched with a defined legal basis, as already mentioned, with dedicated resources, hopefully in collaboration, I believe, also with national youth agencies, without removing funds from existing programs that also have an economic underestimation, as is happening in the ongoing experimentation that actually saw - and this is an important response - over 25,000 young people respond to the call. However, I believe that the body, if it is a body of solidarity, cannot be confused with the voluntary service of the European voluntary service, which in its 20 years of history has represented a reference framework for European and extra-European volunteering, in collaboration with national and accredited NGOs, and not even with EU Aid Volunteers.I think it is also important to specify the different nature of this body, which of course must maintain a civic service profile, albeit with reimbursements and insurance guarantees, but taking into account - and I end up - specific vocations and also possibly employabilitybrings into play.In Italy, for example, it is also used in part as one of the many options of the Youth Guarantee, as you mentioned.But it must be very clear that this must be aimed above all at promoting European citizenship and solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 36, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Jana Žitňanská", "mepid": "124901", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group - Commissioner, let me begin by thanking you for this initiative, which I believe will help thousands of young people to take part in voluntary projects or find an internship or job.

However, as I have already pointed out, the website itself, where those interested can register, is not available in sign language for the deaf or translated into an easy-to-read style for people with mental disabilities, and it is clear that accessibility must be ensured at all levels, and thus not only within the projects, but also during the registration of participants. The Commission must also ensure an effective campaign so that the communities to which the initiative is addressed find out about all the possibilities. More than 26,000 young people have already signed up for the program, as has been said, waiting for an internship, apprenticeship, job or volunteering. This number will increase and it is essential that the funding of the whole program be resolved as soon as possible, without jeopardizing already well-functioning programs such as Erasmus Plus or European Voluntary Service.

From a content point of view, I do not find significant news. So, as Mrs Kammerevert has said before, from the Committee on Culture we ask ourselves some questions about how this is going to work and how it is going to be financed - Mr Navracsics' statements have not given us many clues about this either. He is concerned about the fact, which some colleagues have underlined, that they may exit other programs, for example Europe for Citizens, already under-financed and for which we have just asked for a considerable budget increase. In any case, I would like to express my admiration for the philosophy of the European Solidarity Corps. Perhaps your motivations will seem naive, but I consider it noble and necessary to reaffirm the value of \"solidarity\" in the difficult times we live. The European Union represents the broadening of the moral circle at the supranational level and, therefore, this is an extraordinary achievement. The European principle of solidarity is at the root of the values ​​that found our Union, and we must not fail to affirm it despite the wounds that Brexit may have left us, the selfishness of some nations or our general clumsiness with the management of the refugee crisis.

After decimating the cooperation sector, he wants to create a new body of volunteerism, in addition to the one that already exists, which will be financed with items destined nothing less than to combat youth unemployment. We certainly want a more supportive and inclusive Europe; the problem is that all this seems more like a farce that substitutes paid and professional work for free volunteering.

However, we should be careful that we don't just produce a new shop window decoration that is based on the old offer. And we should be very careful that the proposal does not run into bureaucratic overkill, as the Commission unfortunately succeeded in doing with the wonderful idea of ​​the Interrail Pass for young people. There are still many questions that need to be clarified.

Beyond what has already been discussed at the moment, however, it would be important to me that the Commission once again pay particular attention to the possibility of how we can not only engage young people through this European Solidarity Corps, but also empower them, and also empower youth organizations they can actively engage for Europe in their own initiatives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 40, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Dominique Bilde", "mepid": "124771", "text": "on behalf of the ENF group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his State of the Union address on September 14, 2016, President Juncker said about the European Solidarity Corps: “Young people across the Union will be able to offer their help there. where it will be most useful to respond to crisis situations ”. I believe that this statement is an admission of failure on the part of this European Union which, since its creation, has constantly spoken of solidarity only to better abolish it. How can you seriously, in the course of your text, praise the Union's solidarity when the savage competition it has imposed has devastated thousands of SMEs, put millions of Europeans out of work and enslaved several Member States? to the economic and budgetary diktats of Brussels? This observation of failure is also indicative of the European Union's total inability to resolve the crises that it itself has engendered, since the European Solidarity Corps poses the challenge of integrating refugees, for example. , on the shoulders of the younger generations. But I assure you, the young people did not wait for you to try every day to pick up the pieces of social cohesion that you have broken. In the European Union, one in four young people took part in an organized volunteering activity in the last 12 months. In France, more than 136,000 young people have taken part in Civic Service since its creation in 2010, particularly after the terrible attacks that struck our country.

The Commission’s communication is very unclear on this matter. To make the project acceptable for us, it needs fresh money from the budget.

It is also important that the qualifications acquired through volunteering are later recognized in the labor market. An undoubted advantage of the program is the possibility of increasing the mobility of young people and gaining experience necessary for their future work, as well as the development of active citizenship.

So we see that there are 25,000 volunteers. And suddenly we discover that this is a system with which some people will find work. This now appears in the discussion.

If we do it well the European Solidarity Corps can contribute to both European economic growth and the stability of European societies, because the volunteering part of the European Solidarity Corps can give the experience of living in a community for young people and working for the public good at the same time. And I think it is a very important issue from the point of view of stability of society, of the future society. On the other hand the occupational side, the occupation pillar, can contribute to the employability of young people, the employability which is probably the most important virtue, the most important skill, for young people to get a proper job on the labour market in the future. So we really take it seriously, and that is why I appreciate all of your concerns, all of your feedback and all of your opinions because we will put it into the construction of the European Solidarity Corps. But beyond the broad consensus let me address some of your concerns as well. First the funding, because definitely this is the most sensitive issue of the project. During this phase of implementation the European Voluntary Service funding was increased from EUR 62 million to EUR 89 million, out of which we estimate that EUR 58 million will be used for activities which fall within the scope of the European Solidarity Corps. The Commission continues funding Erasmus+ activities as foreseen in its legal base and financial programming, so no change in that. In other words, funding for volunteering has increased while there are no negative effects on Erasmus+ activities. Regarding the second phase covering the period 2018-2020 discussions on the appropriate funding for the new legislative proposal are still ongoing. Let me thank Ms Žitňanská for her concerns on the accessibility of the portal. We are working on a more accessible format of the portal, because it is our personal mission as well to make it accessible for handicapped and fortunate people as well. I agree with Ms Grapini’s remarks. Yes, I think the European Solidarity Corps is really an investment, an investment in the future, and that is why we would like to do it very well. Actually it is happening, the first action of deployment happened last week. So the European Solidarity Corps is already in operation. However, we know that we have to improve in the future to make it more efficient. The second sensitive issue is the difference between the European Solidarity Corps and the European Voluntary Service. The difference at the moment is mostly procedural. The European Solidarity Corps is needs-driven and builds on the synergies of the programmes involved. Most importantly it will offer new opportunities that do not yet exist under the current programmes. It offers a single, easily accessible entry point through the European Solidarity Corps portal and aims at the widest possible outreach to participating organisations and the young people involved. It will also develop an enhanced training, available before a placement, and recognition of learning outcomes after placement. Basically the European Solidarity Corps will not compete with national volunteering schemes. The European Solidarity Corps will enhance what is already on offer at national level, adding opportunities that were not available before. In this sense it complements national schemes and creates new synergies with them. And, last but not least, the application procedure will be easier in the European Solidarity Corps portal and that is why it will be more accessible for young people, hopefully for handicapped people as well. So thank you once again for your feedback, for your support and for your opinions and I am really looking forward to working with you in the future as well on this project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 59, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  The debate is closed.

It is not only designed to complement and build synergies with other youth engagement and employment programmes. First of all, we have to catch the special nature of this programme as important promoter of European spirit, solidarity and citizenship. The future legal EU framework should prevent ESC becoming a mere substitute to creating jobs, or a sort of auxiliary to the European Voluntary Service. ESC should perform the role of a European civic service, engaged in public, private and NGO sector. Before launching the ESC on the large scale, the Commission has to come forward with a clear legal basis, also taking into account the views of youth organisations, networks and voluntary organisations. We have to ensure that young people who sign up to ESC will know about their rights and obligations, that their certificates would be globally recognised across Europe. The ESC’s goal should be to reach out, as much is possible, to all young people, targeting especially vulnerable young people. In parallel, we must do our utmost to prevent both unnecessary bureaucracy as well as obstacles presented by national boundaries.

This is so because the ESC aims to create opportunities for young people to volunteer or work in projects in their own country or abroad that benefit communities and people around Europe. Nevertheless, the ESC should not replace existing, successful initiatives like the European Voluntary Service (EVS) but rather, to reinforce and complement them. Expressed in other words, the ESC should avoid duplication or replacement of existing programmes and tools. In addition, I would like to stress that the ESC should ensure that volunteering, despite the fact that can provide valuable experience, will not replace paid forms of employment. I warmly welcome the intention of the ESC to spread solidarity among young Europeans (particularly young generations) but we should bear in mind that our prime goal is to create sustainable long—term employment opportunities for many unemployed young Europeans, the EU’s lost generation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 62, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Dominique Martin (ENF)", "mepid": "124751", "text": "in writing. - The European Solidarity Corps (ETUC) aims to help young Europeans to develop their skills and to get a job.

In addition, the ESC contains several risks to which the Commission has not been able to provide satisfactory answers. On the one hand, (unpaid) volunteers run the risk of eventually replacing trainees and apprentices, thus developing the precariousness of young people. On the other hand, even though there are several programs such as Erasmus + and the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), the ESC risks complicating this whole rather than rationalizing it.

Every one of us MEPs is familiar with the situation where you put a question to the Commission for a written answer and only get a very questionable or poor answer. There are certainly cases where the Commission cannot answer because it simply does not have information or the Member States do not provide it. But there are answers where the Commission is holding us off because it is examining something and saying: We are still in an examination procedure and we still need something before the answer comes. But then there is usually no answer. There are cases where the Commission does not want to answer. To be honest, I can sometimes understand that because there are a lot of colleagues who make borderline inquiries. We should continue to think about this here in the house. But there are also questions where the Commission does not want to give an answer, for whatever reason - in case of doubt, because it wants to hide something from us. We have already introduced many, many restrictions here in the European Parliament for ourselves as MEPs in order to encourage the Commission to improve its answers in return: We reduced the number, we then reduced the number again, we have the number of words in the Queries reduced, you can only ask three sub-questions. So we in Parliament have certainly made our contribution. And that's why today's debate should only be a small sign. We only have a very short debate, we deliberately do not have a resolution, but we want to remind the Commission that the quality should please improve. We have a countermovement that is growing. The last time we changed the Rules of Procedure here in this House, we introduced a small and a large question to the Commission. That was a matter from the middle of the MPs because we just do it a lot are dissatisfied.So my request is really to change your practice and keep trying to improve the answer.We would be specifically interested in the following - here today 246 MEPs tabled this question together: Firstly: What exact conditions and restrictions has the Commission imposed on itself, and how does it justify the often non-existent substantial content?Second, on what legal basis were these requirements introduced and what level did this decision take?Thirdly, does the Commission want to change the way in which it is answered so that more detailed and better answers can be expected?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 65, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission takes its replies to Parliamentary questions seriously. Today’s oral question was added to the agenda at such short notice, making it difficult to give a complete response to the issues you raised. Nevertheless, I am able to make a few remarks in response. As a sign of the importance that the Commission attaches to these matters, President Juncker wrote recently, on 13 March, to President Tajani on this very subject. In his letter the President said, once again, that the Commission, under his leadership, has been committed from the start to filling with new life the special partnership with the European Parliament as laid down in the framework agreement of 2010. Only together can we change and renew Europe and regain citizens’ trust in the European Project. Replies to written questions are an integral part of our close relations. The Commission sees them as an important democratic scrutiny tool, which must be given due consideration. Over the last two years, measures have been taken by both institutions to improve the system of written questions and answers. The Commission welcomes the European Parliament’s efforts to set a maximum number of written questions to be tabled by Members of the European Parliament. This is appreciated by the Commission in a spirit of cooperation between the two institutions. The Commission makes every effort to reply in good time and to provide high-quality and politically-pertinent replies. The success of these efforts depends also on the quality of the questions. In 2016 the Commission replied to more than 9 500 written questions. An average of 40 replies a day was transmitted to the European Parliament throughout last year. It is important to recall that, according to Article 230 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Parliamentary questions are to be answered by the European Commission and thus by the College, and not by individual Commissioners. This is why each reply is subject to wide internal consultation and agreed by the Commission through a collegial process, in order to enhance the quality and political relevance. It is in this context that the Commission has chosen to set an indicative limit to the length of replies in order to facilitate the smooth operation of the process and to avoid disproportionate costs arising. Derogations from this limit are made where necessary. President Juncker has asked all Members of the College to pay the utmost importance to the replies to written questions of the Members of the European Parliament, to discuss the answers amongst Members to avoid silo approaches, and to give political answers to political questions. The Commission is ready to join forces with you to ensure that the limitation in the number of questions is matched with high-quality replies. The Treaty does not set out any deadlines for replies, but the Commission makes all reasonable efforts to reply to written questions in good time and, wherever possible, within the target dates that Parliament has requested. New efforts have been made in recent months to reduce the numbers of replies delivered after these targets, and these are already bearing fruit. In this context, the Secretariat-General of the Commission is in contact with the Secretariat-General of the European Parliament to work together to further improve the mutual performance of our institutions. In this context I can inform you that a meeting between the responsible Deputy Secretaries-General of the two institutions in planned already for next week.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 66, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Tibor Szanyi (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124703", "text": "- Madam President, Commissioner.

We ask the Commission if it will investigate these cases and if it will take measures to force the Spanish State to comply with European legislation. The answer is that the Commission will contact the Spanish authorities. As you can see, an answer that says nothing and is useless. The problem with not taking parliamentary questions seriously is that they reduce to absurdity one of this Parliament's tools for obtaining information and for responding to the citizens we represent. Behind each of these questions there is not only a work of legal and juridical foundation, but there is work with social organizations, with trade unions, with citizen associations that are, in many cases, in a situation of abuse and violation and violation of their rights, and we try to use them to represent them.

On a number of occasions I have put down questions and I have either had a delay, or when I have had a reply it has been a thoroughly inadequate response. For example, in December I put down a question about the negotiations going on in Cyprus and asking what sort of helpful role could the Council and Commission be playing in those negotiations, and it was not until February that I got a reply and it told me absolutely nothing at all, so I do think we need to seriously look at this issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 72, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Jonathan Arnott (EFDD).", "mepid": "124958", "text": "   – Madam President, written questions are a valuable tool for doing the job of representing our constituents when they want us to represent them in this place on issues which are affecting them, and they are one of the few ways that we can hold the Commission to account and ensure proper democratic scrutiny, and one of the few ways that we can gain information about the huge areas of responsibility of the European Commission.

I have taken note of your concerns and observations. I think that there is a general consensus and nobody would put it into question that it is one of the fundamental rights of the Members of the European Parliament to question the European Commission, and it is one of the obligations of the European Commission and the Members of the European Commission to answer those questions. It is an non-waivable right, no hesitation and no question in that respect. Let me refer to one issue raised in your interventions and that is the vagueness of the replies of the European Commission. I think there are two reasons for that. One is a political reason, and I agree with my fellow countryman Mr Szanyi that the European Commission is a political body – and this is the self-definition of the European Commission, that it is a political Commission – so if it is a political Commission it needs to give political answers. I agree, but let us not mix up political answers with party political answers or partisan answers, because the European Commission is not only a political body, but it is a political body of four political groups, representatives of four political groups and 28 Member States, or Commissioners sent from 28 Member States. We cannot afford to be party political or partisan. We give political answers but they are not party political answers. The second reason for the so-called vagueness might be the limits of the competences of the European Commission. Sometimes our answers go beyond the real competences of the European Commission. So we must be vague because it is not in our competence to answer concretely those questions. If there are other examples of vagueness, I really apologise for that.

A lot has already been said about the magnitude of these rights violations and about the relevance of the topic. Trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed with a human rights-based and victim-centred approach. Victims and vulnerable populations need to be put at the centre of all efforts. The prevention of trafficking in human beings and the protection of its victims must be our priority goal. Access to justice, support measures, shelter and education needs to be ensured, independent of the victims’ willingness to cooperate in criminal proceedings. The principle of non-criminalisation in this regard is also vital and needs to be implemented in all Member States. Further, demand needs to be tackled as it can be considered a root cause. Accountability needs to be ensured for both offenders, as well as knowing users. For the new strategy, I think that financial investigations and action against money laundering need to play a bigger part in fighting trafficking in human beings and to ensure that confiscated assets are used to support and compensate victims of trafficking. Does the Commission agree on this, and how does it intend to address this in the new strategy? I am also worried about the trend of trafficking in human beings being mixed up with other legally distinct concepts such as migrant smuggling, increasingly addressing trafficking in human beings through a security lens, for instance in the context of recent migration policies. How will the Commission counter this trend in its new strategy? I also call for greater internal/external coherence in the fight against trafficking in human beings and to further enhance and deepen cooperation and coordination among all relevant actors.

And it has many forms: prostitution, forced labor, forced begging, the trade of babies and organs ... that is where we became today. Yes, we have a pretty good anti-trafficking directive. But why does it have poor results? Because the strategies planned by the Commission are contradictory. How does the Union deal with traffickers? Blocking legal immigration routes? But that's pushing people into the arms of illegal networks. Closed borders are a treasure trove for traffickers and you are all complicit in that. How will the Union prevent gender-based violence? Delayed to sign and ratify the Istanbul Convention? That is why I am proposing a viable anti-trafficking strategy. What does sustainable mean? I mean focusing on reducing poverty and high inequality. Because, for the Left, they have always been the sources of human trafficking. Yes to more funds to inform and support victims. Yes to stricter penalties for \"customers\".

It is six years since the Anti-Trafficking Directive came into force. It is held up globally as the gold standard for its gender-specific and victim-centred approach. But new challenges are emerging, and the number of trafficked people continues to rise. The nature of this crime makes it hard, but not impossible, for authorities to obtain data and identify victims. It is therefore absolutely essential that we allocate EU funding in an effective, evidence-based system to address sexual exploitation and invest in prevention. Human trafficking is a high-profit crime. We need to know who buys and who profits. It is also vital that trafficked individuals are seen as victims, not criminals, and helped to recover. Europe can and must do more. Human trafficking is still a threat and feeds on poverty. However, only ten Member States have so far established using a victim of trafficking as a criminal offence. Commissioner, this House demands that we continue our efforts to stop impunity and make prosecution of traffickers and their users our biggest priority. Although most victims or are of European origin, the refugee crisis is feeding the supply, especially the thousands of unaccompanied, vulnerable minors. We have made progress in the EU but we need to plan the next stage. Without action and funding we will slip backwards, and that is why we ask the Commission to publish its new strategy now.

The anti-trafficking directive adopted in 2011 was an important step in the fight against human trafficking. Among other things, the directive took a broad approach to human trafficking, with measures for prevention, definition of the crime of human trafficking itself, penalties for perpetrators and combating demand. In addition to the legislation, an EU strategy was also adopted in 2012. But despite all the measures, human trafficking continues. Hundreds of thousands of people in Europe are forced to work under slave-like conditions. About three quarters of the victims of human trafficking are sex slaves. Trafficking in human beings is still one of the most lucrative and least risky crimes one can engage in. I am therefore pleased that today we have the opportunity to ask the Commission questions about the fight against trafficking in human beings. Today there are two things that make me worried and upset. The first is that the Commission has not yet presented a new strategy against trafficking in human beings. The other thing that upsets me is the lack of action by Member States to combat demand. Article 18 (4) of the Directive makes it optional for Member States to criminalize the exploitation of victims of trafficking in human beings. Only ten Member States have chosen to do so, and only two Member States have reported on alternative measures taken to combat demand. This is deplorable and completely contrary to the commitment in the directive. I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following questions. 1: When will a new strategy come? 2: What other measures are planned on the basis of the two implementing reports on the directive against trafficking in human beings? Will the Commission present new legislation, and if not, why?", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 80, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Anna Maria Corazza Bildt", "mepid": "96674", "text": "  author. – Madam President, trafficking in human beings is a slavery of our time. Figures are shocking and behind every story there is a human tragedy. Most victims are women and girls, exploited for prostitution in Europe and more and more are migrants and more and more are abused online. Trafficking is serious organised crime and should be prosecuted as such. It is a huge business industry with high profit and low risk. It is time to stop impunity and to ensure convictions. There should be no hiding places for traffickers in Europe and neighbouring countries. From the Urals through the Balkans, to the Black Sea, from Niger through the desert and the Mediterranean, actors are cross-border and sophisticated. Concerted action with third countries is necessary. We should step up our European response on all fronts. More police and judicial cooperation, including with Europol and Eurojust, better sharing of information, an operational role for the Asylum Support Office and Frontex, tracking the money, confiscating the assets of both traffickers and agents through the legal chain such as transport and accommodation providers. Member States should also reduce demand and criminalise the users of sex services. I welcome that Member States have finally transposed the directive but, as colleagues have said, much more needs to be done to implement it properly, in particular training of officials, access to health care, and sexual productive rights. Victims should receive unconditional assistance and psychological support. Madam President, many unaccompanied minors that disappear in Europe are exposed to trafficking and abuse. Members have to do more for missing children and ensure that they enter the protection system. I do fully support the anti-trafficking coordinator and in particular her call to focus more on child victims. Commissioner, I urge you to present this year the new strategy on anti-trafficking, taking into account, and I finish on this Madam President, Parliament’s recommendation including a gender perspective and external direction, and the European People’s Party will continue to support you, and be committed to zero tolerance against trafficking.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me start by expressing my thanks to all of you for this opportunity to discuss with you the very important and sensitive issue of trafficking in human beings. The European Parliament has been a strong and consistent supporter of our efforts to deal with this odious and appalling crime. It is a crime that takes advantage of the vulnerability and exploits the desperation of people in need of protection and support. As you know, trafficking was and remains a priority for us as reflected both in the European Agenda on Migration and in the European Agenda on Security. Europe has globally a leading role in this field. We have developed a coherent and coordinated legal and policy framework to address trafficking in human beings. The Anti-Trafficking Directive and the 2012-2016 EU strategy has been our main instruments to develop, coordinate and implement our policy framework priorities. Having delivered on the vast majority of actions envisaged in this strategy we do not feel that our job is done; quite the opposite. We cannot accept that irrespective of origin there are still and unfortunately more children, women, vulnerable people trafficked, abused and exploited. These are victims of the immoral and inhuman profit-making face of our societies. Now that the 2012-2016 strategy has come to an end the time has come to step up our efforts and continue delivering more intensively and in a more focused way. To this end the support and contribution of this House, of all of you, is of utmost importance. The migration crisis and transnational security threats render people more vulnerable to criminal networks and exploitation. That is why more needs to be done to target the organised criminal networks and follow their money throughout the trafficking chain, to focus more on prevention and on better identification and protection of victims, to further strengthen coordination at EU level and to ensure more coherence in the external and internal dimensions of our anti-trafficking policy. Criminal networks target and exploit the most vulnerable. Recent data indicate that the vast majority of victims are female and children. The most widespread form of exploitation is sexual exploitation, with mainly women and young girls as victims. That is why the Anti-Trafficking Directive has a strong gender-specific dimension, and that is why we have also commissioned a study on the gender dimensions of trafficking in human beings. It is also of major importance to increase our cooperation with third countries and further streamline our anti-trafficking priorities in the external dimension of our policies. The two distinct notions of trafficking and smuggling are often confused. However, it is not only a matter of the correct use of terminology. It is also about ensuring a victim-centred and human rights based approach. Allow me to clarify here that smuggling is a cross-border activity while trafficking can also take place within the borders of a state. In smuggling there is consent of the smuggled person while in trafficking there is not. The exploitation of the vulnerable victim for profit making is an essential element in trafficking. These differences bear significant implications for the rights of the victims of trafficking and the respective obligations of Member States. I would like to assure you that the respective EU legislative frameworks on smuggling and trafficking will remain clear and constant in any future policy initiative. Regarding now the two reports based on the Anti-Trafficking Directive presented by the Commission last December we will continue to proactively monitor the situation in the Member States and examine potential options. To conclude, and as far as our next steps are concerned, we are currently taking stock of the experience and achievements of the current strategy, examining trends and problems and assessing and discussing with stakeholders what future actions from all the different policy areas are needed. Our aim is to address the challenges created by the changing socio-political context. But we also want to maintain a coordinated, coherent and constant approach in the continuation of the efforts to fight this extremely pernicious but highly lucrative form of crime.

Among other things, 80% of minors are female and the other 20% male. So it's a huge problem, a problem connected to other factors as well, not just the prostitution factor. I would like to introduce another theme: almost no one talks about it, it is almost a taboo, but as far as minors are concerned, there is really a real danger, even for minors who disappear - we have mentioned unaccompanied foreign minors - of organ trafficking. .

In the last Strategy it was already mentioned in some questions, but I would like to reinforce others, taking into account that - as is well known and many of the participants have said - 75% are women and girls, 96% of whom are victims of sexual exploitation. We need a gender dimension in the entire process of identifying the victim of trafficking. That is very, very important, and also that, in all the instruments of support to the victims, there is that gender dimension that can be accompanied.

Today, with regard to trafficking from Africa, there is a strong emergency certainly from the west, but also from the Horn of Africa. Everything that has been underlined is evident, namely the risk that these trafficking particularly involve weak people, especially minors. But there is one aspect that seems to me to have been little emphasized, even in the commissioner's response, and which results from the data collected by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which shows a worrying reality, as more than 70% of migrants in transit from North Africa to Europe are victims of trafficking, organ trafficking and other forms of exploitation. This is a reality that we have denounced several times, but where is Europe at? Did you realize that your immigration policy, of hypocritical open doors, these senseless policies, actually favor these trafficking? And so it is useless for us to debate these things here when nothing is done to close the borders to traffickers and relies on certain NGOs financed by Soros the pro-immigrant and pro-migrant intervention, who knows under what conditions, and then entrusts the Turkey, perhaps, migrants who wanted to reach Europe from other parts.

Its victims are young women who are forced into prostitution and children who are either used in forced labor under miserable conditions or have their organs removed and trafficked. Particularly easy victims are women and children who enter illegally and uncontrollably as illegal immigrants in the countries of entry, Greece and Italy. Unfortunately, because the profits from this illegal activity can easily be channeled into seemingly legitimate activities, it is not easy for states to tackle this crime. Nevertheless, the states of the European Union must work together and enact strict laws in order to combat this unacceptable phenomenon. A key condition for this effort to be successful is strict border control.

The search for legitimate residence within the Union will, according to Europol, lead to an increase in forced marriages. We must protect these girls, preventing them, for example, from being sent to their countries of origin during the school holidays and from finding precocious wives of men much older than them.

The questions you raised today – the economic and financial aspects, the gender dimension and the coherence between the internal and external dimension – will fuel the development of a new, comprehensive EU anti—trafficking policy. It will certainly take due account of the actual and worrisome trends in Europe. Mrs Wikström, trafficking existed prior to the migration crisis. It is not something new. But there is evidence that the current challenges have exacerbated vulnerabilities and I agree about the attention that has to be given to children. They represent 15% of the victims. Mr Panzeri, in order to ensure policy coherence, it is important to take into account the latest deliverables. The first progress report on the fight against trafficking in human beings and the two reports of the Anti-Trafficking Directive delivered last September will also take into account the targeted consultation with all relevant stakeholders. The internal Commission processes are ongoing to ensure the best possible outcome for a future policy.  Mr Urtasun, the latest data for the European Union does indeed indicate that sexual exploitation is the most prevalent form of exploitation. It concerns 67% of victims with 95% being women and girls. The external dimension has been an integral part of EU policy to address trafficking in human beings. It constitutes one of its pillars and will continue to do so.

Why don't I prefer soy, avocado or other vegetable oils. I believe that this is a legitimate question, which is why I want to answer it for you. The topic of palm oil opened to me sometime at the end of 2015, when I first learned about the fires in Indonesia. I admit that I was completely amazed. The rainforests were on fire and with them everything living in them. The environmental damage was dizzying, but no one seemed to know about it. It was as if we were all looking the other way and letting the rainforests burn. No one informed about it, few people talked about it and no one seemed to be dealing with it. So I started working on the topic, and I had no idea that I was opening Pandora's box. The fires were linked to many of the problems associated with palm oil production in general - corruption, blindness, child labor, environmental devastation, violations of human and indigenous communities, activities of multinational corporations, post-colonial development and migration, and I could go on. This innocent-looking ingredient, often added to confectionery, cosmetics, baby food, potato chips and other food and drug products, is responsible for the fact that the rainforest has burned on more than two million hectares in Indonesia for more than two million hectares. This fire emitted more CO2 into the atmosphere in three weeks than Germany can handle in a whole year. Orangutans, gibbon, Sumatran elephants and tigers, along with thousands and possibly millions of other species, have lost the last remnants of their natural habitat and are in danger of being destroyed. Sixty-nine million people in Indonesia and Borneo breathed polluted air, and thousands of people paid with their lives for these fires. The reason was the effort to create palm plantations at the expense of the forest. The negatives of such palm oil production are clear, but the low price is able to overcome everything. We are thus witnessing another race to the bottom, in which we prefer to follow a short-term race economic benefits rather than the long-term interests of the sustainability of our lives on Earth. As indicated, the problem is not only in the release of harmful substances into our air, which of course helps global warming, but especially in the fact that we do so in the rainforests, which we rightly call the lungs of the planet. I believe that the European Union, as an organization that strongly supports the Paris Climate Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, must act on this. I am very glad that I have found important allies in the shadow newsletters and let me thank them very much. And not only to them, but also to all their co-workers. They took the subject with the seriousness it deserved, and they were a great support and a great help. We may have taken a different path sometimes, but the direction remained the same. For European consumers, but also for citizens of countries that produce palm oil, we wanted to prevent deforestation associated with palm oil production. Ensure that palm oil imported into the European Union is grown and processed in sustainable ways. Push for the most ambitious certification schemes possible. Fight human rights abuses on plantations and trampling on the human rights of indigenous communities. To also comment on the illogicality that we have palm oil in first-generation biofuels, which causes fires that flood our air with significant amounts of CO2. Ladies and gentlemen, I am now looking forward to a constructive debate on my report and on this issue. Palm oil is certainly not the greatest evil we have under the sun. However, the current method of cultivation and processing poses a risk to our planet, and for that reason I believe that we must not only talk about this issue, but also act.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 118, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all I would like to welcome this own-initiative report and particularly congratulate Ms Konečná and her colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). I would also like to congratulate and thank the other three associated committees as well for their good work, and I am referring to the Committee on Development (DEVE), the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI).  Addressing the environmental and social challenges of deforestation and forest degradation has been, and will continue to be, a priority for the European Union, and in particular for the Commission. That is the case now more than ever as part of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as well as for the Paris Agreement. Deforestation is a complex problem with many drivers such as infrastructure and agricultural expansion and with different dynamics in various countries, so there is no single solution. Tackling it requires action at many levels – at the international, national and local levels – and through joint efforts by different actors, acting together – governments, industry and business and civil society. It means working in partnership with countries which are most affected by deforestation and it means adopting a comprehensive and broad approach by identifying all the relevant policies, processes and tools we can work with. The European Union has consistently been at the forefront of action in this area through both international and domestic initiatives. At the international level the European Union has proactively engaged in the UN Forum on Forests, in the Convention on Biological Diversity, in the implementation of the REDD+ framework, and under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Domestically, since 2003, the European Union has an ambitious forest law enforcement governance and trade action plan which has delivered key results such as the conclusion of VPAs (voluntary partnership agreements) to help partner countries combat illegal logging. But being a frontrunner does not mean that no further engagement is needed. The evaluation of our FLEGT Action Plan demonstrated that the work we have carried out so far to combat illegal logging is achieving significant results, but also that we need to work more and we need to work better, both internationally and domestically.  Addressing illegal logging is not sufficient on its own. The main drivers of deforestation are related to a broad range of societal factors. In that context we also have to look, for example, at our own consumption and agricultural commodities that are often associated with deforestation, such as soybean and palm oil here in the EU. We are of course aware of the degree of public concern at the environmental impacts of palm oil production, such as deforestation and biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions and indigenous rights issues, but we are also aware of the opportunities that it presents, for instance contributing to lifting thousands of people out of poverty in producing countries.  The Commission believes that we need to address the issue of deforestation by looking at a much broader range of issues and drivers. As a follow-up to the 7th EAP, the Commission launched this last year in 2016 a study to consider the feasibility of options to step up EU action to combat deforestation and forest degradation. The results of this report should be available by mid-2017. The Commission believes also that it is essential to cooperate and to support the efforts of producer countries to minimise deforestation and other negative impacts that palm oil cultivation can have in order to achieve sustainable production of this commodity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Tiziana Beghin", "mepid": "124777", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, palm oil is a dangerous product that causes enormous damage.

Strengthened by this consideration, in the INTE commission we have formulated precise recommendations: differentiated customs duties to reward those who produce in a sustainable way; complete traceability of palm oil along the entire supply chain to understand who really produces respecting the rules; and finally we called for the use of free trade treaties to promote clear and binding rules on sustainable development, the environment and human rights in producing countries.

In fact, the question of palm oil, and the need for it to be grown in a sustainable way, has made us open our eyes to realities such as the Indonesian one, in which respect for the environment is not always guaranteed, but it also made us understand that instead there are other countries of Southeast Asia - in particular we refer to other realities, to other States - in which we have found and have found a greater respect for the environment, greater education, greater maturity, greater sensitivity , greater awareness regarding the need to ensure production that is sustainable and that is done respecting the environment.

We have had good cross-group cooperation and agreement on the important issue of palm oil and deforestation. At the eleventh hour a letter was received by some of us from ambassadors representing some of the palm oil producing countries outside of the European Union. The letter makes four criticisms of Parliament’s own-initiative report on palm oil and deforestation. However, all of these can be countered. The first criticism made in the letter is that palm oil is not the main deliverer of deforestation. In reply, it may not be the single biggest cause of deforestation but it is responsible for some 29% which is a significant amount of deforestation. The European Union has signed up to ending deforestation and as the third largest market for palm oil the EU cannot turn a blind eye. Consumers have responsibilities too. The second criticism is that the report attacks the reputation of palm oil producing countries. No, it does not! Nor does it call for the phasing out of palm oil.  The third criticism, that the aim of a single certification scheme is redundant, is not true. Too many schemes are now confusing the customer. We need one certification scheme. The fourth criticism is that the report is partial and not inclusive. In reply, this again is not true. The process involved a sustainable palm oil round table which involved growers, cooperatives, processers, traders, development NGOs, environment NGOs and social NGOs. It was inclusive.

So that makes it clear that for the EU there are some things to do. The EU is the world’s largest importer of embedded deforestation and also one of the biggest markets for palm oil globally. We Greens, in line with the report, believe that there is a clear need for a fully sustainable palm oil supply chain by 2020. Also we call on the Commission to come up with an action plan on palm oil. There is a need for comprehensive sustainability criteria for palm oil products, also with independent auditing and monitoring of the certification schemes. In the long term we also need a mandatory certification scheme for palm oil in the EU, and also binding commitments, in particular an anti-deforestation guarantee in trade and development cooperation agreements with producing countries.

Then we must remember - as has already been mentioned - that if we replace palm oil with other vegetable oils we go to consume even more land, because palm oil has a higher yield between five and eleven times compared to many other oils. And then there is no need to talk to industries, just talk to technicians and nutritionists to understand that palm oil has many characteristics that are also useful, for example for health, because palm oil, being practically solid at temperature environment, does not need hydrogenation and is therefore more suitable for limiting, for example, the risks of cardiovascular diseases compared to trans fatty acids deriving from the hydrogenation process. There are many qualities that this oil has, and it cannot be replaced, for example, even by butter - and below I also see a trade war - because butter contains slightly more saturated fatty acids, it goes rancid more quickly and would therefore shorten the life of the products.

The local people are suffering from the environmental effects of palm oil extraction, above all the consequences of deforestation, which has already been mentioned a lot here. I would like to say that I see that we have two tasks: we will certainly accompany it with due weight and attention, and we will do so here today, in the interests of those who live there.

Many cases of child labor and expropriation of indigenous lands for the production of palm oil are also reported. In this context, the European Union - which is the third largest world market for this raw material - has a great responsibility.

I believe that this is the right time for the European Union to promote an action plan against deforestation and forest degradation, as well as the production of palm oil. There are many vast problems that today affect tropical ecosystems, which only occupy 7% of the Earth's surface. Palm oil is being increasingly used as biofuel and a substantial part of its production does not respect human rights, using child labor. This report highlights that respect for fundamental human rights, the protection of the forest and the sustainable production of palm oil are reconcilable objectives.

I would like to thank you all for sharing your views on this important matter. As you have confirmed, deforestation is a very complex issue and I think we can agree on a number of points. But we need to take a broader look at deforestation because it is not caused only by the palm oil industry. On the other hand, not all the palm oil industry produces deforestation. So we cannot take a black and white approach. Here I would like to draw a parallel with agriculture. As in all activities, agricultural activity has both good and bad practices. I agree totally that we need to have a more sustainable agriculture, but we cannot say that we have to scrap all agriculture.  A number of colleagues mentioned traceability. I think that traceability and informing consumers about the sustainable production of products also helps a great deal as consumers can take on – and I think consumers should take on – their environmental responsibilities as well. I agree with Bas Eickhout who said that the power of consumers cannot be underestimated. We all agree that we should stop irregular and unsustainable production, not just of palm oil, but any unsustainable production of any product. But do we all agree that all production of palm oil is irregular, illegal or unsustainable? Julie Girling also mentioned palm oil certification. The Commission is also specifically looking at the issue of palm oil certification schemes through a dedicated study which will inform its ongoing work on deforestation. Some Members also mentioned palm oil as a biofuel. We need to work on sustainable production, but we also need to work on sustainable consumption, including biofuels. The Commission has already proposed revising the Renewal Energy Directive to gradually reduce the share of food-based biofuels after 2020. Already this directive does not allow biofuels to count towards renewable energy targets if they come from land that has been deforested since 2008.  I think the final speaker or the speaker before last also mentioned that palm oil in baby food is toxic and harmful. Here our information is that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is working on this, but there is no proof that these products are toxic or harmful. I will conclude by saying that this report by Parliament is a very useful contribution to the debate. I have already mentioned that the Commission launched a study last year which will give us a better insight into this industry. In addition, the Commission will also be organising a conference on illegal logging and deforestation in the coming months in Brussels, bringing together producer and consumer countries, as well as private sector and civil society organisations. Here I would like to mention that Kateřina and all her colleagues could – and should – also participate in this conference. I trust that this conference will provide a very useful opportunity to strengthen our dialogue with third countries and trigger further contributions to the Commission’s work on deforestation.

We take up an important topic for the functioning of the world market, in this case primarily for our trade relations with Mercosur countries. The most important here is the issue of standards and compliance with certain rules, but also the issue of mutual trust between partners. It is in this context that the recent incidents in Brazil should be considered, which are hopefully only incidents and not a constant practice related, first, to the dispatch of substandard meat on the EU market, and second, to breach of the principles of cooperation that underpin commercial relations . We have high standards in the European Union. Our consumers and we all expect the same requirements for imported goods. And here we are talking about food, which has a significant impact on human health. Let me now turn to a question raised by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and prepared with the active participation of many members of our committee, but also of other Members. Operation Carne Fraca - a two-year investigation by the Brazilian federal police into two of Brazil's largest meat processing plants (JBS and BRF) in seven major Brazilian beef-producing states - has raised great concern. The investigation revealed serious fraud and corruption in a sector that introduces potentially dangerous and fraudulent products that pose a risk to European consumers in the food chain. According to investigators, federal inspectors received money in exchange for ignoring counterfeits or expiring processed foods. Sanitary permits and export certificates were also forged. In addition, the investigation showed that chemicals were used to improve the appearance and smell of expired meat, and cheaper products were added to the meat. European consumers are seriously concerned about reports that salmonella-contaminated meat has been exported to Europe and that, to improve in appearance of rotten meat, ascorbic acid was used. Brazil is the world's largest beef and poultry exporter. It is also the largest meat supplier in the EU, which introduces hundreds of thousands of tons of beef and poultry to our market every year. European producers and consumers expect all meat imported into the Union to meet high European food quality standards. 1. Can the Commission provide details of the imports of these contaminated products into the Union, detailing the volume of the suspect products and the European markets to which they have been sold? 2. Why did the European inspection services fail to detect this systemic fraud of placing counterfeit meat on the EU market? What advice will the Commission give to Member States so that they can strengthen controls following these reports? 3. As this scandal raises concerns over food safety, how will these reports affect ongoing trade negotiations with Mercosur? Is it time to review the negotiations and withdraw meat from the trade negotiation agenda? End of question. I presented the question on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and now my short comment. We must use this situation to review our relationship with the rules and control system on the Brazilian side and clearly demand that the errors and shortcomings that occur there be removed. It is important for the Brazilian side to discover these irregularities, and according to information from Brazil, its services have been dealing with this matter for some time. It is a pity, however, that there was no cooperation with the EU in this respect. I believe that the review that I have mentioned may open up a new lease that needs to be included in the negotiations with Mercosur. In the Union, too, we must learn lessons and evaluate our control system. This situation should contribute to better relations in the future and respect by the Brazilian side of EU requirements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 163, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thanks largely to the solid set of legislation, which aims to ensure that food is safe for consumers, the European Union has probably the world’s highest food safety standards. Our European Union system imposes strict hygiene and safety controls on food imports, and in particular on animal products for which systematic documentary, identity and physical checks are compulsory. Immediately after the information became known about the deficiencies in food licensing in Brazil, on 17 March, and following the Commission’s advice, Member States – in addition to the existing documentary and identity controls – introduced reinforced physical controls to ensure the safety of imports from Brazil, focusing on food hygiene requirements. As soon as news came to light about the fraudulent practices in the Brazilian meat sector, the Commission asked the Brazilian authorities to ensure that there were no exports to the EU from any establishments in Brazil that could bear a risk of non-compliance with European Union requirements. We immediately introduced a request to ban the imports from establishments implicated in the scandal; we requested the reinforcement of control checks at EU borders and we made clear to the Brazilian authorities our dissatisfaction, including learning of this crisis in the media rather than through official channels. We continue to ensure that Member States authorities are continuously informed about the evolution of the situation; we are preparing urgent audits of Brazil. In addition, let me stress that all consignments currently en route to the EU from the establishments implicated in the fraud will be rejected and returned to Brazil. The importance of the controls on imports at the point of entry to the EU – at border inspection posts – is crucial. The Commission is in close contact with the Member States to ensure a harmonised approach as regards these reinforced checks. A full consensus was reached on these reinforced checks and on the way they should be selected. In particular, it was confirmed that there should be 100% physical checks on all consignments presented for import to the EU and 20% microbiological checks. It was also confirmed that importers would be liable for the cost of these reinforced checks. In the light of the outcome of these reinforced checks, the evolution of the situation and the response of the Brazilian authorities to the demands for corrective measures, the Commission and the Member States will decide whether further measures are necessary. In this regard, the protection of European consumers will be the determining factor. The Commission will also undertake audits of Brazil as soon as possible and not later than mid-May. I would like to use this opportunity to thank Members of the European Parliament for their recent vote in favour of the new official control legislation which will enable the Commission to ensure even more vigorous controls of imported food products. Let me also reassure you of my personal commitment to ensure the safety of European consumers. With this objective firmly in mind, I met with the Brazilian Minister of Agriculture, Mr Maggi, last Tuesday in Brazil. I had an open, long and frank discussion with the minister. I asked him to provide more information on the state of play and the next steps that he planned to take. I also stressed the need for Brazil to restore the trust, reliability, predictability and independence of the Brazilian official control system. In addition, I made a point of passing on to the Minister the positions and concerns of the Member States, as well as the requests coming from honourable Members of this Parliament. My services also had a meeting with Brazilian officials on 30 March to further discuss this matter. It was agreed that the minister would send more details about the findings of the investigation and the possible food safety impact. Important progress was also made on two other requests from the EU. First, the Brazilian authorities agreed on concrete steps to solve long-standing applications for export from the EU to Brazil, and to make the approval process more predictable. We also discussed how to improve our cooperation using the bilateral sanitary and phytosanitary mechanism. Second, in relation to avian influenza, Brazil also promised to accept the principle of regionalisation based on region of outbreak. Speaking about possible recognition of the EU as a single entity, the Brazilian counterparts showed some openings. However, more discussions will be needed. In addition, we discussed cooperation on antimicrobial resistance and animal welfare. Just today we received a letter from Minister Maggi informing us, and I quote: ‘the issues investigated by the federal police in the four establishments are authorised to export to the EU are related to conduct misbehaviour and economic fraud not representing any risk to food safety.’ The Minister also informed me of the modification of Brazilian legislation for the inspection of products of animal origin, among other things.   Turning to the negotiations with Mercosur, trade relations between the EU and Brazil currently take place within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. However, the proposed future agreement with Mercosur would not undermine our high safety requirements. Current as well as future imports from Mercosur countries will have to respect these requirements. This will not change. A future EU-Mercosur agreement will not lower our high regulatory standards for food safety. It will not authorise imports of agri-food products if they do not meet our high food safety requirements. The agreement will, however, reinforce cooperation with the authorities of Brazil and other Mercosur countries by means of updated provisions to establish solid information and notification systems in the sanitary and phytosanitary field. This would strengthen our reaction capacity via a privileged channel with the four countries concerned.   To conclude, let me emphasise that current and future imports into the EU will always have to meet the high quality and food standards established by our EU legislation and implemented through a credible certification and control system. Once again, a future EU-Mercosur agreement would not lower our high regulatory requirements and food safety standards for agricultural imports from Mercosur countries, including Brazil.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 164, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Mairead McGuinness", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his detailed response. However, I have just some comments to make. On our first question we did look for some details and I am not sure that you have provided us with the details we would like. This investigation, which is a criminal investigation, was going on for two years and in that time products that were unfit for purpose were placed on the market and we need more clarity about the extent of it, and where they were sent to.  The second point I would make is in relation to the return of products on the high seas. I have to say, if I were a Brazilian consumer and I heard that this product was being returned to Brazil I would be very frightened. I would want this product destroyed somewhere and to have a guarantee of that if there is any doubt about its quality, because insofar as I worry about European consumers I clearly would have a worry too about Brazilian consumers.  In relation to how this was discovered, probably the only good part of this story is that there was an investigation and the system was found wanting. It reveals an all too close relationship between the industry and those who are inspecting it, and it reveals that where an industry is very large, then it is very powerful. While I like what you are saying, that there would be no lowering of EU standards, these are very fine words but the problem is that if you have this type of activity in an industry that is supplying the European Union today, how can you guarantee that it will not continue tomorrow?

Instead, last week, the Commission released a joint statement with the Mercosur trading bloc committing us to concluding a deal as soon as possible. Not a single mention whatsoever in that statement of the complete breakdown in trust following the emergence of the meat scandal just ten days previously. It appears that revelations that rotten meat, meat treated with carcinogenic chemicals, meat mixed with cardboard, that had made its way into the EU under your watch, could not dampen the enthusiasm of this Commission to try to conclude dangerous and regressive trade deals. This time last year Commissioner Hogan told us that beef was temporarily off the table of these negotiations. But where is the follow-up timeline or detail of the conditions under which it will be brought back to the table? Where are the assurances for poultry, the sector which is actually the single largest category of meat consumed in Ireland, for example, and which faces far bigger Brazilian import quotas than even beef? What about the other sectors that stand to be impacted by cheaper, improperly treated agricultural products? Where are the assurances for consumers who should be confident that what they buy in the shops or order in the restaurants is properly treated?

Commissioner, you have acted relatively quickly on the case, but the question still arises: what did you do before? Were the controls effective? And you didn't answer the question: Has meat really made it onto the European market? You couldn't definitely answer that. This scandal is not just any trivial matter. Chemicals were added to rotten meat, the meat was contaminated with salmonella - an effective health hazard. That means that the highest level of alert is really announced. And the Commission is now doing a bit of business as usual and says: “No problem, we have it under control.” But the matter is more serious, especially because this scandal has shown that there is a system error in at least 21 production sites . Massive corruption, fraud, even in the highest government agencies - that's not even a small scandal, it's a scandal, so to speak, of the entire Brazilian sector. And that is why the question is: what conclusions do you draw? The subject of the Mercosur negotiations has already been raised several times today. There can be no business as usual here either, you have to draw conclusions. Because what will come of this is likely that consumer standards and safety standards will not rise, but rather that this area will be liberalized again and that consumer protection and the rights of small farmers are of secondary importance at Mercosur. I have to honestly say that I have no confidence in the Brazilian government either.

The Commission has failed in this duty. Several countries moved swiftly to ban Brazilian beef. Some have relaxed that ban, but we sat on our hands and failed our citizens and farmers again.

Me! I am responsible. I am required to do my best and to be responsible in this situation. I would like to continue my work in this style.  Of course it is not about a trade war, it is not about protectionism, I fully agree with all of you. It is about food safety, about trust, about reliability, predictability and effectiveness of official controls in Brazil and here. Of course the fraud was in Brazil, and we all know very well how it is difficult to detect fraud because we have our own experience when we are speaking about the horsemeat scandal. Now it is very difficult to detect fraud on the ground and the Brazilian police authorities did it. Of course we will ask the Minister once again to provide us with very informative, very detailed information. We will look at such a response from the Brazilian side. As you know, in Brazil they have only three states which have the right to use the European certificate. Twenty-one establishments were involved in this situation. Only four establishments were involved in that scandal.  Of course we will see how to monitor the situation. This is why we have asked to check, to reinforce controls here in the EU – because we are speaking about the past and not only about the future – but we will ask Member States to follow all situations and once again to provide very reliable information after official and enforced controls here in our Union.  Then we will ask also to see how to introduce stricter rules today. We organised two immediate meetings with senior officials, with senior veterinary officials and they all agreed about such a harmonised approach at the moment. As you know, we do not rule out the adoption too of further measures should the situation so require, be it through the outcome of the import controls, the Commission’s audit in Brazil or the information provided by Brazil, and I am ready to inform you after a few months about the situation because it is about food safety, about consumer protection, about our trust and reliability.  Of course, there is no doubt we will do our best in this way, but it is not about war between the EU and Brazil, about war between the EU and Mercosur. This is not the situation when we are speaking about a rule-based trade agreement. A rule-based trade agreement! You need to understand that the EU-Mercosur agreement must be based on rules and of course we will guarantee all possibilities to provide clear instruments to defend food safety standards.  Of course you ask me about statistics. Such statistics are available. I can send you this information additionally. Just to illustrate: in 2016 imports from Brazil of bovine animals meat was EUR 449 million and of poultry EUR 163 million. As I mentioned, of course, you also know that we have a rapid alert system and in this rapid alert system they have all the figures. I do not know about some figures which were mentioned here, they are not in line with our figures which we have in our rapid alert system.

Now there is another brief change, the individual areas of expertise being redistributed, Commissioner Vella. I also greet the representatives of the Maltese Presidency. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this report. That is certainly a very technical report, but it is also a very comprehensive and important report. And it is necessary that the regulation defining the information on fishing vessels be made very clear. Technical and physical information must be consistent. The current status of this information from the fishing vessels is summarized in this regulation. Every Member State has to submit a fleet report almost every year on its small, medium-sized and deep-sea fishing vessels, and for this they naturally also need precise information on how ships are measured, what propulsion power they have and similar things. Up until now, the information on fishing vessels was regulated in the 1986 regulation - at that time still EEC. But against the background of simplifying Union law, i.e. making it clearer and easier to understand, this legal act has of course now been codified in a new version, so to speak. That means a systematic summary of the law applicable to a certain area in a coherent body of law, so that one does not always have to merge it into different paragraphs. The material content of this codified legal act was retained in full, and it is only a necessary adjustment to the current status of the International Organization for Standardization, to which all member states belong. The regulation regulates the legal content, the definition of this information: length over all, width, the tonnage - that is, the gross tonnage - the displacement according to Archimedes, the engine power - that is, which bollard pull, which fishing device can be carried there with a corresponding towing power - and of course the ship register and the date when the ship was put into service. The same characteristics must be used for all member states in the European Union. Because these are of course things that are important, even when it comes to restrictions on very specific fishing areas, then fishing vessels up to eight meters - small artisanal fishing - of course have different options than those that are twelve meters and larger. Those over 15 meters must have an electronic log, they must have a vessel monitoring system and also the AIS, the automatic ship identification system. That is why it is necessary for us to come to an agreement on the conventions on which, so to speak, the Member States are also based: the 1969 International Ship Surveying Convention of London and also the International Convention on the Safety of Fishing Vessels and their Crew - that is the Convention from Torremolinos - both under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization. Alignment with the Treaty of Lisbon - I have already mentioned this - is necessary and entails a delegation of powers in the form of delegated acts. But here you especially have the engine power, the towing power in mind. The Commission originally requested that the delegated acts should not be time-limited. But we did that together in Parliament, for five years. It is a legal exercise, so to speak, and it is necessary that we address these characteristics of fishing vessels together. One more word on the amendment proposed by the GUE and my colleague Ní Riada. We discussed whether it is possible to include such an amendment. But unfortunately the big problem is that we're here fail to find a coherent adaptation.We see it as very difficult to define exactly what small fishing vessels are, which medium-scale and which deep-sea fishing vessels are, given the characteristics of the ships, where lengths and propulsion power are involved.I think we should look at the subject again in a different situation.Thank you all again, I look forward to the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 211, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would also like to thank my colleague, Werner Kuhn, the rapporteur on this file, for the very clear explanation that he has just given.

The Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying the law of the Union so as to make it clearer and more accessible and understandable to citizens.

One size does not fit all and while we have to continually reform the common fisheries policy we have to be cognisant of the fact that there are big and small countries, big and small fishing vessels, and that each of them must be considered and given their due regard, especially where we, the coastal communities of Ireland, are concerned.

For this reason, it provides legal certainty and clarity to all types of operations that are related in the Union to the exercise of the fishing profession. In order to achieve this, this Regulation has proceeded to establish a definition of all the parameters that serve to define and describe fishing boats, such as length, tonnage beam, date of entry into service and engine power, which it will allow these definitions to apply to all European Union fisheries rules. To make these definitions we have looked at the initiatives of specialized international organizations and, of course, for specific aspects such as engine power, at the standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that are usually applied to the measures that they are adopted in other sectors of activity. Finally, they are definitions consistent with the common fisheries policy, and this will allow us to give coherence to all the policies and all the regulations of this Chamber.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Liadh Ní Riada", "mepid": "124987", "text": "  thar ceann an Ghrúpa GUE/NGL. – A Uachtaráin, Táim tar éis leasuithe mar a luaigh an tUasal Coonan san áit chéanna a mholadh ar reachtaíocht iascaigh maidir le tréithriú agus sonrú árthaí iascaireachta.

Many thanks to my colleagues as shadow rapporteurs. I was also very pleased to incorporate constructive suggestions from you into this dossier. With the basic regulation, we repeatedly came to the point: How can we promote small-scale and artisanal fishing in a special way? And the definition, as Ricardo Serrão Santos said earlier, is highly complicated and very different from region to region. And Mrs Ní Riada, it is difficult to include in this very formal file - it is a regulation - now a definition of small-scale and artisanal fishing, fishing vessels centimeters in length over everything, displacement and engine power - that can be done in another country to be completely different than in Ireland - or to define large factory ships exactly what propulsion power they may have, what size, how much frost, catch and processing capacity, how much tonnage, how much fuel they are allowed to carry and, and, and. That is why I would make the proposal - because that is the only dissent we have on this dossier, on this regulation - that the coordinators meet at the next meeting or the next but one, perhaps with the support of the Commissioner, that an own-initiative report be drawn up on this and tries to define the definition - especially with regard to small-scale and small-scale fisheries and of course also medium-scale fishery vessels and of course deep-sea fishing vessels - in such a way that the individual Member States have the opportunity to make a clear regional distinction For small-scale and coastal fishing or deep-sea fishing vessels and also normal tugs that are over 15 meters where the vessel monitoring system is and the AIS, automatic information system, and maybe we'll get a solution there and take a step further.Many thanks again to everyone, the Commissioner, my rapporteurs, but also the Maltese Presidency, which as an island already has a lot of experience in fishing, but also in shipbuilding, and that made a particular impression on me as a shipbuilding engineer.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 223, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday, April 4, 2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 224, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The next order of the day is the report by Marijana Petir and Maria Lidia Senra Rodriguez, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on womenand their roles in rural areas (2016/2204 (INI)) (A8-0058 / 2017).", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 225, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Maria Lidia Senra Rodríguez", "mepid": "125049", "text": "rapporteur. - Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contributions and also the teams that made this report possible. In rural areas, different types of women live with different professions and, like all women, they suffer the consequences of a patriarchal system that oppresses, discriminates and makes them unfeasible. Despite the progress of the laws on equality, we see that there is a long way to go. Existing laws do not fully apply or are often implemented on a macho basis. This impeded the advancement of our rights. I hope that this report on women in rural areas will help to strengthen the fight and to move forward in terms of full recognition of the rights of rural women. The challenges are important: in the professional sphere, in that of conciliation, in the scope of public services and in the fight against macho violence. The wage gap between men and women persists and unemployment affects women to a greater extent. I am going to refer, above all, to the situation of women farmers. The policies of deregulation of production and markets, driven by the CAP, have caused the precariousness and loss of many jobs on farms and in rural areas. Failure to recognize shared ownership on family farms implies that only 30% of female farmers in the European Union own farms. All other women in this type of farm are deprived of the rights that derive from being the holder of the same. We are referring, for example, to economic income and CAP rights. These women also face difficulties in receiving aid under positive action measures to support working women, as has already been the case in many Member States. The way in which the CAP distributes aid, favoring large farms, it also harms women, who normally own smaller farms. For example, in 2013, on average, a farm managed by a woman is 8 hectares, compared to 20 hectares on farms managed by men, or 8 livestock units compared to 26 of men. But there is also the fact that many women farmers are not considered as such because they do not contribute to agricultural social security. Others, on the other hand, have a few years of contribution when they reach retirement age and this deepens the pension gap and brings higher levels of poverty to women. It is essential, therefore, to tackle this situation of discrimination and insecurity for women at the root if we really want to keep the farms that are the fundamental economic base for the development of a living rural environment. It is proposed in this report the need for Member States and the Commission to bet on shared ownership in family farms, namely through the drafting of laws aiming at their establishment and their effective application where it already exists. The participation of women in all areas of decision-making, such as institutions, unions, cooperatives and also in the negotiation processes must be guaranteed. Public and quality services should target the countryside, education, health, social services, transport or postal services. To conclude, I would like to say that it is essential to provide the rural environment with instruments for the implementation of measures aimed at preventing and eradicating sexist violence and that support and counseling services be guaranteed for women affected by this violence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 226, "date": "2017-04-03.json", "name": "Marijana Petir", "mepid": "124749", "text": "rapporteur. - Madam President, women living in rural areas deserve our full attention and our full commitment. Their problems are real and in order to understand them, we need to understand the diverse role of women in rural areas. They take care of the family, preserve tradition and the environment, work in agriculture, which is one of the most important economic branches of every country, participate in the process of food production. Women in rural areas are invaluable for their family farms, they are also important for the development of entrepreneurship, sustainable development, as well as overall economic development. But they are not a homogeneous group, so I advocate a specific approach to their diverse roles. Women in rural areas do not have good access to education, computer literacy is weak, and the availability of the Internet is still very low. Also, due to the distance of specialist doctors and unavailable diagnostics, in most cases women come to the doctor only in the advanced stage of the disease, which is unfortunately sometimes too late for them. In the countryside, there is usually no adequate social, communal and communal infrastructure that is necessary for a dignified life. Women make up less than 50% of the total working age population in rural areas of the European Union and manage only 30% of family farms. During 2014, women accounted for about 35% of total working time in agriculture, which is a significant contribution to agricultural production, and in addition, farms take care of the family and household, which is often characterized as \"invisible\" work. Women in the countryside are often economically dependent on their husbands. There are no working hours for them, and they also struggle with the lack of basic social and pension rights, such as significantly lower pensions or unpaid maternity leave. Almost half of them never go on holiday, and participate to a very small extent in decision-making processes at the local and regional level. No member state The European Union has not yet established a thematic sub-program for women in rural areas, such as the one for young farmers, although this is provided for by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, which is a clear indication that women in rural areas are simply not valued enough. This Report recognizes the invaluable contribution that women make to the rural economy and encourages Member States to make more and more synergistic use of the instruments available under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader + and the European Social Fund. Women need easier access to land and all social rights they do not currently have because their work on the family farm is not recognized and valued, so the professional status of rural women needs to be regulated. I hope that this Report will help raise awareness of the problems faced by women in rural areas and that in this sense it will be a step towards solving them.

I know many small and small municipalities that manage to support these services, to create a better environment, precisely with the support of European Union funds or government programs. I think this is a good example of how the better position of women can be addressed. I consider the special view from the point of view of women on this issue to be rather artificial, but I respect it.

The strength of support for your joint report reflects the fact that you have accurately identified the challenges faced by women in rural areas.  The Commission welcomes the report in terms of its recognition of the contribution that women make to the rural economy, and also of the opportunities for women both on- and off-farm. Gender equality is a fundamental EU value. As policymakers, we have a responsibility to ensure that the rights of women are fully protected and to enable women to realise their potential. This needs both legislative and non-legislative action. We are committed to mainstreaming the gender perspective into all policy areas and to promote gender equality in the preparation and implementation of EU programmes. This includes the CAP, the rural development policy, which is an essential element of the wider policies supporting both on-farm and off-farm investment to ensure the vitality and viability of our rural communities. The report emphasises the importance of the family farm model, which frequently involves the participation of all family members and often as many as three generations. The modernised and simplified CAP will continue to foster and support European family farms. We need to provide opportunities to young men and women who wish to live and work in rural communities, so that they can make the most of their potential. Attractive rural communities will help generate balanced territorial development.  We also recognised the need to do more in relation to the roll-out of rural broadband, which is essential if we are going to encourage those who wish to live and those who wish to work in rural communities. Women have always played a huge role on family farms, even if not always adequately rewarded financially. Today, the numbers of women wishing to enter farming in Europe has probably never been higher, yet there are persistent barriers to entry that prevent many young men and women from taking up farming, and women face particular problems. The Cork 2.0 Declaration on a better life for rural areas includes strong messages that rural areas must be attractive places for people in which to live and to work throughout the different stages of life.  Your report addresses itself to the Commission and to the Member States. We must all take our respective responsibilities in formulating a comprehensive and considered response, and I trust that the Member States will take careful note of the report’s observations and recommendations. Honourable Members, this report reminds us all of the essential role that women play in rural areas and throughout society.

Within the EU, family farms dominate, where nearly 80% of work is performed by family members. Taking into account that in rural areas only 60% of women have official employment, this means that a large part of them perform the so-called invisible work. This is a serious problem because very often they are not covered by the social security system and do not have their own financial resources. This in turn makes them dependent on their husbands and partners throughout their lives. Therefore, within the EU, we should consider how to solve this problem. Competences in this area generally belong to the Member States, but it would be worth thinking about introducing a system of incentives to institutionalize the work of women and other family members, as well as creating a mechanism for the exchange of good practices between Member States, within the framework of the common agricultural policy. Some European countries have already noticed the problem of \"invisible\" work by women and there are various solutions in them, including, for example, differentiating legal statuses of spouses working on family farms. A good example is France, where family members can have the status of manager, associate or employee. Giving official professional status is one of the possibilities to strengthen the financial independence of women and guarantee them higher pensions.
