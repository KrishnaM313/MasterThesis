March 22 was a black day for Belgium, a black day for Europe. Insidious murderers carried out a horrific series of terror attacks in Brussels. Thirty-two innocent people are dead, 340 innocent people are injured, some of them very serious – that is the record of this cruelty, a record of inhumanity. The criminals of ISIS, with their attacks, targeted the heart of Europe, Brussels, which offers a home to the European institutions and many other institutions, Brussels, this multilingual, cosmopolitan and tolerant city that embodies our open European society. Above all, however, the gang of murderers targeted the innocent people of Brussels. Attacks on public places such as airports or subways are targeted at innocent people – against men, against women, even against children. The cynical calculus of such assassins is to fear the whole of Brussels, the whole of Belgium, the whole of Europe, so that fear and hatred will conquer our hearts. That is why we must remain calm, not place every Muslim under general suspicion, and not equate Islam with the primitive Islamism of the murderers. That is why, in memory of the victims as Europeans, we must stand together in solidarity against this fear, not let ourselves be infected by the hatred of the assassins, not to the hatred of hatred with hatred, not to respond to violence with violence, but to combat a growing distrust, a growing fear, also by courageousness and cohesion with the aim of defending the freedom of all and our democracy and of respecting and protecting the dignity of all people on principle. We must not forget that people around the world are becoming victims of these jihadists almost every day: in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Somalia, Nigeria. In all these countries, in recent months, innocent people have often become hundreds of victims of these terrorists, and their lives have been taken away. This list is not even complete. Let us not delude ourselves: this terror is global. And by the way, most of the victims of this terror are Muslims. This terror is a global challenge and we will not be able to respond to it through individual national measures. The fight against terrorism means that we stand together – all of them – in Europe together and in the world. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which On behalf of the European Parliament, I wish the injured a speedy recovery and express our full solidarity with the families and families of the innocently murdered people. Our deepest sympathies go out to the victims and their families. We will not forget the victims of this terror in Brussels and elsewhere in the world, we must not forget them. I would ask you to stand for a minute's silence in memory of the victims.

Discrimination against Roma is still widespread across the EU. Anti-Gypsyism, a specific form of racism closely related to deep-rooted negative stereotyping and stigmatisation of Roma, is on the rise. It is linked to the rise of radicalism and extremism in general in the EU. This trend raises serious concerns. It is crucial to take a strong stand and to do our best to stop these negative phenomena, which are incompatible with the values cherished by the European Union. The Commission has put in place a solid framework of policy, legal and financial instruments which, if implemented properly, should produce results on the ground. The Commission has stepped up its efforts to ensure the correct implementation of legislation to combat discrimination against Roma. The Commission has also urged Member States to demonstrate greater political will and a long-term vision to combat discrimination and promote the inclusion of Roma people. The inclusion of minorities in education, the labour market and political life is one of the main ingredients of a healthy society. This year the Commission launched a targeted campaign to effectively tackle stereotypes and prejudices against the Roma, called ‘For Roma, with Roma’. It includes training for the media and close collaboration with municipalities in selected Member States. The fight against discrimination against Roma and anti-Gypsyism – including hate speech and hate crime targeting the Roma community – is included in the Commission’s annual reporting on the progress made in advancing Roma integration, as well as in the Council recommendations on effective Roma integration measures, the first ever EU legal instruments specifically referring to Roma. The Commission has welcomed and strongly supported the initiative of the European Parliament to designate 2 August as European Roma Holocaust Memorial Day. The Commission has also encouraged Member States to do the same. It is our duty to acknowledge and remember all those who suffered under the Nazi regime, including Roma. The suffering of Roma in concentration camps is a horrific chapter of human history that is less widely known. The Commission will support the European Parliament in its action to bring the European Parliament resolution to the Council for further discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Preşedinte. –", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   No on-demand interventions are made in this debate and blue card is not accepted.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "György Hölvényi", "mepid": "124715", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, it is my honour and a real privilege to share my hopes regarding the International Roma Day on behalf of my Group, the European People’s Party. Roma affairs have social, human and economic aspects all at once. These affairs are not less important than they have been up to now. Not less important than they were in 2011, when – during the Hungarian Presidency – a project called Roma Strategy was launched. Hungary is proud of having called the attention of the community to those European Roma competitors who should be considered as human resources but often have no chance to prove it. Youngsters from the Roma population have to face extra difficulties if they want to break out of their cultural or material circumstances, which are ruled by the strict tradition and tight bonds of their community. Even if they manage to overcome these factors, they have to face the discriminating prejudices of society. The Roma population needs special aid in this effort to be able to overcome these disadvantages and other complexes. Our task is to form the attitude in society to be more respectful and adapting. The European Union’s main duty is to create the professional framework through special programmes focusing on this issue. That is why the Roma strategy has called on the Member States to refuse all kinds of segregation, discrimination and racism. These Roma programmes and invested resources can be refunded only if we take action together with them on the basis of common decisions. We have to bring together not only Roma but also non-Roma if we want to create sustainable projects. It is of great importance that the culture and history of Roma should be integrated in the education of the youth and that the new generation does not grow up without any knowledge or with false information concerning the 10 million Roma citizens in Europe. Europe has decided to face what it has missed so far and will pay attention to creating equal opportunities and providing early childhood aid, which is the most important action, even if the results are apparent only much later. This is how targeted school and pre-school programmes started in the Member States, and this was the way to give more and more Roma children the chance to get help from early childhood. As we open the doors for schools wider and wider, likewise we have to open the gates of the churches as well, so that a receptive and solidarity-based spirit can pervade Roma communities. Let us be proud of Roma intelligence; let us give Roma youngsters the opportunity to obtain degrees, and let us create the circumstances for them to work among us. In Europe, the unique Hungarian Roma college network serves as a good example to help hundreds of Roma students to get a degree. Among them are doctors, researchers, teachers and artists. We started this work together; let us continue together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Soraya Post", "mepid": "124997", "text": "  On the other: And on the S&amp;D Group. Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Last year, at this time, we debated a resolution on the fight against and recognition of anti-Gypsyism and the EU's recognition of the holocaust of Roma during the Second World War. Parliament adopted the resolution by a very broad majority. With this resolution, Parliament has clearly shown the way in which to work to ensure that Roma can enjoy equal rights within the EU – in short, in order for Roma to be treated as human beings. Anti-Gypsyism is a disgrace to Europe. In the debate with the Council and the Commission, everyone agreed that anti-Gypsyism should be combated by all means. Today is the time to start discussing how to do it. Social measures are not enough. We must fight against this particular form of racism. So we need to work towards the mainstream society. Parliament has asked two oral questions on which this debate is based. They deal with what the Commission and the Council should do to ensure that the Member States take concrete and effective measures to combat this particular form of racism, anti-Gypsyism. The Council and the Member States must set ambitious and concrete targets for their work which the Commission can evaluate. Otherwise, nothing will happen. The Commission must establish a High Representative against racism to ensure that work against all forms of racism is a priority in the Member States, especially since today we are seeing racism and racists entering our parliaments. Finally, I have a specific question for the Council. When will you confirm the establishment of 2 August as the European Day of Remembrance for the Holocaust of the Roma? I am thinking that Parliament has done its part, and now you too must do your part. Last week we celebrated International Roma Day all week, Roma Week, by a large majority, the broad participation of the various political groups. We had party leader debate, we had exhibitions, we had various seminars to just note that despite national strategies, the inclusion of the Roma does not work. We need to turn the pancake around a little, we also have to work against the majority society. There is a change in attitudes. Politicians and people on the bus are without shame expressing themselves negatively towards the Roma across Europe. I was in Berlin on April 8th. I had several different meetings with different participants. I watched movies. In at least a thousand camps across Europe, Roma settle without access to electricity, without access to water, without access to schools for children, without any access to medical care. The situation is catastrophic. If we do not act now, Europe will have to stand with a very long nose and receive a great deal of shame from the rest of the world. It is not acceptable for us, in a modern democratic society, to continue to have 10-12 million people living below the poverty line. It's a great shame. We have to act now, we can't wait. The far-right forces are exploiting this group to the maximum and are actually winning voters because we established political parties are not taking hold of the issue as we should. We in the Socialist Group have set up a programme. We've positioned ourselves. We will not accept this. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the political group leaders who took part in the debate. Everyone was there except from the ALDE group, which had some kind of obstruction. However, the other parties clearly showed that they stand up to ensure that the Roma issue is on the political agenda, despite all the other difficult challenges we face. So now I would like the Commission to take this issue seriously. It is not acceptable in 2016 that we go into next year without having done anything. Now something has to be done. This is not acceptable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 16, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Jana Žitňanská", "mepid": "124901", "text": "  for the ECR Group. – Slovakia is one of the European countries with a large Roma minority. It is estimated that today it accounts for about 9% of the population. A large proportion of Roma are dependent on the social system as a result of low education and unemployment, and also face difficult situations in life because of poverty, discrimination and established stereotypes. Roma children are more often than not in special schools, and Roma employment is only about 10% compared to 60% for non-Roma. Many Roma have already resigned themselves to finding a job, children are losing motivation to learn. Despite the funds available from the state budget, as well as The European Funds, it turns out that the state has long been unable to integrate the excluded Roma. I believe that civic associations, churches and, in particular, local leaders, who deserve our recognition and can inspire many others in their communities will play a fundamental role in this process. That is why it is important to create the conditions for them to work, to support them financially, but also to make them more visible. I am therefore glad that last week, in the European Parliament, they solemnly unveiled a travelling statue of a Slovak Roma and his colleagues. John onions have an incredible life story. From the settlement he developed to his own medical practice in Switzerland and was one of the nine initiators of the first Roma World Congress. On this occasion, therefore, we are already commemorating Roma World Day for the 45th year. Mr Onion was convinced that only the association of Roma elites would help to break down the barriers between Roma and non-Roma, which unfortunately still exist in society to this day. None of us have chosen whether to be born healthy or disabled, whether to come to a wealthy family or to a family living in poverty in one of the populations. However, without outside help, it will not get out of the vicious circle of poverty and exclusion. The sooner we manage to cut through this circle, the more it will benefit not only the Roma themselves, but our entire society.

Much more needs to be done not only to fight discrimination and stereotypes against Roma people, but also to support their socio-economic integration. This is the key to delivering on equality for all. The European Union and the Member States have committed to this, but if you look at the reality on the ground, we are far from living up to our standards. Forced evictions, segregation and discrimination in access to jobs, education, housing and health care cannot be tolerated any more in our Union. We cannot be satisfied with national strategies for Roma integration on paper only.

Mr President, I would like to thank the International Roma Day is really bad for folklore afternoons and not for half-empty halls, as we are seeing here. Rather, it is an opportunity to understand – really understand – that Roma have lived in Europe for centuries – more than 600 years. And I think that 600 years is enough to be considered native, as a neighbour, as a work colleague and – I may say so at least for the European left – as friends.  The latter is not difficult for us, because Roma are genuine citizens of the world, not only because they have never, and at no time, initiated any war, but because Roma have enriched and enriched society in many countries of the world and still do so today, they shape it, like the Canadian writer Ronald Lee, the Austrian jazz guitarist Harri Stojka, the cosmopolitan and civil rights activist Romani Rose, the singer Marianne Rosenberg, the boxer Johann Wilhelm Trollmann, who, like 500 million Roma and Sinti, was killed by the Hitler fascists in the concentration camp during World War II.  I have really spoken to Roma a lot in recent years, and again and again they have told me one thing: 'What we want is actually quite simple. We do not want our own state, nor do we insist on any particular religion. We want to be able to live where we live. We want to live like everyone else, we want to work, we want to start families, we want to grow old, we also want to die in this family round. We do not want privileges, no extra treatment. Dignity, that is what we want. We want to be treated equally,\" they say again and again, \"have equal opportunities and, please, don't have to be afraid to say what we are: Roma.\"  The fact that today's Roma still have to explain that they really are human beings, that they really want to live in peace, that they do not just see themselves as musicians and certainly do not steal white children, but that they certainly have a problem with them when they are deported from Germany to Kosovo after 17 years, to a country where they have no livelihood, which is by no means a safe country for them – all this is one of the really great impositions of our time – a time when racism is booming again.  Fighting for an unbiased and dignified world under such conditions is not so easy for the many larger, but above all for the many small Roma organisations and initiatives, but really difficult. That is another reason why I take this opportunity today to thank them, not to repeat the whining and fuss of integration, to thank them, to all those who are waging this tireless struggle every day, such as Amaro Drom in Berlin, the Roma Centre in Göttingen, the defenders – this is very close to my heart – of the Roma Parliament in Budapest, the Gitanos in Spain, the many, many Roma initiatives in Bulgaria, Whenever there is talk of integrating new Roma, these initiatives do not talk about it, they make it quite easy. They show what is really at stake: the indivisibility of human rights, for which there is no precondition but one thing: to be a human being.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Terry Reintke", "mepid": "103381", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, dear colleagues, and especially dear Roma all over Europe, International Roma Day is a day to commemorate the atrocities and the persecution that Roma have been facing for hundreds of years on this continent. But it is also a day to think about the injustices that Roma still face every day in Europe. The past – but also our present – makes it very clear that we hold responsibility. We hold responsibility to create a fully-inclusive European Union and to fight against anti-Gypsyism and for equal rights for all. We can make a difference today. We can shape the politics of anti-discrimination. We can create a society that gives equal chances with regard to housing, employment, education and health. As dry as it very often seems, the EU structural funds are one of the instruments at our disposal in order to do this. But we even need to go further, because the fight against discrimination does not end with merely shaping policies. It needs to go very deep in our mainstream society. To give just one example, there are 11 million Roma living in the European Union. There is a great diversity amongst this community. Yet still, when I open the newspaper, I see stereotypical images of Roma every single day. This does not represent their great diversity and this will not be a step in order to fight against anti—Gypsyism in the European Union. Lastly, in my struggle, together with Roma activists, I have again and again been thanked for what I am doing, and I hear them thank the Commission for fighting for equal rights.  I want to take this opportunity to say that I do not want to be thanked any more, because actually we are the ones who should be grateful. We are the ones who should be grateful for the richness that Roma culture represents within Europe and for the power of Roma activists within the political debates.

He was typical of many of his kith and kin. Never held back by his own illiteracy, he was streetwise, shrewd and incredibly tough. As I am believed to be the only British parliamentarian of Romani descent, I am proud to champion the real concerns facing a community living on the margins of UK society. On Roma Nation Day I met with representatives of the International Romani Union, the Gypsy Council and Traveller Movement groups outside 10 Downing Street in London. I then hand-delivered a letter outlining my concerns over recent changes in UK planning legislation redefining a legal personality of a Traveller, thus placing increased difficulties on my community, who already face a massive shortage of site provision. I also asked for the appointment of Romanies to the UK Holocaust Commission, as the current absence from membership, despite the Nazi genocide that cost some half a million lives, is felt as another instance of exclusion.

I endorse every word you have said. I have to think about many of the things which you have raised here. Soraya Post said that we need to do a lot and we need to do it now. I think the situation is worse, because we are doing a lot – we have done a lot, we have invested a lot – and it obviously is not working because the situation is not improving. On the contrary, the situation is worsening. Now, with the worsening of the whole atmosphere in Europe and with increasing intolerance, the Roma people are among the first to be attacked, mocked and abused. That is why we have to do better. I am thinking deeply about where the barriers are and why we are not able to achieve better results in terms of including Roma citizens. I can see three main problems. One problem is resortism. We need to tackle all four areas with one series of well—targeted actions: health protection, labour, social protection and education, giving a helping hand to children and families with children. We see in Member States that these sectors are dealt with by different ministries, and they themselves say that they understand and they need common action. This is already being reflected in the national strategies. I hope that a solution can be found soon. The second problem is that I have a feeling that we are implementing this policy for the Roma but without their participation. We need to involve them more because action cannot be taken without them. Here it is necessary to give more support to the NGOs – some Members also said this – and local communities which are in everyday contact with Roma people. I have always criticised the fact that NGOs are only given financing for one year at a time, because NGOs are not the only ones working for the inclusion of Roma. We have to tackle the permanent problem of finance. They keep looking for money to maintain their activities, and so we should also look at the financing of NGOs, because financing for at least three years would help their projects become more sustainable. The last problem which I see is that EU funding should be better used. Again we are speaking about short-term projects, but longer-term action is necessary to change the situation, because the task ahead of us is not a trivial one. We want to change the stereotypes and prejudices in society, and this cannot be done in the short term and with badly-chosen instruments. So let us all work together on this, and let us be brave enough to admit that what we are doing is not working.

It really has been a tremendous honour for me, over many years now, to be able to play my part in helping to develop the way in which we carry out our legislation-making processes. Of course, I cannot do it alone, and I must acknowledge and thank all of my shadow rapporteurs who have helped me for many years now: Tadeusz Zwiefka, Mady Delvaux, Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, António Marinho e Pinto and, of course, colleagues like Angelika Niebler, who is currently leaving the Chamber as I am addressing you all. Colleagues, this is really a pivotal point for the European Union and, indeed, for my country – the United Kingdom – as well. I firmly believe that Britain and the European Union are stronger together, and I hope that, through our proposals, we can cement the relationship between this Parliament and our national parliaments. Britain’s input in the European Union, I believe, benefits the entirety of Europe. But this may be one of the last occasions that I, as an MEP, am actually able to put forward proposals of this sort, because we are about to undergo a referendum in the UK that, at this stage, remains far too close to call. What concerns do our constituents, our citizens, actually have on this particular topic? Well, they may not recognise the details that we attach and the names we attach, but they quite frequently say to all of us that the European Union is too distant, that it is doing far too much, and that what it does applies to far too many people unnecessarily. And we, as a Parliament, must address these pivotal issues. It is important for our own democratic accountability. In particular, if these reforms are rejected, we play into the hands of those who ultimately want to break the European Union and weaken all of our citizens. We must not allow that to happen. It is in that spirit that our national leaders came to an agreement and have put that forward for us to consider, in accordance with how we wish to proceed. Is the European Union’s law-making too distant? Well the role of national parliaments, and coupled with that, their responsibility and rights: we must bring national parliaments much closer to our EU decision-making processes. It is only by doing that that we strengthen them and we strengthen ourselves. Indeed, I have to confess that my own House of Commons EU Scrutiny Committee is not the best example of how EU legislation should be scrutinised, and I certainly do not recommend that as a way forward. Is the European Union doing too much? Well, we must have Europe only where necessary. Subsidiarity – reasoned opinions from national parliaments – has increased, but not all of our parliaments are fully engaged. The Impact Assessment Board itself has said that subsidiarity is not adequately addressed in our impact assessments. In my report, I also encourage more participation of national parliaments in the preparation of EU legislation, such as green papers or white papers. This could also include annual debates for each national parliament with the European Commission. The yellow card procedure in the Treaties should be easily implementable for national parliaments, since there are several circumstances in which difficulties have been reported. An extension to the eight-week time period for consultation with national parliaments under the subsidiarity check should be furthered. I have a number of other proposals which I will go into, but I will save those for when I come back at the end of the debate. But my final plea to colleagues is this: we have nothing to be frightened of when we say we want to empower ourselves and national parliaments to work much more closely to ensure that we, ultimately, are delivering legislation which is seen as relevant and proper by our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Karim for his excellent report on the Commission’s report for 2012-2013 on subsidiarity and proportionality. For the Commission, subsidiarity and proportionality must be at the heart of the European democratic process: the very key to our objective of being big on the big things and small on the small things. We have committed to give real effect to the principle of subsidiarity and to work closely with national parliaments and other EU institutions to enhance our common understanding of subsidiarity and ensure that every proposal complies with that principle. National parliaments play a key role when it comes to monitoring respect for the principle of subsidiarity. In that regard, the report calls on the Commission to deepen its relations with the national parliaments and to engage in a yearly debate with each national parliament. The Juncker Commission pledged to forge a new partnership with national parliaments, in particular by increasing the frequency of Commissioners’ visits to national parliaments. Since taking office in November 2014, Commissioners have made more than 270 visits to national parliaments. The Commission intends to continue the frequency of these visits, explaining what we do and why we do it and listening to the concerns of national parliaments. The report also suggests revising the guidelines for impact assessments. In May 2015 the Commission adopted the Better Regulation Package. This new framework includes a range of measures to make Commission policy-making more transparent and evidence-based. It comprises improved guidelines, both for ex-ante impact assessments and the retrospective evaluation of already-existing legislation. The revised guidelines also include strengthened guidance both on subsidiarity and proportionality analysis, as well as a dedicated tool for the legal basis of a given proposal and its subsidiarity and proportionality aspects. Furthermore, the package sets up a new regulatory scrutiny board responsible for reviewing the quality of impact assessments and of major evaluations. The board is also responsible for recommending improvements in case particular aspects, including subsidiarity or proportionality, have not been duly taken into account. This brings me to the comments in the report calling on all institutions to ensure that subsidiarity checks are also undertaken at the conclusion of the legislative negotiation before the adoption of the final text. The Commission is very pleased that the three institutions have recently agreed on a new inter-institutional agreement on better law-making. The agreement puts renewed focus on ensuring that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are given full respect when developing Union legislation and assessing its impacts. The agreement not only obliges the Commission to explain in its explanatory memoranda how the measures proposed are justified in the light of the principle of subsidiarity, but now provides that the European Parliament and the Council will, when they consider it appropriate and necessary, carry out impact assessments in relation to any substantial amendments they make to the Commission’s initial proposal. The Commission is pleased that all the institutions have jointly committed to ensuring that subsidiarity is a key element throughout the legislative process. Let me conclude by reassuring all Members that the Commission will make sure that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality remain at the heart of the European democratic process. We look forward to working with the other EU institutions under the new inter-institutional framework to ensure that every piece of legislation respects the principle of subsidiarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Kazimierz Michał Ujazdowski", "mepid": "23791", "text": "  draftss author of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Colleagues, i would like to thank you for your excellent work. I would also like to thank Mr Karim very warmly for this report, and for the analytical part, and for this reform part, because it is indeed a very British report, in the best sense of the word, which he says: you have to be consistent. Yes, if we say a, we must also say b, so we cannot be content with the current state of affairs and the fact that the European institutions declare that they respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. There needs to be more consistency in this case, because the thing is not abstract. The implementation of the subsidiarity principle is a good law, and a frugal good law without centralism, without arbitrariness, without excessive bureaucracy, is more energy and competitiveness in Europe and in the Member States.  I therefore believe that we should learn from this and really consider extending the period during which national parliaments can apply the principle of subsidiarity to strengthen them. I would also be very pleased for The United Kingdom to stay in the European Union and for us to be able to use a red card mechanism that will allow national parliaments to block bad legislation. Finally, uniform criteria are needed. Uniform criteria, on the other hand, require the cooperation of national parliaments of various, all European Union countries and greater courage and openness on the part of the European Parliament, which should not regard national parliaments as competitors.

However, this issue is also not without impact on trade policy. That is why I would like to sum up the debate we have had in INTA.  First of all, the issue of the SDS, a well-known issue that has fuelled and continues to fuel a number of potential conflicts between the Powers of the Union and the judicial sovereignty of the Member States.  Secondly, the issue of macro-financial assistance. More ex ante and ex-post controls are needed, in particular to assess the proportion of assistance we offer to our partners while at the same time strengthening Parliament's control.  Thirdly, there are the issues of transparency and impact assessments of international treaties, making them sincere, reliable and consistent. The involvement of enterprises at this stage and especially of small and medium-sized enterprises, as called for in the INTA opinion, remains crucial.

I have had great pleasure for many years working with Mr Karim on the annual reports on subsidiarity and proportionality in the process of creating EU law, and every time there are new proposals or in-depth analyses of what we should do. It would be worth while to achieve their effective implementation, because it will undoubtedly have a very good impact on the quality of the law we create.  The principle of subsidiarity and proportionality is an absolutely fundamental principle in the process of EU legislation, I would say that this is the starting point for the creation of Community law. Especially now, at a time when many of our Member States are getting stronger and stronger anti-EU accents, questions arise: why is the European Union needed when it creates a complicated law when there is overregulation. Why does this happen at all?  Applying the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality – as Mr Karim recommends, together with a very well-conducted impact assessment process – is something that we should be exposing in our action, which should include in understanding the essence of European law-making not only european citizens, but also European entrepreneurs, so that they understand why Community law is an added value and not something that we create for ourselves. Hence the important role of involving national parliaments to participate more in the creation of this right and to make them want to be more active at the stage of expressing their views on new proposals. This applies both to the proposal submitted by the European Commission and to the very law of the final effect of the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council. I believe that the deadline for submitting such proposals in justified situations should indeed be extended, we should strengthen the role of national parliaments. That is why the innovative proposal put forward by colleague Karim to introduce a so-called Green Card, which would allow national parliaments to make very legitimate and very sensible proposals already to the European Commission, seems to me to be extremely well founded.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 36, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Mady Delvaux", "mepid": "124776", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S and D. - Mr President, Commissioner, I think we all agree that we are in agreement to reiterate how important the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are for us to form a Union close to the citizens. These principles are necessary and useful to the smooth running of the European Union, and I say, the right thing is going on. These principles are in no way intended to prevent the Union from acting effectively. The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality must be finely calibrated in relation to the need for efficiency in the work of our institutions, so as to achieve the right balance. However, I believe that the report as presented to us threatens this fragile and yet essential balance for the proper functioning of the Union. And I cannot bring myself to have the founding principles serve the aims of the Eurosceptics. In the name of respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, this report calls for the creation of additional steps in our legislative process. These steps add to the bureaucratic burden that already weighs on our institutions and the application of such procedures has the effect of slowing down or even blocking the European legislative process.  However, we owe our citizens an effective Union, which takes into account their concerns, a union that is efficient in the service of their interests, a flexible Union capable of responding promptly to the challenges imposed on it, an ever closer Union between peoples, capable of reacting in a common way to circumstances with mutual respect.

And only when they can't, this problem should go to Berlin. And only if Berlin cannot solve it should it go to Brussels. Unfortunately, this House is constantly violating this. One of the main reasons for the violation of the principle of subsidiarity is the single euro, ladies and gentlemen, because it automatically leads to the exact opposite, namely centralisation, and this centralisation increasingly alienates Europeans from Brussels. It is increasingly leading to a lack of competitiveness in the euro area and, above all, to right-wing radicalism.

Thank you, Mr President. I would like to begin by welcoming the rapporteur to commend the work he has done in this report. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. One of the most serious problems of the European Union today is the removal of citizens and even some Member States, from the Union institutions themselves. I believe that Mr Karin's report is part of this problem, and it seeks with rigour and seriousness, to bring about a good application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. To that extent, it will contribute decisively to the prestigious institutions of the Union and to bringing them closer to the citizens. Bringing the European Union closer to the citizens and not pushing it away.  It is important that laws are understandable and their process is simple and accessible to the majority of citizens, on behalf of those who act here and intervene here. The results of the European elections show that citizens are increasingly separated from the Union itself, from the Community institutions themselves. In this regard, I would like once again to welcome Mr Karin's work and to commend his efforts to combat this problem, this issue, in the European Union. I support the report, I will vote in favour and I have only one small question here which, moreover, is practically outdated, which was the possibility of extending the deadline for national parliaments to speak, extending that deadline from eight to twelve weeks. I agree extending the deadline will allow the reports and a more thorough and reasoned analysis by those for national parliaments and this will honor the European Union itself. I would like, however, to say that the Treaty does not provide for such a possibility, but the Council, the Member States unanimously approved this extension of that period and, therefore, I think that the issue is over, in the near future, this should be introduced into the Treaty itself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 39, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Paloma López Bermejo", "mepid": "125047", "text": "  GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, as you know, but a large number of Europeans are unaware, the European Parliament is the only democratically elected institution but does not write European laws. And the reason is not coincidental. The Treaties themselves intended to prevent the working majority from being able to directly transfer their social demands on legislation, by ceding that competence to the Commission.  Moreover, even after hearing Parliament's voice, it is the governments of the States that must again approve it by showing their co-responsibility in the neoliberal and deregulatory agenda that currently dominates Europe.  The complexity and lack of legitimacy in this way of legislating and governing are at the heart of the debate today: the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are supposed to bring some clarity to the European legislative process, but it is in practice vague principles, as you yourself admit, which are interpreted to the taste of the legislature.  Let me say that the guiding principle of European politics is another: neoliberalism. I can illustrate this with examples of your own report: you are talking about subsidiarity, that national parliaments can decide sovereignly on their policies, but as soon as they start talking about the countries intervened by the troika, such precautions are forgotten.

It also contains a number of rather poor proposals for an excessive number of impact assessments. I will start by talking about what is problematic about this report. Impact assessments are not as easy to do as you might think. It is easy to produce figures – not necessarily accurate figures but figures – for how much it will cost a company to implement, for example, good new environmental legislation. However, it is more difficult to find out how much the socio-economic benefits are from a proposal. Impact assessments risk being skewed in the direction of doing nothing. To have impact assessments before, during and after work has been made on a proposal, as proposed in this report, is far too much of an impact assessment, and that would cause problems for the EU's ability to act. The good things in the report are about making the EU's subsidiarity control work, getting the yellow card that is not used at all to the extent that it should today. 15 of the parliaments in the EU's 28 Member States hardly use it at all. There are things that we can do here to make subsidiarity and proportionality control work. We could take and extend the time that parliaments have to do so. We could take and introduce a green card, so that parliaments have the opportunity to present their own proposals to the Commission that the Commission can look at.

How very decent of you to actually concede that some laws should be made by democratic nation states and not the EU. Say something about subsidiarity. I might be wrong but I seem to remember about 24 or 25 years ago, when the Treaty on European Union was progressing, somebody suggested that there should be a cash prize for anybody that could actually define subsidiarity and describe how it would work in practice. As far as I know nobody ever won. Proportionality is a bit late when the EU now controls most areas of domestic policy, and most of our laws now come from the EU, down to the wattage in electric kettles, toasters and vacuum cleaners. We recently saw the British Prime Minister on his hands and knees begging the EU to allow him to reduce VAT on tampons, which is something that he is powerless to do. David Cameron’s so-called reforms include something on the yellow card, which says that Member States – not individual Member States, of course: 15 together – can stop some legislation. I would like to ridicule this but I do not have to, because it was already ridiculed by William Hague when he was Foreign Minister in parliament, when he absolutely tore this idea to pieces when it was proposed before.

Mr President, the yellow card procedure is the main weapon of national parliaments to force the Brussels Commission to respect the principle of subsidiarity. It obliges the Commission to reconsider a legislative proposal when it has been the subject of reasoned opinions, i.e. protests by one-third of the national parliaments of the Member States. The report notes that this yellow card has succeeded only once in persuading the Commission to abandon a proposal. It was in 2012, with regard to the scandalous Monti II proposal, which called into question the right to strike. This is a very meagre record because, the rest of the time, the Commission has rejected with some arrogance the other yellow cards. Subsidiarity is therefore a decoy. The Commission does not respect it and violates it, either directly or indirectly, through delegated acts, i.e. decree-laws to which it uses massively, as the report deplores. The report has the merit of denouncing this situation, but it disappoints by merely calling on the Commission to engage in dialogue with national parliaments and improve its impact studies. He certainly proposes to create a green card, which would allow national parliaments to make suggestions to the Commission, but this would only resurrect the placets of the Old Regime that the beggings presented to the king's delight.  It is a much more radical and much more democratic solution that should be put in place. It would create a real red card procedure that would allow each Member State to oppose a commission legislative proposal, since it considers that the proposal undermines its vital interest. This red card would be a veto that would allow each state to enforce its sovereignty.

Only gullible and misled by political saltibagus and directed media, domestic and foreign. For six years he has been misled that memoranda and implementing laws are imposed to his advantage and in the light of the viability of his country, while they themselves keep exorbitant bank accounts and offshore companies. Scandals covered, lists of tax irregularities that are never investigated, sworn politicians hiding behind parliamentary immunities. How proportionate and subsidiary is this to citizens who do not have to eat or pay for their medicines? No memorandum policy and no implementing law complied with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality for Greeks. Only the principles of punishment, the banking macro-economy and the loot in private, real estate and movable property.

What we now have before the European Parliament is the European Commission's proposal on Pan-European deposit insurance as the third pillar of the Banking Union. This Pan-European deposit guarantee does not take into account the specific structures of the European banking landscape, does not take into account savings banks and Raiffeisen funds, their deposit insurance and the institution guarantee that is associated with them. Worse still, it does not take account of the fact that economic policy is and must be different in the different states of the European Union.

With such a phrase, colleagues, one can of course go in all directions. With such a phrase in the hands of the adepts of the European Union, we are moving towards an enlargement and further centralisation of that European Union. With such a phrase, combined with the exclusivity of the powers held by the European Union, the principle of subsidiarity, namely that powers should be exercised at the lowest possible level, is a principle that becomes dead letter.

And when I look at this report now, it gets even more complicated. Many of the points in the report make the European legislative process almost impossible. Instead of a clear, transparent division of powers, the report, on the pretext of subsidiarity control, awards national parliaments the right to hinder European processes in any progress. Supporting is one thing, but hindering is, of course, a problem. Of course, national competences should not be undermined by European agents.

The European institutions have paid increased attention to respect ingestion of the principle of subsidiarity, and the national parliaments have shown a very high willingness to exercise their powers. This is also reflected in the very interesting reports of COSAC.  It is a good sign of the now developed culture of subsidiarity that there were only two yellow cards of national parliaments in the direction of the Commission all the time. It is undoubtedly necessary and right to intensify the political dialogue with the national parliaments, and I am interested in that, and we should all be interested in that. At the same time, however, I would like to stress that the European Union is a multi-level political system. Its functioning is complicated. However, it will only become comprehensible and comprehensible to citizens if it is clear who is responsible for what and who is responsible for what. It is therefore important not to mix up the different competences of the different levels of action.

Over time, the European institutions and national parliaments have been concerned with identifying effective mechanisms necessary for the adoption of legislation that corresponds to both national requirements and the general interest of the European Union. Compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in the legislative procedures at European Union level is the 'keystone' of a regulation that respects the needs of the European citizen as much as possible. The introduction and strengthening of procedures to assess compliance with the two principles at different stages of the decision-making process, public consultations in which stakeholders submit comments, and possible solutions to the problems identified are likely to provide added value to the legislative process. On the assumption that the two principles are the starting point for policy formulation at European level, the Commission is expected to further examine in a thorough way the extent to which they are being respected. However, a few observations are required. Throughout the legislative procedure, it should be borne in mind that impact studies cover only the initial stages of the legislative process, since legislative proposals may undergo substantial changes in the adoption process.

The proposal received – I think – 11 yellow cards from the national parliaments and, as I said before, this Commission has already visited national parliaments 270 times. At least 10 of these were mine, because I did not see the Commission sending a letter to the parliament as the end of the matter. I felt it necessary to come back to these national parliaments and to explain how we modified the proposal by replacing the centralised structure with a decentralised one. The national parliaments could see that it is in my strong interest to explain and to convince them that the issue of subsidiarity has disappeared. This is merely how this works in one example: the case of the European Prosecutor’s Office. I feel it is necessary to create such a model, which will not replace national prosecution but will strengthen it.

It was never proposed as a veto, and it was never envisaged to be anything of the sort.

I agree with them that any extension of the current deadline for submitting opinions on subsidiarity should indeed be incorporated into the Treaties when they are next updated.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today's debate was not on the original agenda, but I think it was right to discuss, in this House, such an important issue that closely affects human and animal health and the environment, and I am therefore pleased that this debate can take place here before everyone.  In recent months, we have seen intense discussions on the European Commission's decision to renew the authorisation to use glyphosate within the regulatory framework outlined in the regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market; the current authorization expires in June 2016. As you all know, glyphosate is an active ingredient in a selective herbicide and is currently the most globally produced herbicide; it has been used worldwide for the last forty years and is used in 76 % of cases in the agricultural sector.  The ENVI Committee of this Parliament, on whose behalf I am presenting this position today, has raised and approved the objection that we are now debating, asking the European Commission to withdraw the draft implementing regulation, not to renew the approval of glyphosate, to draw up a clear timetable for drawing up a list of coformulants that cannot be included in commercial products. The report also calls on the Commission to carry out an independent review of the classification of glyphosate in a short time, in the light of available scientific evidence of the carcinogenic potential of the substance itself, as well as the possible properties of interference on the basis of horizontal scientific criteria for endocrine disruptors.  But I would take a brief step back, in order to better understand what has happened since the Commission renewed its authorisation. In March 2015, in fact, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as likely carcinogenic to humans, based on limited evidence of carcinogenic effects on humans and sufficient evidence of tumours in laboratory animals.  In November 2015, EFSA, the European Food Safety Agency, contrary to the opinion of the IARC, completed a joint assessment of glyphosate and concluded that it is unlikely to pose a threat of cancer to humans and that the available evidence does not justify its classification of its carcinogenic potential, in accordance with the Regulation on the placing on the market of plant protection products.  In view of this situation, the ENVI Committee decided by a large majority that the precautionary principle should be applied in this case in order to ensure that active substances or products placed on the market do not have harmful effects on human or animal health or the environment. The Regulation on the placing on the market of plant protection products states that, in particular, Member States are not prevented from applying the precautionary principle where there is scientific uncertainty as to the risks to human, animal or environmental health risks to plant protection products to be authorised on their territory.  The ENVI Committee therefore considers that the Commission's draft implementing regulation does not guarantee a high level of health protection, does not apply the precautionary principle and exceeds the implementing powers laid down in the legislation. It therefore calls on the Commission to withdraw the draft regulation, calls on the Commission not to renew its approval, and calls on EFSA to disseminate all scientific evidence.

In this respect I would like to point out that the draft implementing regulation for renewal of the approval of glyphosate has been processed in line with the procedures set out in Regulation No 1107/2009 and Regulation No 182/2011 on comitology. The Commission considers, therefore, that it has not exceeded its implementing powers. The Commission services have presented a draft implementing act to the standing committee in compliance with the legal framework. The Commission services are now discussing with Member States the best way forward on the renewal of the approval for glyphosate and will endeavour to find a solution which commands the widest possible support among the Member States. The current draft implementing act is therefore likely to be amended and should not be considered as a decision from the Commission. Before Members express their position on this draft resolution, I would like to recall a few important points that were raised when this was discussed in Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. The draft regulation includes a firm commitment to review the approval if the European Chemicals Agency process leads to a classification relevant for the approval. Second, the Commission has started working on co-formulants. The current draft, if adopted, would not allow the placing on the market of glyphosate-containing products containing the co-formulant tallowamine. Third, the Commission has called on the industry to publish the regulatory studies submitted by companies.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, on form, I would like to point out that this is an objection to an act of execution and, therefore, that it will have no legal consequences. However, this issue is one of the concerns of citizens and, at the same time, the agricultural world is going through an unprecedented crisis. In Europe, many farmers use glyphosate in most plant production. Glyphosate is fundamental to weeding strategies. To date, however, there is no economically viable alternative to offer farmers that will ensure that there are no consequences for human health. For all these reasons, we must be a force for proposal so that the current deadlock between the Member States and the Commission can find a way out. I would also like to point out that we have a procedure for approving substances that we, the co-legislators, have decided and voted for. In this regard, the procedure was followed. In addition, in the event of new information, the Commission can always reverse its authorisation, and we are also waiting for the analysis of the gap by the end of 2017. In view of these elements, I have proposed amendments, on behalf of the EPP Group, limiting authorisation over time, asking the Commission and the Member States to speed up their work on the list of coformulants to be banned, such as tallow amine, and proposing to the Commission framework measures for The Member States. I also want to strengthen research and innovation in order to find alternatives to the use of glyphosate. I count on all my colleagues to approve these proposals.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration will begin testing the glyphosate content of food this year. Our resolution calls on the European Commission to follow in the interests of the security of European citizens.  We are similarly convinced that glyphosate is not dangerous to human health. The European Food Safety Authority bases its recommendations on several so-called key but classified studies funded by whom? Industry. But the International Agency for Research on Cancer and dozens and dozens of independent scientists are bringing more and more evidence that glyphosate can be the cause of a number of health disorders and is probably an endocrine disruptor.

I could give you a long speech on the use of glyphosate and how important it is to agriculture. I do not have time for that, so let me just concentrate on what I see as the failures in the resolution. The resolution states, as part of its justification, that residues of glyphosate have been found in soil and water; well, yes, they have. But, as the German Federal Risk Institute tells us, they have been found in quantities at less than 1% of the daily acceptable rate. It also states that residues have been found in food. Again, this is not about hazard, this is about risk, and they are at levels way below those which are acceptable to human health. So why does this form such an upfront part of this resolution when it is frankly irrelevant? It also says, in Recital J, that the current proposal has no restrictions on use. That is not the case. The draft implementing regulation clearly states that regulatory measures to identify co-formulants must be developed. It is already there in the draft regulation. So before we even think about the use of glyphosate and its value to us, we really ought to get our facts right. And where we talk about the precautionary principle, once again: the precautionary principle as enshrined in EU law is to take care of cases where there is not any scientific advice. There is a plethora of scientific advice here.

Therefore we have just tabled an amendment, as the Liberal Group, in which we call on the Commission to renew the approval of glyphosate with a maximum of five years, and to take into account any new evidence up to that time which proves that it is more dangerous than we previously thought, in which case the authorisation should be withdrawn.

In addition, there is clear evidence that glyphosate acts as a hormone disruptor.  According to advertisements, glyphosate breaks down in nature in a couple of weeks. However, recent studies have shown that glyphosate and its degradation products, in particular AMPA, can bind to the soil and continue to flow to other parts of the environment. The risks are especially high in cold climates, where soil processes are slow. Evidence of rapid degradation of glyphosate is based on warm conditions and tests carried out on them.

There is a suspicion of cancer that has not yet been dispelled, and no one has said that, but the World Health Organisation has said that it is in the room and it is not clear.  There is a massive loss of biodiversity in the use of this agent, which is still applied to 40 percent of the land and has increased by 70 percent in the last 10 years, and glyphosate is now detectable everywhere, in beer, in cereals and also in us. And I don't care about Mrs Girling, we don't have to argue about limit values, the substance simply doesn't belong there. That is why we really need to think seriously about whether we are not looking at alternatives firstly and, secondly, whether we accept that, after a long discussion process, a Commission should make a proposal that says that it must be extended by 15 years, with no restrictions. No restrictions mean: it may be used before harvesting, it may be used by any layman, and it may be used for purely economic reasons: the farmer saves 100 euros. This raises the fundamental question: can economic reasons be valued higher than ecological or health reasons? Therefore, this substance may not be extended in the authorisation.

I think it is very easy to call for a ban on the chemical, because chemicals raise concerns among our citizens. We need to reflect on exactly what is before us here. There are two, apparently different, scientific assessments. But in fact one – the EFSA position – looks at the risks, while the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) looks at the hazards. We need to differentiate between both of those.

It is therefore not a weed killer, because it does not really make any difference between weeds and cultivated plants. This difference only makes it if this crop is RR-compatible, i.e. if Monsanto or anyone else has succeeded in planting an enzyme in the plant that makes it resistant to this toxic rain. In other words, I believe that we have already agreed relatively clearly today that glyphosate is suitable for damaging the human body, whether it is carcinogenic or hormone-altering.

One thing is certain, however, and we must all be aware of this, and that is the importance that this product widely used in agriculture today has as a herbicide and that, obviously as some of my fellow Members have said, it could only be replaced by mechanical interventions, that is, manual or mechanical mowing which, objectively, if, on the one hand, are technically possible, on the other hand, would certainly undermine the competitiveness of our production system.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Ladies and gentlemen, the reason for this own-initiative report is the Commission's 2014 communication on the programme to ensure the efficiency and efficiency of legislation, abbreviated REFIT. Unfortunately, some time has already passed since then. REFIT has been around since 2012. In May last year, the Commission presented its comprehensive reform package on better regulation, and we now have a new interinstitutional agreement between the Commission, Parliament and the Council. The REFIT programme plays a central role in the work of the Commission and will also play a role in the cooperation of the institutions in the legislative process. It is therefore high time that our House finally took a position on this programme.  Let me highlight some aspects of the report, which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs. It is good that Vice-President Frans Timmermans has been entrusted with the Better Regulation business. This was and is a strong political signal to the citizens of the Union, who perceive our European Union as too bureaucratic. Citizens rightly expect something to change. The report rightly emphasises that better regulation is not, at its core, about the mere number of EU laws, not about the question of more or less legislation. What matters is their quality, and I would remind you that a European standard usually replaces 28 standards, which in fact leads to less bureaucracy and at the same time strengthens the common judicial area and the common market.  Dialogue with citizens, social partners, stakeholders from all sectors of civil society helps to ensure that EU legislation is transparent, effective and coherent. In the report, we therefore attach great importance to the Commission taking sufficient account of the views of all stakeholders when consulting. Balance and transparency are also needed when it comes to the various comments made on the Commission's website under the new heading: 'Burden reduction – Tell your mind', which will be examined by the newly created REFIT platform. It is still too early to assess the REFIT platform, but the Commission can be sure that Parliament will follow this process closely.  My report also emphasises that impact assessments play an important role in legislation. There have been very much heated discussions in this House about how they should be done and when by whom. In this respect, the report makes it clear that the new Regulatory Scrutiny Board must not issue binding opinions to the Commission. This must continue to be the case in the future, because the Commission, as the executive, has political responsibility. It has to decide and it must assume its responsibilities. Impact assessments are simply not a substitute for political decisions, and as far as agreements concluded by the social partners are concerned, the autonomy of the social partners naturally applies.  The report rightly pays great attention to reducing administrative burdens, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the economy. Here, too, the same applies to many things, as in other things: the EU is not a company, and good EU legislation cannot be reduced to operational cost-benefit calculations. That is why the report emphasises that the reduction of administrative burdens for SMEs must not lead to a questioning of workers' rights or perhaps even to fragmentation of the internal market for SMEs.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last but not least, Parliament will continue to pay close attention to the issue of REFIT. I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their good cooperation and cooperation in committee, especially, of course, the shadow rapporteurs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 107, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Angelika Niebler (PPE).", "mepid": "4289", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I would just like to say very briefly that the REFIT programme is really a good programme, that it is to be welcomed that the Commission is also withdrawing concrete proposals. This is a first of the Juncker Commission, and that can only be supported. I have one point that I would like to raise, which is the issue of impact assessment. For many years, including in the course of better legislation, we in Parliament have put a great deal of effort into ensuring that the proposals, including amendments that came from Parliament, are subject to a proper legislative impact assessment. We must once again encourage the Commission and call for it to become even more ambitious. There is this regulatory scrutiny committee. As a group, we once wanted to set up an independent standards control council, just as many Member States have it, and it is the case here in Germany, in the Netherlands, in the United Kingdom, that is where it works. What the Commission is now doing with the Regulatory Scrutiny Committee is a step backwards, and I simply ask that we continue to do so in terms of the independence of this legislative institution.

In the face of increasing red tape and declining confidence in the European Union, I believe it is important to strengthen civic dialogue and social dialogue in particular. In this respect, strengthening the role of institutions such as the Committee of the Regions or the European Economic and Social Committee is a priority also mentioned in this report. I would therefore also welcome the extension of the public consultation period to 12 weeks in advance, during and after the legislation was drafted.

The conclusions of the report are a strong encouragement for the Commission’s work in this area and also for me personally. Making EU law more effective and efficient, reducing the costs of its application and working with Member States to ensure that it is implemented well: this is a task for all European institutions. Our success in this area will make a positive contribution to growth and jobs and, therefore, help to fight the ‘EU fatigue’ we are too often confronted with. This common endeavour is reflected in the interinstitutional agreement for better law-making which you approved on 8 March 2015. The report we are discussing today dates from before that agreement, so many of the issues it raises have in fact already been resolved between us. The Commission adopted the better regulation package on 19 May 2015 with a view to ensuring an effective and efficient regulatory environment for businesses as well as for other stakeholders. The package included several measures, one of which, the new Regulatory Scrutiny Board, is already in place. Half of its members are external to the Commission, and its prerogatives have also been extended to cover the review of ex-post evaluations. This includes new comprehensive guidelines and tools to cover the application of better regulation throughout the entire policy cycle. It means planning, impact assessments, legal drafting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation as well as stakeholder consultation. This is the first time that such integrated guidance has been prepared in the Commission. A new REFIT platform has been established. A first meeting took place in January, and I hope that first results can be presented by the summer. Our new interinstitutional agreement on better law-making includes a number of important achievements. On implementing acts and delegated acts, the proposed approach should facilitate future discussions between the co-legislators and reassure them. The Commission will also provide greater transparency by allowing stakeholders to see the text of delegated acts and implementing acts before they are adopted. On annual and multiannual programming, the interinstitutional agreement provides for intensive cooperation between the institutions in setting priorities through annual and multiannual programming and on identifying the priority files for the legislative procedure. On regulatory fitness, each new act will set out how the legislation will be monitored and evaluated in the future so that we can check whether it is working as planned. The Commission’s regulatory fitness programme will also play a central role in simplifying the body of existing legislation and reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens but without weakening any of our important social or environmental goals. On transparency, in some cases working jointly across the institutions to build common IT platforms for delegated acts – and later perhaps for the codecision procedure – will help open up decision-making to public scrutiny.

We have the euro crisis, the refugee crisis, the security crisis, Brexit, Grexit and last week's referendum in the Netherlands. I would therefore like to say that the time to walk around Europe with blinkers and see 'More Europe' as a solution to all this is over! When people ask me 'What can Europe do to reconnect with its citizens?' I invariably reply that Europe has a responsibility to demonstrate its relevance. It is only if Europe can show that it matters that people will see its added value.  It is therefore a shared responsibility of the European institutions to be guided by this principle, translated into the principle of subsidiarity, when deciding whether or not to act, to decide how best to act when regulations are needed, and ultimately to ensure that the regulations adopted are simple and easily applicable. This is therefore the starting point of the report on better regulation in the internal market. The single market, which is one of the cornerstones of European cooperation.  It is therefore important that the legislation adopted is also implemented and transposed by the Member States. In order to facilitate the achievements of the internal market and also to exploit the challenges of the single digital single market, the institutions must show determination. If not, efforts to achieve better regulation may be thwarted by regulatory drive. Implementing legislation in a simple and effective way and also constantly evaluating the legislation to ensure that the objectives are achieved, that is the message.  Improving the regulation of the internal market does not mean abolishing regulation, but rather creating a competitive regulatory environment that keeps jobs and businesses in Europe. A single market that does not frustrate production, innovation and trade, but stimulates it. Dare to ask questions, dare to be critical, without taboos. In this way, we are committed to a strong and dynamic internal market that contributes to long-term growth in Europe and therefore to the prosperity of European citizens. That is what I had in mind with this report. I therefore hope to be able to count on your vote in tomorrow's vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 120, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Anna Maria Corazza Bildt (PPE).", "mepid": "96674", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for an excellent report. Better regulation is a roadmap to a better-functioning single market. Better single market rules are not about diminishing workers’ or consumer rights; they are about about diminishing bureaucracy and red tape. The single market rules must be simple, proportionate and applicable in the real economy. We need to move from inadequate to quality impact assessments and to make problem—solving tools, such as SOLVIT and Your Europe, available to all citizens. Dialogue with stakeholders is essential, and so is avoiding gold-plating, where Member States impose an extra burden when implementing single market rules. It is therefore bizarre that the left are resisting the better regulation agenda at a time when we need a transparent, effective single market that is closer to our citizens.

The common EU framework should also ensure that single market regulation is kept up to date as far as possible. Digital innovations, and thus user needs, must be continuously monitored, thereby helping to complete the European single digital market.

We agree that the single market is a cornerstone of European integration. In recent decades it has delivered more jobs and contributed to higher growth. We need to address the whole policy cycle, so last year the Commission presented two main initiatives designed to do that: the Better Regulation Package and the Single Market Strategy. Last May we proposed a Better Regulation Package, covering the entire policy cycle from consultations and impact assessments to the adoption, implementation and evaluation of EU legislation. The package will help us make sure that EU laws tackle the real problems of citizens and businesses. From now on, EU laws should be adopted according to better evidence and a more careful assessment of their impact on the real world. This will help us regain the trust of EU citizens. More recently a new interinstitutional agreement on better law—making was negotiated by Parliament, the Council and the Commission. We now have a strong political framework and a renewed commitment from the institutions in support of better regulation. After formal adoption it will be up to Parliament and the Council to work with the Commission to ensure its timely and effective implementation. We need to ensure that we deliver the benefits for citizens and businesses in practice rather than just in theory. Let us take the Regulatory Fitness Programme as an example – the one which we discussed a while ago. The Commission’s Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme will also play a central role in simplifying the body of existing legislation and reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens, especially for microenterprises and small and medium enterprises, and we will do so without weakening any of our important social and environmental goals. The second major initiative that we took last year is the Single Market Strategy adopted in October. It has three key aims: creating new opportunities for people and businesses, encouraging and enabling the modernisation and innovation that Europe needs and, above all, ensuring practical delivery. In some areas we need to launch new initiatives, such as introducing a service passport for key sectors of the economy, adopting a legislative proposal to prevent discrimination against consumers based on nationality or residence, or revising the Mutual Recognition Regulation. However, it is not enough just to come forward with new initiatives. We need to ensure the effective and efficient application of the existing legislation. We need to design legislation better and to evaluate and fix things which do not work as they should. We also need to make sure that existing rules are applied correctly by the Member States and backed by a smart approach to enforcement and the development of a compliance culture. For example, we will promote an enhanced partnership with Member States through implementation plans for new legislation and yearly compliance dialogues with each Member State. We all have the same aims. We have the same broad vision of what we want to achieve: we all want improved single market legislation and better delivery.

According to a 2014 Eurobarometer opinion poll, 71% of European Union citizens feel that they are not very well informed about the EU and 44% feel that they have a limited understanding of how the EU works. Even more worryingly, 52% of Europeans believe that their voice does not count in the EU. Under these circumstances it is little wonder that citizens feel distant to or even increasingly estranged from the European project, become even more Eurosceptic, and perceive democratic deficits in the decision-making processes of the Union. Therefore, enhancing dialogue about the EU in our schools and other educational institutions is crucial in order to bridge the long-standing gap between the European Union and its citizens and to restore their faith in the merits and necessity of the European integration process. This is even more important in the current context of the ongoing refugee crisis and of serious threats to fundamental human rights and democracy due to the recent terrorist attacks. The Report ‘Learning EU at school’ highlights that the main role of education is to train fully aware and active citizens in an increasingly complex, multicultural and integrated Europe and should therefore equip all learners with solid knowledge about the EU and in-depth understanding of its functioning and concrete added-value. An EU dimension in education should also encourage learners to critically reflect on European matters and how these influence their country and their own activities. This will empower them to form well-informed and balanced opinions, exercise their democratic rights and responsibilities, value diversity, intercultural and interreligious dialogue and be active and responsible citizens. With this in mind, the report stresses that the EU should become more visible in teaching materials and extracurricular activities at all levels and in all forms of education, including non-formal and lifelong learning. Teaching about the EU should reflect both the role of Member States in the development of the EU and the influence of the EU on national developments. In this context I would like to stress the importance of a European approach to the teaching of history in developing a reflective awareness of the past and a critical ‘culture of remembering’ based on European values. Another important aspect the report focuses on is the strengthening of citizenship education with the aim of enabling learners to acquire the competences they need to live and actively engage in pluralistic democratic societies and make their concerns heard. Core elements to be taught include tolerance, awareness and understanding for other cultures as well as democratic values and human rights. Until now, a majority of Member States has progressively integrated an EU dimension into their curricula and into teacher training, but gaps and disparities between and within Member States continue to exist. Much more could be done, for example, with regard to curricula, teacher training, textbooks and teaching methods. Therefore the report strongly encourages Member States to review and update their education systems and all forms of EU-related curricula content, to support all possibilities of conveying more information about the EU to learners as well as to teachers and other educators through formal, non-formal and informal learning, and to fully exploit and complement EU financial instruments, programmes and initiatives in this regard. At the European level, existing possibilities offered by the EU programmes in the field of education and culture should be fully used to promote active citizenship, cultural awareness, intercultural understanding and other valuable key and transversal competences. In this regard, the report calls for adequate financial support for these programmes, a greater focus on their qualitative outcomes and wider access to mobility, paying special attention to teachers and other educators, young people with different socio-economic backgrounds and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. In addition, platforms such as EU Twinning, the School Education Gateway and EPALE for adult learning can be used for the development and exchange of teaching materials and projects related to the EU and its institutions, as well as citizenship education. The report calls on the Commission to continue to support Member States in their efforts to develop and promote an EU dimension in education while respecting their competence in the field, also by providing a common framework and guidelines for learning about the EU and by actively conveying information to key stakeholders and citizens.

Certainly, such information adds value to school education and equips students with the knowledge necessary to understand the modern world. The citizens' education initiative is particularly important: the role of the school is not only education, but also education. Students should draw on and be encouraged to participate in active civic life. Given today's influx of refugees and the percentage increase in the share of people of non-European origin in the societies of the Member States, educational opportunities are important, and in particular attention to civic education in terms of their integration into our society.

Let me first of all congratulate Mr Drăghici on his excellent work. Recent developments have once more demonstrated the risks of a ‘disconnect’ between disaffected young people and society. Our answer has to be multifaceted and has to promote our values and foster inclusion through education. Every young person in Europe needs to understand and share our fundamental values. And we need to build a Europe where every young person is able to find their place in society and achieve their potential, regardless of their background or abilities. What does learning EU at school mean concretely? I fully agree with the broad approach taken by Mr Drăghici in his report. To me it comprises two core aspects: the teaching of European history, cultures and languages on the one hand, and citizenship education on the other. Indeed, these aspects are linked. Without knowing Europe it is impossible to understand the founding values of the EU. In turn, knowing the cultures and languages of our neighbours supports active European citizenship. All those elements together form the concept of a European dimension in education, as expressed in Mr Drăghici’s report. It is, of course, up to the Member States to integrate this concept into their national school curricula. The Commission is ready to support this through its policy cooperation with Member States and especially the Erasmus+ programme. Some years ago, the Council and Parliament agreed on the key competences every European needs. They include social and civic competences and cultural awareness and expression. Fostering these competences and encouraging intercultural and interreligious dialogue to help our children become responsible and active citizens has always been an important element of our initiatives at EU level. In the current context, it is more necessary than ever to better understand but, first and foremost, to better transmit our common values. One year ago, in March 2015, the EU education ministers adopted the Paris declaration in response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks, in order to better promote citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education. It is also one of the priorities of Education and Training 2020, our policy cooperation framework with Member States. A working group is currently tackling the topic of preventing violent radicalisation with a focus on enhancing critical thinking and media literacy.  The Commission also welcomes the importance the report attaches to EU programmes such as Erasmus+, Europe for Citizens and Creative Europe when it comes to promoting active citizenship, language skills and cultural awareness. I can confirm that in 2016 the Commission remains fully committed to funding concrete projects under these programmes, which aim at fostering active and democratic citizenship. I am determined to continue developing our virtual education platforms under Erasmus+, such as e-training, a network of 300 000 teachers, the electronic platform for adult learning in Europe and a school education gateway. These are valid instruments for our teachers and educators, who are key players in the school context. These platforms give them access to relevant high-quality teaching materials, encourage them to network and help them to exchange best practices. The Commission will closely monitor the impact of all of these measures on actually developing more active and democratic participation among our citizens.

In these circumstances, it is understandable that citizens feel distant from the European Union and feel a democratic deficit in its decision-making. Although EU knowledge is already included in the education systems of several Member States, there are significant differences in this respect, both between Member States and within Member States.  In general, EU knowledge is only a small part of the curriculum. Teaching EU knowledge is not just about transferring specific material knowledge. Personal experiences such as youth and volunteering, participation in Erasmus, visits to the EU institutions, contacts with EU officials, traineeships are just as important. The teaching of foreign languages also plays a key role in helping to develop intercultural awareness and supporting mobility between Member States.

I would like to stress that this 'intercultural approach' must be strongly articulated around common values and principles, because positive school integration is not possible where personal rights are subordinated by reason of religion, ideology or culture.

A misunderstanding of how the EU works and its core values and principles makes young European generations an easy target for disinformation campaigns aimed at undermining the foundations of a democratic Europe and weakening its institutions, reinforcing populist and nationalist attitudes. This is a european-worthy challenge that respects national competences and educational traditions.  The European dimension in education will help restore the weakened relationship between the European Union and its citizens by creating a sense of belonging to a community based on values and the rule of law.

Unfortunately, we do not know enough about each other at the moment, and our education system does not present young people with their rights as European citizens. With an added knowledge of the history of the entire European Union and more information about European topicality, young people will regain confidence in the European institutions built with so much difficulty to ensure the peace and development of our continent. That is why, as an academic, but also as the initiator of several debates about the need to have a common European-wide curriculum on the EU, I wholeheartedly support this report which I hope will generate clear solutions for the uniformity, but also the popularisation of education about the EU, from the European Commission and the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 144, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Ева Паунова (PPE)", "mepid": "98341", "text": "  in writing. – The European Union faces more and more challenges – local, national, global, economic, political.

And the report aims to provide positive solution elements for an equation that is now unresolved: the equation between education, learning and incorporation into the work of so many young Europeans. In this area, Commissioner, we are a long way from the right path to achieve the objectives to which we committed ourselves, to which the European Union has at the time committed itself to the 2020 Strategy. Rather it seems that in some cases we are almost diverging. This evidence is also being answered by the proposal for reform and improvement of the Erasmus+ programme contained in this report, which is aimed in particular at the sector, reality, our vocational training and learning.  This is what this report is all about: it identifies the obstacles and circumstances that explain Erasmus+'s current inadequacy and inadequacy for this particular objective and formulates the main lines of reform and adaptation that should enable us to extend Erasmus+'s overall success, which does exist and is indisputable, to this new area of vocational training and learning. Let's put it plainly: mobility equals employability. If we are clear about it and respect this criterion, we will surely advance and win some battles. That is why this Parliament addresses the European Commission and also the Member States with a certain demand and with no less urgency, and we do so by diagnosing, difficulties, instruments, etc.  Some points to achieve this proposal, this reflection and this urgency: to expand and improve mobility options, starting with the creation of a truly European reference framework that clearly and simply offers the possibilities available; the adoption of complementary measures to this Erasmus programme with social programmes, the European Social Fund, the European Youth Initiative); the adequate increase of economic resources to meet the needs and complexities of the specific circumstances of this group that is the protagonist of vocational training and learning. Therefore, adequate programs to remove obstacles to the creation of successful environments for this issue, starting with language barriers and following the simplification of procedures and the proper accompaniment and mentoring of our students, etc. The definition, too, of the intermediate agents, who will have to star in new management models, new models of success, to give maximum power to the Erasmus+ programme in this field. And that is why we will have to think about the definition of regional and mixed-composition agencies or consortia. Education system and business system must work together, they must agree to give the right operational response.  We must also complete the process of recognition of studies and the skills acquired, and professional experience, not always recognised in terms of professional title, but which is essential to do so now, and for this we must complete Europass, WE must complete ECVET and we must already think of a statute of the European apprentice, as is also advocated in the report.  Finally, effort must be devoted due to the preparation and mobility of the teachers themselves, which are key instruments for the success of this operation. This clear position of the European Parliament is what it wants is to give vocational training its role within the Erasmus programme.

Non-formal and informal learning, as well as vocational training, play an important role in the lifelong learning process and in addressing challenges such as early school leaving, the high number of NEET young people and unemployment.  Erasmus+ has been successful, but the results so far show that not all opportunities have been fully used and that this mobility in vocational training should continue to be encouraged.

At the same time, the aim of the programme is to improve career prospects and provide students with social connections.  However, the social and economic reality demonstrates the need for this programme to adapt to the economic needs of each country. In particular, in the countries of the Union, there are extreme imbalances in unemployment rates.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Maragall, for his work. I fully share the view expressed in the report that the learning and training grants offered by the Erasmus+ programme are contributing to high-quality education, improved employability and better civic competences. For many trainees, especially from lower socio-economic backgrounds, their Erasmus+ experience is often their first occasion to leave their home countries and step into another reality. Mr Maragall’s report contains a rich analysis of both the advantages and the challenges of mobility. The advantages are many: when trainees and apprentices go abroad, they acquire new professional competences which contribute to their training at home. Moreover, they improve their motivation and self-confidence, their versatility and adaptability and their language, communication and intercultural skills. All of these competences and skills acquired abroad give them an advantage on the labour market. Challenges range from reduced access to mobility programmes, the lack of financial resources, linguistic and cultural barriers, poor compatibility with training programmes at home and cumbersome recognition of skills acquired abroad to legal obstacles. The Commission is aware of these challenges. I will try to respond to some of them in the little time I have here and now. The Commission has already created a logistical and organisational framework which strives to make VET mobility a success for everybody involved. The Erasmus+ VET Mobility Charter, for example, improves the strategic impact of VET mobility on VET organisations. Through the charter, the Commission rewards high-quality mobility initiatives and internationalisation strategies. It is through the networking of schools that possess the VET Mobility Charter and their links to their respective local labour markets that better placements can be found and suitable companies located. We also have a good body of intermediaries – such as chambers of commerce, associations or local authorities – which help improve the logistics and the quality of VET mobility. Regarding people with special needs, the Commission has always considered it a priority to make their participation in the programme possible. Additional funds are made available to persons with special needs, which cover their additional expenses during their stay abroad. As for simplified access to the programme, the Erasmus+ IT tools are constantly being adapted to meet the applicants’ requests, and efforts are being made to simplify application procedures. We have been working with the national agencies managing Erasmus+ at the national level to tailor IT tools and e—forms to the applicants’ needs and to simplify them. The Commission also works closely with the national agencies to ensure maximum visibility of the programme’s VET actions. Various promotion events and social media campaigns at national and European level have been organised, such as the ‘We Mean Business’ campaign that aimed to boost the number of companies getting involved in transnational traineeships. Finally, linguistic preparation. Knowing the language of your host country is a crucial success factor for training periods abroad, especially for young trainees, whose knowledge of a foreign language can be limited. The programme helps them get over the linguistic hurdle by offering language assessment tools, online language courses and other linguistic and intercultural preparation courses. The European Parliament also contributes to improving the quality and quantity of VET mobility. In concrete terms, the pilot projects of both Mr Maragall and Mr Arthuis will provide vital funds to overcome obstacles and improve transnational placements for the future. This is in line with our policy priorities to improve work-based learning and help the younger generation to have better chances on the job market. Let me conclude by saying that I greatly appreciate the commitment of the European Parliament to boosting the quality and quantity of mobility in vocational education and training. The Commission is working in the same direction, and I am looking forward to our cooperation on these issues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 159, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Die Präsidentin. –", "mepid": "97017", "text": "   That concludes.

This means that we also need to address the use of VET by national systems as a way to show a decrease in the number of early school leavers by lowering the educational and training component of VET or else pushing learners towards VET from a very young age without ensuring that they gain basic skills.

Mobility increases the social inclusion of young people in society and promotes active citizenship. Among other things, one of the objectives of mobility is to reduce the number of unemployed young people. Practices abroad make contacts with employers and have been proven to be easier to recruit. However, mobility does not prevail in vocational education and training, notably due to the mismatch between higher education institutions where mobility programmes are implemented. At EU level, it is essential to enable better coordination and organisation of mobility programmes.  Furthermore, it is necessary to recognise and confirm the results of mobility programmes achieved by young people through formal and non-formal learning.

Madam President, I will speak in French. I am very pleased that we are coming to the vote on this report, which is a modest report of initiative on a subject that goes far beyond us.  There are two key words in this report if we want to understand the meaning of them. The first key word is \"democratic control.\" We do have - and I believe that Europe, which is an open society, is particularly attached to it - the will to participate in the stabilisation of the international financial system. This stabilization requires agreements at the global level, with partners who may be in America, Asia and, perhaps tomorrow, around the world. However, the need to set rules at the global level runs up against the demands of democracy quite quickly and, in essence, we are no longer always able to give a very simple answer to an equally simple question, namely: who decides?  Therefore, the starting point of this report was that, in more and more areas, we cannot answer our constituents, the citizens, about the simple question: who decides? And it is quite important, even if expert committees intervene, that democratically elected entities can carry out their function. Secondly, the second important aspect is that of Europe's influence in this global negotiation. The report tries to be quite pragmatic and to start, in particular, from the areas in which we have legislative powers, that is, in which we legislate with the Council. On the face of it, all Member States are bound by this legislation. However, it sometimes appears that in committees, in international organisations, some States do not play the collective game, for example in the banking sector where, however, there is common legislation. On the method, we have observed what is being done in a number of international institutions that are sometimes full international organizations, such as the OECD or the IMF, more flexible bodies, which were created during the crisis or which strengthened during the crisis, such as the G20 or the Financial Stability Board, and then a number of other bodies such as the Basel Committee for Banking , IOSCO, IEIS, IOPS, or IASB - I'm sorry for the interpreters, that's a lot of acronyms - in which the industry is sometimes present, which can also pose problems of conflicts of interest, and sometimes very fragmentary representation of the countries of the world.  I would also like to thank Parliament's services, which have enabled us to obtain a number of reports on these different institutions, as well as my shadow rapporteurs. I see that Mady Delvaux is here, and so is Sirpa Pietik-inen. I don't know if there are others I forget, but I think we have worked really well together. I hope that we can have a large majority, because again, these are subjects that we are trying to anticipate, and we are trying to lift the veil on practices that have been necessary because of the crisis, but which we are no longer quite able to explain to the electorate.

Last October the Commission released a communication aiming at a more unified external representation of our economic and monetary union in international financial institutions. We can no longer accept that the euro area, which has the second largest currency in the world and which represents one of the world’s key market actors and economic powerhouses, does not speak with one voice on economic and financial matters in international financial institutions. This especially holds for the International Monetary Fund. The International Monetary Fund is a key pillar of the international monetary system in charge of global crisis prevention and crisis response. It is of strong relevance for the euro area. A more unified representation will allow the euro area to effectively shape its future role in the global financial architecture and more effectively promote euro area interests at a global level. Our proposal consists of two elements: streamlining euro area representation in the short term and moving to a unified representation by the year 2025. We are aware that the road ahead is not easy. We are currently discussing the proposals with the Member States. The decision-making process will take some time: agreement is not imminent, but we believe that an agreement can be reached. We welcome an early discussion with Parliament on this important subject and we take note of your recommendations. We appreciate that the report stresses the need for a stronger European voice. As regards international standard-setting bodies for financial regulation, the situation is very diverse from the Financial Stability Board to the Basel Committee and others. Each body has its own particular governance arrangements, and the extent to which the EU is represented varies – often with only certain Member States represented. We agree with Parliament that the European position should be better coordinated, as we all understand that when we are united we are stronger on the international scene, and we set out in our October communication what the Commission will do to get there. The Commission also takes note of the proposals in the report to involve European supervisory authorities more in international fora. A core interest of the European Parliament is to be more involved in discussions leading up to the development of new international rules concerning the financial sector. Since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Commission has been steadily building up strong relations with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). This work is not finished, and we stand ready to provide timely updates on salient developments in international financial regulation.

However, so far the rules have been more or less universal and did not recognise this so much-emphasized diversity, and some provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy and the Mediterranean Regulation specifically concerning small-scale coastal fishing are the best example of this.  The Mediterranean and the northern seas were one and the same to the legislator and the bureaucratic apparatus, and the consequence of such an approach is a legislative framework that stifles the development of fishing communities in both the south and north of the continent. The first step in building a new framework is to adopt a definition of coastal, small-scale coastal and traditional fishing at EU level, while taking into account the specifics of the different fishing regions.  In this process, we call on the Commission to take into account a number of different criteria such as vessel size, fishing gear used, selectivity of fishing techniques, duration of fishing, but also socio-economic indicators, such as the impact of traditional fisheries on the well-being of local communities. We consider it necessary to review the possibility of small-scale coastal fishing in island communities that traditionally depend on fisheries and participate in fishing activities throughout the year due to livelihoods.  Such a decision would be fully in line with the new initiative for islands, which aims to develop comprehensive solutions to the problems of economic and demographic die-off of the island and the preservation of island communities. Taking into account the negative effects of the administrative burden to be significantly reduced in the future, we ask the Commission and the Member States to ensure through the competent authorities that small-scale coastal fishing receives adequate funding from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. Traditional fishing is an important segment of the cultural and historical heritage of coastal communities and as such should be the basis for the development of fishing tourism. We therefore call on the Commission to support investments in promoting fishing heritage and diversifying fisheries in the fields of culture and the arts. However, in order not to leave everything on tradition and to ensure the sustainability of island communities in the future, Parliament strongly supports the diversification of the fisheries sector through the development of complementary activities and investment in vessels, safety equipment, training and innovation, with the key objective being to finance activities that are socially, environmentally and economically sustainable. These objectives can only be achieved with the participation of all local stakeholders, entrepreneurial associations, research institutes, universities, technology centres and local and regional institutions, so we call on the Commission to provide sufficient support to meet the conditions set out in the European Fisheries Fund and to take more decisive steps to improve their funding opportunities.

First of all, I would like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs and all the members of the Fisheries Committee who have created a very constructive and positive atmosphere around this report through their proposals and discussions.

Recently a delegation from the Committee on Fisheries visited precisely this land and was able to see the importance of artisanal fishing. These are, for the most part, small vessels, family-owned enterprises. They use selective arts, have little environmental impact and consume less fuel. We need to help this fleet, which is very important in the local communities from which it comes.

Fortunately, for my home region – the Baltic Sea – we have now completed the Baltic Sea plan, which also brings many benefits for fisheries: that they have abolished the one-network rule, that there are no need for more days at sea, that social benefits can also be paid in special decommissioning phases, these are all important signals to the small fisheries that make us authentic together with tourism. , and we can also invest in the Juncker Plan, and then that will also go in a positive direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 192, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I welcome the European Parliament’s own-initiative report on innovation and diversification of small-scale coastal fishing in fisheries-dependent regions, and I would like to thank rapporteur Tomašić for the report. The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), which as you know is the structural support tool for the common fisheries policy for the period 2014-2020, was the fruit of intense negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council. Thanks to the fund, Member States can and probably will implement most of what is requested or proposed in the report. The fund permits a higher intensity of aid – 80% – for all operations related to small-scale coastal fishing. Some examples are: young fishermen starting out in the sector; health and safety; diversification; partnerships between scientists and fishermen for the purposes of training; lifelong learning; marketing and processing; and innovation. However, it is the responsibility of Member States to decide, under the respective operational programmes approved in late 2015, how to translate their strategic preferences into concrete support to their small-scale coastal fishing fleet. The figures for small-scale coastal fishing fleets are telling. They account for only 8% of gross tonnage yet they represent nearly three quarters – almost 75% – of active fishing vessels. They account for only 12% of the value of landings and 16% of the gross value added, yet they represent 48% of the total number of jobs and 36% of the full-time equivalents, which means that a significant proportion of the jobs are part-time. This last element implies that fishing is not the only, or even the main, source of income for many small-scale coastal fishing fishermen and families. In any event, it is a fact that small-scale coastal fishing vessels are fundamental for the viability and resilience of coastal communities dependent on them, and I fully agree with that view. However, it is also a fact that industrial or large-scale fishing fleets are also based in coastal areas and that they represent most of the value of landings, gross value added and full-time equivalent jobs within the EU. Thus, these are at least as fundamental for the viability and the resilience of coastal communities as small-scale coastal fishing fleets. Furthermore, the simple fact that some 36 stocks in the Atlantic are now operating at maximum sustainable yield shows that large-scale fleets can also fish in a sustainable way whilst producing a lot of added value and social benefits. In view of the above, we need to support all fishing fleets and avoid instituting an asymmetric fishing policy, even though we do recognise the equal importance of this small-scale coastal fishing. Regarding control requirements, let me recall that small-scale coastal fishing can already benefit from preferential conditions of support from the EMFF for the installation of control equipment on board. As to the proposal to relax control requirements for the fund during the review of the Control Regulation, we have to be particularly careful in ensuring that this does not jeopardise fishing resources in the coastal band. The coastal band is a strip about 12 nautical miles wide where most small-scale coastal fishing occurs and where most Member States grant preferential access rights to vessels. In particular, there is a serious risk that further relaxing regulatory requirements on small-scale coastal fishing could encourage fishing by additional vessels and worsen crowding in the coastal band, especially in areas where there is already a lot of pressure on regulated and unregulated stocks. I am convinced that such a further relaxation would backfire both in terms of economic viability and environmental protection. Regarding the definition of small-scale coastal fleets, according to the EMFF Regulation, Article 3(14) covers fishing vessels of an overall length of less than 12 metres and not using towed fishing gear. It was subject to intense discussions during the trilogues on the EMFF regulations. Many alternatives, including the criteria proposed on point one of the report, were proposed, analysed and discussed, but in the end it was not possible to come to an agreement on any new definition, and the existing one was proposed. A regionalised approach to the definition could have some merit but would also risk creating an uneven playing field. In conclusion, all fleets, including the small-scale coastal fishing fleet, are fundamental for the continued viability of coastal areas. A successful CFP is the best possible way to ensure the environmental, economic and social sustainability of EU fisheries and coastal areas. There is a lot of public support for that. Finally, be aware that relaxing further control requirements and allowing over-capacity to develop or increase in the 12-nautical-mile zone would clearly threaten the resilience of these communities. I have no doubt that the co-legislators will get back to us on these issues as part of the planned revision of the control regulation.

As you know, almost 64% of the planet's waters remain outside the regulatory scope of the Convention on the Law of the Sea, as such the protection of the environment, marine biodiversity and sustainable exploitation of resources are not covered by this Convention, which is more than thirty-five years old, which applies the principle of freedom of the seas in a world where things have changed, where the economy is diversified , the need for food and resources of the population is quite different. As such, this Convention is to be subject, we hope, in the near future, to amendments that bring it to a present reality. With regard to subsequent agreements, the most important agreement we wish to signal is the one on fish stocks, an agreement reached in 1995. This agreement is specifically addressed to fish stocks with high migration and those outside national jurisdiction. The agreement is in force, it is a good agreement, there are certainly still issues that can be discussed about the effects of this agreement, but our committee recommends that the provisions of this agreement be strongly supported and maintained unchanged in the future legal instrument. In 2004, the UN General Assembly decided to start the first forms of negotiation of this convention. Subsequently, on 6 June 2015, the UN General Assembly decided to open debates and negotiations in preliminary committees. The committees will start work in 2016 and we hope that a first report will be in 2017. The aim of these committees will be to prepare substantive negotiations on the development of a legal international instrument, subordinate to the Convention on the Law of the Sea, to fill gaps and complement the agreements currently in force. I would particularly like to highlight the important role that the European Commission has played, being one of the voices that have taken this initiative in terms of the working group, but in this context I would like you to know that there are states that want to exclude from this agreement certain types of activities that take place outside national jurisdiction and in particular fishing , which puts us in difficulty, the European Commission and Parliament disagree with this exclusion. In short, the inclusion of fisheries in this new international, legal instrument is a priority for us for the reasons expressed earlier, but, with a very firm amendment, that this will not lead to the renegotiation of the 1995 agreement on fish stocks, but will ensure its inclusion in a new international framework. We also recommended the use, expansion and enhancement of the importance of regional organisations for fisheries management. They are part of the 1995 agreement, some of which have worked less well, but in general the work of these regional organisations is meritorious. We suggest that the United Nations find a way to motivate the less involved States in this agreement. As regards protected maritime areas, they cannot be successful unless there is coordination and collaboration between all areas of activity and if they are not established in an overall logic on the protection of biodiversity.

Within the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the United Nations General Assembly has decided to establish an internationally legally binding instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity.  In particular, it was tended that this objective should be achieved and that the European Union's fishing industry and market should therefore be sustainability-oriented. This UN Convention must, of course, be applied by all countries, not only the countries of the European Union, but also the countries which are candidates for accession to the European Union and the rest.

I have chosen, I have allowed myself, a few that are really related to our European space.

The South-East Asians, the Chinese and the Russians are importing their fish into the market, and everywhere we want to check that quality and sustainability in fisheries are also enforced.

I am happy to say that the report rightly focuses on this important development, which should bring international maritime law up to date with developments in the last 30 years. We have been promoting this new agreement since the first meeting of the BBNJ Working Group in 2006. This report by Mrs Nicolai, whom I would like to thank very much, is very timely, as the first preparatory committee, which opens the negotiations on this international instrument, has just taken place in the last two weeks, between 28 March and 8 April. It will be followed by a second meeting at the end of August, between 26 August and 12 September. The report rightly points out that the new legal instrument will address a package of elements. These will include marine genetic resources, including questions on the sharing of benefits, area-based management tools including marine protected areas, environmental impact assessments, capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology. One of the main aims of this new agreement will be to establish a mechanism which will enable the creation and management of marine protected areas. This will help the global community meet the commitment it made at the third Rio Conference on Sustainable Development to protect 10% of oceans in this manner by 2020. The European Union would also like this agreement to make the UNCLOS provisions on environmental impact assessments operational. This is necessary to prevent or to mitigate activities which have a negative impact on marine biodiversity. All activities in the high seas that could have an impact on marine biodiversity, including fisheries, should be covered by the new agreement without, however, undermining existing international fisheries law and bodies. This agreement should also help achieve the biodiversity protection provisions in the UN fish stocks agreement (FSA). We agree with the report that the UN FSA continues to function well and should not be renegotiated, only implemented better. Similarly, we continue to support the work of regional fisheries management organisations. I am committed to ensuring that these organisations become more effective in delivering their aims of managing highly migratory and straddling stocks. I want to reassure you that the Commission and the European Union will continue to play a leading role in the UN negotiations and to defend the need for better protection of marine biodiversity, in line with our international commitments. We will also continue to support the work of the regional fisheries management organisations in managing fisheries. The right balance will have to be struck between conservation and sustainable use, similarly to what we have done with the latest reform of the common fisheries policy. In addition, we will not allow these negotiations to upset the balance of rights and obligations established by the UNCLOS. We consider this to be the legal framework under which all human activities in the oceans should be undertaken. I would like to conclude by thanking you for the support in our fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.

A special thanks also to the Long-Distance Advisory Council, which was very timely in organising a conference in Las Palmas on the issue so that we could take their input into account in the drafting of the report. I am very happy that we all share the ambition of promoting sustainable fishing, keeping fish stocks above levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield, not only inside the EU waters but also outside the EU. Historically there have been very good reasons to be critical of fisheries agreements – they used to be very unsustainable. The great achievement of the new common fisheries policy is the inclusion of rules on fishing activities outside of the EU. The EU is now bound to respect human rights and only fish from surplus stocks. The transparency provisions in the new protocol on Mauritania that will soon be voted on at Parliament should work as a guideline, and I want to thank the Commission here. I know that the negotiations with Mauritania were very hard, and the Commission should be praised for doing a great job. Now we need to make sure that the conditions are met, and we will follow proceedings very closely to make sure that Mauritania lives up to its commitments and publishes all its agreements with other states and private companies. There are many good ambitions that we share in this report – the establishment of regulatory framework for joint ventures, for instance. Since the CFP is to be a vehicle to provide technical, scientific and financial assistance to third countries, the EU must promote the harmonisation of conditions of access to African waters for all foreign fleets. The regional management of fisheries should be encouraged, including control programmes, and the network of fisheries agreements is to be used to ensure that other distant fishing fleets also respect the same standards of sustainability. The EU should encourage third countries to develop a regulatory framework for joint ventures from the EU and other interests as the best way of ensuring that such joint ventures are sustainable and transparent. Over party lines, I am happy that the European Parliament shares the objective of using the influence of the EU on the international stage in order to improve fisheries management and transparency standards. The EU should encourage a race to the top, instead of a race to the bottom, in international fisheries.

In doing so, Parliament recognises that, where an EU fleet ceases to operate in the fisheries of a third country, the relevant fishing opportunities are generally allocated to other fleets applying much lower standards of management and sustainability than those laid down and protected by the EU.

There, scientific surveys can also be made about the stocks – whether that is in the Indian Ocean via bluefin tuna, whether it is up to the Pacific or off Africa and also in the Atlantic. It is very important that we also combat illegal fishing there and draw attention to which countries are not complying with the rules of the United Nations. You can only get this on the spot when our fleets are on the way there. That is why a good start has been made here, which can be combined very well with development policy, and the fact that quality can then also be introduced here is of the utmost importance to my terms.

The report’s recommendations are very much in the same direction as the Commission’s policy. It recognises that sustainable fishing partnership agreements contribute to sustainable fishing and to the development of the fisheries sector in partner countries. I fully agree that these agreements play a key role in the global governance of the oceans. As you know, my ambition is to set a benchmark at international level through these agreements. Sustainable fisheries partnership agreements (SFPAs) contribute to the achievement of development goals, in particular food security. We need to help developing countries to manage their resources in a sustainable way, and this is key for the supply of healthy food and for the livelihood of coastal populations. I welcome the report’s finding that SFPAs are a very successful tool that integrate the partnership component and commercial aspects of the SFPAs, and that they promote transparency, sustainability and accountability. I also share your objective that we should ensure even better consistency between fisheries, environmental and trade policy, as well as development cooperation. I agree that, as pointed out in the Court of Auditors’ report, there is room for further improvement. This is the case, for example, for our sectoral support policy. This is already a highly effective tool, supporting our third-country partners in developing their fisheries sector in a sustainable way and in fighting illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We will continue to work to rally the sector’s support and ensure better coherence with our policies and our regional cooperation. Some of the report’s recommendations have already been included in my recent proposal on the sustainable management of the external fleet. I want to improve the current legal framework and extend its scope to tackle any situation where a Union vessel is fishing outside EU waters, including under the so-called private licences. I also want to prevent abusive reflagging, which is not addressed in the current rules. These measures should definitely improve transparency and represent an additional step in reinforcing the governance of oceans where the EU is playing a key role. I am therefore looking forward to Parliament’s support on this proposal. Finally, a few words on regional fisheries management organisations. We have a key interest in creating such bodies where stocks are shared, and in ensuring that they work well when they already exist. We have been working hard to increase the performance of these bodies in recent years, including through financial contributions. We will also continue to improve scientific compliance and to ensure science—based decision-making. Geographical gaps, such as in the central Arctic Ocean, should be closed by setting up an adequate management framework. Existing advisory bodies, such as the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic, should be made into fully-fledged decision-making bodies. But we cannot achieve this alone. Therefore, since the beginning of my mandate, I have reached out to a number of key players to move better fisheries governance forward. Regarding the rapporteur’s support for our stronger and clearer provisions on joint ventures, the Commission has proposed this through specific conditions in its new proposal for the regulation of the external fleet – FAR – which is now under negotiation. This will increase transparency and reduce opportunities for abuse. I would like to take the opportunity to assure you that the Commission is fully committed to improving global fisheries governance as an essential component of ocean governance. We will continue to act globally at the level of the UN and FAO to have the legal framework we need, regionally to have efficient fisheries management bodies in place, and bilaterally in the framework of sustainable fisheries partnership agreements and dialogues with key partners to make sure fish stocks are managed in the best possible way and in a transparent manner.

It is good news for an industry in an existential crisis due to the massive dumping of cheap steel. Contrary to the Europhobes’ lies, the EU is not the cause of this crisis, but it is a crucial means for fixing it through strong trade defence measures. MEPs, the Commission and governments representing 72% of Europe's population are in favour of action, but it is our government – the British Government – which is blocking that crucial EU action. Stronger trade defence tools could be finalised in a matter of weeks, on 13 May at the EU Trade Council, and it is up to the UK Government and David Cameron to decide if they are really willing to save our steel communities and our vital industry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 245, "date": "2016-04-11.json", "name": "Andrejs Mamikins (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124746", "text": "   – Madam President, every state has the right to defend its inhabitants, independence, territorial integrity and interests by whatever means deemed necessary, without, however, breaking the law or violating the inherent rights of its own people. Of these rights, freedom of speech and self-expression rank among the most important. Two years ago, the Latvian Maxim Koptelov published a survey on the possibility of Latvia joining the Russian Federation. He himself described the whole idea as a joke. Nonetheless, in February of this year he was sentenced to six months in prison. Interestingly, the authorities had ignored similar surveys on the subject of Latvia joining the United States of America. What is more, a month ago the Latvian Parliament introduced an amendment to its criminal law, according to which essentially any statement, even a joke, deemed to have improper content could now lead to actual imprisonment. My home country has disgraced itself in a shameful manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
