Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. \"Good thing sometimes takes a while,\" one says in Austria. This good thing that we are discussing today, namely the question of the weights and dimensions of lorries, has really taken a little longer. But we have come to a good end. I was very pleased that the proposal for this report for second reading was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Transport. That is not always the case, and it shows that we have worked very well together. It also shows that common solutions can be found if it is necessary and sensible. In terms of content, the European Parliament, together with the Council, has taken this Commission's proposal forward and changed it. We felt – and this is the first key point – that there was no need for any new legislation on the issue of cross-border journeys. Those who have so far crossed borders with larger, heavier and higher trucks can continue to do so. Those who do not want to do so do not need to do so, nor do they need to allow such lorries to pass through these countries. That has been the stand so far, and it is good that it has remained so. That is what we have decided. Otherwise, we have been very accommodating to the Commission and have taken up the ideas expressed in this proposal, because they were very useful. We have ensured that lorries become safer in the future, safer for drivers, but also and, above all, safer for other road users, for weaker road users, in particular by changing the shape of cabins, but also by improving the all-round visibility, because there are still a great many serious and also fatal accidents involving lorries, especially in urban traffic. We have also ensured that trucks become more environmentally friendly in the future, on the one hand by enabling other propulsion methods, more environmentally friendly propulsion methods, on the other hand also by changing the design of the trucks, at the back by introducing so-called rear flaps – I believe that the English term is almost the better one here – and at the front by the possibility of modifying the cabin shape. There are also facilitations for intermodal transport. This is also important because we have so many different transport situations in Europe. If you compare Central Europe with northern Europe, for example, the distances are quite different. That was also important. Another problem we have addressed is the issue of truck overloading. Drivers are held responsible if the truck is overloaded. Therefore, they must also be able to see if it is overloaded. We will ensure that this is the case in the future and we have ensured that this will be the case. Ladies and gentlemen, that is what I have to say in my introductory remarks. Once again, thank you very much for the extremely good cooperation. I look forward to a lively and interesting debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur Mr Jörg Leichtfried, for the excellent work they have done. The Commission is grateful for the amendments proposed and adopted by Parliament and for the constructive work carried out during the legislative process to reach a good compromise. All these efforts have contributed to the possibility of having safer and greener heavy goods vehicles on the roads in the future. The proposed revision of the Weights and Dimensions Directive will serve different EU transport policy objectives. First, it will contribute to road safety. This is for us one of the core objectives and we always try to find new solutions in order to achieve that: better road safety. It is good for vulnerable road users because the new cab design will give lorry drivers a better view of the road. On-board weighing systems linked to digital tachographs and weigh—in—motion stations on the main roads will allow for more consistent checks from country to country.  Second, it will encourage greener transport. With the use of low—carbon technologies it will make trucks more aerodynamic and therefore more fuel—efficient.  Third, it will promote innovation as has already been stated, and this will boost the competitiveness of the EU industry at a global level. It is enabling legislation which will allow European manufacturers to sell the truck of the future across the global markets.  Finally, intermodality. This promotes intermodular transport by cutting red tape to allow 45-foot containers to be shifted more easily between ship, rail and road.  This can be described as a win—win situation for society, with fewer emissions and casualties on our roads; for hauliers with lower fuel costs and additional incentives to renew their fleet; and for the industry, which will be able to produce new models with higher performance and to remain competitive on the global market for heavy goods vehicles.

I think that we have managed to achieve a very good result on the further development of the directive on dimensions and weights, both in our committee during the last parliamentary term and now, together with the Council in the trialogue, in negotiations that are not very easy. I would just like to pick out a few points; Key words have already been mentioned: I believe that the promotion of intermodal transport is a great step forward. I think it is a good point that we have solved the problem of not being able to transport 45-foot containers intermodally because of ten centimetres. The fact that we are getting more efficient commercial vehicles should also be mentioned. The fact that we are getting more road safety by allowing designs in the cab that improve the driver's field of vision is a significant step forward. However, I would also like to raise the issue of stricter controls in the event of overloading. The Commissioner also mentioned it in her speech. I think that this, too, is an important contribution to improving road safety, and also, of course, that we accept that new propulsion technologies require additional weight and dimensional requirements. All this shows that we are on a very sensible and right path. On the other hand, however, I would also like to say that, as far as the usable area itself is concerned, we have always made it clear that 25-metre lorries, 60-tonne lorries and the like are not on our agenda in cross-border traffic. And that is also a clear message that is being sent here by the European Parliament. What we have now permanently approved in Scandinavia for the Member States that have always done so in Scandinavia is not the introduction of long or 60 tonne lorries throughout the European Union – I would like to say this explicitly – but merely a confirmation of the status quo that we already have in other parts of Europe, but also creates the legal certainty there that would otherwise have been lost.

I would like to take this as an example – as has already been said– a larger windscreen will, of course, make a decisive contribution to the safety of those who are the weakest in traffic, namely pedestrians and bicyclists. This is part of the vision zero, namely zero road deaths by 2050. It is somewhat sad that the lobby has won in the Council in terms of introducing this new generation of lorries.

Mr President, today we are concluding a long dossier on sizes and weights. It is good that we have now reached an agreement and that modern-designed lorries now have an opportunity for the future: more environmental friendliness, better for road safety. In doing so, we are taking a step in the right direction. Yet I stand here with mixed feelings. We could do much more to make the road transport sector more environmentally friendly and road-safe, while at the same time reducing congestion on Europe's roads. I am referring, of course, to the ecocombi, the longer and heavier truck that we have known for a long time from the Dutch roads and on the Dutch roads. We see that the ecocombis drive around there to everyone's satisfaction. The environmental performance is better, there are fewer trucks on the road, there is no negative effect on infrastructure maintenance costs, nor does there is a negative impact on road safety. That's what all the studies on the ecocombi show. So you would expect Europe to take that opportunity and give the ecocombi ample access. Such an innovative concept, who would leave it behind? But unfortunately, what do we see? Unfounded prejudices and fear of innovation prevail here in this Parliament, and so the ecocombi does not have opportunities in Europe. As a result, we continue to be allowed depending on the good will of a Member State or an ecocombi. Fortunately, there is a back door, because we have known since 2012 that the European Commission is fine with the use of ecocombi across borders, provided that both countries on the border side allow the ecocombi nationally. Fortunately, there is that back door, but we missed an opportunity today. The ecocombi should have come to Europe.

He has really done a great job, because we have had very different positions in Parliament. He has managed to get this to a reasonable whole, which we all ultimately agreed to. We all agree with what we now have on the table. We all want more safety in lorries, it is more environmentally friendly, which we have already achieved through these aerodynamic attachments. That is all well and good. But I think that when Ismail Ertug says that we have now created something for the truck of the future, that is not quite right. We missed some chances. I think that is an explicit pity. It is .B that we do not have the extended semi-trailer in it. We do have the 45-foot container, but we have no options for the 48-foot container that is already on the world's oceans. Watching and watching tomorrow's traffic also means setting up the framework conditions for tomorrow's transport. Of course, it's true: not everything that is longer can drive anywhere, Lucy Anderson is right. It cannot be the case – and this is not the case in Germany either – that longer trucks, i.e. the really long ones, the 26-metre-long ones, drive into the cities. But there is infrastructure where possible. And that is exactly the case: I can fully understand, dear Jörg Leichtfried, that Austria says that we have tunnel systems, that there are no emergency stops in the tunnels where these long trucks can stop. We don't have the infrastructure, so they shouldn't drive with us. Totally ok! But I think that where it is possible to drive in Europe, we should also allow it. That is why I am very much looking forward to this revision clause, which comes from the Commission – hopefully before 2020. And one more thing: it is the case that, for example.B, in Germany North Rhine-Westphalia, the largest federal state, has agreed to take part in this field trial for long trucks – with a red-green government, of course – is something i welcome, because I think that is the right direction.

We are happy to regard the outcome achieved as a good compromise, especially in view of the series of wishes and demands that we have dealt with in the Member States and in the various stakeholders. It is worth bearing in mind that the fact that this proposal will make Europe's heavy equipment more energy-efficient, safer and, above all, lower-emission, is easily drowned in a number of technical details. The introduction of new technologies always entails costs, it must be recognised and can also indirectly affect the competitive situation and division of labour between modes of transport. During the preparations, it became very clear that the so-called mega-trucks raise fears, and at least personally, I was sometimes very concerned about whether we would continue to be able to maintain the exceptions that preserve logistical cost-effectiveness and the possibility of transport and production in the Nordic countries too, in northern Europe. In Finland, traffic flows and infrastructure are significantly different from those in congested Central Europe, and it is therefore of the utmost importance that solutions that are perceived to be regionally sound can continue to be in place, as is the case now, for example.

Legalising mega-trucks throughout Europe in densely populated areas with high traffic volumes would have, we believe, devastating effects for road safety and for infrastructure investment costs and would counteract all the good efforts for a more sustainable and efficient use of transport modes. Furthermore, the gains we achieved on road safety and fuel efficiency aspects are positive. The introduction of a new and safer lorry cab design, including reduced blind spots, underrun protection and health and safety within cabs, will save lives on roads, notably those of cyclists. However, we felt that these proposals had been considerably watered down. We had hoped for much more, for example for direct vision improvements, as well as for the possibility to implement those changes much sooner than from 2021 onwards. In view of the continued ban on gigaliners across borders within the EU, we are happy to support this text, although the gains on safety and workers’ rights could clearly have been bigger.

The safety was also mentioned here by colleagues, namely better visibility. Unfortunately, we still have many accidents involving lorries in Europe and these proposals could cause 300 road deaths. The issue of containers has already been mentioned by Mrs Meissner. Those 45 foot containers are a good development.  I think the ecocombis are a missed opportunity. In the Netherlands, we have very good experience with ecocombi's: positive effects on road safety and better environmental performance. There are more and more reports from the German Government – i.e. Mr Ertug – saying that they are good for the environment.

He has managed to keep unwarranted hysteria to a minimum, certainly on this issue of mega trucks.  Firstly, my delegation had a number of key political objectives. One was to ensure that the UK would retain the right to determine the use of mega trucks on British roads. Just for clarification, this has been established. So the agreement to operate cross-border is, in my view, as it should be. That should be determined; this is subsidiarity and that again has been the conclusion that has been reached. So I support my Swedish, Dutch and other colleagues too. It is not for me to determine what they choose to do in their Member State. Secondly, we were also successful in retaining the existing right of trucks which are higher than the permitted 4 metres to operate between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, thus protecting our local hauliers. Finally, in terms of safer cab design, we did successfully reach an agreement whereby new, safer and more streamlined cab design in lorries will be introduced following the Commission proposal on type-approval legislation which will be coming in the near future. So this will give our manufacturers sufficient time to improve those designs and this should eventually lead to safer vehicles, reducing the risk of death and injury to pedestrians and cyclists.

I am pleased that special permits have been maintained which allow non-standard vehicles to move around the territory of a country. Indeed, not every road infrastructure in the Member States is adapted m.in to the traffic of such large and heavy vehicles, for example because of climatic conditions or road quality. Therefore, the prior consent of two countries to cross-border use of mega-vehicles, as well as the monitoring and evaluation of the traffic consequences of these vehicles, will certainly greatly improve safety and maintain the proper condition of the road infrastructure.  The next important issue is vehicle overload. I would like to draw attention to the need to strengthen controls in this area, as it is often cheaper to implement an effective pre-wedding measurement system than the sum of the expenditure incurred in modernising roads as a result of the movement of overloaded vehicles on them. Moreover, the European Commission's plans to introduce a new on-board truck weight control system for new vehicles, to install a current weighing system, are, from my point of view, a very good solution.

Finally, however, I must add that it is a breath of fresh air for many of us that the legislation has been drafted in a way that has protected our road network from megakamions.  Make no mistake, I fully accept and consider it reasonable, for example, to use megakamions in scandinavian countries. After all, over the past years and decades, infrastructure has been fully conformed to this form of freight transport and has also made a significant contribution to reducing pollution and safety risks. At the same time, it would have been wrong to extend these vehicles in a uniform way, while ignoring the specificities of some Member States and the impact of megakamions.

The future permissible deviations from the current upper limits on vehicle dimensions are a contribution to making road transport safer, more environmentally friendly and more energy-efficient. They have not succeeded in making road freight transport more economical and future-proof. Of course, improving the aerodynamics of the vehicles in the front and rear areas without compromising the loading area capacity will increase efficiency. With a moderate extension of the semi-trailer combination by 1.3 meters, even better compatibility with 48-foot containers and rail traffic would be achievable. Changing the shape of the cab will reduce the blind spot in the driver's field of vision, taking into account in particular the concerns of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. However, in order to ensure genuine protection for these road users, I call for the introduction of driver assistance systems such as cameras or radar systems, which are mandatory by law. The most common violation of traffic regulations is the overloading of lorries. Overcharging has serious consequences, from damage to infrastructure to increased risk of accidents and distortion of competition between transport companies.

Separately, I would point out that I do not accept the fact that 'intermodal' and 'combined' transport are concepts that fully coincide.

The Commission is particularly satisfied that a compromise could be found on this political point. We all recognise that a particular type of service needs to be adjusted based on the available infrastructure and local characteristics.  The compromise maintains the status quo of the current directive, meaning that its Member States have competence to decide either to introduce longer trucks on a trial basis or not to do so. Member States can also decide which roads longer trucks are allowed to drive on, in order to minimise safety risks and impact on infrastructure. These are concrete examples of implementation of the subsidiarity principle.  So Member States already allowing longer trucks can continue to use them and those Member States which do not wish to have longer trucks can decide against them.  Let me be very clear on the clarification issue. At the request of the legislators, the Commission clarified during the interinstitutional negotiations its interpretation of this existing text through a statement.

It is, of course, difficult to reach a compromise. But I think we have succeeded. I ask both of them to forgive me for overdrawing, but I think it was better suited to represent it. A very interesting issue was the issue of subsidiarity, which was raised at the end by Mrs Arnautu, Mrs Seymour, Mr Lundgren and Mr Etheridge. Yes, subsidiarity is a good thing. But we live in an internal market. If each country in this internal market were to adopt different technical specifications for lorries, what would be the situation? A country .B allows these flaps, the next country in which this truck wants to continue does not allow them. Do you now have to reload the truck at the border? That's not how it works! There must be certain rules that apply to the whole of the internal market, particularly in the transport sector. Otherwise, this transport industry would not work. You have to see that. Of course, British trucks can also travel to Europe, to the continent and vice versa. This is possible because we have the same rules. It is good that we have the same rules here.

Mr President, the creation of the European Long-Term Investment Funds (ELTIF) is the first concrete step in redirecting financial resources towards the real economy and, in particular, towards long-term investment.  In recent weeks, we have seen that all the engines of growth are returning to Europe. We are benefiting from the collapse in the price of a barrel, a significant fall in the euro, the particularly accommodative policy recently launched by the European Central Bank and, finally, the launch of the Juncker plan.  We must consolidate these fundamental elements of growth: by first retaining the global liquidity that is now returning to Europe spontaneously. Naturally, by strengthening financial stability across all dimensions of the banking union and by clearing the obstacles to investment that remain between the Member States, together with our partners. That is the whole point of the banking union and the union of capital markets. ELTIF is a much-anticipated first investment for this purpose. We started from a worrying observation with the Commission. Large amounts of money are available around the world, but very few are moving towards long-term financing and very few are moving to Europe for these financings. Governments themselves are constrained by significant debt and fiscal reforms to be implemented. Large companies adopt conservative investment strategies or, in turn, they invest outside Europe and the banks - weakened ones - still too often depend on state aid. Moreover, insurance companies and pension funds wishing to invest in long-term assets do not always have the resources to independently mobilise sufficient funds, and there is no European pooling mechanism, such as investment funds, that would facilitate this type of action.  So we had to respond to a market need. The creation of the new investment vehicle aims to encourage them to invest in assets such as unlisted companies looking for long-term capital, some listed SMEs, as well as the European venture capital funds and European social entrepreneurship funds that we created some time ago. These categories of funds require investors to agree to lock in their investments for a period of time in exchange for a bonus, unlike other funds that allow investors to recoup their investment at any time but for less pay. To be LABELLED ELTIF, funds will need to invest at least 70% of their capital in certain types of assets, be marketed only by managers - the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive sets out strict rules and stringent requirements for fund managers - and finally be managed for a fixed period during which investors are not allowed to recoup their investment , except in certain circumstances to be clearly specified from the outset. We have tried to create as flexible a status as possible to appeal to sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, pension funds, but also wealthy individuals. ELTTTs mainly target professional investors such as local or corporate pension funds, municipalities, insurance companies. They will also be available to some retail investors. This is how we propose to consolidate the investment toolkit in Europe, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Its entry into force will coincide with the effective start of the Juncker Plan and will have the same objective: to boost growth and competitiveness throughout the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 68, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Margrethe Vestager", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes the constructive approach to this important file both under the current rapporteur Mr Lamassoure and under Mrs Kratsa—Tsaragopoulou in the previous Parliament. In particular, we are very thankful for Parliament’s willingness to compromise on issues such as the European investment quota to ensure that the European Long-term Investment Funds are in place and in a form that is both attractive for potential managers and investors. The European Long—term Investment Funds will invest in a wide range of underlying assets – infrastructure, real assets and other long-term projects, unlisted companies, listed small and medium—sized enterprises capitalised up to EUR 500 million and intellectual property. It is a unique opportunity for asset managers to give investors access to a far wider range of assets than has hitherto been available, in a robustly regulated legal framework. As such, it is a key component in our work on the financial markets union to increase the amounts of market financing going into the real economy.  This regulation is one of the first concrete expressions of our work with capital markets. At the moment, private investors interested in committing money for the long term face a set of fragmented national markets which can make it hard for them to invest in one single Member State or across borders within the Union. This in turn restricts the amount of private investment for jobs and growth. The European Long-term Investment Funds are designed to solve this problem, creating a uniform set of rules that allows all types of investors to invest in SMEs, long-term projects and companies. This makes it a first mover in a true capital markets union as it creates a robust and reliable framework for investors who want to make long—term commitments of capital.  Members probably know even better than me that there is a pressing need to do exactly that. As Mr Lamassoure has just pointed out, the winds are a little milder these days with the euro going down and with energy pricing being more favourable to growth but, at the same time, we need investment. The estimated investment is about EUR 1 500 billion to EUR 2 000 billion by the year 2020 to finance infrastructure projects which are so keenly needed. The European Long-term Investments Funds have a role to play here and in other parts of the economy where long-term committed capital is needed. Our commitment to market-based financing, channelled through these funds, does not exclude the role that banks can play in long-term financing. Banks continue to play a very important role in financing long-term businesses and projects in many Member States. The European Long-term Investment Funds are therefore complementary to this activity. Parliament and the Council have always agreed that SMEs are crucially important to the European economy and so their inclusion as an asset within this is key. I would like to pay tribute to Parliament’s farsightedness in including intellectual, as well as physical, property within these Funds. Research and development play a vital role in our economies and they are as much in need of financing as physical infrastructures for example. Ensuring that all types of investors – retail investors as well as major institutions such as insurance companies and pension funds – can access our European Long-term Investment Funds has always been a key element of the Commission proposal. Parliament’s support for retail access has proven vital in ensuring that this remains the case in the final result. I also commend the House’s willingness to accept the extra safeguards proposed, such as only allowing investors with less than EUR 500 million in assets to invest and not to put more than 10% of their savings into these funds.

For that reason, Mr Juncker presented an investment plan, and the European Long-term Investment Fund (ELTIF) was part of that much—needed plan to get Europe back on track.  What these funds can do is function as an investment vehicle that can contribute to the financing of the real economy in the EU.

The capital markets union – which we are talking about today and also will be in the coming weeks – is all about creating diversity both for investors and companies which are in need of finance. I think that today we have given them a piece of the puzzle where we say: look for investors, especially institutional investors, and we can create a fund; we have a label here which allows you to invest in the long term, not only in infrastructure projects, but also in non—listed companies and in SMEs which also need a stable shareholding base. I think it is important that with this label we give investors the diversity that they need.  This is also a new tool for companies to raise money and to look for new investments in their companies which are looking for a stable shareholding base. It is important also for the small— to mid—cap companies to allow this.  Of course, the work is not finished. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and pension funds, insurance companies and banks, even some high—net—worth retail investors, will have to come in to provide the necessary finance.

It is an attempt to attract investors to investment funds whose purpose will be to work in the long term. But I am surprised, in any case, that the Council has refused - and Mrs Vestager has pointed out - the quota for European investment. We were very modest, we said that, in order to receive the label of European long-term investment funds, 60% of the investments of these investor funds had to be invested in Europe. The Commission considered that this was an impossible red line to cross. What does the Council want? Does it want to encourage investors or encourage investment in Europe? By refusing the quota, I think the Council has shown which side it is on.  We will nevertheless vote for this text, but we believe that if we really want to revive long-term investment in Europe, other measures are needed.  First, retail banks should be separated from reputable investment banks. When you force the banks that collect the savings to do only one thing, which is to lend the money to the real economy, and you close the casino to them, the entirety of the European savings will ipso facto go to the real economy.  Second, we must have the courage to tackle a series of financial products, the sole purpose of which is to squeeze the lemon of the planet and the lemon of our societies to extract maximum profit in the short term.  Finally, a genuine European investment plan must also be put in place. In this regard, I would like to bring two figures closer: 13 billion is the public money that the Juncker plan promises to mobilise, it is one hundredth of tax evasion and evasion in Europe. If we were serious about the fight against tax evasion and evasion, EUR 1 trillion would join the public coffers.

Together with other pieces like the Juncker plan, this can gradually change the picture and help to improve our long—term economic growth. But let me state here that financial regulation is not by far the only obstacle to supporting the long—term investments vital for our future. First of all, there is significant uncertainty concerning the reforms in some states – the reforms that are needed to get the countries on a sustainable path. As the countries have not reached a sustainable path, there is significant uncertainty about the future of economic actions which is undermining the investment. Secondly, instability of regulation and insufficient stability of the legal system is another obstacle which goes against people’s willingness to make a long—term investment. Last, but not least, the unfinished single market is also an important component, because a functioning single market is vital for a larger multinational project.

Since then, we have taken a long time to stabilise financial markets and to save the banks, but at the end of the day very little is being done to ensure the essentials, namely the long-term financing of the economy so that the European Union can face its challenges: climate change, the demographic challenge and what else do I know. So this is good news and, perhaps tomorrow, the European long-term investment funds, the ELTIF, will become this new label, much like the UCITS have been a demonstration that Europe knew how to invent financial markets or financial products useful for financing the economy. This will be true if these funds allow investments outside of speculation, outside of tax havens and in particular in compliance with OECD conventions. This will be true if it does, indeed, help to create jobs here in Europe through these strategic investments or allows individuals to contribute to these funds as well.

There are two fundamental dogmas in this proposal. The first dogma is that the Capital Markets Union has to play a bigger role in channeling funding into the real economy. And I ask: do we really need to multiply and extend the casino model, which was ultimately the one that led us to adjustment programmes during the crisis years? Do we really need to multiply this model, or do we need to work on this model and reverse it completely?  The second dogma is what says that we need to create new investment vehicles, which says that if there are no new investment vehicles, there is no way to finance small and medium-sized enterprises and other organizations. They even say that without a capital market there is no alternative financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. And I ask you, isn't there? So what is made of the traditional relationship between banks and economics? What is made of public investment? Why do we only multiply the instruments that aggravate the systemic risk of the European economy?  And yet, the fundamental prolema is not worked.

All the proposals launched by the EU in recent years do not relaunch traditional credit, do not put the credit system before its social role but, on the contrary, leverage the capital market, where speculation reigns supreme and the dangers to savers are very high. The continuing carelessness of the productive fabric that has driven European countries for years is part of a clear path, decided by brussels bureaucrats.

Slowly things are getting better, we are solving specific problems, such as financing long-term investments, and I think that over time the picture changes and the outlook improves.  For example, we have the stabilisation of the banking system and its consolidation, we have a significant reduction in borrowing costs - both for businesses and for the public sector - particularly in the so-called 'region countries', although I do not quite accept this wording, but in any case the fall in borrowing costs, for example in Ireland and Portugal, makes debt more manageable and frees up resources for development and social reasons.

What we now need to do – and it is the key issue for me – is to provide certainty. There is a wall of funds within the pensions industry, within the insurance industry, that will invest in a long—term investment project. But they are looking for two things: they are looking for certainty, firstly that they will get their money back, and secondly they are looking for certainty in terms of the projects that they need to invest in.

At present, access to finance for SMEs is also at a reasonable level. More than 70% of euro area loan applications are accepted. Interest rates are 2.78% on average, which means that the banking sector does work in that sense, but more attention must now be paid to ensuring that Europe is an interesting investment destination in the European Parliament as well.

(Applause) Allow me to assure you and your people – the applause shows it – of our full support and solidarity with your country in these difficult times. We also want to support Jordan on the road to political and economic reform. You, Her Majesty, have embarked on this course of reform, responding to your people's desire for change. They have recognised that reforms can bring peace and respect for human rights to the region. Jordan and the European Union are also partners in the international alliance against the so-called Islamic State. We want the Jordanian people to be able to live with dignity and in a safe environment. For many years, Her Majesty has been making a decisive contribution to ensuring that this security is returned to the region. And even these days, your country is leading the way in providing parole to the terrorist militias on the ground. The determination with which you oppose the spread of hatred and extremism requires our utmost respect. In these difficult times for minorities throughout the region, Jordan continues to be a tolerant country where people can live together peacefully, regardless of their faith. Your participation in the commemorative march in Paris for the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack was therefore a strong signal for which I thank you from the heart, certainly on behalf of the whole House. (Applause) With this signal, you have shown that Jordan is once again standing up to terrorism and to the side of tolerance, respect and peace. Finally, Her Majesty – we have just had the opportunity to talk about this – your tireless commitment to a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict shows that you share with us, that we share the same values and norms with you. We want to be guided by these norms and values in order to meet the challenges together in these difficult times. True friends can be recognized in difficult times. We Europeans are proud to have a real friend in Jordan and in its king. Her Majesty, welcome to the European Parliament. You have the floor.

Mr President, distinguished Members, Jordan treasures its long ties of friendship with this great institution, and I appreciate your invitation to speak here today. Permettez-moi aussi de remercier les citoyens de Strasbourg pour leur hospitalité chaleureuse. Cette ville représente toujours un symbole du passage de la guerre à la paix, un symbole de la réconciliation et de l'unité de l'Europe. (L'Assemblée, debout, applaudit l'orateur) My friends, people thrive where there is mutual respect. Civilisation is built on it and futures are better for it, but co-existence must be made, and made again, in every generation. The common good is defended only by vigilance and action, and this means more than security measures. Humanity must arm itself with ideas, with justice, and with economic and social inclusion.  Today these challenges have a special importance. Our world faces an assault by terrorists with ruthless ambition. The motive is not faith: it is power pursued by ripping countries and communities apart in sectarian conflicts and inflicting suffering across the world. (Applause) The savage murder by Daesh of Jordan’s hero pilot outraged all Jordanians and horrified the world. Jordan’s response has been swift, serious and determined, and our fight will continue. (Applause) We and other Arab and Muslim states defend not only our people but our faith. This is a fight that has to be carried out by Muslim nations first and foremost. (Applause) This is a fight within Islam. At the same time, the danger of extremism must be seen for what it is: global. The threat is not only in Syria and in Iraq. It has struck Libya, Yemen, Sinai, Mali, Nigeria, the Horn of Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Europe has suffered despicable attacks and shown unbeatable courage. Your friends are with you. In January, Rania and I joined millions of people in France who marched, united, against violence and intimidation. My friends, there are those living in Europe today who remember the ravages that struck the continent in the late 1930s and the world war that followed, because of an aggressive, expansionist ideology based on hatred and disregard for the very essence of humanity. Europe’s war became the world’s war. Today we are fighting a similar war, a war against an expansionist ideology that feeds on hate, that is committing murder in the name of God and religion, to justify evil actions that no religion tolerates – a war against terrorists who disrespect Islam’s values and humanity’s values. Our victory now depends on our unity and Europe’s role is vital. Only by cooperation can our regions shut down the sources of terrorist support and defeat their purposes. And it is also essential that our regions renew the source of our great strength: the mutual respect that binds and sustains us. Young people especially must be inspired by values that reject violence, create peace and build inclusive societies. (Applause) Let me suggest three areas of importance. The first is meaningful interfaith outreach, engaging people where they live. A dialogue of respect is the rock—bed of all societies. Attacking and excluding others, insulting other peoples and their faith and their convictions – this is no way forward. The future lies in unity and respect, not division and stereotypes. (Applause) Europe is an important partner in this effort, especially in helping to stop the global rise of Islamophobia. This poison is based on false ideas and helps play into the hands of these extremists. This is why it is important to clarify what it really means to be a Muslim. I and countless other Muslims have been taught from our earliest years that our religion demanded respect and caring for others. The Prophet Mohammad, peace and blessings be upon him, said: ‘None of you has faith until you love for your neighbour what you love for yourself.’ This is what it means to be a Muslim. Among the very names of God we hear the Compassionate, the All-Merciful. All my life, every day, I have heard and used the greeting Assalamu aleikum – a wish for the other to be blessed with peace. This is what it means to be a Muslim.  (Applause) More than a thousand years ago, before the Geneva Conventions, Muslim soldiers were ordered not to kill a child, a woman or an old person, not to destroy a tree, not to harm a priest, not to destroy a church. These are the same values of Islam we were taught in school as children: not to destroy or desecrate a place where God is worshipped, not a mosque, not a church, not a synagogue. (Applause) This is what it means to be a Muslim. These are the values I teach my children and that they will hand on to theirs. My friends, I am outraged and grieved by the recent attacks in some countries against Christian and minority communities. This is an offence against humanity as well as Islam. Arab Christians are an integral part of our region’s past, present and future. (Applause) Jordan is a Muslim country with a deeply—rooted Christian community. Together the Jordanian people make up an indivisible society – friends and partners in building our country. The world’s Muslims have a critical role in global understanding. Our faith, like yours, commands mercy, peace and tolerance. It upholds, as yours does, the equal human dignity of every person – men and women, neighbours and strangers. Those outlaws of Islam who deny these truths are vastly outnumbered by the ocean of believers – 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide. In fact these terrorists have made the world’s Muslims their greatest target. We will not allow them to hijack our faith. (Applause) My friends, the second area key to global harmony is an international system that gives all people the respect they want and deserve. Again and again I hear the question: why does the world not defend Palestinian rights? Time after time the peace process has stalled. Let me say what the situation looks like in reality – more Israeli settlement-building, less respect for the occupied Palestinians. This failure sends a dangerous message. It erodes trust in international law and community. It threatens a pillar of world peace: that conflict must be solved by political means, not by force, not by violence, and it has given the extremists a powerful rallying cry. They exploit the injustices and the lingering conflict, to build legitimacy and recruit foreign fighters across Europe and the world. (Applause) It is time to think about the future and how this ongoing conflict will breed further hate, violence and terror across the world. How can we fight the ideological battle if we do not chart the way forward towards Palestinian—Israeli peace? Our countries, united, must provide the momentum and chart the way forward towards a final comprehensive settlement. (Applause) Ladies and Gentlemen, a third critical effort is creating deeper hope. Radicalisation thrives on economic insecurity and exclusion. To create stakeholders in a peaceful world, people need opportunities to fulfil their potential and build good lives. Helping them is a powerful message of respect. The European Parliament has recognised the importance of creating social and economic opportunities in naming 2015 the Year of Development. For Jordan, development is a priority and despite all the regional challenges we have pressed forward to meet urgent needs, to grow jobs, to improve the quality of life through continued reforms and partnerships such as yours. Jordan values our strong partnership with the European Union and its Member States. We are committed, with your support, to work together towards more advanced levels of partnership. (Applause) Jordan also takes seriously our moral obligations to others. Despite scarce resources, the people of Jordan have opened their arms to refugees fleeing regional violence. As the President mentioned earlier, Jordan has taken in thousands of Iraqi Christians over the past year. This in addition to giving shelter to 1.4 million Syrian refugees, which is 20% of the population, over the past few years. (Applause) This is more than the equivalent of France hosting the entire population of Belgium. Our small country is now the world’s third largest refugee host and I thank all of you who are helping us to uphold this global responsibility. (Applause) My friends, your support sends a message, not only to my people but to all those who seek to move forward in peace and moderation. Europe is with you. Our regions, our people, can find no better partners and neighbours than each other. History, geography and future bind us. Let no one separate us because together we can create pillars of mutual respect that will support the common good for generations to come.

This balanced agreement was the subject of difficult negotiations during the last mandate and I am particularly pleased that there is no longer any question of opening up to free movement on European roads the movement of 'mega-camions', the giant lorries which are currently only subject to local use in some EU countries, and which in my opinion have no place in a Europe geared towards a sustainable economy. , and logically therefore towards modal deferral.

This vote and parliament's adoption of amendments have shown how the EU's legislatim can have a positive impact on the lives of the citizens of the European Union. The lack of competition in the card payment transactions sector has led to users paying too high costs in Europe.

Although the employment rate of women has risen slightly since 2002, it has been affected by the crisis.

If gender equality were to exist in the labour market, THE EU's GDP could increase by as much as 12%. The cost of care services continues to be a major obstacle to women's employment. It is therefore necessary for Member States to develop affordable and quality care services that are provided on a full-time basis. The fight against violence against women is also very important.

Equality between women and men is not only an essential element of social justice, enshrined in the Treaty on European Union (Article 2 and 3), but also a condition for stable and inclusive economic growth. The inequalities still present in the labour market between women and men limit the use of women's talents and competences, which the economy is losing, and undermine the constitutional principle of social justice. The accumulation of inequalities in the labour market results in a pension gap of 39%, which translates into poverty for women. Hence effective policies for reconciling professional and family roles, tackling labour market inequalities and gender mainstreaming are priorities for gender equality, which is one of the EU's key values. In order to express my support for equality, I voted in favour of the report, including gender budget analysis, quotas for women in decision-making positions, equality education, access to reproductive health and sex education services, the inclusion of the concept of violence against women and girls in Article 84 of the Treaty and other proposals in the strategy.

However, if we are to talk seriously about tackling the under-representation of women in the higher ranks, rather than introducing mandatory gender quotas we should advocate the implementation of corporate policies which encourage women to step forward; demonstrating that they are just as eligible for rising through the ranks as men.

Nor will it bring \"fairer competition,\" as is often claimed, but it will lead to private companies using the most profitable routes and siphoning off profits there.

Secondly, we wanted to note that the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement procedures in free trade agreements (e.B. the ISDS procedure in the EU-US Free Trade Agreement (TTIP) deprives Member States of the democratic right to implement their own policies.

Large retailers, often condemned for cartels, put a lot of pressure on suppliers via common purchasing centres. SMEs remain losers, disadvantaged by regulations that favour large groups, depriving them of public procurement.

In addition, within the framework of the banking union, the ECB has resumed supervision of systemic institutions, thus depriving states of their supervisory power.

The many actions put in place, some of which were considered \"unconventional\" for a Central Bank, although they did not lead to the desired recovery, avoided the collapse of the continental banking system and helped to create a climate of confidence in international markets with the consequent lowering of financing costs for the peripheral states of the eurozone.

In fact, the European Union budget is mainly an investment budget, only 6 % is administration expenditure. And a budget that has important added value in the European Union. We want 2016 to have as a priority what we call the three E: jobs, business and entrepreneurship. Employment and, above all, youth employment, and this means a focus on education, a strengthening of people's skills, the use of European Union funds and Structural Funds for this purpose, in particular the European Social Fund, not forgetting programmes such as Erasmus+, not forgetting programmes such as the Youth Employment Initiative, which we want to continue and which will have effective results in the coming years. Enterprises and, above all, small and medium-sized enterprises, is the other E. We must not forget that 99 % of enterprises in the European Union are small and medium-sized enterprises and are largely responsible for the employment that exists. A favourable environment is needed for small and medium-sized enterprises and priority needs to be given to programmes such as COSME. Entrepreneurship, because we need - it is the other E - also to support young people and all initiatives, all start up. We need entrepreneurship to have space, vigour and also a favourable environment in the European Union, and research, Horizon 2020 and programmes that can help this objective, including start-ups and COSME, which we want to be used for this purpose are directly linked to this objective. We do not forget the internal solidarity of the European Union, social cohesion, territorial cohesion is fundamental, aid to the most deprived is important, this internal solidarity which must pay attention to the Structural Funds but also in programmes centrally managed by the European Commission, such as the Social Innovation Programme or the programme within it, such as progress. Do not forget yet the external solidarity. The European Union must not forget its surroundings and external solidarity, the neighbourhood policy, we also help it to prevent the deaths that happen in the Mediterranean, aid to Ukraine must be in our concerns, all of which are for another purpose, which is to have a safe Europe.

We fully share the priorities he has outlined and we can sum them up with the ‘three Es’: employment, enterprise, entrepreneurship.  We should already in 2015 demonstrate that the priorities of this Commission regarding projects under the investment plan are put to work. This is in our DAB 1 (Draft Amending Budget No 1) i.e. that reprogramming of commitments is done in a timely manner so we can accelerate new programmes for the new programming period in the areas under shared management. As we worry about reinforcement of growth at home, we continue to be concerned about developments in our neighbourhoods, and therefore funding for actions we take on the external side must remain sound for countries facing humanitarian and civilian crises. We welcome very much the focus that the rapporteur has put on EU added valued and how our budget turns into an engine for growth and convergence. We are keen to reinforce – already in the 2016 draft budget – an approach that provides for measurable elements of results achieved, in other words, a strong focus on a budget oriented towards performance and results.  In terms of payment appropriations, we all remember the negotiations on the 2015 budget that ensured that, at the end of last year, the level of payments remained at EUR 24.7 billion of unpaid bills. I want to thank you for the efforts we have made together to prevent this level from going up even further and I can assure you that in the proposal for 2016 we will have a draft budget which allows us both to reduce the backlog and correct the pace of implementation for the new 2014—2020 programmes.  We are fully committed to the interinstitutional dialogue on the payment plan. As we promised, it will be made available by the end of March. On 30 March we will have our first trilogue, and that should also provide analytical documents that explain the payments situation today, how we expect it to evolve over time and what measures we are taking, so we can have a rhythm of absorption of the backlogs that by the end of 2016 brings us to a sound position.  We are committed to controlling administrative expenditure and staffing. Our 5 % staff cut is on track and we really hope all institutions will stick to the same administrative restraints so that we can demonstrate to our taxpayers that our focus is on what we do for them.

We do not always remember this, because traditionally there was a slippage of one year, but this will be the third year (2014, 2015, 2016 – the third year of the perspective), which means that this will be the year in which, hopefully, all operational programmes will be prepared and all the work will start, that is, we will have to deal with the first major payments that will already be used. Secondly, this is the year in which we will have to try to deal (as the Commissioner says) with unpaid payments from previous years, and this will put on the situation of new investments, because we know very well that there are no two budgets – one old and one new – it all goes from one budget.

But maybe someone is watching on the Internet. Mr Fernandes, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank mr Fernandes for his excellent work and for the work she has I am sure we all share the interest that the budget should be used for growth and jobs as far as possible. But the Europe 2020 strategy also has a social and an ecological side. I am one of those who finds these objectives clearly too defensive. Our proposal as Social Democrats in this Parliament is therefore to emphasise more clearly the social and environmental dimension in the budget and to strengthen the corresponding programmes and instruments. We will also pay close attention to how the EU's unresolved payment problem is addressed in the context of the 2016 EU budget. Madam Vice-President, I am waiting impatiently for the Commission's proposal on this. So far, we have only been able to stabilise the level of unpaid bills, we have not reduced it. The Council seems to be relying on many programmes to be implemented late, leaving money unused, which can then be used to pay outstanding bills. I have strong doubts that this will be so simple. The Council should have learned its lessons from the last budgetary procedures. In the spring of last year, it cut the Commission's draft budget and in late autumn it had to agree to a supplementary budget of several billion euros. How about, dear Council, if we do not make any knee-jerk cuts this year, but to realise together that jointly defined political objectives also cost money? And because that is the case, the decommissioning of budget estimates, i.e. decommissioning, will not be a solution either. In the end, the EU budget may become smaller, but whether it can then achieve the political objectives can be called into question. The Council has some allies in this House, but we Social Democrats do not consider a small budget to be a political value in itself. We are concerned with solving problems. We should also consider the Stability and Growth Pact in the context of the 2016 budget. Ladies and gentlemen, if Member States cannot make sufficient contributions in a largely investment budget because they then violate the stability criteria, then I believe that we have a clear argument as to why this Stability and Growth Pact should be de-ideologised as a matter of urgency. Finally, the revenue situation is important to me. Smuggling is damaging the EU budget. Cigarette smuggling alone damages Member States' budgets by EUR 10 billion a year. That makes EUR 1 billion for the European budget. We have already been arguing with the Council for less money. I would like to make another point about the revenue situation: the EU's only real own resources are customs duties. Is anyone in the EU, especially in the Council, concerned about what the forthcoming free trade agreements with the US and Japan mean for the budget? In any case, we will therefore keep a close eye on the debate on own resources.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2048, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Bernd Kölmel", "mepid": "124824", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take back from the ECR Group.

We are talking about the guidelines of the 2016 budget. The report mentions four considerations which deal in particular with the importance of this budget for the Member States. We all agree on that. It contains 19 findings and claims. I am sure we are all concerned about the level of unemployment and the scandalous level of youth unemployment. We all want to create jobs. It also highlights the potential we have in the budget to improve all these things. We agree on this in principle. But the question is: how can we promote all this? Here we say, the ECR Group, quite clearly: only by accompanying measures, only by helping people to help themselves. We want aid recipients to be able to do so as quickly as possible and not need any help in the foreseeable future. We miss the clear signals in this report that this is the direction in which we are heading. We want a lean budget. We believe that this is an important value, both for the EU and for the Member States. We fear that we are going in the wrong direction instead, and we see a particularly bad signal in the EUR 315 billion investment programme. In our opinion, this is going in exactly the wrong direction, because it calls for more state governance and restricts free market forces. This cannot lead to anything good, as we have had enough examples in the past. One case is, for example, that German universities are not at all in a position to apply for funding from this programme in the future. At the same time, in the Horizon 2020 programme, we are cutting funding for basic research. These are completely false signals. That is why we, the ECR, reject this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2049, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Nedzhmi Ali", "mepid": "34250", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, we support in general the report by the rapporteur Mr Fernandes on the guidelines for the 2016 budget. The priorities are correctly presented as they have been discussed within the Budget Committee. Launching the guidelines for the preparation of budget 2016 we should have two things in mind. Firstly, the EU Member State economies are already in the 8th year of fiscal consolidation with visible lack of resources to bridge the gap of missing investments. Secondly, 2016 will serve as a benchmark of post—electoral multiannual financial framework divisions. The main directions alongside on which the budget should be developed are creation of favourable conditions for economic growth, an increase of employment, which will lead to economic social and territorial cohesion with any Member State left aside. In this respect, special emphasis should be put on policies towards growth, competitiveness and employment with the particular highlight on the role of small and medium enterprises and mid-cap companies and on ensuring the proper distribution of European funds. In 2016, the new investment plan proposed by the Commission, aiming at mobilising EUR 315 billion to stimulate public and private capital investment in Europe, shall also be fully operational. While it is expected that the EU budget will fund the biggest part of the guarantee for this European fund for strategic investment, I would like to stress that this EU contribution must not be made at the expense of existing EU multiannual programmes.  Last, but not least, the 2016 budget has to be provided with a sufficient level of payment appropriations so as to bring real results to the European citizens, to enable the budget to match EU political priorities and to allow the Commission to meet its legal obligations. The ALDE Group insists on the conclusion of a structural plan for payment before the presentation of the Commission of its draft budget 2016, as jointly agreed among the Parliament, Council and the Commission during the negotiations on budget 2015.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2050, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Pablo Echenique", "mepid": "125036", "text": "  GUE/NGL Group. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the scientific and academic field unanimity is practically total.

According to the Commission's own research department, austerity cost France 4.8 points of GDP between 2011 and 2013. In the face of this, the resolution welcomes the implementation of the Juncker Plan, whose leverage of 15 is totally overestimated. The pact for growth and employment provided for a lever of 6 to finish in reality at 2. It has no new fiscal stimulus and does not meet the investment needs estimated at 235 billion euros per year to boost economic activity.

Let me also congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work in drafting the guidelines for the 2016 budget. More than ever before, the most important priority is to create more employment in Europe. To put it in a nutshell, with employment comes political stability, without employment comes instability, and instability in Europe is always fertile soil for dangerous political development. So it should be clear to everyone that we need to give European enterprises the best possible environment for employing people. But this is nothing new and here we are again talking over and over about the same thing. It should be obvious that European political institutions alone are not able to pull the rabbit out of the hat. This is why we should not separate the 2016 budget from the Juncker Plan. The plan – not just the approval of the plan but the working plan that is implemented – is needed for economic growth in Europe. An EU budget is needed for the Juncker plan to take off. So in the big picture, the number one priority is to allow additional private investment to take place.

Yes, it is imperative to solve the payments crisis in order to restore credibility and room for action to the European budget, and in this we will be particularly attentive to your proposals for a debt purge plan. But this issue of the payments crisis must not mask the dysfunctions of the Union, nor the gaping flaws in the budget, some of which are structural. I want to quote: the programming delays of the Structural Funds, to the point that we need to change the multi-year financial framework at a time when Europe is in dire need of investment; the Youth Employment Initiative, which to date has failed to meet the objectives that Parliament had entrusted to the Commission and member states; budgetary constraints, which deprive the Union and the States of the means to respond to the global challenges of the fight against terrorism, the Ukrainian crisis or the great climate challenge.  And, above all, there are our difficulties in financing innovation, energy transition, the fight against climate change, blue growth. In short, anything that needs to stimulate tomorrow's growth but which cannot find the means today either at EU or national level.  If investment in Europe is a priority, we must have the courage to give Member States room for action through greater flexibility in the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG), for example by removing contributions to the EU budget from the calculation of deficits.  Of course, there is Mr Juncker's plan, but as it stands, it would reduce funding for research and infrastructure projects to provide an extension to the EIB to finance frizzy projects.  Commissioner, I ask you sincerely: how can you accept your prerogatives being challenged? The question of the financing of the Juncker plan must, from our point of view, go back into the annual budgetary procedure and find all the necessary margins.  Finally, I will stress the last point of our resolution, the structural question of the budget: the Union's own resources.

In this situation, Parliament has high hopes of breaking these unfavourable trends precisely with the 2016 budget and the Juncker Plan.  I wanted to raise three serious concerns about these matters. Firstly, the Commission, the Council and Parliament do not appear to have been able to resolve the outstanding payments in 2015, despite previous assurances, and this undermines the credibility of all three institutions. Although the Union budget is primarily of an investment nature, it is wrong to hope that these investments will be a major part of the increase in investment in individual Member States if they are not prone to private sector investment. Thirdly, the hopes of the Juncker Plan may prove to be burning, as the lack of investment propensity on the part of the private sector is not at all due to a lack of access to finance, but rather to a lack of confidence in the development prospects of the EU economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2056, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Gérard Deprez (ALDE).", "mepid": "1473", "text": "   Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I essentially agree with the general guidelines proposed in the report of my friendly colleague, José Manuel Fernandes.

And this is a particularly good time to do so, as three complementary schemes will combine their efforts in 2016.   The first is, as you know, the quantitative easing programme put in place by the European Central Bank. In concrete terms, by September 2016, an amount of EUR 60 billion each month will be able to move sovereign bonds to productive assets. The second favourable arrangement is, of course, the Juncker plan. In this regard, I want to say that I totally agree with our rapporteur when he writes that the Union budget will have to make available to this plan the eight billion necessary to provide the guarantee. The third element of this scheme is, of course, the Union budget, which is, for the most part, as our rapporteur points out, an investment budget and which must also stimulate growth and innovation.

Nevertheless, I also have to point out that the 2016 budget will have to address key issues such as the financing of the Youth Employment Initiative.

Starting from the implementation of the budget so far, I would like to note that there are two important issues: delays in payments and unspent resources from previous financial programmes that raise important issues, especially in countries with reduced national resources. And delays in the start of the new programming period in cohesion policy automatically increase the risk of resource accumulation and reduce the chances of their absorption or even inefficient exploitation.  The report aims to create sustainable jobs. Can we study and discuss new initiatives here beyond the Youth Initiative, but also involving businesses?

Today’s debate has been a very good illustration of the fact that we are keenly interested in a sound financial base for our economies.  Let me make four very brief points. Firstly, it is a crucial time to secure sustainability of growth in Europe. In 2015, for the first year, we expect positive growth everywhere. I hope that will be the case also for Greece despite some political changes there. Should that be the case, the economy of Europe would be finally coming out of a long, protracted crisis. But we will only succeed if we are fiercely determined to use the budget for that exact purpose: to help our investments and help growth.  This is why my second point is: yes, the investment plan is very important because what it aims to do is to draw private sector investment on a large scale to complement what we do on the public sector side; that is essential. This takes me to the third point; if we are to succeed it will be shown in employment numbers. We know SMEs generate most of the jobs, so of course attention to SMEs is necessary; but attention to our innovative centres, to researchers and to small farmers is also necessary. This would be a predominant objective for us. Last but not least, I would mention social impact and the equality that we aim for. Luckily we continue to be the most equal region in the world and, even during the crisis, the Gini coefficient – the most well—known measure for equality in the 28 countries – has gone down slightly from 30.9 to 30.4. But we all know that this is not across the board; that in many countries and many regions and many communities, inequality has gone up. That is why we have to be very mindful of how the benefit from our budget is spread so that it is as equal as we can possibly make it.

We are referring here to the Juncker Plan, which we hope will be resolved in 2015 in June, but there is a little confusion here, the European Union budget will not give any subsidies or funds, the European Union budget guarantees only and provides only an €8 billion guarantee for an investment, particularly private, of EUR 315 billion.  Still on the goal of employment, business and entrepreneurship, the high priority. We must never forget that employment has an added value and a very strong social component, but if we look at the report we see that internal solidarity is there, social cohesion, territorial cohesion, the call to strengthen programmes to combat poverty. All this is mentioned, the social, solidarity, sustainability, we can even say that, in addition to the three E, we also already have these three S.

The report of the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is in your attention, was adopted unanimously. However, the course of its discussion outlined two divergent understandings of what adequate protection of the EU budget consists of.  It is traditionally considered that the emphasis should be placed on restrictions and sanctions in respect of the infringements found. However, the point is that violations are of two different types – one is the result of corruption, fraud and criminal acts. But the far greater number and volume are violations as a result of errors, ignorance of the rules or overly complex regulations. Sanctioning therefore needs to be combined with active support from Member States, both to prevent premediation fraud and to decisively limit cases of non-intentional infringements.   The data in the European Commission's 2013 report are sufficiently indicative – out of a total of EUR 2 billion and EUR 140 million of financial violations, the largest part – eight hundred and forty are the result of unintentional deviations from the rules, while the damage from intentional abuse amounts to no more than 309 million.  In this regard, I would also draw your attention to the sensitive issue of interruptions and suspensions of payments in the area of cohesion policy. The text now contained in the report calls on the European Commission to strictly follow its policy on the implementation of such measures. In this form, this wording is half-hearted because it does not contain the fundamental meaning for the preventive role of these measures as a means of preventing and preventing infringements. Such are the meaning and the letter of Article 325 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which puts first precisely the deterrent side of measures to protect the European Union's financial interests.   It is very important that Member States report to the European Commission the cases of fraud and unintentional infringements detected. This information identifies where the problems are and can be searched for solutions so that such problems are not repeated in the future. However, information on detected fraud and irregularities should not be used to embarrass states. On the contrary, countries must be incentivised to report, be encouraged to detect and prevent fraud and error, punish and correct them, address shortcomings and gaps in their control systems. Therefore, if some countries are found to be struggling, then responsible European institutions and other countries must assist them through good practices, exchange of experience and information, through coordination and training. It is in this way that the Union's financial interests will best be protected in accordance with the requirements and mechanisms of good financial management and in response to the expectations and requirements of European citizens.

We in the Commission have reviewed the report and I am very pleased that on a number of your recommendations we are already pursuing a positive follow up. Let me highlight some of these. First – irregularities reporting. We agree with your conclusion that we have to make a clear distinction between fraud and errors. Zero tolerance for fraud unquestionably, but with regard to errors we must invest in preventive action, simplification, and also in harmonisation across all expenditure categories, and this is work we are undertaking in a newly—established group of Commissioners that is dealing with the big spending areas.  With regard to our cohesion policy, we also agree with your emphasis on building up preventive action and also on taking stock, as requested by Parliament, at the mid-term assessment in 2018, of whether the new regulatory architecture of cohesion policy further prevents and reduces the risk of irregularities.  We have been very carefully reading the report’s views on public procurement. We recognise that it is still vulnerable to irregularities, to fraud, to corruption, and in this case we welcome the support you are giving to the transposition process of the new Public Procurement Directive. This is an opportunity for Member States to improve and it is also an opportunity for us in the EU institutions to carry forward the related changes to the Financial Regulation, which is currently under negotiation.  I hope that we will complete this negotiation swiftly. We recognise that the anti—corruption stand in our institutions is paramount. For that reason we will include an assessment of the implementation of internal anti—corruption policies – we are considering including it in the second EU anti—corruption report that is due in 2016.  With regard to the European Anti—fraud Office (OLAF), I have said many times that OLAF is a critical building block in our anti—fraud, anti—corruption stand. We are working for OLAF to have a sound interface with the OLAF Supervisory Committee. I have been personally engaging in working with the Supervisory Committee to make sure that we have the enabling environment for OLAF and for the Supervisory Committee to function. OLAF has been quite open to approaching the Supervisory Committee, including on the matter of statistical tools and the outcome of analyses, which is done on the basis of their application. We are also looking into how we can further strengthen the independence of the Supervisory Committee in their human resources and budget management policies. We will come forward with some advancement on this front soon.  We welcome the points that were made in the report on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the PIF Directive. I would say wholeheartedly that we appreciate your support. We are grateful for it. We need a European Public Prosecutor’s Office that is able to add value to the protection of EU financial interests. So we want to be ambitious and we want to have an institutional set—up that produces significantly better outcomes in our fight against fraud and corruption.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2087, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Pascal Arimont", "mepid": "24922", "text": "   Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. In times of tight public coffers, and not only then, we must ensure that European taxpayers' money is handled correctly. Every single penny that we have at our disposal for European projects must be put to good use. This is a very important concern for me and for my group. Reports of waste and misspent taxpayers' money are damaging the reputation of the European Union and damaging the image of politics in general. We must not do these favours to the enemies of the EU or to the enemies of democracy. That is why enlightenment is needed. This is important, especially in my field of expertise, cohesion policy, that is, the use of structural funds such as the ERDF, Interreg or ESF. It is the EU's policy area, where the highest total irregularities have been recorded. That must give us something to think about. A total of 321 cases of fraud were reported during the period 2013, i.e. EUR 156 million. In the area of non-fraudulent irregularities, as many as 4672 cases were reported, representing a loss amounting to EUR 1.2 billion. That is EUR 1.356 billion too much! We must ensure that European funding is used more efficiently in the Member States. We need objective criteria for recording fraud for all Member States. So far, these uniform criteria do not exist. We have also noted that a number of irregularities have arisen as a result of excessively complicated procedural rules. Administrative simplification is needed here.  Real fraud, on the other hand, must be prevented in advance by means of an appropriate anti-fraud strategy in the Member States. This also includes, and above all, external controls and, probably, the idea of the European Public Prosecutor. As you have just said, European tenders are also a frequent source of irregularities. The recently adopted directives on European tenders will or are intended to help reduce the problems, which is why these directives must be transposed into national law as soon as possible. We can make it possible for criminal energy to be less opportunities to develop without any problems. That is why I repeat: every penny must be used wisely.

It's our money, all together, whether you're a Romanian citizen, whether you're a German citizen or any Member State, and that's what we all need to understand: that we need to protect our citizens' money. European money is our citizens' money; their taxes and the national public budget are paid a quota to the European Union and these are the money for European funds. We have given this explanation to everyone, to make it clear that we are not talking about the financial interests of the Union in an abstract way, but about the money that actually comes from our citizens. And it is important to understand that it is a single basket, in which all the money is paid, and as such, if the protection of European funds is well fought in one Member State, but poorly fought in another Member State, everyone suffers because the money is together. So it is not true that if more is stolen in ten Member States, the rest do well because they are fighting their fraud at home. And we're still here because it's common money.

It can now be said that there are statistical ambiguities about the duration of the procedures and about the number or treatment of cases.

The OLAF Supervisory Committee has made an important report on this and on other systemic shortcomings, but the Commission should finally take the reports seriously and react. We need a proper fight against fraud, but I believe that preventing controls on statistics and other monitoring measures of the Office is really the only thing that works reliably. I am also concerned that the truth always comes to light only in a piecemeal way. I would like to mention this explicitly here.

It should be noted that the 2013 financial year is the last of the multiannual budget in which payments are therefore accumulated. Hence, some increases from 2012 go into normal if we consider that we are talking about literal data. I always say that multiannuality would have to be seen as such, instead of going year by year, which is another way of \"sausageing\" that usually hides reality. It is an exercise in which I thank the rapporteur for working thoroughly on the issue of income, because it is true that we have been focused for years and years on seeing how, in the expenditure section, it is best spent (I think we have been inducing at least a certain culture — and of interest — both in the Commission and , little by little, even though we find it insufficient, in the Member States); but instead we've been leaving and ignoring what was going on with income. That is, what happened to the inlet part of the money in the budget.  I think there are elements of concern there in 2013: the customs regime has not been sufficiently demanding and, therefore, there are elements to improve, and cigarette smuggling represents, as the figures show us, a total of EUR 10 billion. Look at the Juncker Plan and the EUR 10 billion in cigarette smuggling that we could still recover, even though , which I see Mrs Grule, is rapidly targeting OLAF - even though OLAF, in this regard, has achieved a number of important successes: the recovery and seizure of 68 million smuggled cigarettes , 124 kilos of cocaine and 140,000 litres of diesel fuel. In other words, OLAF must also be acknowledged for what it does well. We are also concerned that the computerised system for the movement and control of excise taxes identifies some deficiencies which we hope will definitely improve in the new procedure.  And there is a finding that year after year comes to us, which is that non-fraudulent irregularities, which are the largest number by which the budget begins to be a little undone and what should be emphasized, are usually due to the disrecognisement of the standard and overly complex regulations and requirements.

If he hears that more than EUR 2 billion has been spent inappropriately (in diplomatic language), well, it really has to be – and stirs up – strong emotions, we have to reckon with that. And, of course, I am pleased that these are mostly issues of certain irregularities and not of deliberate fraud, although I note that the amount of fraud has increased by as much as 30% in recent times. However, whether it is a question of irregularities or abuse, it is perhaps from the point of view of our constituents, our taxpayer, less important. What is important is that this money is lost by the Union, and therefore all of us, somehow. Of course, we need to see olaf's successes. I agree with the speaker, although of course efforts to improve his work must also be supported. That is what we have been talking about for years in the Committee on Budgetary Control.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Georgieva for her work in the area of better financial management of European Union expenditure. We are in agreement. As rapporteur, I have presented a report on the performance base budgeting of the European Parliament. We need to move towards results-oriented financial management. Citizens expect EU funds to be well spent. The main focus must continue to be on this in the future. As the ALDE Group, we have insisted that the Commission also use its instruments, that is to say, that the interruptions and corrections should be used in practice to force the Member States to correct them in the event that errors are found. 80% of the EU budget is shared and managed by the Member States. And the fact is that the corrections and interruptions have meant that the Member States have paid more attention to the money. The error rate has decreased. At the same time, however, there are also fraudulent transactions. Although not every mistake has been made fraudulently, there are criminal practices. And they must be punished. OLAF, the anti-fraud authority, is important here. However, it must also be monitored under the rule of law. That is why the Monitoring Committee needs to be strengthened. We need a European Public Prosecutor. However, the rule of law must also be respected.  Let me also turn to the important issue of combating tax fraud and tax evasion. If more than EUR 1 billion a year is lost to public hands by tax avoidance schemes, tax avoidance and tax reduction, then action must be taken. That is why we Liberals have also requested the special committee on Luxleaks. We in the European Parliament should be at the spearhead of public education here, because the citizens expect action to finally be taken here at European level too.

Thus, fuel smuggling, cigarette smuggling, VAT fraud and Lux-leaks tax evasion are on the agenda.  Of course there are irregularities which occur not by deceit, but purely by negligence. Here we must intensify our preventive action in order to make good use of the limited funds from the European funds.

We have a huge obligation to our people to use their money wisely and to account for every penny they give to us. The facts are that fraud actually has gone down a bit on the expenditure side: it stands at 0.19% versus 0.21% the year before. But 0.19% is too much and we have to continue relentlessly to push this evil out of the territory of our European project.  There was a comment that our accounts have not been signed. Our accounts are signed. Every year for the last seven years, the Court of Auditors has signed off the EU accounts but we still have an unacceptably high level of errors. The errors, at 4.7%, far exceed the tolerance of 2% that the Court has established and the Court has also told us very clearly that we have to simplify the rules. Many of you spoke about this. Simplifying the rules is necessary not only because then we will have fewer errors but also because then we can have true transparency and people can find out and trace the money. If it is complicated then we cannot do that. We know that transparency is our best friend in fighting fraud and corruption.  So I just want to stress that this is the reason we look to Parliament as a partner to help us in simplification. We now have rules. Unfortunately, in the MFF we managed to start from simpler rules and actually make them more complicated in the end but, within the parameters of the MFF, let us try to have the foundation for transparency that can help us to use money better and to be more accountable.  I completely agree with those who have spoken about the significance of also addressing the revenue side. On the revenue side the trend is in the opposite direction. Fraud has gone up a little to 0.29%. Obviously we have to take this very seriously because this is foregone revenue for our countries and it is a crime not to be tolerated.  I fully subscribe to the notion that prevention is better than cure. Preventing fraud and preventing errors is much better than having to respond to them. But we also need to act when wrongdoing or fraud takes place. I believe that if we have a European public prosecutor’s office with the right mandate, which is also able to tackle VAT fraud, it will make us more effective, not less effective. This is a notion that I have heard from many here. That, of course, would help us to protect the interests of the European Union.  And what is in the interests of the European Union? It is to protect our taxpayers; and for that we have to be credible in our own activities. This is why OLAF has asked the Supervisory Committee to look into the credibility of data. It is very important that we trust our own office on the data that it provides. That is actually something I personally would follow up. This is not for me to act upon – it is for the Supervisory Committee – but I am very interested in a good outcome.  This is a conversation we will continue.

The irregularity of the practice was only reported by the Commission auditors at the end of the 2007-2013 period in December 2013. The Court of Justice of the European Union has no relevant case law and it cannot therefore be concluded that the standards applied by the Hungarian State are unlawful. The requirements imposed by the contracting authority were in order to facilitate the proper and timely implementation of road construction projects. Foreign and Hungarian applicants were equally affected by the requirements, with 35 out of 62 joint bidders or consortia with foreign members winning the tenders. The case is currently in the preliminary suspension phase.

However, differences in interpretation can easily support protectionist aid. With this in mind, I call on the Commission to make greater efforts to ensure a uniform interpretation of the legal framework, which could make the detection of fraudulent irregularities more transparent. But we mustn't stop here. Although some statistics show that we are becoming more successful in detecting fraud, there is still a lot of money going away without knowing where it lands.

For this reason, I call for the establishment of a European anti-corruption strategy, covering fraud by European means. The aim of the strategy is to set a framework for synergies between the different instruments and policies implemented at European and national level and to outline guidelines on how Member States and the European institutions can combat these criminal activities.

It is a global problem. No country in the world can feel completely safe as the Ebola virus disease does not respect national borders, and is a challenge that demands our highest attention.  The Presidency welcomes the High-Level Conference on Ebola from Emergency to Recovery organised by, and under the patronage of, the European Union, in close cooperation with the United Nations and the governments of the three most affected countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The Presidency would like to convey its gratitude to High Representative Federica Mogherini and to the EU Ebola Coordinator, Commissioner Stylianides, and also to Commissioner Mimica and Commissioner Andriukaitis for an outstanding organisation of this event. The large number of high-level speakers and participants representing the affected region, the EU and its Member States, international organisations, UN agencies and NGOs, proved that the international community is greatly concerned by, and actively engaged against, the Ebola virus disease. We are cooperating in a joint effort to combat this dreadful epidemic.  Commissioner Stylianides will, I believe, go into much greater detail in the work and the outcomes of the Conference, but let me, for my part, share some thoughts from the Council’s point of view. This conference confirms that despite the stabilisation of the outbreak, the international community must ‘keep up the momentum’ and continue to provide the international aid, which is essential. We cannot afford to become complacent. We have to maintain our attention on the response to the epidemic and prevent any increase in infections.  Our efforts need to focus on the target of bringing the number of infections to zero because even a single case not identified quickly enough can pose a significant threat. The target of bringing the number of infections to zero, and maintaining that level, is ambitious, yet, by working together, we can achieve it.  The conference took place at a crucial moment as we are moving from the emergency response to the recovery phase. It marked a step forward, for participants to look ahead, discuss the lessons learned and start focusing on recovery and reconstruction of public services, enhancement of preparedness, alert and response systems, health, education, risk communication, social protection and reviving the economies of the affected countries and of other countries with a potential risk of outbreak of the disease.  All the participants shared the opinion that the crisis can only be solved with a common and comprehensive approach addressing critical gaps in essential services, allowing the affected countries and countries which are at potential risk to build long—term resilience and protect themselves from future shocks.  The Ebola virus disease is primarily a regional problem. Therefore, the Presidency welcomes the commitment of the Presidents of the three affected countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – to establish coordinated regional recovery plans together with roadmaps and coordinating structures. This conference has shown once again the commitment of the EU and its Member States in tackling the epidemic and assisting the countries in need. The EU reacted quickly. Several mechanisms were rapidly activated such as the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and the Health Security Committee. Starting from early September, the Council and the European Council provided political guidance for the EU response and worked on the basis of the ambitious objective of mobilising financial aid amounting to EUR 1 billion. We have surpassed that objective, and have provided also in—kind assistance and expertise, thus giving the EU one of the leading roles in the global Ebola response. Last October, the European Council nominated Commissioner Stylianides as the EU Ebola Coordinator.  Today and tomorrow, we must work along the lines identified by the Conference, notably, to ensure that funds already pledged are made available and maintain international support until there are no more Ebola cases. We must also make the response more mobile and flexible; promote regional cooperation; assist countries in West Africa on prevention, containment and preparedness and help them build resilient health systems; and we must also improve governance and accountability of local and national systems.  International engagement needs to be maintained, and I note that further high—level meetings will be held in Washington next month. The Council also welcomes the valuable support of the European Parliament in addressing the Ebola crisis. Discussions in different committees, debate in the plenary and the resolution adopted in September by the European Parliament gave an important signal to the international community on the EU’s dedication to overcome the epidemic.  The Council is looking forward to the report by Charles Goerens that will serve as an important element in further discussions on the lessons learned and on the strengthening of health systems in developing countries to prevent future crises.  Allow me to conclude by expressing our deepest tribute and appreciation to the constant dedication of health workers and international governmental and non-governmental organisations to tackle the Ebola epidemics, their exceptional courage, self-sacrifice and professionalism.  I would like to thank you very much right now for having this debate tonight and I also look forward to a fruitful discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2143, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it is very important that we are having this discussion today, only one week after the High—Level Conference on Ebola, as has already been said by the Presidency. It proves once again the interest of Parliament in our fight against the virus, against its tangible consequences on the ground. Allow me to share with you a brief assessment of the conference we organised last week in Brussels. First, the conference succeeded in bringing together all the key actors in the fight against Ebola. In a joint effort between the European Union and the three affected countries, their presidents played a central role in the proceedings, but also involving the United Nations and the West African region, as well as the African Union.  Why do I insist on this joint effort? Because everything we do in the fight against Ebola needs to be done with, and for, the affected countries, especially their people.  Second, the conference underlined the fact that our immediate priority still has to be to ‘get to zero cases’ in all three countries and sustain this for 42 days. You know very well the medical conditions and that we need to further adjust our response in the field. Of course, by shifting from big treatment centres to community—level response, out in the provinces, we have to work even more with communities. This was timely because, while Liberia may now be close to a sustainable ‘zero’, case numbers have unfortunately again been going up in Sierra Leone and Guinea. Third, the conference reflected the joined—up way in which we as the European Union have approached Ebola – as a collective effort between Federica Mogherini, Neven Mimica, Vytenis Andriukaitis, Carlos Moedas and myself as Ebola Coordinator, with the Commission and the EEAS working together to get things done, as we have been doing ever since the Ebola outbreak started. The conference also heard how an unprecedented research effort is helping in the fight to get to zero, and how the European Union, through fast—tracking very substantial amounts of research funding, is making a big contribution to meeting the research priorities identified by the WHO. The conference also agreed that a coordinated research effort both in the inter—epidemic periods and in emergency situations is a crucial element of preparedness. The Commission is actively working to achieve this. Fourth, the conference agreed a framework for recovery of the three countries. It heard how massively Ebola has hit their economies, which were on a path of strong growth before Ebola.  The co—Chairs’ conclusions from the conference set out the key sectors on which the recovery effort needs to focus: healthcare, certainly, to provide people with basic care, and to make sure the three countries are better prepared to deal with future epidemics; but also water and sanitation, nutrition, and social safety nets, with, of course, a particular focus on the most vulnerable. In the very short term, there is a need to vaccinate people, and provide primary care, clean water, and sanitation. If we do not invest in these things, it will be just a matter of time before another epidemic erupts. So we now have a common roadmap with strong support from the three presidents. The next steps will be a discussion on the fringes of the World Bank spring meetings, in April, and then a UN—led pledging conference at the end of May. Fifth, and very important, the conference provided a big boost for regional cooperation. This became one of my top objectives upon my arrival from the Ebola—affected countries last November. Over the last few months, the three countries have taken concrete steps in that direction. The presence of the three leaders in Brussels last week and their mutual commitment are very encouraging, and all actors agree that this is crucial for preventing and containing future epidemics.

It was a unique opportunity to consider the current situation but also to reflect on the lessons we have learned. While we are currently witnessing some positive trends in the fight against the epidemic, we must continue our maximum efforts, not only to completely defeat this disease, but also to help the long-term development of the affected countries. Because with the exception of the current effects of this crisis such as the losses of numerous human lives, Ebola has left profound socioeconomic consequences in the hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  In addition to direct humanitarian aid, it is therefore extremely important for the management to continue to use development assistance to help the transition and establish coordination between recovery, rehabilitation and development. We need to use development assistance to invest in the long-term development of sustainable health and education systems.  However, we must not lose sight of the broad picture. We need to increase investment and efforts to build the governance and institutional structures of the affected countries. At last week's conference, representatives of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone stressed that they intend to build a regional recovery plan. The EU should certainly encourage regional cooperation, it is good to encourage the recipient countries of development assistance to participate in the creation and implementation of their own development programmes.  Ultimately, we must insist on promoting good rule, building institutional capacity and the rule of law to promote sustainable development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2145, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Linda McAvan", "mepid": "2327", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, firstly I would like to congratulate the Commission. It was a good conference, Commissioner, and you got the whole world together to tackle the problem, so that in itself was very important. The lesson I took away was firstly that the crisis is not over. There are still new cases and we have got to stay on the ground and deal with them. Secondly, we need to plan for the future. How can we do that? I have some meetings with the ministers from the affected countries. What they are looking for in the immediate future are some quick wins – to get the children back to school and budget support for the health systems. They want people to feel that life is getting back to normal. Debt relief was another priority so that they have some resources to invest in their own education and health systems. I think that colleagues are perhaps not aware how small the budgets of these countries are. We were told that USD 550 million was the budget for Liberia. That is like a small town in the United Kingdom, the entire annual budget.  But the key lesson for me as well is that we have to invest in health for the long term. You both said this – the Commission and the Council. Last week, Save the Children published a report. That report showed that the cost of the emergency response is greater than the estimated cost of building health services in the three countries concerned. So that should be our lesson. We have got to have a health service that is free at the point of use and accessible. It is a scandal that we ask the poorest in the world to pay for their health services. We should get rid of user fees now. In September we go to New York, we have the sustainable development goals conference, and we have to put universal health care at the top of that agenda.

This limitation exists in developing countries – we see it in the case of Ebola and years ago we saw it with AIDS – but also in the European Union. In Spain, for example, 4,000 people sick with hepatitis C have died, due to the price of the drug, under the impassive gaze of an absolutely inhumane government. The current biomedical research model is a business that enriches a few to the detriment of global health. If you have money, you can pay for the medicine and if you don't, you have it very difficult, you can die, even if you're European. In addition, current incentives for patent research fail to raise enough for the development of new drugs needed, such as Ebola. Research into new medicines is often not guided by public health needs, but by the economic benefit of pharmaceutical companies. It seems, ladies and gentlemen, that investigating Ebola was not profitable. Alternatives that help the whole society and not just pharmaceutical companies or those who can afford it need to be rethred.   The European Union should take the lead in exploring new forms of biomedical research that promote affordable access to R&amp;D outcomes, but also the creation of knowledge as public goods.

The second thing is that there is absolutely no confidence in these countries in terms of structures. Now there are deaths from malaria and some women do not want to go to these structures as they have seen deaths coming out. So you have to rebuild trust and you have to plan. In planning, it seems to me that we need to think regionally and make sure that there are really hospitals, because contrary to what was said, before the Ebola virus, there was no health infrastructure; it was not the Ebola virus that caused this. We really need to think about mobile labs because the sooner we have diagnosed diseases, the sooner we can react. We also need to train staff and set up free education.

It is also necessary to reflect on the reconstruction period of the affected countries and to have a long-term strategy.  The European Union has played a crucial role in the fight against Ebola by mobilizing funds to immediately help victims, but also by allocating additional funds to Ebola research. EU funds for cooperation and development will also need to be mobilised in the coming months to sustainably strengthen health systems in developing countries.

It is necessary to break with this submission. Unmask the hypocrisy of a certain international aid, in which more than half of the resources return to donors to pay debt and debt service.

It is not just a question of rebuilding their health care systems, but of allowing these countries to rise again with their own strength. To do this requires a profound strengthening of their governance; we need appropriate policies on training, research and innovation; we need to invest in centres of excellence; we need the confidence of private investors who have fled in the face of the stigma of the epidemic; we need debt cancellation, as has already been said several times, because no aid from us can be said to be effective as long as this axe hangs over the governments of these countries.

The World Health Organization has stated that the economic resources collected can guarantee the first round of vaccines, once they are made available.

Mr President, recently in this Chamber we discussed the explosive problem of the deadly Ebola virus that struck Africa and I would like to congratulate you on your immediate reaction and on your important contribution to the successful organisation of the International Ebola Conference. Of course, the European Union's response to the deadly ebola outbreak has not been effective, with the death toll from the epidemic in West Africa surpassing 9,000 last February, according to World Health Organisation figures.  The main problem that exacerbates the weaknesses in dealing with Ebola in West Africa is the dismantling of health structures due to the demands of international lenders. That is why the debt of those countries hit by Ebola must be written off. At the same time, funds must be invested in research in order to finally find the Ebola vaccine.  Finally, I close by pointing out the hypocritical attitude of the West, which closed its eyes when the disease first appeared years ago, and now that the epidemic is knocking on the door of the West, the European Union and the United States have finally woken up.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2179, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Marielle de Sarnez (ALDE).", "mepid": "4335", "text": "   Mr President, of course we must remain vigilant - as you know - because we are not yet at zero cases.

We need to act in at least two directions. Everyone said that. We must actively support a research policy for vaccination, for medicines, for testing as well. This is extremely important.

I have listened very carefully to your points. I particularly note the following: Firstly, regarding regional cooperation, this is a very critical point – as many of you have already mentioned – not only for tackling the virus transmission across the borders of the three countries, but also for the three countries to elaborate compatible national recovery strategies. The presence of the three leaders in Brussels last week was both substantial and symbolic.  Regarding funding, USD 4.9 billion has been pledged and an unparalleled USD 2.5 billion has already been disbursed. The United Nations has a shortfall of USD 400 million, so more might need to be pledged. The UN pledging conference of the Secretary General Ban Ki—moon is planned for the end of May. Regarding the European Union’s response, it is not a secret that the whole international community underestimated the crisis in the first stage, but I am sure we learned a lesson from it. We provided EUR 1.2 billion in assistance through various directions and co—funded over 100 flights of in—kind assistance, among other things. The European Union has already provided EUR 210 million of development assistance to assist the affected countries with their recovery strategy.  We have contributed EUR 138 million to Ebola research programmes, which Mr Ponga referred to, and to vaccines, treatments and rapid tests in an unparalleled example of public and private cooperation. With regard to researching non—profitable diseases, as I come from the medical profession, that is something I will raise with my colleague Commissioner Carlos Moedas. One word about resilience, which my colleague Mr Stier mentioned, we definitely need to help vulnerable countries build health systems, social systems and education systems – as Linda McAvan already mentioned – in a more resilient way. One such initiative is to create a Centre for Disease Control in Africa. This is something that I fully support. On improving our mobilisation capacity as European institutions, I fully agree and I think that we are learning many lessons from this crisis. Our thinking should focus on our future ability to deploy medical teams immediately after an outbreak. Some initiatives from Member States, notably the White Helmets proposal, are already on the drawing board and will need to be followed up.  As I said earlier, the Conference was not the end point of a process, but rather the beginning. We have important meetings coming up, first in Washington at the World Bank spring meetings, and later on in the form of the UN pledging conference. As the European Union, we will of course continue to contribute to the response and to the recovery of the three affected countries, adjusting our substantial existing effort as needed, on emergency response, on development and on research.

Following our debate, I would like to underline three aspects. Firstly, clearly there is no room for complacency. We need to continue our efforts in the immediate response. Getting down to, and staying at, zero is our objective. The question is how to prevent a similar crisis in the future. I believe that during last week’s conference it was stated by all participants that the world after Ebola cannot remain the same if we do not want to be confronted with another epidemic of an even larger scale. First and foremost, advances realised in developing vaccines and effective treatment against Ebola and other neglected diseases. The participants welcomed the encouraging results of treating Ebola patients with Favipiravir that is undergoing the final stage of testing. Secondly, it is clear for us that, together with affected countries, we need to build resilience for the region. We need a comprehensive cross—border strategy encompassing health, education, public services and economic development. The Council therefore welcomes the Mano River Union Summit held in the capital of the Ivory Coast, Abidjan, on 15 February, and the commitments made by the countries of the region: a reduction of Ebola in 60 days, close cooperation, establishment of a regional centre for infections, preventions and control and the fostering of the economic recovery of affected countries. At the same time, the idea of creating a Marshall Plan for the affected countries or restructuring their foreign debt should be dealt with in appropriate fora, in the margins of the IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions. The EU can use instruments that are at its disposal to strengthen the resilience and capacity of the affected countries while preparing for the World Bank meeting in April and the UN Ebola Donors’ Conference in May 2015. Thirdly, improved governance, accountability and transparency of national, regional and local systems will allow us to provide a more inclusive and effective result for citizens. Lessons learned from this crisis should be incorporated in the recovery and development plans. The Council will continue monitoring the situation. Together with the European Commission, we will continue to work with the countries of the region and international organisations in devising the most appropriate recovery and development strategies.  In order to reinforce the EU and global preparedness and response to health threats in the light of the experience to fight the Ebola epidemic, it is important that the Commission and the EU Member States take stock of lessons learned over the last month.

Before we start the discussion on the individual assessment of the respective countries, I would like to underline that the Council continues to attach great importance to the credibility of the Stabilisation and Association process, which remains crucial for maintaining the momentum of democratic reforms. The values upon which the European Union is founded – freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights – are linked to the economic and social progress the European Union has achieved since its creation. In this respect we recognise that the preparation of economic reform programmes will support the efforts of candidate and aspirant states of the Western Balkans towards meeting the Copenhagen economic criteria. I would also like to underline that the ultimate wish to move forward on crucial reform issues cannot come from the European Union, but from the governments of the Western Balkan countries themselves. Cooperation is the common link that binds the EU and what strengthens our ability to deliver security and prosperity. It provides strength in unity and builds consensus and mutual trust, while taking into account the needs, challenges and assets of each country. This is why the Council underlines the importance of regional economic cooperation, sharing the best practice on economic governance and connectivity and inclusiveness within the region and with the EU. Let me now turn to Montenegro. It is clear that the Council broadly shares many of the views expressed in your draft resolution. I would particularly like to underline some points which we consider very important. In its conclusions in December last year, the Council welcomed the progress Montenegro had made in the past year, including the completion of the extensive screening phase. In line with the new approach, the focus has been on the chapters dedicated to the fundamental rights and rule of law: Chapter 23, Judiciary and Fundamental Rights and Chapter 24, Justice, Freedom and Security, as they are rightly at the heart of the enlargement process. Montenegro has demonstrated strong commitment to the reform process in line with European standards, which is an essential element of the accession negotiation process. We welcome the recent adoption of certain measures, in particular in the area of the fight against corruption. However, much along the same lines as the Parliament, the Council also stressed that a number of shortcomings identified by the Commission need to be addressed in a decisive and effective way. Montenegro needs to further intensify its efforts with regard to legislative reforms and their effective implementation, in particular in relation to chapters 23 and 24. In this light, let me take note of the recent adoption by the government of Montenegro of the revised action plan for both chapters. The interim benchmark for the rule of law chapters should continue to provide clear guidance for future reforms. Particular importance should be given to making up for delays and to further developing a solid track record in the area of the rule of law, including with respect to the fight against corruption, notably at high level. Further efforts are also needed to implement constitutional amendments, strengthen political inclusiveness, and guarantee citizens’ trust in public institutions. Furthermore, Montenegro needs to implement the public administration reform strategy and strengthen administrative capacity, tackle politicisation, increase transparency, and improve the business environment. A well-functioning public administration is not only necessary for democratic governance, but it also directly impacts on a government’s ability to provide public services and to foster competitiveness and growth. In this regard the Council welcomes the approach of the Commission to focus on strengthening economic governance and competitiveness. It should prove to be a valuable support to the efforts towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria. As you have highlighted in your draft resolution, further efforts are also needed to guarantee freedom of expression and of the media, including properly investigating and prosecuting threats and violence against journalists. Montenegro will require strong political commitment in order to deliver further tangible and lasting results. The Council will continue to closely monitor the progress in the chapters on Fundamental Rights and Justice and Security which will determine the overall pace of negotiations. The Council notes that Montenegro has continued to implement its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and to play an active role in the region. The Council commends Montenegro for its strong commitment to regional cooperation and its constructive role in maintaining regional stability. In this regard, the Council welcomes the active participation of Montenegro in numerous regional initiatives in South—Eastern Europe and the good neighbourly and bilateral relations it entertains with other enlargement countries and EU Member States. I would also like to stress that the Council welcomes Montenegro’s full alignment with the Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. Now, let me say a few words about the state of play in the accession negotiations. Four new negotiation chapters were successfully opened during the latest Accession Conference, held on 16 December 2014. Overall, out of a total of 35 chapters, 16 have now been opened for negotiations, of which two chapters have already been provisionally closed. We plan for the next Accession Conferences at Deputy and Ministerial level, in March and June respectively, where we expect to be able to open further chapters, depending on Montenegro’s continuous progress in meeting the requirements for accession. Finally, let me acknowledge and welcome, on behalf of the Presidency and the Council, the Parliament’s work, and in particular the continuous engagement of your rapporteur, Mr Charles Tannock, regarding the negotiation process with Montenegro. I am looking forward to our discussion. Thank you for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2194, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you for your invitation to discuss Parliament’s resolution on Montenegro. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for Montenegro, Charles Tannock, for his draft resolution. It is a text that well reflects the assessment in the Commission’s 2014 Progress Report on that country. Let me start with a general remark: for the Commission, the enlargement process is not in doubt. We will work closely with the countries of the region to prepare them for their accession to the European Union. Montenegro was one of the first countries I visited after the start of my mandate and this was the message I delivered to the country’s political leadership.  Two and a half years after the opening of accession negotiations, Montenegro has made progress and has now opened the 16 negotiating chapters. It is also the first country to apply the new approach to the rule of law. Serious shortcomings identified in the progress report have already been addressed by Montenegro through intense work in the weeks following its publication and by the adoption of important legislation on the prevention of corruption. However, adopting legislation is not the cure-all. We have made it clear to Montenegro that the focus now has to be on implementing this legislation. This was also a message during the recent stock-taking on the rule of law which took place in Podgorica.  It is time to shift the focus from processes and procedures to ensuring results on the ground. Such changes should also be felt by individuals in their daily lives. To give you an example, let me mention the protection of persons with disabilities. Despite amending legislation, and making a budget available, access to public buildings for persons with disabilities is still not ensured in an appropriate manner. Legal identity, a functioning independent judicial system and fundamental rights like property rights are necessary – and not only for meeting the rule of law criteria, they are pre-conditions for attracting investment, improving competitiveness and stimulating growth and jobs.  We are also strengthening our economic dialogue with Montenegro. In January the country submitted its economic reform program. This will be the basis of guidance to be adopted by the Council later in the year. Turning now to Montenegro’s foreign policy, I would like to use this opportunity to commend Montenegro’s alignment with the European Union on restrictive measures in the context of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and events in Eastern Ukraine. Finally, I want to underline that, through the accession negotiations, and through IPA assistance, the Commission is committed to helping Montenegro reach new standards and meet the various criteria that will make the country ready politically, as well as economically, to join the Union.

These chapters include the all—important Chapters 23 and 24, key to the accession, as they deal with the Justice and Home Affairs rule of law areas of fighting organised crime, for instance, and fighting corruption and upholding generally the rule of law, including the issue of the judiciary; as well as, of course, Chapter 31 regarding foreign policy. In this context Montenegro, very much to its credit, has aligned its foreign policy position with other EU Member States in applying sectoral economic sanctions against Russia in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine. Similarly, Montenegro is supporting the coalition against ISIS in Syria and Iraq in proposing a law now to criminalise those of its citizens who join foreign terrorist groups. The Commission’s progress report highlights a number of other areas where Montenegro has also made progress and the joint resolution that I drafted echoes much of this, for instance, the election of Stankovic last year as a state prosecutor is very welcome. Overall, I am pleased as rapporteur that the resolution reflects a very fair picture of the current state of play for Montenegro; praising its progress where illustrated, and offering advice constructively where improvement is still needed. As one example, for instance, incidents of violence against journalists and media premises has continued this year, but has actually decreased in the terms of total numbers of incidents. So I am pleased that Parliament’s resolution this year has noted this fact. Ensuring a free press is not only of value in its own right in terms of human rights and democracy, but it is also vital in exposing public corruption, an area where we need to see more progress in Montenegro. Montenegro’s commitment to the EU Accession process is a strong one and it will be important politically to retain widespread domestic cross—party support in its endeavours.  The EU acquis communautaire sets very tough benchmarks for the membership of all future Member States but in my view, for now, Montenegro definitely remains on the right track.

Montenegro is one of the countries showing progress in a number of areas and has recently opened new negotiating chapters. Work on Chapters 23 and 24 remains key, and reforms in this area will determine the dynamics of future negotiations. Over the past year, a number of decisions have been taken related to the appointment of a Chief Prosecutor, the fight against corruption and the effective work of judges and prosecutors. Montenegro has a vision and an action plan. We now expect concrete measures for the implementation of the legal framework, which will be important for the further integration of the country. Ensuring the rule of law is key to Montenegro's European future. Montenegro is also a good example of the involvement of civil society in preparing for the adoption of European Union law.  At the same time, I expect the authorities to do more to improve the media environment and to detect and stop crimes against journalists. Podgorica should not repeat the mistakes of other countries, where media concentration and business dependencies lead to distortion of information and meaninglessness of democracy. As for the other countries of the Western Balkans, Montenegro is very important to break with the shadows of communism's past and to walk the path of historical reconciliation and good neighbourly relations, which is the only possible option for European integration.

The government should first focus on reforms relating to the rule of law, improving public administration and increasing transparency in the political system. As was the objective of our political group from the outset, we urged the government to avoid reform fatigue and to continue its European course unabaalthough. We have called for further progress in the fight against inequality, social exclusion and high unemployment rates. We have intervened with amendments on the elimination of discrimination against women, the Roma minority and people with disabilities. With regard to the Montenegrin economy, we focused on the need to combat tax evasion, unemployment and poverty. The difficult economic situation in the Western Balkans requires the implementation of ambitious programmes that enhance competitiveness and modernise their production base. We did not overlook the government's attention to the importance of protecting the environment.

I also agree with what was said in the report, namely that Montenegro has made progress in recent years and I am glad that already 16 chapters have been opened. Nevertheless, I would like to state here as well what is in this report because it says that the fight against corruption and organised crime is, and will be, the litmus test for an independent, efficient and professional judiciary in the country. I hope we will see more progress here in the future. There are also positive things in the report and positive progress in the country with regard to an end to discrimination, where the Roma and LGBTI people are concerned. And yet hatred, hate speech and fear—mongering still exist. I would nevertheless like to say that I appreciate that the government of Montenegro has made very clear statements and also taken action in the fight against hatred against LGBTI people, and will be hosting a high-level ministerial meeting in Budva at the beginning of May on the fight against homophobia with European Union and enlargement countries. There is one thing I would have especially liked to see more of in the report, and that is ecology and the environment. Of course, Montenegro’s Constitution states that it is an ecological state, and we appreciate that. But nevertheless, more than 25% of Europe’s biodiversity is in the Western Balkans, and the last remaining free—flowing rivers in Europe.

Madam President, we welcome the negotiations between Montenegro and the European Union in order to implement Montenegro's accession to the Union. Greece supports Montenegro's European perspective and as early as 2011 signed a cooperation agreement to provide know-how on European Union issues.  Of course, within Montenegro there are political tensions with the opposition abstaining from specific parliamentary work. At the same time there is a negative climate in the economy, since we have increased unemployment, while there are very serious phenomena and problems of corruption, but also action of organised crime.

Montenegro's foreign policy is fully in line with the European Union's foreign and defence policy.  Of course, the progress made carries additional responsibilities. Montenegro must continue with the reform process. The government and the opposition need to improve dialogue with each other in the name of nationwide themes such as the rule of law, the fight against corruption and media freedom.

But there are still a few chapters to draw attention to. And one of these chapters is also – which is not explicitly written, but is visible – is attitudes towards the environment. Namely, attitude towards the environment, towards renewable energy sources, and I think that this will be one of the key things for the future of Montenegro, especially as we know that it is not a brilliant economic situation at the moment and that there are many unemployed, especially among young people.

As far as the completion of a united, shall we say, united Europe is concerned, but on other assumptions which should be respect for the rule of law and also for the welfare state ( this also applies to all Member States).

Your resolution captures the basic elements of our policy towards that country and the acknowledgment of the achievements that have been possible, but it also sends a clear message on what needs to be done now. This year, Montenegro should continue working on rule of law issues and focus on delivering results. Results should include direct recourse in the fight against corruption and organised crime, as several speakers have said. At the same time, we expect Montenegro to continue working on meeting the opening benchmarks set in challenging areas such as competition, the environment, climate change and food safety. The opening benchmarks provide clear guidance on what needs to be done. For the chapters that have already been opened, we will work with Montenegro in helping the country meet the closing benchmarks. We have a challenging programme ahead of us and the support of this House will be instrumental in completing it. Next month our Joint Parliamentary Committee will meet again in Podgorica. This will be a good opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved in Montenegro since the last meeting in December and to present the challenges ahead. Let us be clear, it is up to each candidate country to ensure that there is progress in the reforms necessary for its accession to the Union. It is up to each candidate country to ensure that these reforms bring results that help improve the lives of its citizens. The Commission can offer, and does offer, its technical know—how, its expertise and, of course, financial assistance in meeting the challenges of the accession process. Strong political will and determination will be needed from Montenegro to make progress. This will be required not only of the government but of the whole political system. Montenegro’s cross-party consensus on EU accession is a major asset in this endeavour. I was reassured about this during my last visit to that country, when I had the opportunity to meet the European Affairs Committee of the Montenegro Parliament. This was further evidence that Montenegro and the whole of Montenegrin society is trying to meet all the challenges in order to make significant progress when it comes to the future accession of the country. Once again, and to stress it again and again, the announcement of President Juncker that there will be no enlargement during this period does not mean we are not following up on all the necessary negotiations. It is more about the process than about negotiations, and what we have discussed and what you have discussed today on Montenegro, and what we will discuss imminently with other countries, is proof that it is about the process and less about the negotiations.

We seem to agree on the point that the work with potential accession countries should continue towards democratic reforms and closer European integration. I am pleased that the speakers, like the Council, praised the efforts by Montenegro to align with the common foreign and security policy. The Council also attaches particular importance to the area of the rule of law and fundamental rights and has urged Montenegro to tackle the issues of concern identified by the Commission, especially the independence of the judiciary, the fight against corruption and organised crime. The Council thoroughly assessed the action plans which Montenegro prepared in order to meet the opening benchmarks for the chapters on the judiciary and fundamental rights and on justice, freedom and security. They were of good quality and allowed us to get to the next stage and open the negotiations in these two key chapters. The action plans were revised in February 2015 and re—worked to calibrate and adjust them, with implications for the interim benchmarks set for these chapters. We also agreed that freedom of speech and media independence is one of the fundamental values of the European agenda. It is essential that all attacks on media representatives be properly investigated in order to ensure freedom of expression and citizens’ trust in public institutions. As a Presidency, we are continuing the work on accession negotiations with Montenegro and are looking forward to opening new chapters during our Presidency. So far, the accession negotiations process with Montenegro has been quite dynamic. Nevertheless, in order to ensure the further opening of new chapters, Montenegro needs to deliver tangible results in the rule of law area.

Like the Parliament in its draft resolution, the Council, in December 2014, welcomed the fact that the EU agenda remained the strategic priority of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. But we note that it will require strong political will and commitment on the part of politicians from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to continue the implementation of the EU—related reforms. The Council broadly shares the view that the country has achieved a high level of alignment with the legislative acquis. However, I would point out that the Council Conclusions of December 2014 emphasised serious concerns about an increasing politicisation of state institutions and growing shortcomings in relation to the independence of the judiciary and to media freedoms. Failure to deliver on these issues has damaged the sustainability of reforms. We will continue to emphasise that the rule of law, fundamental rights and media freedom are at the heart of the enlargement process and that it is essential that candidate countries take decisive, rapid action to address the challenges. As shown by the latest developments, political crises between government and opposition parties are recurrent. The Council shares the view expressed in Parliament’s draft resolution that a more constructive and inclusive political dialogue is needed. I would urge both the government and the opposition in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to demonstrate political responsibility and engage in a constructive dialogue in order to resolve all the issues that remain open and to accelerate the reform process in line with European standards. Concerning the inter—ethnic situation, greater trust between the communities needs to be built. The Ohrid Framework Agreement continues to be an essential element for democracy and rule of law in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We would remind you that the review of the Ohrid Framework Agreement needs to be completed rapidly and its recommendations need to be implemented. The Council reiterates that maintaining good neighbourly relations remains an essential part of European integration. This includes a negotiated and mutually accepted solution to the name issue, under the auspices of the United Nations. We call for progress towards bringing the longstanding discussions on this issue to a definitive conclusion without delay. In the light of the overall importance of maintaining good neighbourly relations, it is essential to continue high—level contacts between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and to translate them into concrete action and results. Finally, let me add that the Council broadly shares the Commission’s assessment that the political criteria continue to be sufficiently met, on the basis of the cumulative progress achieved. The Council also took note of the Commission’s recommendation, reflected in Parliament’s draft resolution, that accession negotiations should be opened. With a view to a possible decision by the European Council to open such negotiations, the Council will return to the issue at some time this year, on the basis of an update by the Commission on the implementation of reforms. This will take into account the High—Level Accession Dialogue and the tangible steps taken to promote good neighbourly relations and to reach a negotiated and mutually accepted solution to the name issue. Progress in all these areas will be conducive to reaching a positive decision among the EU Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2231, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to acknowledge the report which has been prepared by your rapporteur Ivo Vajgl, which to a large extent corresponds to the findings of our 2014 progress report on the country. I welcome the supportive stance the European Parliament has taken towards the country’s efforts in the accession process. In our progress report we repeated our recommendation to open accession negotiations but raised our serious concerns about selective justice, problems with the freedom of expression, politicisation and the lack of constructive political dialogue in the country. The current political crisis has further exacerbated all these issues. I will come to this in a second. As the draft resolution points out, the level of alignment with the EU acquis remains high, but decisive action is required from Skopje to address backsliding in several key areas. I share your concerns that delays in setting a date for the start of accession negotiations have added to the frustration of the population in the country and also affected the sustainability of previous reforms as well as the leverage of the Union as such. As regards the current political events in the country, I visited Skopje in February and expressed my very serious concerns to all political leaders. All of them must step back from the brink. They are all playing with the future of their country. In my frequent and on—going contacts with the political leadership and the opposition, I continue to urge political actors to engage in constructive dialogue within the parliament, focusing on the strategic priorities of the country and all its citizens. They have no time to lose. I also reiterated that investigations are to be conducted by the proper authorities, notably the judiciary, in a manner that is totally independent, transparent and rapid with full regard for due process and the presumption of innocence. In this respect, I welcome any initiative taken by European political party groups and individual MEPs to help overcome the crisis and welcome their willingness to engage further. The Commission will work closely with the MEPs in this respect. I would like to reiterate that the Commission stands ready to provide support, while fully insisting on the separation of powers. The Commission could support efforts to improve checks and balances and address failures, for instance through the assessment on continued concerns about the independence of justice.  Meanwhile, irrespective of the origins of the wiretapping, which needs to be investigated, any potential wrongdoing revealed, along with its disturbing content, must be investigated and appropriate consequences must be taken, especially if it fundamentally impinges on the rule of law and separation of powers.  At a time when public trust in institutions is low, all public figures must act responsibly and take accountability for their actions in their own interest. Turning to the issue of good neighbourly relations, I agree with you that it is an essential part of the country’s progress towards the European Union. While the country has good relations with its Western Balkan neighbours, relations with Greece and Bulgaria remain affected. It is of the utmost importance that there are continued efforts to improve the overall climate for cooperation and trust. Good neighbourly relations remain an essential part of the enlargement process and the EU’s own history shows that working out compromises on contested issues is the best way to enhance regional cooperation and move forward. I would also like to use this opportunity to highlight the importance of maintaining good inter—ethnic relations. They remain fundamental for the very functioning of the country and its EU perspective. To build on the positive lessons learned so far, the review of the Ohrid Framework Agreement is important and should be soon converted into policy recommendations. Finally, let me stress that renewed efforts from all sides are needed to improve relations and trust between parties, and these need to be friendly. Therefore, I urge all parties to respect the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary and freedom of the press.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2232, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Ivo Vajgl", "mepid": "97019", "text": "  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Rapporteur, – You have made it easier for me to appear in these two minutes as rapporteur, with very substantive and very, very gratifying views, ersy views on Macedonia's progress on the way to the European Union.

I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the colleagues who have proposed amendments and contributed to a politically balanced resolution. On the principle that each candidate country will be judged on its achievements and qualities, the resolution supports the following: the opening of negotiations for membership of the European Union, the lifting of the blockade in the Council and the resolution of bilateral issues, such as the problem of the name of the country, separate from the negotiations, but in time before the conclusion of the accession negotiations. The long-standing stalemate in the union is one of the reasons for the current severe crisis of trust between the political forces in Macedonia. This crisis also leads to obstruction of the national parliament and serious accusations of abuses, violations of laws and the constitution, human rights and freedom of the media.

Madam President, I understand the efforts of the Presidency, the Commissioner and the rapporteur of the report to help the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the road to democracy. However, I have to say that the rapporteur should be more careful. Do not use the name \"Macedonia\" first of all. And he should bear in mind, having seen all the documents, that his position on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is also related to the United Nations resolution of 817 of 1993, which defines the name of Skopje and FYROM as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  And it is not a bilateral issue, it is an international issue and the name issue is dealt with as an international issue. Now, I have the following comments to make. The European Commission, as the Presidency has said, is finding a setback in the areas of freedom of expression, the media and the independence of the judiciary. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe also notes the politicisation of state institutions, government control of the media even in the context of elections. There's the 25,000 eavesdropping scandal. There is the Ohrid agreement, and the Presidency has also mentioned, which does not respect minority issues.

We thank the new rapporteur, Mr Vajgl, for his continuity on this and other points. However, I am forced to use my speech now as shadow rapporteur to express my, and my group’s, deep concern about the impact that the current political crisis in the country is having on the prospects for realising the aim of opening talks. My group recognises that we ourselves have a responsibility to avoid adding to the polarising forces in the country, which is why I worked with my PPE Group colleagues to secure the 1 March 2013 agreement, and why I have expressed my willingness, if asked, to do so again now. In saying that, I am conscious that success would require genuine political will on both sides and that the long—term interests require functioning political institutions within the country, rather than reliance on external assistance. But let me make some things very clear: the announcement of charges and the threat of imprisonment against the leader of the opposition in the country – the leader of the sister party of the group of parties which I represent in this Chamber – is a dangerous moment for democracy in this country. For the charges to be announced by the Prime Minister personally only adds to the concerns generated following the evidence of tapes released in relation to apparent gross political interference in the country’s judiciary and media. Tonight, the opposition party is publishing further evidence – this time alleging electoral malpractice on behalf of the governing party – while the governing party has a simultaneous press conference alleging bribery on behalf of the leader of the opposition. We, in this Chamber, do not want to be drawn into a spiral of allegations and counter—allegations, nor into the conflicting explanations about the provenance of the tapes; but there is no doubt that mass surveillance has taken place and that at least some of the evidence produced is genuine. We cannot ignore that evidence and nor can the Commissioner. There is a sad history in this country, in this region and in other parts of Europe, of systems of surveillance and of charges being brought against individuals for political purposes. These practices have no place today, in this country or in Europe. If further promises of remedial judicial reform are made now – when the same promises have been made before and not fulfilled – there would have to be new elements of monitoring and review to create confidence within the country and credibility outside it.

The nomenclature, an international issue which remains, as it should, under the auspices of the UN and concerns regional security and stability in the context of good neighbourly relations, arbitrarily calls it bilateral.

I appreciate both his work and the text that has come out of it. My group is going to support the resolution, first of all because we seriously believe that there is no real alternative in the Western Balkans to EU accession. There is no conceivable political alternative, and there is no conceivable economic or social alternative, if the region is to be what Europe is good at – at peace with itself and with its neighbours. There is, as the Commissioner rightly pointed out, a grave political crisis in Macedonia, which is real and dangerous. However, this real and dangerous crisis is just yet another illustration of the fact that a long—drawn—out negotiation process, with a large number of issues that actually polarise politics and societies in the region, is something we need to deal with directly. Macedonia needs our help to overcome this political crisis, and I wish that everybody in this Chamber were willing to contribute to the resolution of the crisis instead of making it worse. Macedonia may have been much more of a success story a few years back, but the problems identified in the progress report are actually common to all the Western Balkan countries under the accession process. The rule of law, freedom of the media, administrative reforms: all these are problems in all the other accession countries in precisely the same way that they are in Macedonia.

Then, with mediation assistance by the European institutions, which involved many Members of the European Parliament, the crisis was overcome, but not for good and not in a sustainable way, because it has now been reproduced in an even worse manner.

The problem is not bilateral. It's international. I grew up, studied, worked in Macedonia and I know exactly what's going on there.

We are talking about the integration of the countries of Europe into the European Union, including the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that I was standing next to Federica Mogherini in the press conference, in which she twice did not use the correct term, but did not do so intentionally. It must be admitted that in a very tense situation, such as a press conference, a person sometimes uses an expression that is not 100% correct. Please do not make this a special story. It is legitimate for someone to be 100% correct. Secondly, I have the utmost respect for any parliamentary debate, and the name problem is a problem that needs to be resolved, because we should not doubt the perspective of the country. However, I would also like to say quite frankly that, on the one hand, Greece has other very serious problems, and that, on the other hand, FYROM is now facing a major internal political crisis that needs to be resolved and which, in my view, is actually the far more dramatic one. I believe that we should also have this discussion here in this House. Once again, I would like to thank Mr Howitt, Mr Vajgl and Mr Kukan in particular, who have agreed to intervene in FYROM in this very serious internal political crisis and to help overcome it so that the country can continue to have a European perspective on which I hope we will all work together. After all, that is the strength of Europe, that we have repeatedly managed to overcome our internal difficulties and achieve a common result. I hope that we will be able to do so in a joint effort with our friends on the ground on this issue as well.

However, our debate today clearly demonstrated that we all share concerns about the increasing politicisation of state institutions and the growing shortcomings of the independence of the judiciary and of freedom of the media, which is damaging the sustainability of reforms. In this regard, we also count on the European Parliament support to call on all leaders of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to take decisive action to rapidly address the concerns. Mr Howitt called on the Presidency to be more proactive in setting a date for the start of accession negotiations. I can say that the Council is fully aware of recommendations by the Commission and we adopted conclusions in that context in December 2014. Yet with respect to the current political situation, the EU has expressed serious concerns. These are very serious charges that need independent and proper investigation and the High Representative of the Union and the Council has been clear on this.

The Council in its conclusions of December 2014 welcomed the launch of accession negotiations with Serbia on 21 January 2014, and the ongoing screening process. With the beginning of accession negotiations, Serbia has moved to a new stage on its path to the European Union. In this regard, the Council welcomed the high level of engagement and preparedness demonstrated so far by the Serbian Government. Strong commitment is a particularly important ingredient of any state’s negotiation process in moving towards EU accession, as it is linked to an often challenging reform process. Serbia’s ambitious programme of economic and structural reforms is an evident manifestation of its efforts in this regard. In line with the new approach, opening benchmarks have been set under the rule of law chapters, requiring comprehensive action plans. The Council positively noted that these chapters were being addressed early in the negotiations. The rule of law is a fundamental EU value. These chapters are rightly at the heart of the accession process as they have a cross—cutting effect on all the policy sectors covered by the accession negotiations. Therefore, progress under these chapters needs to be made in parallel with progress in the negotiations overall. We also welcomed the progress made in the past year, including in public administration reform, judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime. Serbia actively participated in regional law-enforcement cooperation. This led to effective results in the fight against organised crime. The Council encourages Serbia to further intensify its reform process. Continued strong efforts are needed to ensure an effective, independent judiciary and to build a track record in the fight against corruption and organised crime. The promotion, implementation and full observance of fundamental rights must be ensured, including the protection of the most vulnerable groups, particularly the Roma. The legislation on the protection of minorities should be implemented effectively, and the treatment of minorities should be non-discriminatory. Particular attention also needs to be paid to tackling discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. There are concerns about deteriorating conditions for the full exercise of freedom of expression. We will continue to emphasise the importance of promoting and protecting an environment that supports free speech and media freedom. The business environment and the investment climate should be further improved. Attention should also be paid to implementing public administration reform and to implementing the economic and structural reforms required to restore fiscal sustainability, and ultimately to support growth and employment. In this regard, the Council welcomes the Commission’s approach of focusing on strengthening economic governance and competitiveness. This should prove valuable in supporting the efforts towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria. An essential part of Serbia’s EU integration process is regional cooperation and good neighbourly cooperation. In this regard, the Council welcomes Serbia’s continued active and constructive engagement in further developing regional cooperation by participating in regional initiatives such as the South—East Europe Cooperation Process and the Regional Cooperation Council, as well as by strengthening bilateral relations with other countries of Western Balkans region. Serbia also needs to maintain active and constructive engagement in the normalisation process with Kosovo, which has seen significant progress. In this regard, let me welcome the resumption on 9 February 2015 of the High—Level Dialogue, as well as the finalisation of the agreement on justice and the judiciary in Kosovo. Advancement on the normalisation of relations with Pristina and full implementation of the Brussels Agreement, by means of the High-Level Dialogue, are directly linked to forward movement in Serbia’s EU accession talks. The Council will continue to monitor closely Serbia’s continued engagement in the process, including the implementation in good faith of all agreements reached so far, so that Serbia and Kosovo can continue on their respective European paths, while avoiding a situation in which either could block the other’s efforts. Progress in this process needs to be made in parallel with progress in the negotiations overall. The Council has also called on Serbia to align progressively with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy. It is especially important at times like these for countries wishing to join the EU to show commitment to the common European values. Last but not least, Serbia should also continue to cooperate effectively with the European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) and contribute actively to the full and unhindered execution by EULEX of its mandate. The Council looks forward to the next meeting of the Accession Conference and to the opening of the first negotiating chapters with Serbia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2285, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate David McAllister for his resolution on the 2014 progress report on Serbia. This is a very balanced and comprehensive assessment of Serbia’s progress on its EU path, which is overall in line with the findings of our 2014 progress report.  I share the view that Serbia’s efforts and progress need to receive a positive narrative from the European Union and I look forward to the opening of the first chapters. Negotiations with Serbia are underway. The country has committed to difficult reforms and has come a long way on the normalisation of its relations with Kosovo. This is also key for stability in the region. The screening process is on schedule and should be finalised by the end of the month. Serbia’s negotiation team has shown impressive commitment and professionalism throughout. Discussions in the Council on screening reports are expected to continue throughout the year. Now Serbia needs to deliver on key areas, including the rule of law and the normalisation of its relations with Kosovo which need to be tackled early in the negotiation process in line with the negotiating framework. The resumption of the high level dialogue one month ago after a break of almost a year is crucial. The agreement on justice and judiciary in Kosovo has been finalised. This is a welcome development. Working groups are now meeting to take forward the work on implementation on which both sides are expected to continue delivering results. Once sufficient progress is assessed, we could move forward on Chapter 35. I hope this can happen in the near future. Serious work is also on—going on the rule of law issues. I look forward to the adoption of credible, comprehensive and sustainable action plans. I am also hopeful that this could contribute to the opening of Chapters 23 and 24 before the end of the year. The Serbian Government should also ensure that progress is not put at risk in such a way as being perceived as interfering in the work of the Ombudsman’s office or stepping back on freedom of expression. Media freedom is a non—negotiable fundamental right and a key condition for progress on the EU path. This is the message I constantly convey to my Serbian interlocutors and in particular to Prime Minister Vučić with whom I am in regular contact. At the same time, we should be careful not to add requirements not provided for under the EU acquis or the negotiating framework. In this respect it is important that bilateral disputes do not hamper the overall accession process. The Commission remains firmly committed to support and guide Serbia on its European path and I appreciate that the European Parliament is on the same page.

This resolution sends out two main messages, firstly Serbia is on its path towards the European Union. Looking back, 2014 was an important year for Serbia; the formal beginning of the accession talks took place on the 21 January 2015. I am convinced Prime Minister Vučić and his government show commitment to the European integration process. They tackle head on the systemic and socio—economic reforms; this deserves our respect and support. In recent months, the Serbian Parliament has adopted important laws on whistle—blowers, media, labour, privatisation and bankruptcy; this is a positive development. Nevertheless, a thorough implementation of legislation and policies remains essential for a successful integration process. Secondly, ‘fundamentals first’ is key in the negotiation process. I consider as fundamentals: the rule of law, economic governance, the reform of public administration, aligning to our EU foreign policy and the normalisation of relations with Kosovo.  How long the accession negotiations will take primarily depends on Serbia’s ability to make sustained progress on the EU agenda of reforms. I am convinced this progress can be made.

Thank you also to the reporter David. That's the way it is today. I congratulate Serbia on the progress made, I welcome the important steps that have already been taken, and I remain optimistic that the country will continue to make progress. At the same time, I express my concern about the tendencies and pressures that have been felt recently on issues that are actually about Serbia's bilateral relations with neighbouring countries. I believe that the call for Serbia to reconsider the war crimes law is by no means part of this report. Universal jurisdiction in the field of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide is in line with international case law. Several European Union countries have a similar regime. And that is the Commission's view. What is more, the existing legislation allows for greater efficiency and trial even for those who, due to the lack of such legislation, could avoid punishment for crimes committed.  The European Parliament must not be used as a field to tackle or promote internal policy topics. Serbia bears a great responsibility on its shoulders. First, in the Western Balkans region, it has taken on the role of a kind of initiator for establishing better relations and accelerating regional cooperation. And secondly, there is an important period ahead of Serbia in which it will have to gradually resolve relations with Kosovo and fully implement the agreement on the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Prishino. In this light, I welcome the recent resumption of dialogue, including the adoption of a judicial agreement, which is essential for progress. I believe that the most important thing at the moment is to create conditions that will enable all the people of Kosovo to live as much as possible. I join the calls for serbia's negotiations with the Union to be opened as soon as possible and for Chapters 23 and 24 to be opened. I will be in a hurry to visit Belgrade next week, and my message will be clear: I am convinced that negotiations must start as soon as possible. In doing so, we in the European Parliament will continue to pay attention to developments in Serbia, especially when it comes to the normalisation of relations with Kosovo, the rule of law and the free media.

I must say that Serbia has taken a big step forward over the years. She's taken some reforms seriously. Because there is a sense of effort to achieve as much as possible a degree of independence in the judicial field, because of course this also strengthens confidence in the rule of law. The issue of corruption, which is, of course, not insignificant in Serbia, has also been on the agenda. It is, of course, a process that will take some time. Above all, it is important to be aware that corruption is slowly leading to the country's propath of power, and therefore it must be seriously tackled. I am sure, of course, that Serbia will continue to push for even greater transparency through its reforms. In doing so, I would particularly like to highlight the role of the National Audit Committee or control the use of public finances, as this is also one of the outstanding indicators and mirrors of the functioning of each government. And I think that in this way it can also direct the consumption of public finances, which is also important from the point of view of European funds flowing into Serbia. And through the Report of the European Court of Auditors, we can be sure that, in most cases, these funds are used, of course, correctly and in a proper way. That problem, which, of course, remains, is, of course, a high level of unemployment, youth, the economy, the media. I, too, am getting quite a few emails, drawing attention to the issue of media independence, and here, of course, I would like to point out that the authorities still have to take many steps forward.

At this moment, Eastern Partnership countries like Ukraine are showing more political will and eagerness to be closer to the EU than those countries which consider themselves to be on the EU’s doorstep.

Now, on the issue of relations with Russia, I do not think that for Turkey we cannot see that it does not follow the Common European Policy and has excellent relations with Russia, which is not due to orthodoxy, because one country is Muslim, the other Orthodox, while for Serbia this is a negative element.

Particular attention should be paid to improving the rule of law, including judicial independence, and to intensifying the fight against organised crime and corruption. We welcome Kosovo’s progress so far, but we would also point out that Kosovo needs to address shortcomings raised in the visa dialogue, including mitigating the security and migration-related risks of potential visa liberalisation. In this regard, the need for structural economic reforms, addressing the high level of unemployment, is becoming increasingly urgent. Important reforms, such as electoral reform and public administration reform, remain a priority. The protection of minorities must be addressed. The increased focus by the Commission on the national economic reform programmes also applies to Kosovo. We are hopeful that this approach will serve as an aid to Kosovo in implementing its economic reform package. The normalisation process with Serbia has seen significant progress. Kosovo must maintain an active and constructive engagement in this process. The dialogue remains essential in terms of advancing a European future for both Serbia and Kosovo. Therefore, the normalisation of relations should be one of the key tasks for Kosovo. In this respect, let me welcome the resumption on 9 February 2015 of the High-Level Dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina and the finalisation of the agreement on justice and the judiciary in Kosovo. This is a step towards full implementation of the Brussels Agreement, which we expect to be achieved as soon as possible. We also welcome the agreement between Prime Minister Mustafa and Prime Minister Vučić to work together to tackle regional concerns, among them the acute problem of illegal migration from Kosovo, which is also reflected in your resolution. The Council will continue to monitor closely Kosovo’s continued engagement towards visible and sustainable progress in the normalisation of relations with Serbia. This means implementation in good faith of all agreements reached so far, so that Kosovo and Serbia can continue on their respective European paths. This is an essential principle of the proposed Stabilisation and Association Agreement that will underpin the development of relations and cooperation between the EU and Kosovo. Lastly, Kosovo should continue to cooperate closely and effectively with the European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) and contribute actively to the full and unhindered execution by EULEX of its renewed mandate. Kosovo should also, as a matter of priority, implement the political commitment to establish the special court to hear cases arising out of the investigation led by the Special Investigative Task Force, by adopting all the necessary legal changes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2323, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I welcome the motion for a resolution on the European integration process of Kosovo. The Commission and the European Parliament continue to share the same vision of Kosovo’s European future. We are grateful for the support of this House and look forward to continuing our close cooperation. We stand ready to help and support Parliament, and the rapporteur Ms Lunacek, over the next few months and years in advancing Kosovo’s European perspective.  In line with the motion for a resolution, during my recent visit to Pristina I emphasised the need for economic reforms to enhance Kosovo’s competitiveness leading to growth, job creation, investment in education and better living conditions for Kosovo’s citizens. This will help in addressing the root causes of irregular migration. Our progress report of October 2014 identified the key areas that need to be tackled by Kosovo. Emphasis remains on the rule of law, reform of public administration and strengthening socio-economic development. All three aspects are essential and progress in these fields will yield political and economic benefits for Kosovo. Last July we completed the negotiations of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) and initialled the text with Kosovo. As you know, the Kosovo SAA is EU only, not mixed. However, I should like to emphasise that it is both comprehensive and robust and that it covers all key areas covered by the other SAAs in the region. Once in force, I am sure there will be very few practical differences between it and other SAAs. Following the initialling of the SAA, the agreement and the draft Council decisions are now being translated. This should be completed later this month. I will propose to the college approval of the package early in April, after which we will submit it to the Council for approval. We aim for the Council to agree on the SAA signature later in the spring and as soon as High Representative/Vice President Mogherini and Kosovo have signed, the SAA will be transmitted to this House for consent. Parliament therefore has an important role to play in the approval process. If the SAA is to come into force in early 2016, which is what we continue to aim for, it will be essential that the dossier is processed efficiently. Of course we stand ready to provide support throughout the process. Once Parliament has given its consent, the Council will be able to proceed with the conclusions of the SAA. Given its EU only nature, ratification by Member States of the interim agreement are not required. Therefore, once concluded, the SAA will enter into force immediately. The coming into force of the Kosovo SAA will be a milestone in the development of EU-Kosovo relations. For the first time, there will be a contractual relationship between the European Union and Kosovo. This relationship provides for rights and benefits, but it also creates duties and obligations. I am sure both sides will need time to get used to this, but I am equally sure that implementation of the SAA will be to the benefit of both and I look forward to Parliament’s continued support for this promising process.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2324, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Ulrike Lunacek", "mepid": "97017", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for very good cooperation in reaching a largely consensual text which I hope will have a good majority tomorrow. Let me start by describing the references to Kosovo over the last weeks and months in many of our Member States. It recently hit the headlines with thousands of asylum-seekers coming across Serbia into Hungary and then Austria, Germany and other countries. This is something that again raised the context of the situation in Kosovo. I am really happy to see that this has gone down over the last weeks because many people in Kosovo have realised that they have been given the illusion of promises through rumours, and that these are illusions. We demand in this report that both Serbia and the Kosovo authorities really clamp down on traffickers who feed into these illusions so that in the future we will not have these many asylum seekers in Member States. Let me also make one thing clear. In this report, as in many others before, I demand fast visa liberalisation for Kosovo. I am sure that if we already had visa liberalisation then people would not feel so locked—in in their country and would be able to go for three months to the European Union and return and would not have the feeling that they need to leave because this was not provided for them. I am glad that Commissioner Avramopoulous has just recently said that Kosovo is walking the last mile and he will soon have good news for Kosovo; so I hope this will come through very soon. Of course, the economic and social situation has to improve, especially for young people, and the fight against corruption and organised crime has to be stepped up by the new government, including in high—ranking parts of their own parties and organisations; otherwise the trust of citizens will not improve. I also welcome the fact that a government was formed after some six months of stalemate, but only two women in a government of 21 really is not acceptable. I also hope that the Kosovo Assembly will soon pass the law on the special court. Let me say one thing: this is not about KLA in general; it is about certain individuals of KLA who might have committed crimes. I am glad the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo has resumed; there are still things that have to be implemented. For example, Kosovo MPs are still not allowed to participate in all regional meetings, for example in the SECP process of the Parliamentary Assembly, so progress still needs to go ahead there and I think Serbia also has to move on. One thing I also criticise is that five Member States still do not recognise Kosovo. This blocks progress, and I am glad to hear from Commissioner Hahn that the SAA will be put to the Council later in the spring; I hope there will be an agreement and that soon Kosovo will be on its way. I do not have any more time so please read the text. It is also about EULEX and about investigations on corruption allegations inside EULEX. These are harming the credibility of the European Union; we need swift investigations.

The resolution before us seems to me to be balanced and points the way forward in the near future. Kosovo, it has been said, is in the midst of transition and transformation, and there is no doubt that we have welcomed the conclusion of political uncertainty after the elections, with the constitution of the assembly and the new government. There is now another piece of road to be taken: we must continue along the path of reform with commitment and determination, strengthening the role of laws and justice in a visible and concrete way and extending civil rights. It is essential that we finally engage in the fight against corruption and organised crime, and we need to put in place a policy that defeats unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, by implementing economic and structural reforms and sustainable development.  We must, in essence, test the new government and measure its ability to work towards these goals. There will certainly be support from the European Union and a stimulus in this direction, so that these objectives can actually be achieved. However, some concerns remain, concerning the independence, reliability and impartiality of judges and prosecutors. A justice that works is the essential element of a country that wants to be democratic.  Finally, with regard to the Eulex mission, the resolution expresses concern about the recent allegations of corruption and there is no doubt that we need transparency: the credibility of the European Union is also at stake.

However, this did not prevent a serious part of the international community from recognising Kosovo's independence. I would like to make it clear that this was a serious geopolitical error. Independence was recognised not by a state meeting the requirements of the fundamental rule of law, but rather by criminal organisations operating there, whose conglomerate did not deserve to be called a state. Today, this system is ruled by dozens of mafia clans drawing on the gigantic income from the trafficking of heroin, living goods and human organs.  I would also like to remind you that the Union is conducting formal accession negotiations with Serbia. An equal commitment to Kosovo undermines the coherence of our external policy and may damage EU-Serbia relations, which is in Russia's immediate interest. Putin is keeping a close eye on the Balkans and will try to discourage Serbia from rapprochement with the European Union. If we lose Serbia, we will also lose the entire Balkans, putting them in russia's zone of economic and political influence. I therefore recommend that we be particularly careful and balance our European interests in the region.  The Commissioner pointed to another derogation that we are about to make towards Kosovo. One derogation was already premature recognition.

Mr President, first of all, of course, I would like to thank Mrs Lunacek for the work she has done in bringing this excellent and balanced report into the world. Kosovo is very close to my heart. I have had the honour and pleasure of visiting the country three times, with our then Belgian king and with then Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt. That was immediately after the war. So I've seen the destruction, too. Our detachment did not return to Belgium until 2010. On paper, of course, Kosovo was moved closer to Europe in 2014, but in practice much remains to be done. The report gives a very good overview of both the achievements, giving the Kosovars courage in their reform process, and of the challenges that the country still faces. It is clear to myself and to the ALDE Group that Kosovo's path leads towards a fully recognised independent state that integrates into the European Union. That must be the goal.  Kosovo, however, is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in Europe and has an unemployment rate of more than 35%. Prishtina must therefore urgently, with the help of Europe, work towards its rule of law and the fight against corruption and organised crime if it is to combat the exodus of its citizens. This exodus is estimated at 35,000 Kosovars in the last three months, an unlikely figure. That is why, as liberals, we fully support the call in this resolution for socio-economic reform. Let the citizens and the companies, the companies, undertake again. Make Kosovo the beautiful country it is again, because when you go there you see the beauty.

The draft resolution discussed today is a very constructive one and I would also like to thank Mrs Lunacek for her work, which I can imagine was not always easy. It quite clearly shows Kosovo’s structural problems, both with regard to the economy and the rule of law, but also points to the way forward. Therefore, I strongly believe that signing and concluding the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) this year will send an encouraging signal to all Kosovo citizens that Kosovo’s future lies in continuing its progress towards Europe. The SAA will help further consolidate the country’s engagement on European integration, provide an important stimulus to pursue necessary reforms and address Kosovo’s economic challenges. Let me also thank, in the presence of the Ambassador, the leading authorities of Kosovo, and in particular the President of State and the Prime Minister but also others, for the immediate, quick and tough reaction to the immigration flow we faced at the end of last year by communicating in the country itself that it does not make sense to leave the country to try to apply for asylum which is not recognised. All these efforts have led to a sustainable decline in migrants and this is proof of the quality the administration and the politicians have already reached in Kosovo. Please pass on my thanks to the authorities in the country itself.  Perhaps I can do this myself because I will have the pleasure of being there in two weeks’ time when we can participate in a Western Balkan Six conference hosted by Kosovo dealing with connectivity in the area of transport. I think this is already a very good signal of the fact that Kosovo is fully participating in all the activities in the region itself, trying to better connect the countries in the region and to contribute to peace and stability, to growth, to jobs and to prosperity in the region.  I wish you all the best and once again thank Members of the Parliament for this very constructive work and contribution in the interest of Kosovo and therefore in Europe’s interests.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2345, "date": "2015-03-10.json", "name": "Zanda Kalniņa-Lukaševica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, the EU will continue to assist Kosovo of course, including through its strengthened presence on the ground. However, the primary responsibility for progress lies with Kosovo, its leaders, institutions and civil society. The Council recognises the importance of concluding the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo as soon as possible. It will be an important contribution to regional stability, closely linking Kosovo to its European integration path, and creating an additional incentive for reforms in Kosovo. The Council now awaits proposals from the Commission to be able to proceed with the Council decision, with a view to concluding the agreement without delay. Reforms are crucial and will require the political leaders to live up to their responsibilities for the good of Kosovo and of its citizens. Key EU—related reforms are essential, not just to please the EU, but because they are in the interests of Kosovo and in the interests of its citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}]
