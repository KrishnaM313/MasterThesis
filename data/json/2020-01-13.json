We know that it will be a very challenging year and therefore I very much appreciate that you have already put as the first item on the plenary agenda this urgent debate on the devastating bush fires in Australia. As you know, my Commissioner colleagues are now coming to Strasbourg from Luxembourg, where they have been pledging the oath to their office at the European Court of Justice, and therefore it would be my pleasure and my honour to represent the European Commission in the afternoon’s plenary debates with you. As you very well know – and as Australia has confirmed – these fires which we are going to debate are unprecedented. They have devastated local communities, they have led to the tragic loss of homes and they have taken the lives of people and, possibly, of over a billion animals, many of which are completely unique in the world. Beyond the immediate destruction of forest, land, lives, animals and ecosystems, these wildfires jeopardise health and livelihoods in other places as well. Canberra experienced peak air pollution levels that were 20 times above the hazardous threshold, to give just one example. First and foremost, we send our support and solidarity to Australia. The European Union stands ready to help the Australian people. Yesterday, my colleague Commissioner Lenarčič reached out and spoke to the Australian Minister Littleproud and he reiterated the Union’s readiness to assist Australia in this moment of crisis. He also informed the Minister of the possibility for, in particular, firefighters to be deployed at short notice under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. The Minister appreciated the support and readiness of the Union to help, but he reiterated that at this stage they don’t require additional assistance. The science is loud and clear. Climate change will increase the frequency of extreme weather events and these events will continue to affect us, and with more and more consequences and higher and higher intensity. Do we need more proof that the prevention of climate change and environmental destruction, adaptation and disaster risk prevention, are absolutely necessary, and that we need to mitigate the effects of climate change together in Europe, in Australia and in the rest of the world? We have discussed many times in recent months the importance of EU leadership on global climate action. The effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and increasing global ambition is a key priority under the European Green Deal. The European Union will use all the tools at our disposal to tackle the global climate challenge. Our bilateral engagement with partner countries is crucial, in particular with the G20 economies that are responsible for three-quarters of global emissions. We value our long-standing partnership with Australia and are working to strengthen it through the establishment of the Dialogue on Climate Action under the Framework Agreement. The Commission thanks the Parliament for tabling this urgent debate and for seeing the climate urgency in these tragic events and especially in these circumstances, where we need to highlight the need to take global action.

Let me make two comments on this: firstly, on the occasion of the commission's relaunch, on the occasion of the launch of the Green Deal and following the World Climate Conference in Madrid, the EU must add the climate and environmental dimension to its foreign policy more clearly than it has done so far. We do not just need summit and conference diplomacy, we need constant publicity for compliance with the Paris climate targets and the content of the Green Deal. Future EU climate diplomacy must be strengthened in terms of personnel and, above all, clearly assigned to institutions and competences, so that we can quickly bring difficult partners such as Australia on board in the future. On the other hand, we must remember that the way in which fires are fought has been called into question. The Australian firefighting system is one of the best in the world and has yet been overwhelmed by the novel fire dynamics. We have to deal with living with the fire or leaving certain areas uninhabited in the future. In 2018, 100 people were killed in forest fires in Greece.

The wildfires in Australia are increasing the CO2 levels in our atmosphere and creating toxic airspaces. The smoke created by these wildfires is orbiting the entire planet. Fires in New South Wales and Queensland alone emitted a combined 306 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and they are generating enough heat to create unique weather systems, including cyclonic fire tornados.  The 7.3 million hectares of land that have been destroyed cover an area that exceeds the size of the Netherlands and Belgium combined. Over one billion animals – twice the amount of EU citizens – have perished. And this is, yes, a biodiversity crisis. Australia is home to truly unique species, including 200 types of mammals that do not exist anywhere else in the world.  In the face of this destruction, complacency should have no place, and the EU needs to remain a leader in fighting climate change when these things happen. Because we saw an unperturbed government in Brazil when the Amazon was on fire, and we are seeing an Australian Government that for the past months has been hesitating to link these fires to climate change. We saw some Members of this House today trying to do the same. It is even planning to use a carbon accounting loophole to fulfil its Paris Agreement commitments and this is not acceptable. As we discuss here, the Australian wildfires are still raging, and are projected to do so for at least another month. Ultimately we are speaking about climate change. We are in this together.

Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims and injured, and our heartfelt thanks also go to the firefighters and volunteers. Of course, the first question is the causes of these catastrophic fires. The climate in Australia is generally hot and dry. Bushfires are an integral part of Australia's ecology and allow the re-growth of certain species and plants. However, it is not clear that climate change is also causing drier and hotter summers in Australia, and thus also affects the length of the bushfire season. What consequences are we going to draw? On the one hand, we need to check whether the EU civil protection mechanism has grown disasters of this magnitude. This concerns both operations within the EU and our ability to provide assistance in third countries in such exceptional situations. Of course, Australia must also stick to its climate targets, and I expect these targets to be met, partly because of the great potential for renewable energy. Prime Minister Morrison said this in the press yesterday. The European Parliament delegation will travel to Australia as early as February to find out about the impact of the fires and progress on climate change.

Shame on you, and please do so vigorously. Without sounding cynical, devastating fires have repeatedly developed from the fires that belong to the continent's ecosystem: 1851, 1939, 1983, 1974, 1975, for example, were such years. And the issue of drought? In fact, there is a tendency towards higher annual rainfall, as can be guessed here in this descriptive statistic of the last 120 years, even if 2019 was particularly low.\" The reasons for the fires? In addition to arson, it was in particular the perverse policy of green environmentalists that prevented the state programs for the targeted burning of dead wood. This has massively increased the so-called fire load. Even small bushfires can develop disastrously.

We are, of course, all deeply concerned about the development of the situation, the drought that has been going on for so long and the high temperatures that, of course, are conducive to these fires.  But let's not forget that fires on the Australian continent are not a new phenomenon. They happen almost every year.

Our own science from the GRC of 2018 says exactly the same: longer seasons, larger areas, bigger fires. Especially in the south of Europe, even in the best case scenario of a 2 degree warming, the projections for the future are near apocalyptic.  What did the current neoliberal climate-denying Australian Government do besides blocking agreement in COP25? They reduced the budget of New South Wales for firefighting by 75% and that for rescue by 34%. Mr Vice-President, we must not do like the Australians.

Today, in Europe, we must mobilize in the name of solidarity, of course, but the reality is that we need an obligation of collective intelligence and political mobilization. While we have just declaring a climate emergency, how can we fail to understand that if we do not accelerate our fight against climate change, the Australian disaster will be our global tragedy tomorrow. How can we fail to understand the need to combat climate sceptics all over the world, including here, because the consequences of ecological tragedies have no borders: from Australia to Chile, a toxic cloud has just crossed the world's largest ocean, an ocean rich in biodiversity.

But I really do appreciate the wealth of information and all the aspects you covered in this discussion. As I said at the beginning, I believe that, after this debate, we can say that we as Europeans clearly send our support and our solidarity to Australia. As highlighted by Madam Šojdrová, it’s very important that this message is also spread across Europe, namely that we are ready to help, especially any country in such dramatic distress. At the same time, many of you highlighted the fact that what’s happening in Australia is just the consequence of global climate change, that this situation was caused by us humans, and that we need a global effort to take care of it. The interventions by Ms Bentele, Ms Dalli and Mr Bijoux appealed to us in the Commission – but also to our global partners – to make sure that we do this collectively and that we will have that consistent and strong global effort. We need to make sure that the Paris Agreement is implemented globally by all the key powers, as Mr Hajšel said, and to look for ways in which we can make that important transition in Europe socially fair so that we can demonstrate to other parts of the world that this is possible: that you can grow, that you can cut CO2 emissions and that you can do it in a socially fair manner. I think that, if we see that the world is not respecting our pace, we will have to look for new mechanisms – as was suggested in our previous discussions – to make sure that we push other countries in that direction if they do not respond to our efforts. Let’s consider mechanisms like the carbon adjustment mechanism or other measures to make sure that other industries in parts of the world outside Europe will also try to produce as cleanly as we do in the European Union.  I think that this discussion has also just reminded us of the fact that we in Europe have also not been spared the dramas and tragedies brought by climate change. Let’s just look back at some of the dramatic events which honourable Members have reminded us about – the tragic fires in Portugal, Sweden and Greece – and let’s be sure that we will not relent in making sure that our readiness and preparedness gets much better every single year to come. We need to simply make sure that we will improve the existing wildfire and forest management strategy, complement the fire suppression strategies with increased awareness, preparedness and prevention, and combine these short—term measures with long-term adaptations, which is so important, especially for forest management. The EU strategy on adaptation, which was adopted in 2013, was aimed exactly at that: to make sure that we would enhance our preparedness and resilience to the current and future impact on climate change, especially by the climate proofing of key vulnerable sectors such as those that I have already mentioned. All this would come under the new umbrella of the new ambitious strategy, which will be the flagship project of this Commission and, I believe, of this House. This will be the European Green Deal. Mr Knotek referred to the Copernicus Programme and I’m very glad to say that, yes, we are the biggest provider of this data, of the imagery which is very often key for fighting fires from California to Australia. We are, of course, going to develop that further and invest in early warning systems, such as the European Forest Fire Information System, which are critical for managing the crisis, as we are discussing today. We have improved our civil protection capacities, but we know that we need to do more. I would agree with Ms Müller and Mr Kokkalis that we have to permanently look for ways in which we can make it better, make it more fireproof and be properly prepared for all contingencies which might head in our direction in the future. To conclude, I would like to say that the best response we could give to this crisis is to be very focused and very determined in introducing the European Green Deal and demonstrating to other parts of the world that it’s possible to do it. We know how to do it and we are ready to share our experience, and of course in all that we would count on the support of this House – of you, of the European Parliament.

It is not acceptable for countries that do not comply with the Paris Agreement or that there are political leaders who deny climate change or ignore its consequences.

In the face of these events, the EU must urgently revise the planned trade deal with Australia. There are valid concerns that this deal will have negative impacts on climate change. A draft final report for the Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment published on 13 December warns us that greenhouse gasses emissions are expected to increase, as a result of increased production in Australia and in the EU. Such increase will come from the production of meat – mainly beef and sheep meat. This trade deal aims to liberalise current meat tariffs. As a result, Australia will produce more meat further contributing to climate change. The EU wants to be a global leader that sets the environmental agenda.

Organised crime affects the life and safety of European citizens. It affects Europe’s economy and society’s trust in public institutions. The 2017 European Union Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment Report stated that more than 5 000 organised crime groups are under investigation in Europe, which is a rise of more than 50% compared to the numbers from 2013. Their profits are estimated at EUR 110 billion per year in the European Union. However, only one percentage point of these profits is confiscated. The challenge is to build a holistic and comprehensive approach with the legislative and operational instruments to tackle the modus operandi of organised crime groups, including one of its key enablers, corruption. At the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) meeting in December 2019, dedicated to the fight against corruption and organised crime, the Members of this House called for a strategy on organised crime and corruption, as European problems call for European solutions. Therefore, I very much welcome the timely organisation of this debate.  In 2008, the EU adopted a legally binding instrument requiring Member States to outlaw participation in a criminal organisation. However, by the time it was adopted, some shortcomings had already been identified, such as the lack of harmonisation in the definition of the offence (participation in a criminal organisation), which, in practice, means that a number of Member States do not criminalise the mere participation in a criminal organisation, but require a specific link to a criminal offence. As policymakers, it is our duty to close loopholes in existing legislation. An external study on organised crime, and also on this issue, will be launched very soon.  The approach of ‘following the money’ should be part of any investigation into organised crime. The Directive on Law Enforcement Access to Financial Information entered into force on 1 August last year. Additional measures may be needed to enable law enforcement authorities to carry out effective cross-border investigations. Interconnection as well as access for law enforcement is a key component for investigations into organised crime, and this avenue should be pursued in the future.  Asset recovery offices have been created in all Member States, and the Directive on Freezing and Confiscation of Instrumentalities and Proceeds of Crime, adopted in 2014, harmonises these rules across the European Union.  A new regulation on the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders that will apply as of December 2020 complements the legal framework. However, we need to do more. A confiscation rate of 1% is just much too low. The Commission will therefore present a report on the implementation of the Confiscation Directive to help reflect on the need for stronger provision on enhancing asset tracing, freezing and confiscation.  The Commission has already analysed non-conviction-based confiscation provisions in the Member States in a document presented in the LIBE Committee last September. The Europol 2017 report also highlighted the way corruption enables the crime. The 2019 midterm review showed the considerable increase in top-level organised crime activities in the European Union. It is essential that Member States are well equipped to fight against corruption. The capacity to fight corruption has been identified as one of the key aspects of the new rule of law review cycle to be developed by the Commission in 2020.  The European Labour Authority, mandated to facilitate the free movement of workers across the EU and to support the Commission and Member States in the application and enforcement of European law, will also create synergies and work together with other EU agencies, such as Europol and Eurojust, in the fight against organised crime and trafficking in human beings. The Commission fully supports Europol’s approach to dismantling top—level organised crime groups by removing the key players, the so-called high—value targets. Such an approach fits with a desire to deprive criminals of their illegally gained profits. It is also important for Europol to stress that any high-value targets initiative should be complementary to the EU policy cycle on serious and organised crime.  The fight against illicit drugs will be a priority for the next Commission. According to the latest report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and Europol, we are currently experiencing the worst drug crisis in our history. The volume of cocaine and heroin introduced in the EU is at an all-time high, and in parts of Europe, synthetic drug production is growing. As the current EU drug strategy is ending, the Commission will consider what future action is needed in view of this alarming situation. EMPACT, the EU policy cycle for serious and international organised crime, has changed the way the Member States cooperate and tackle organised crime together. For the period 2018-2021, 10 crime priorities are being jointly addressed. These include cybercrime, drug trafficking, facilitation of illegal immigration, and trafficking in human beings, among others.  The numbers are staggering. In 2018, on trafficking in human beings, more than 1 200 investigations were initiated, with 7 249 suspects reported and 6 057 victims identified. Another example I would refer to is excise fraud, where over EUR 229 million of tax evasion has been prevented. So we see that the challenge is enormous and that this is really a European problem, a European challenge, to which we need to find the answers together. Therefore, I would really like to thank Madam President for tabling this issue for plenary debate.

Last year, 40 people were shot dead, we've had 200 blasts. Malmö has been particularly affected, where, for example, a woman was shot dead while carrying her own child in her arms. Blasts and shootings are now so common in Sweden that the Danish government has had to take the decision to introduce border controls against Sweden in order to protect its own citizens.  Now is not the time to deny or reduce the problems we see with gang crime in Sweden. Now is the time to ensure that we can do everything we can, nationally of course, but also at European level, to be able to help increase security in Sweden and to ensure that free movement between Sweden and Denmark can also work forward.  It is tragic to have seen how, in particular, Socialist MEPs in particular have tried to reduce this and were not prepared to discuss it. I think we need to be more humble than that. This is a problem for Sweden, but it is also a problem for the whole region and Europe. I would therefore call on the Commission to make three proposals: to ensure that Europol has more resources, to focus more on Sweden, to stop drugs and weapons.

Ensuring the safety and security of people is a key task for each Member State. Crime must be combated, crime is to be prevented. But we have long underestimated how crime, weapons and drugs flow between Member States and across the EU's borders. That's not how we're going to do it. The EU's freedom of movement should increase freedom, not be abused by those who want to destroy. Greater cross-border cooperation is now needed.  Today's police cooperation within the EU, Europol, is far too weak and without operational power. If we are serious about strangling the flow of cross-border crime, europe must have proper muscle. The Liberals therefore want europol to develop into a European FBI, which will be operational and able to make its own efforts when gangs operate across borders. I would like to say that this is urgent and important to the EPP and to the Moderates, who have taken the initiative in this debate. But now it's up to the evidence.

Madam President! Thank you to the Commissioner for an answer which I think is adequate. I'll look at it from a different angle. The means of action in many countries, including Denmark, has been border controls. Border controls can be useful in some places, but are actually mostly a huge hassle. Now, fortunately, it has been thrashed down between Sweden and Denmark. We do not bother citizens as much as we have done, and that has not helped.  We have introduced border controls against Germany too. In Denmark, we are currently celebrating the jubilation this year that we have reunited North Schleswig with Jutland, and at the same time we are very proud that we have built up good border cooperation between minorities – and the memory of Denmark not putting in border controls. Fortunately, it does not work, or rather: it does not work, it wastes money, it bothers our fellow human beings, it costs a lot. But that has been done.

The Schengen area without internal borders, which guarantees every citizen of the Union the right to move and reside freely, is one of the greatest achievements of European integration and is a key element of the Union's identity, embodying cooperation, reconciliation, peace, tolerance, trust and security. But Schengen has been a difficult test for the last four years, with six countries in the area erstyking internal border controls for four years, even though they have no legal basis for them.  Today, we are faced with the question of how to move forward. Are we already witnessing the beginning of the end of Schengen and what to do to bring it back to life? How and when internal controls can in fact be abandoned and whether alternative measures can achieve the same objective. The implementation of internal border controls cannot be a long-term response to the challenges of cross-border organised crime, migration and security. Internal controls are only a short-term solution, they are a postponing of responsibility. We must face the challenges of European migration and asylum policy, secure external borders, the fight against people smugglers, the mitigation of the situation in the crisis areas from which people are fleeing. We also need to strengthen cross-border cooperation between police and judicial authorities, the exchange of information between countries, which is still not effective and, above all, trust. In this spirit, we in the European Parliament have also adopted amendments to the Schengen Code with more transparent rules. At the time of the creation of Schengen, we could not have imagined four years of internal border controls. Let us not let Schengen, as we knew it, lose. All the risks will never be eliminated, of course, even if we restore control at all borders. We have rule reform on the table, but this is blocked by a lack of political will among governments.

Many of you mentioned very concretely the situation in Malmö in Sweden, in Denmark, and indeed we have seen across the Nordic countries but I would say more generally across Europe, the fact that organised crime is on the rise, that drug supply trafficking has increased, and that we see also these very high numbers of organised crime groups which of course then lead to the increased use of violence. You cited the figures for Sweden and I agree with you that they are staggering. I can assure you that on behalf of the Commission we will be ready to explore all avenues, all possibilities, for how we in the Commission, but especially our specialised agencies like Europol and Eurojust, can be of help to Sweden and other Nordic countries or any country of the European Union which is in need of assistance. Several of you asked what we can do, how we can help, and in my introductory remarks I already reiterated some of the measures we would like to propose. But I think the most important one is to close legal loopholes, to make sure that we do not apply the law differently, that our police officials cooperate more sincerely, more cordially, that we would simply close the borders for criminals and keep them open for our law-abiding citizens. So therefore I really would like to thank Mr Tobé, Ms Fritzon and also Ms Auken for their support and also for the call to explore every possibility for how we can increase the capabilities of Europol and how to motivate our Member States and our police forces for even closer cross-border cooperation. I can assure you that this is one of the top priorities for this Commission, and we will see how this will be reflected in the Commission work programme which I hope we will be coming to present to you before the end of the month. Some of you – Ms Schaldemose, Ms Fajon – also referred to the temporary reintroduction of border controls by Denmark, and here I would just underline that Member States are entitled to temporarily reintroduce border controls at their internal borders if confronted with threats to internal security and public policy. Indeed in the last prolongation of border controls at internal borders Denmark specifically referred to the threats related to the cross-border criminality originating from Sweden. I would just like to inform you that the Commission is analysing its notification, its proportionality and necessity, because we know how Schengen is important for our citizens, how it represents the core and also the symbol of European integration. Therefore, we need to explore all the possibilities – how to prevent the causes which led to this temporary introduction of border controls. To conclude, I really would like to agree with all of you who said that this is indeed a European problem which needs a European solution, and therefore it is absolutely crucial that all of us, all actors, work together in this fight, and here again I would underline how the Commission counts on your continued support in this fight against organised crime.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2020-01-13.json", "name": "Die Präsidentin. –", "mepid": "197433", "text": "  The debate is closed.

According to the 2017 European Union Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment Report, around 5,000 organised crime groups operate within the EU – an increase of 50% compared to 2013! According to the report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the EU is also experiencing the worst drug crisis since the EU was founded. And the attacks in Paris, Berlin, and Nice also show how terrorists are using free movement. Drugs, crime and terrorism undermine bourgeois societies. Added to this is the ever-increasing financial power of organised crime. Already, the annual profit from organised crime in the EU is EUR 110 billion! This, too, is changing societies into the negative. The situation in Central American countries is a blueprint for what is also seen in some countries in south-eastern Europe: the takeover of state institutions by financially strong criminal cartels.

The threat of illegal migration and terrorism has forced these anti-terrorist measures on the part of Denmark. At this point, the Schengen free travel zone faces a major test after both countries closed their borders in November, while Austria and Germany extended their temporary checks at their internal borders for another six months, the first with Hungary and Slovenia and the second with Austria. A total of six countries have closed their borders. We have seen how many Schengen member states do not deal with migration and security problems at their borders and have been forced to introduce checks on them. In this respect, Bulgaria is an example of the protection of the EU's worst land external border – the one with Turkey, where there is zero migratory pressure and is not yet a member of Schengen, even though it has met all the technical criteria.

But, first, I would like to underline that the Commission has strongly supported the harmonisation of chargers for mobile phones and similar devices. The common charger campaign was an initiative triggered by the Commission back in 2009 and I have to underline that, thanks to the Commission’s efforts, the industry implemented a voluntary approach. The work has only gained in importance since that moment and, in the light of the urgent transition to the circular economy, a sustainable product policy is a priority initiative in the European Green Deal, which has just been adopted by this Commission. To give you a little bit of the background, I would just like us to remind ourselves that, in 2009, we had more than 30 charging solutions. Currently, we have only three main possibilities. The voluntary approach has therefore been very effective in reducing market fragmentation, enhancing consumer convenience and reducing the environmental impact without resorting to regulation. It should also be noted that electronic waste is still one of the fastest growing waste streams, which makes this type of waste prevention particularly important.  The voluntary agreement came to an end in 2014. Since then, the Commission has made every effort to promote renewed voluntary commitment. However, the last mile has not yet been accomplished. Since 2014 – the same year the voluntary agreement was discontinued – the industry introduced two new technologies for chargers onto the market: USB C and wireless. Fast charging capabilities have been implemented in many models too and, in this context of technological changes, we felt that the voluntary approach, actively supported by the European Commission, was the best way of achieving our policy objectives without hampering innovation. In discussions with the industry, we continuously insist on the need to agree on a solution which would fulfil the following objectives satisfactorily: convenience for consumers, the safety and interoperability of chargers, and the reduction of electronic waste.  Regretfully, the memorandum of understanding of March 2018 fell short of our expectations. The industry proposed continuing to allow for a proprietary solution instead of implementing one common charger possibility. Therefore, consumer convenience and the reduction of e—waste was not enhanced. In addition, the scope was limited to smartphones only, failing to capture other portable devices. Against the global backdrop of ever—increasing material use and resource extraction responsible for half of the total CO2 emissions and environmental pressures, we consider this a missed opportunity. Therefore, the Commission has explored other possible options with a study to be published in the next few days.  One of the options is the adoption of the delegated act under the Radio Equipment Directive. At first glance, regulating the common charging interface on its own would, however, not necessarily be an optimal solution. This would mainly consist in the elimination of proprietary connectors, representing around 20% of the market with limited benefits for consumers. For this option to achieve significant reduction in material use, e—waste and greenhouse gas emissions, it would have to be complemented by additional measures, for instance to mandate and/or incentivise the sale of mobile phones without the charger. Therefore, we will look at a combination of policy options, including regulatory and non-regulatory measures, in order to achieve our objectives.  The study also assesses whether it is possible to extend the scope beyond smartphones and thus enhance benefits to both the consumer and the environment, taking into account technical issues such as different power needs. In addition, innovation and interoperability are key elements of any solution. Therefore, any better-performing new charging solution would be welcome as long as it is a common charging solution. Along the same lines, interoperability of wireless technology for charging would have to be ensured, even if this is still an incipient technology. Consumers should definitely be given a central role, in particular if manufacturers are only allowed to sell mobile phones without the charger, which seems to be a promising option from the environmental point of view. This would entail large consumer awareness campaigns and consumers should benefit from any reduction in costs being passed on through lower prices for standalone devices. In the European Green Deal we have committed to support and accelerate the EU’s industry transition to a sustainable model of inclusive growth. We have committed ourselves to mobilise industry for a clean and circular economy, including for a sustainable products policy and durable design of products, also giving priority to reducing and re—using materials before recycling them.  The Commission is therefore committed to present the next steps to make common chargers a reality for all EU citizens, and we will keep you closely informed.

The number of cables and chargers produced and thrown away each year is simply unacceptable. We still need four different cables for smartphones, digital cameras, e-book readers and tablets. Europeans change their smartphones on average every two years, so every second year our citizens are forced to buy new chargers when buying new devices, even if all the chargers still function. Demand grows and with it waste and exploitation of natural resources. We are drowning in an ocean of electronic waste. Around 50 million tonnes of e-waste is generated globally per year with an average of more than 6 kilograms per person. In Europe, it is even 16 kilograms per person, and we cannot continue this way. Commissioner, I agree that the voluntary agreement is not enough. We expect three concrete actions to be undertaken. Firstly, the Commission has to show leadership and stop letting tech giants dictate standards. If digital sovereignty really means something to this new Commission, we expect a proposal to establish a standard of a common charger – wireless or not – within the next six months. Secondly, having the possibility to use the same common charger for multiple devices, the consumer should not be forced to pay additional charges when buying new devices. Thirdly, the Commission should propose quality standards for treating e-waste and help Member States to reach e-waste collection targets.

These are sometimes large, life-size abstract things, such as ensuring our freedom and security, or creating a single market for 500 million people. But sometimes it also lies in something as practical and simple as one uniform charger, the so-called common charger. A single general charger for all mobile phones, cameras and tablets means less cost, less waste and more user convenience for consumers. We no longer need a separate charger for each device, which we then throw away when we buy a new phone from a different brand.  This dossier has been going on for a decade now, so it is high time. Although some manufacturers still claim that you can't compare apples with pears, I don't think this needs to be that complicated. For example, manufacturers have already made great strides and we have gone from 30 different chargers to three different types of chargers over the past decade. That's good, but we're not there yet. It seems that something more is needed than just encouragement. For example, the current legislation is still based on a voluntary basis for manufacturers, whereas now you can see that this is not working enough in the end. In addition, of course, there must also be room for the development of new applications.

I am aware that this is an important matter for the European Parliament, as reflected in its resolutions calling for legal actions that tackle gender-based pay discrimination. We are on exactly the same page on this. Pay discrimination has gone on for too long. The principle of equal pay has been in the Treaty since 1957, but women are still being paid an average of 16% less than men in Europe. It is high time for further action. President von der Leyen has entrusted me with the task to develop a new European gender equality strategy to address areas in which women still face additional barriers. I will give equality in the world of work its due attention by putting forward proposals for pay transparency. The Commission envisages presenting a new gender equality strategy in the first week of March. The aim is to have a strong ambitious and overarching approach, with specific measures to close the gender pay gap. Equal pay will be a key principle of the new strategy, and the Commission will act as regards measures on pay transparency. We have had a non-binding recommendation for five years now, which gave Member States a toolbox of measures to enforce the equal-pay principle. Some Member States have introduced the measures, but many have not. Because there is a lack of transparency, many women do not even know that they are being underpaid. Work typically done by women is systematically and structurally underpaid compared to work typically done by men, even when it is work of equal value. This is why transparency is such an important issue. I will be looking at a broad range of options when working on the scope of the pay transparency proposals, from giving employees information on pay levels to requiring companies to report on pay levels and analyse such data in audits. I am aware that introducing binding pay transparency measures is challenging. While we want to strengthen the rights of employees to get more information about pay levels, we also need to recognise that some of the possible measures may add administrative burdens for employers. It is therefore imperative to consult employers, employees and national administrations to find the right balance for such EU intervention. Let’s also not forget that increasing pay transparency is only one of the steps towards addressing the gender pay gap. Closing this gap requires a comprehensive approach addressing all its root causes: a lower participation of women in the labour market; a higher use of part-time and career breaks by women when compared to men; vertical and horizontal segregation on the labour market; and gender stereotypes and discrimination. Another thing. Women are over-represented in work of precarious nature. They are the vast majority of part-time workers and often opt for variable hours and temporary contracts. This is another factor which significantly reinforces gender gaps. In in this regard, the Commission will work closely with Member States to ensure that binding legal acts are properly implemented, and to assist Member States in taking utmost advantage of other legal provisions. This includes the recommendation on access to social protection, the Directive on Part-Time Work, the Directive on Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions, and, of course, the Work-Life Balance Directive. I intend to work closely with the European Parliament throughout this process and I look forward to listening to your views today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 141, "date": "2020-01-13.json", "name": "Die Präsidentin. –", "mepid": "197433", "text": "  I would also like to point out here that the clock has been running backwards since today.

I’m glad we’re all on the same page – because we need to be if we are to get action in relation to this issue. If we are serious about gender equality here in the European Union, if we are serious, for example, about the sustainable development goals (SDGs), if we are serious about the European social pillar, then it is essential that we tackle the gender pay gap. Equality matters, and this is a very serious inequality that has lasted for far too long. Economic equality is critically important because without equality in earnings, in what people live on throughout their lives, social equality cannot be guaranteed. You have described the pay gap that exists: the 16%, and more in some places. Of course, we also have the pension pay gap, which is very, very serious. The current gender pension gap in Europe stands at over double the gender pay gap – at 35.7%. Just think of the implications of that for individual women, for children and for their families as they grow older. They just do not have access to the same money to live their lives. The consequences of both the gender pay gap and the pension pay gap are very serious. They cost our society. They cost because they perpetuate child poverty, they perpetuate skills shortages, and of course, there is an enormous cost to the economies of all our countries because they are underusing women’s skills, and there is a serious barrier here to women’s full participation. We know all this. The question is: what we are going to do about it? What we see already is quite a number of countries taking action. I welcome what you say about the variety of issues that can be dealt with if we take this seriously. Pay transparency is critical. We’ve seen already the impact of greater transparency, for example, when it has been seen in media jobs recently.

There is this sad anniversary, which highlights the glaring pay gap between women and men in the European Union: Equal Pay Day, which we all know. There is nothing to celebrate. This day marks the large pay gap between women and their male counterparts. Although the principle of equal pay for equal work or equal work of equal value has always been enshrined in the EU Treaties, although article 4 explicitly prohibits direct and indirect discrimination in pay, women still earn 16% less per hour than their male counterparts in 2019. The situation is even worse in old age, as women receive on average 40% less pension, less pension than men. Mothers with children under the age of seven have the worst at all: two-thirds of the pay gap is classic discrimination. Woman gets paid less just because she is a woman. The pay gap is based, among other things, on persistent stereotypes about the role of women, who still do most of the housework and child-rearing. What is needed is a rethink, a break-up of the existing power and thought structures if we want real equality and fair pay.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my fight is for equality. Eliminating the wage gap also means combating women's poverty and social exclusion. The gender pay gap is socially and economically intolerable. Socially, because it contravenes the principle of equality - as you have pointed out, of non-discrimination - enshrined in the European treaties. Economically, because it is part of growth and innovation that suffers from these gaps. It is estimated that by reducing the gender pay gap by an additional two percentage points, we could increase the EU's GDP by more than 40 billion a year. Equality is also at the heart of the inspiration for the European social rights base, which we are committed to putting fully into practice. The time has come to update the European Union's action plan on this issue by working around three axes. First, the transparency of remuneration information, which needs to be improved. Second, obligations of results, remedial measures and, third, support measures for the organization. Through the obligation to pay transparency and the implementation of audit measures, we will have accurate, objective and large-scale data that will enable us to better define the contours of these possible discriminations and also to measure progress. I am pleased that the Commission has resolutely embarked on this transparency, which is part of the obligations resulting from the 2014 directive on extra-financial information. On the second axis, the Commission, Member States and social partners - social dialogue is important - will need to have more relevant measures, as a prevention of binding remedial measures.

I want to start by saying this. In any case, thank you, Commissioner, for what you presented here today. We are really hopeful that we will be able to work the fight against the pay gap in an important way. This is affecting a lot of women, given the 16% gap we have. We must not forget that this then has other consequences: the pension gap, which is at 35%, which is a direct consequence of the wage gap we have. And, therefore, I think there are two things about what he has said that are very important to me. First, we have had a specific own strategy, a specific action plan to combat the wage gap, which has done little work. I believe that, in the context of the review of the strategy, it must be updated, with clear indicators, in order to be able to deal with the phenomenon. And then, of course, we are very anxiously awaiting the new Directive on wage transparency, which you have already presented. I liked the content of what you mentioned: the fact that audits are mandatory, that employees can know and employees can know the gender pay scales. I think it is also very important that we have a regime of sanctions and the protection of victims of the significant pay gap in that legislative piece. With all this, I am convinced that you will be able to count on this Parliament. I believe that we can also learn a lot from the Icelandic experience, which has managed to reduce the pay gap by virtually zero with these measures. And finally, what I would recommend to you, or I think we have to do together, is to start working on an alliance in the Council. I do not want this legislative text to end as in the past other proposals, for example blocked.

There is an unadjusted and an adjusted pay gap. If we take the adjusted, the difference is between 2 and 7%, for the younger, the 20-30 year olds, even the other way round at the expense of men. If we look at the unadjusted gender pay gap, we have to say that the cause lies in the policy of the political left, which to this day does not manage to give attractive economic recognition to child-rearing times and motherhood and to start with the calculation of pensions, for example. We are seeing how conservatively governed countries such as Hungary, but also Poland, whose Minister for Family Affairs will shortly be speaking here, are going down the road where they take into account the very benefits that mothers provide when they take care of children, so that the unadjusted gender pay gap is falling, while precisely where women are seen only as economic farm animals and do not want to reward family benefits, it is just increasing, as in many Western European countries.

However, when we look globally at the issue of the gender pay gap, there is indeed much to be done. There are many reasons for the gender pay gap, but I am convinced that one of the main reasons is women's responsibility to look after their families. They raise children, take care of often old, sick parents. Ladies are therefore more likely to work part-time and in less profitable sectors. We should therefore consider how to compensate the ladies who act as mothers and carers of their ailing parents, precisely those differences in pay.

But upstream of all this is above all an ethical reading, or rather the lack of a true social awareness about the seriousness of this problem. There is a kind of collective complacency on this issue, as if there were always others in a list of priorities that are always outof moral relevance. And that's why, although 60% of the population with higher qualifications is female, women remain relegated from management and management positions. This is also the case in the agricultural world, where only 30% of farms in the European Union are run by women, often linked to low-paid tasks.

This is a fact-based Commission. We act on facts. And the fact is that women are paid less than men, so may I add that it is also a fact that the Commission will act on this fact. I want to conclude by recalling that in addition to binding pay transparency measures and tackling the gender pay gap, as was mentioned here, there are other factors which contribute to women not being able to use their full potential and not being remunerated for what they are doing. So there is this new strategy on gender equality which will address other concomitant topics which were highlighted in the President’s political guidelines. We will work to combat and prevent violence against women, including online violence. We also know that there is a correlation between women’s financial independence and abuse and remaining in abusive relationships, so when we are talking about pay, as we did earlier, there are other consequences if this big issue is not addressed as it should be.  I also want to see gender balance on company boards and enhanced work-life balance for women and men. Again, this affects the quality of lives of women, of men, of our families. I want to see that we pay attention to the gender and broader equality perspective when addressing some of our society’s main challenges, such as climate change and digitalisation. The Commission will monitor the implementation of the work-life balance Directive in the Member States. We will promote take-up of the rights to family-related leave and flexible working arrangements, especially by men, and this will promote a more equal sharing of care responsibilities which is key to closing the gender pay gap. So, as you can see, it is all related and connected.  It is also about women achieving their full potential in the labour market, including their full economic potential. It will remove some of the incentives for women to self-select into lower-paying occupations and lower-paying roles within organisations. The strategy, in line with the commitments and the political guidelines of the new Commission, will also work on improving women’s positions in decision-making.  I will work hard with Member States to build a majority to unblock the Directive on women on boards. I count on the strong support of Parliament. Together we can make the gender pay gap history.

Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ensures the application of the principle that men and women are paid equally for work of equal or equal value. In other words, in the case of performance wages, the remuneration for the same work is determined on the basis of the same unit of measurement or, in the case of a time wage, the same remuneration is paid in the same job. However, Member States are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations and we can therefore see a difference of up to 26% in some Member States in the pay gap between men and women for the same work.

The Gender Pay Gap however, is not only a legislative matter. The gap is real, and it means women do not only have lower hourly earnings, but they work fewer hours in paid jobs and have lower employment rates. This means that legislative change alone will do little without measures across the Union to ensure more flexible working arrangements so that they become worker-oriented; and family measures to balance out the disproportions in the hours men and women dedicate to care and household activities.

There are therefore fewer than men in the labour market, but there is a lack of infrastructure to make it easier for women to return to work or start their careers again. We must also bear in mind maternity and parental leave, during which women sometimes receive lower wages and thus pay lower pension contributions, and also retire earlier than men. All this leads to a huge difference in the amount of benefits. It is currently as high as 38% in the EU. The average length of service of a man at the time of retirement is 37 years and women are only 33 years old.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Parliament for organising this debate because it touches on one of the major problems that is at the heart of our concerns about social exclusion and misery. The number of homeless people in Europe continues to grow. In fact, you only have to walk around our cities to find out. Living in decent housing at a reasonable price and in a safe environment is a fundamental need that can be considered a human right. The situation of the homeless is a major challenge in a growing number of European countries. There are no official and comparable figures on the extent of this challenge. However, the few figures we are aware of indicate that the number of homeless people has increased in the majority of Member States over the past decade. It is estimated that there are some three million homeless people in Europe. Every night, more than 400,000 people sleep on our streets. This is a daily and tangible problem that we face in our cities and that challenges us. The causes of this problem are multiple and complex, but it is established that housing market parameters and housing policies have a direct and significant impact on homelessness, which is a form of extreme exclusion and particularly affects vulnerable groups, particularly people with disabilities and migrants. Recent analyses specifically identify rising housing prices and the shortage of social housing as a key factor. Indeed, the increase in rental and purchase prices makes housing less and less accessible. As such, social housing, market surveillance and housing benefit can potentially help households. However, many citizens, without becoming homeless, can suffer and often suffer from fluctuations in markets and housing policies, including prices that are literally exploding. The housing crisis is linked to a lack of investment. The High-Level Working Group on Investments in Social Infrastructure in Europe estimated in its 2018 report that investment deficits in affordable housing amount to almost EUR 57 billion in the European Union. Although the Union does not have the competence on housing - which is often a local competence in the Member States - social housing and homelessness play an important role within the EU's social policy agenda. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU stipulates that the Union recognises and respects the right to social and housing assistance so as to ensure a decent existence for all those who lack sufficient resources, in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices. The European Pillar of Social Rights includes a principle dedicated to housing and assistance for the homeless. It is a clear political signal on the importance that the European Union attaches to the fight against homelessness and housing exclusion. The European Pillar of Social Rights sets the bar high by promoting the reintegration of homeless people into society by means of enabling social services. The Commission will now launch a broad consultation on the implementation of the looter at a national, regional and local level. The EU's role will be to work alongside all levels of governance for the benefit of citizens, and housing should also be a focus of this process. Principle 19 of the looter is included among the areas of investment of the European Social Fund Plus (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the post—2020 Multiannual Financial Framework. Applying the integrated housing—led approach, housing action supported by the ERDF should be combined with thematic areas that can be supported through ESF. In addition, we foresee an increased guarantee for social infrastructure within the proposed InvestEU, the EU's future financial instrument for investments. The European Fund for Strategic Investments is already playing a key role by financing a wide range of social infrastructure investment projects, including affordable social housing projects. Through the European Semester, the Commission provides Member States with policy support, guidance and guidance on how to design efficient national policies aimed at ensuring citizens' access to affordable and accessible social housing by stressing housing supply shortage, dysfunctional housing markets, macroeconomic imbalances and insufficient stock of social housing. The issue of homelessness has to be fully taken into account at the level of our policies fighting poverty. The Commission has shown its readiness to support Member States when and where possible on tackling homelessness. A good example is the integrated housing-led approach, which follows the principles of Housing First, that is: combining the provision of immediate housing with enabling services to empower homeless people to sustain their tenancy, promote stable living conditions and prevent repeat homelessness. Through the tools at its disposal, the Commission enables the exchange of good practices and learning between Member States. The Commission also directly supports FEANTSA, a European—level network of national organisations focusing exclusively on the fight against homelessness and housing exclusion. It runs concrete projects at the local level and has benefited from close to EUR 5 million-worth of grants from the European Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 195, "date": "2020-01-13.json", "name": "Dennis Radtke", "mepid": "188945", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I can already hear the voices saying: why are you dealing with such a subject?

We also have to deal with the fact that we do not even have a single instrument to measure the situation of homelessness in Europe.

The Housing First programme has had outstanding results in countries where it has become part of national strategies: Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal.

I worry there’s a danger in a transnational centralised one-size-fits-all approach that can mean ignoring local and national circumstances and solutions. I’d like to stress that the causes of homelessness are not universal. I think that it can mean avoiding deeper long-term solutions. So, for example, the horror and degradation of homelessness has been in some countries directly the consequence of the impoverishing and brutal austerity policies imposed on nation-states in eurozone countries by this very European Union, that has led to unemployment, evictions and homelessness. But in turn, those stagnating economies in some countries force people to move around Europe looking for better lives, understandably, and they often, too, end up homeless. For those who glamorise freedom of movement, to remind you that according to the charity Crisis, the number of homeless people from continental Europe accounts for a third of all rough sleepers in London. Freedom of movement can mean people are far from home, exploited in low-paid jobs, with no support network.

But it is a particular model, and it needs to be modified for every country. I’ve seen it work in the Midlands of Ireland where, for example, a derelict building was converted for 10 individuals who needed that extra support, and they have that and they are secure.  But of course this debate – and Commissioner, you’ve opened it out to be a much wider debate than just Housing First because in my own country after the housing crisis we have now a real crisis still for some families who are living in emergency accommodation, and while we have built social housing – 10 000 last year – we still have significant numbers who need housing.

Mr President, honourable Members, this debate shows that this problem of homelessness exists in the south, north, east and west. It exists in virtually every major city. This shows that this is a local problem, but also a European problem, and we cannot avoid this problem by saying that, at the end of the day, Europe has no competences or the competences reside mainly with The Member States or local authorities. We are challenged and your debate shows that. We want to get involved and we want to find solutions. The challenge is considerable, the numbers have been mentioned and the resources we need are also considerable, but not impossible to mobilize. I agree that the first solution is actually supply because there is a huge supply gap in Europe. The housing market has become a speculative market, and we must be able to say that as well. We must therefore ensure that supply in our Member States and in our cities is once again keeping up with demand.  It is true that housing is at the heart of all social issues. First, work, employment. You don't have a place to live, you won't have a job. You don't have a place to live, your health is deteriorating. You have problems, your problems get bigger from the moment you are on the street. We therefore need a comprehensive approach that first addresses the problem of housing but accompanies those who are the victims of absolute exclusion, in the return not only to employment, but I would say towards dignity because the people who are on the streets are deprived of their essential and fundamental dignity. We have admirable texts: we have the declaration, we have the foundation, we have our values; it is now a question of action and it is a call that emanates from both sides of this Parliament. We are not going to sit idle. The housing problem must be at the centre of the fight against poverty. Moreover, when we talk about a guarantee for children, housing is an integral part of it and, without wanting to make too specific commitments now, I think it is important that we come together to work on a concept, to bring Member States, local entities together with the Committee of the Regions, among others, to actually develop a common approach. Of course, it will not be uniform because, despite everything, the situations are diverse, but we need a thread, a real thread that guides our policies, that also inspires the policies to be implemented. This is an offer I am making to you, I hope and I am convinced that your Parliament will join in.

It is important that all homeless people are given the opportunity to access services and that no one is forced to spend the night in a public place. We don't need alarm, we need action.

More than 1 600 additional places can be used by persons in need during the winter season (intermittent capacity). In addition, more than 7,600 daytime heating capacities are available nationwide. In addition to the municipalities, a significant proportion of ecclesiastical and non-governmental organisations are involved in the operation of the institutions. On 8 January 2020, the use of night shelters was about 85.08% nationally and 83.66% in Budapest.  In total, there were around 666 available places for night shelters nationwide. The First Housing programme is also implemented in Hungary – building on the experience of previous hungarian (Back from the Street) and EU programmes. The aim is to get homeless people on the streets out of their crisis, to be placed in independent housing and to help them rehabilitate by a multidisciplinary team.

There are more than 14,000 juveniles with debts in the Czech Republic. A very vulnerable group are mothers with children who are one foot on the street due to executions. These problems must be addressed. However, I believe that the issue of homelessness must be dealt with directly by the Member States at national or local level. It is the local authorities who know the situation in their area best. A good example of a local housing first project in the Czech Republic is the Rapid Re-housing project in Brno, where 50 city apartments were provided to homeless families. Within two years, 46 families were able to maintain their households. If people on the street or hostels can maintain stable housing, their health improves, the chances of finding a job increase, and poor parents are not in danger of ending up in institutional care.

Camps in Świętochłówce-Zgodzi, Myslowice, Łambinowice are sad symbols of this tragedy. The Tragedy of Upper Silesia has not yet become part of the universal collective memory, and it should. We should teach about it in schools: Polish, German, Czech, European. We should also provide all children in Europe with regional education lessons, because regionalism and the love of their own Heimat are the best response to blind nationalism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 253, "date": "2020-01-13.json", "name": "Jane Brophy (Renew).", "mepid": "197716", "text": "   – Mr President, this is one of the last plenary sessions before Britain leaves the EU. We may be going, but leaving will impact far into our future.  Today, Parliament discussed the tragic bushfires that have decimated Australia’s homes and wildlife. In Yorkshire, in northern England, people’s homes have been devastated by floods. The EU offered millions of pounds of funding in flood relief, but the UK rejected it. In 1980, our British beaches were badly polluted and they were unsightly too. Just 40 years later, 99% have been designated safe for swimming, mostly because of GBP 3 billion of EU funding.  Can we trust Boris Johnson’s Government to keep our beaches clean? Can we trust that our native species of birds will be saved again from extinction? Who will be there, when the floods come to the UK again, to support us? The EU has worked tirelessly to invest in a shared future for our children. Weird weather events must be a warning to everybody that climate change does not respect international boundaries. It is up to the elected representatives of every nation to protect our planet from environmental destruction, and Britain is so much worse off without the European Union.

The European Union regulates a wide range of policies, enters a number of areas of our lives, sometimes happily, sometimes less appropriately, but what we incomprehensibly miss is the regulation of the activities and financing of political parties, and now I mean the national ones. There is a lack of any transparency in this regard, many states do not have at all regulated the reporting of the activities of national political parties and the availability of this data for national authorities, but also for citizens in general.  And it must be said that we have a number of cases where national political parties act as trojan horses of third powers, sometimes Russia, sometimes others. I can talk about the Freedom Party from Austria, the AfD, the Brexit Party, The Hungarian Jobbik and a whole range of other parties. And I think it is important for the European Union to start addressing this issue as well, because it is usually the darkest under the candlelight, but also the greatest risk.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 255, "date": "2020-01-13.json", "name": "Vlad-Marius Botoş (Renew).", "mepid": "197668", "text": "   – Mr President, Romania has one of the greatest incidences of cancer. Unfortunately, the treatment and care of cancer patients is not to acceptable standards. Their fight and their families is incredible.  I know what it means to see family members sickened by this disease. I know what it means to fight with them in a system that doesn't seem to be trying to help you, quite the contrary. That is why I think it is important that from here, at the level of the European Parliament, dear colleagues, we make as many projects as possible in which the main objective is prevention.  This chapter of health falls within our remit. We owe it to all those who voted for us to think of clear ways to prevent disease. It is no longer news to anyone that excessive pollution and nutrition are among the main causes of illness.  Let us give due importance to this chapter!

Lately, the European Union has focused its attention on the Western Balkans, but I recently visited one of these countries – it is Serbia – and I note that, although Romania made it conditional, when negotiations began seven years ago with this country, that the rights of minorities be respected, I noticed something that I find extremely serious , namely, that the rights of the Romanian minority in this country – there are more than 300 000 Romanian speakers – are still disrespected. There is no access to education in the Romanian language, there is no freedom for the citizens of this Romanian-speaking country to have their own media institutions, and it is all the more serious since the ban on the construction of a Romanian church in Malainitsa, in Eastern Serbia – a church, which has been threatened with demolition for several years by the Serbian authorities – has not been withdrawn. So I am sounding the alarm to the Commission and i am calling for the rights of national minorities in this country to be strictly monitored, because, although a bilateral agreement has been signed between Romania and Serbia – an agreement that has been negotiated by the current Foreign Minister, Bogdan Aurescu – for 7 years, it is not respected and I think it is inadmissible as a country with European aspirations , who wants to become a member of the European Union, not to comply with these commitments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 257, "date": "2020-01-13.json", "name": "John Howarth (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "188636", "text": "   – Mr President, thank you for bearing with me again. Following representations by an elected representative in my constituency, I’m raising this issue as a matter of public record before this House. In recent days, following various media reports, the case of a young British female tourist who made a complaint to police of a multiple rape while on holiday in Cyprus has come to light. She later withdrew the complaint following 10 hours – 10 hours – of police questioning without legal representation. As a result, she was charged and found guilty of the crime ‘fomenting public mischief’ and assigned a four—month prison sentence, suspended for three years. Justice in this Union should work without fear or favour. We are all equal EU citizens. Having looked at reports of this case, I believe there’s a serious miscarriage of justice, or there’s evidence of that, which will do damage to the ongoing reputation of Cyprus. While I welcome the reality of a suspended sentence and the safe return of the young woman in question, I will be raising this issue with my Cypriot colleagues. It is my hope that her name will be cleared on appeal.

The ageing population, the exodus of young people and the low birthplace of rural areas are common characteristics of this phenomenon, but not the only ones. The point is that there is a growing imbalance between depopulated areas and urban areas. That is why I would like to recall here the responsibility of the European institutions to prevent these inequalities and to ensure that all citizens have access to basic services and opportunities, regardless of where they live. To date, CAP funds, ERDF funds and the European Social Fund have financed certain specific activities aimed at curbing depopulation, but we now need to prioritize strategies, measures fully studied and financed and in line with the new needs and realities of 21st century society. For example, the promotion of new technologies and digitization in the rural environment through high-capacity networks, or also to bet on sustainable growth and development models and the stimulus and incentives to fix population. In short, what I want to ask is agility, commitment and that, once and for all, we are already working to implement all these measures by virtue of the commitments we have all made to the demographic phenomenon and challenge.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 259, "date": "2020-01-13.json", "name": "Sunčana Glavak (PPE).", "mepid": "202036", "text": "   – Dear Chairman, perhaps to what my colleague said before me, only a strong Europe can adequately respond to the challenges of the modern world, and that is why the four priorities of the Croatian Presidency, which we will hear more about tomorrow morning, and we have almost stepped into tomorrow, can be summed up in a strong Europe in a world of challenges.  I am sure that we all want a Europe that is evolving, with a clear emphasis that smaller and larger, both rich and poor have equal opportunities, a Europe that connects with the full potential of all its capacities.
