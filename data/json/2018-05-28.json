A memory full of gratitude and gratitude. First elected in 1984, she was an eminent member of our Assembly for twenty-three years, with a two-year break during which she served as a minister in France. During these many years, it has gained deep knowledge of Parliament and the political and institutional environment of the Union and has worked tirelessly to strengthen our institution. As Vice-President for Conciliation, she worked passionately to consolidate the codecision procedure and strengthen the role of Parliament. We owe him a lot. On 20 July 1999, twenty years after another woman, Simone Veil, she was elected President of our Assembly. “In varietate concordia”, United in diversity. This motto, which was his and became ours, was adopted eighteen years ago during his presidency. I refer to this page of our history because beyond the symbol, there is the strength of a commitment. This motto expresses all thought and represents the guiding thread of its political action. Of course, we are different, but our diversity enriches us. They are only the declination of a common European culture, three thousand years old. Yes, sometimes we have different interests, but we share the same fundamental values: united, we could defend them and make them thrive on the world stage. That was Nicole Fontaine's state of mind when she signed, on behalf of Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights eighteen years ago. It was convinced that it is up to our Assembly to carry our values all over the world, especially in areas where democracy is flouted or struggling to assert itself. From this perspective, she had a special look at Africa. We are the only region in the world where the death penalty is no longer applied. It is to us that the world turns when journalists are imprisoned, when women are subjected to violence and their rights violated, when political opponents are threatened or deprived of their liberty. We have an obligation to remain a benchmark, a beacon for fundamental rights. That was Nicole Fontaine's conviction. During his election as President of this House in 1999, Nicole Fontaine also affirmed the need for greater proximity to European citizens. I want to pay tribute to his incessant work, which is expressed both in his numerous works and by his regular and intense presence on the ground, as close as possible to the citizens. During her presidency, she will go to all walks of life to give more than 100 lectures and interventions. This presence, this proximity to the people, which were vital to Nicole Fontaine, was accompanied by an extraordinary ability to listen and persuade that was decisive in many respects, especially at the historic time of the adoption of the single currency, when the euro aroused very strong apprehensions among Europeans. I would also like to recall the Fontaine report, with which it was decided to grant financial aid for twinning between European cities. A small concrete gesture that has helped bring millions of European citizens closer together. This imperative of proximity is, today, more essential than ever. Nicole Fontaine was a courageous and farsighted president. While the madness of the Taliban ravaged Afghanistan, it invited Commander Massoud to the European Parliament, against everyone's opinion and despite the reluctance of Western Chanceries. A year earlier, the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council and the President of the Knesset were jointly received in our Chamber. This was a great time for our House. At the Nice Summit on 7 December 2000, she succeeded in convincing Tony Blair of the need to sign the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In her opening speech in 1999, she said: “There is an urgent need to restore meaning to the Union”. Things have hardly changed from this point of view. Now it is up to us to continue the work of our distinguished colleague who knew how to speak to people. It is up to us to awaken enthusiasm and to revive this sense of belonging to a great project that transcends us. On behalf of the European Parliament, I thank you, Madam President, dear Nicole, for what you have been, for the passion, courage and coherence that have marked your work at the service of citizens throughout your life. As you often said, to conclude a long-lasting meeting: “Everything is said. Thank you.” (Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, as the EPP, we are deeply saddened about the loss of Nicole Fontaine.

She was the EPP Group’s first woman to become President of the European Parliament, and she was such a strong woman. Just recently, Nicole Fontaine called upon us to relaunch Europe.

This is due to the entry into force of new data protection rules promoted by the European Parliament. I would like to thank all my colleagues who have worked on this important regulation, and in particular the rapporteur Jan Philipp Albrecht, who will shortly leave us to become a minister in Germany and whom I do our best wishes. The General Data Protection Regulation is the largest reform of privacy legislation since the birth of the Internet. It is a decisive step in ensuring that citizens use the Internet with serenity in Europe, but also in the rest of the world. With this regulation, we have demonstrated that we can set global standards on privacy and the European Union is leading the world for protecting citizens. From now on the companies and online platforms to which we entrust our data will have to make their intentions known when they use it. They will have to get our explicit consent, regardless of which country they operate in. No more tacit consent, shadow zones or shortcuts that allow rules to be circumvented. These rules will help prevent the recurrence of scandals, of data from millions of users used to influence election results. For example, any form of unauthorized use of data must be notified within 72 hours. Heavy penalties are expected for those who fail to comply with the new rules, up to 4% of total annual turnover. For web giants this could amount to fines of up to billions of dollars. The European Parliament has played a central role in setting cutting-edge privacy standards, but also in calling for online flatforms to be accountable to citizens Europeans. I am delighted that the world's large digital flatforms are committed to our rules. But our task is not over, our priority is to achieve true governance of the technological revolution by introducing a proper framework of rules. We must ensure the correct functioning of the digital market with clear responsibilities for online operators.

And the ones that are now being hit by the United States's exit from this agreement are precisely those who have set hope. We think it's important to talk now about agreoning what action we are taking to save the agreement, to do something here, and not to allow those in Iran to practically hang down — to hang again, it would not be the first time.

As you have just said, this is a statement by the Council and the Commission on excessive efforts against refugees and migrants, in the context of the Mafda case. To remind colleagues once again, Mafda is a two-year-old girl from the Kurdish part of Iraq who was recently shot in Belgium during a car chase. Although investigations are still ongoing, the prosecution has clarified that it is clear that the girl died through a bullet by the police and that no weapons were found in the pickup truck that was being pursued. I am, of course, aware that this is a question that needs to be resolved in Belgium. On the other hand, however, the handling of so-called “transmigrants” in particular also makes it clear that the issues go much further. For us, on the one hand, the question arises: how can a car be pursued for 70 kilometers to be shot at, even though it is clear that there are refugees in there who fear for their lives? Secondly, we are concerned with the question of how to deal with so-called 'transmigrants' in general. Ultimately, this is also a consequence of the Dublin Regulation — a majority here as Parliament we have voted in favour of reform. We need this debate once again to initiate this and to make it clear that it can have just such consequences if, in the end, clear conditions are not created here. And we point out that repressive asylum policy is strengthening gangs on smugglers benefiting from this despair, especially of course, refugees and migrants. Without legal and safe ways to apply for asylum, we will not live up to our responsibilities here in the European Parliament.

This was the last set of proposals under the Energy Union, and I am proud that we managed to deliver on this ambitious project well ahead of the end of the mandate. This should leave us enough time to negotiate the entire Energy Union into law and leave it as a significant legacy of this mandate. Miguel and Violeta will explain the Third Mobility Package in detail, but allow me to set the tone and the context. I am sure that, whichever constituency or political party you come from, you will appreciate the main objectives: road safety, clean mobility, inclusion and boosting of our industrial competitiveness. First, on safety. The number of fatalities on EU roads has been, unfortunately, still the same for some years already. It is simply too high. 26 000 fatalities per year or 70 fatalities per day is simply too many, and we know that today we can definitely save more lives, and it is our duty to do so. That is why we propose infrastructure improvements, and we will have new advanced safety features which will become obligatory in three years. These include automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and distraction recognition or technology facilitating the use of alcohol interlocks. This is also one of the reasons why we are paving the way for connected and automated driving. Of course, the advantages are numerous: serving to increase the inclusion of people who cannot drive or have no access to a car, boosting Europe’s competitive advantage and creating new, quality jobs. By 2025 we expect automated mobility to generate revenues of EUR 620 billion for the EU automotive industry and EUR 180 billion for our electronic sector. The majority of Europe’s population is in favour of trying driverless cars, but of course there are still legitimate concerns. Surely, a lot of work remains until we can rely on this technology. Significant investments will be needed to develop and deploy the key technologies and to create the necessary infrastructure support. That is why we need a joined-up EU strategy. From safety to connectivity. Let me move on to sustainability. Transport is responsible for almost a quarter of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions, and this share is growing, as opposed to other sectors. That is why, for the first time, the EU is proposing CO2 standards for new heavy-duty vehicles. Other major economies like the US, Canada, Japan and China already have them, so it’s about time we caught up. Our proposals for 2025 and 2030 are both realistic and ambitious, and they incentivise the trade users to catch the low-hanging fruit of existing solutions, but they also leave enough time for new technologies to be developed. This brings me to the strategic action plan on batteries. I think by now we all realise that battery production is a strategic imperative, and we have to move fast in this global race. It has huge potential for investment and jobs – we are talking about EUR 250 billion per year as of 2025. With this Action Plan we put forward a robust set of measures, for example ensuring access to critical raw materials and limiting their use; stepping-up EU research and innovation to better link it with industry’s future needs; establishing robust regulatory requirements for safe and sustainable battery production to comply when placed on EU markets; developing the skills we need in Europe to deploy the next generation of high-performing, sustainable battery technology. As you might know, we are already working with Member States, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and industrial consortia to support large-scale manufacturing projects in Europe as a part of the EU battery alliance, and I would like to thank the honourable Members of this House for setting up the ‘Friends of Batteries’ group, because I am sure in the future months and years it will have a lot to discuss. To conclude, I would like to underline that this is the last time a legislative package will be proposed under the Energy Union strategy. It is clear that the Energy Union and its transition to clean energy will have a strong, long-term positive impact on all of us and on the future of our mobility. Together, with my colleagues, we are looking forward to discussing with you this package in greater detail, and I hope we can accelerate the legislative adoption of the Energy Union files. We now rely on you to make sure that you transform these proposals into binding laws.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this is the first time ever a proposal has been made to set CO2 standards for heavy-duty vehicles. We need this new legislation for three key reasons. First, we need to tackle the growing emissions of this sector, which are set to increase by almost 10% by 2030. Second, we want to support transport operators and help them to reduce their fuel costs. Third, we want to keep Europe’s industrial leadership, as other key countries such as the United States, China and Japan have already regulated this sector. To address these challenges, we propose ambitious and realistic targets: a mandatory target of -15% for 2025 and an aspirational target of at least -30% for 2030 compared to 2019. The European Commission is convinced that the targets proposed strike the right balance. The 2025 target can be achieved with technologies which are already available on the market but are not yet widely deployed, even though their costs are low. Furthermore, an early review is foreseen in 2022 to set the 2030 target based on additional information on the new technologies needed to meet this target. The proposal will apply initially to the four most representative categories of vehicles, which are responsible for almost 10% of heavy-duty vehicle emissions. The review will also be the occasion to expand the scope of the proposal to all remaining categories of heavy-duty vehicles, including buses and coaches. The package also contains additional policy measures to help us meet these targets. Manufacturers will be able to put on the market more rounded and aerodynamic heavy-duty vehicles, reducing emissions and improving road safety. Tyre labelling will be improved and extended to heavy-duty vehicles generating significant annual fuel savings for consumers and transport operators. Besides the targets, the proposal includes an incentive system to speed up our transition to zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles. Today around 98% of our trucks rely on diesel. There are virtually no large zero-emission trucks on European roads, and few zero-emission buses in cities. We want to support these technologies and foster innovation by proposing an incentive scheme. This system of super credits will reward those manufacturers who will invest more in innovative technologies while preserving the environmental integrity of the CO2 targets. It also includes zero-emission buses, which are needed for cleaner air in cities. In conclusion, the key benefits of these proposals are that we will fight climate change and improve air quality; transport operators, mainly small and medium-sized enterprises, will save money at the pump – this proposal will help them save EUR 25 000 in fuel costs in the first five years of the use of a new truck; we will keep and create new jobs here in Europe; we will use and import less oil, and the proposal will in total save more than 200 million tonnes of oil up to 2040; and last but not least we will set the right conditions to invest and innovate here in Europe. I look forward to continuing our fruitful cooperation with the rapporteur Mr Turmes, the shadow rapporteurs and the whole Parliament, to ensure swift progress and the adoption of this proposal before the end of the mandate of this Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 27, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am really pleased to be here with colleagues to present to you yet another set of important mobility reforms, the third and final package of its kind by the Commission. As the Vice-President already highlighted, the objective of the Third Mobility Package is to let all Europeans benefit from safer traffic, less polluting vehicles and more advanced transport technologies, while simultaneously supporting EU industrial competences and competitiveness. Concretely, the package sets out measures to support the transition to mobility that is safe, clean, connected, automated and inclusive. Let me first say a couple of words on safety. Safety is always our top priority. I am a firm believer in Vision Zero, our ambition to reduce death and serious injuries on European roads to zero by 2050. We have made some progress lately: we recorded the lowest fatality rate ever last year, roughly a 2% decrease compared to 2016. But still, last year, 25 300 Europeans lost their lives on EU roads. All these lives lost are irreplaceable. And this comes with an enormous cost to society, emotional and financial. This is why the EU needs a fresh approach, and this is what we are delivering. With the Third Mobility Package, we set out principles for a new road safety framework for the next decade based on the so-called Safe System. This idea is to build a number of protective layers that protect all road users. It takes into account all factors: infrastructure, vehicle safety and design, and people’s behaviour. In this framework, we are setting new targets on the way to Vision Zero. Between 2020 and 2030 we want to cut the number of deaths and serious injuries by half. There is an action plan in which you can see all the measures that we are planning. The first two elements that are already part of the package are legislative proposals on infrastructure and vehicles. We are proposing to make a number of new vehicle safety technologies mandatory, and the Vice—President has already mentioned many of them so I will not repeat them. This will make sure that all road users will be able to benefit from the latest developments in technology. This will bring important benefits and pave the way to automated mobility. We are also proposing to improve the rules on infrastructure safety management, not only applying these rules to the roads of the TEN-T networks, which are already by far the safest ones – only 8% of fatalities happen on the core corridors – but also extending them to other main roads where 39% of all fatalities happen. This is the largest share of all, and that is why we are introducing network-wide risk mapping which will show us which EU roads are the safest and which ones are less so. But more importantly, that will set priorities for our future investments in infrastructure. Second, let me say a couple of words on autonomous mobility. With the Third Mobility Package we are proposing a strategy to make the EU an engaging global leader in autonomous mobility systems. Autonomous mobility holds the enormous promise of making transport safer, more accessible, inclusive and sustainable, and on cooperative, connected and automated mobility the Commission sets out a clear forward-looking and ambitious European agenda based on three core pillars. First, a legal framework that creates a single market for autonomous mobility covering road safety, cyber security, access to data and data protection. Second, financial support to establish a new partnership for a sector-wide approach towards research and development. And the third pillar is an in-depth assessment of the socio-economic and ethical aspects of autonomous mobility. We are also proposing to digitalise and simplify the communication from business to administration, and from administration to administration in freight transport. The regulation on electronic freight transport information will ensure the wide use and acceptance of electronic documents and information exchange among all players involved in cargo transport operation. For example, e-consignment notes will now follow the cargo from source to final destination regardless of the transport mode used. The potential for efficiency gains in all transport modes over 2018 to 2040 are estimated at EUR 20-27 billion. The regulation on the European Maritime Single Window environment will establish harmonised reporting interfaces, procedures and data formats for ships calling at EU ports. This will cut red tape and contribute to multimodal solutions even further. Very quickly, on clean mobility, it has been really well described already by my colleague Mr Arias Cañete, but let me add that to facilitate further CO2 reductions, the Commission also proposes to allow manufacturers to bring new heavy goods vehicles earlier onto the market with more rounded and aerodynamic-effect cabs and help reach the future CO2 standards for trucks. Such cabins will also be safer, give better visibility to drivers, as well as improved comfort. We also propose improved labelling for tyres. Last but not least, investments and infrastructure. Infrastructure is a vital tool for the deployment of clean, safe, digital and connected solutions in transport systems. To make sure we deliver the core trans-European transport network on time by 2030, the package proposes a regulation on streamlining measures for advancing the implementation of the trans-European transport core network, the so-called Smart TEN-T Regulation. It aims to simplify permit granting, cross-border public procurement and other procedures, with a view to delivering better administrative efficiency. Our initiative will significantly reduce delays as permits should be granted within three years and cut the related costs. I am also pleased to announce that the Commission’s proposals in the Mobility Package are accompanied by an additional EUR 450 million of CEF funds to support safe mobility and digitalisation across transport modes. The outcome of this CEF Transport call should be announced in the first quarter of 2019.

Every year, far too many cyclists and people die in road traffic precisely because of this lack of these technologies. With respect to the battery strategy, I believe that this is one of the best and the most far-reaching that has been presented in recent years. Thank you very much, Mr. Šefčovič, for this topic, also because you have taken into account the entire value chain from raw materials to recycling and focus on research and development. My question is: how can Parliament support you in this? Because it is still very general, and we do not yet have a specific timetable for action. Finally, on autonomous driving: Commissioner. Commissioner, too, the course has been set in the right direction.

I think that this needs to be said.  I especially appreciate that on the Third Mobility Package, we might be short on time, but still the emphasis is on safety. This is an element which is clearly new, an element where the Commission has made a real effort and which I think, in the past, has been left aside.  On emissions, I will leave the figures aside, but I do appreciate what Commissioner Cañete has said on the question of incentives. I think that without incentives, we will not manage. Another issue in this respect is that we could overemphasise just one source of energy, and that is electricity – not in the proposal, but in general. We know that we’ve got hydrogen, we’ve got a synthetic, and if we want to make a real change then we need to manage with those vehicles which are on the market, and this is not primarily about electricity.

You are right, we can have agreements on road safety and that will be a priority, but I would like to emphasize two main points. First on the issue of climate: the CO2 standard is too low for trucks. You say less 30% for 2030, when we all agreed at COP 21 — and you were there — on a minimum target of minus 40%. Moreover, according to the roadmap, trucks weighing less than 16 tonnes will not be affected, while the entire road sector must make efforts against global warming. Second point: Mrs Bulc, you are right on the issue of autonomous car. We can't see it arriving on our roads until there is no specific legislation. These vehicles need to be supervised from the experimentation, because they pose real questions, especially on cybersecurity, access to data and liability in the event of an accident. Their control cannot be entrusted to the current European system, very largely failing?? , who did not see the “dieselgate” coming.

I am pleased that the Commission is responding to the initiative from the European Parliament and is dedicated to the safety of our citizens. In 2017 alone, over 25 thousand people died on European roads and 135 thousand suffered severe injuries. The new age provides the possibility of new security features that should be affordable and save the lives of all Europeans. And in that sense, I hope that the Commission has prepared its proposals. Europe must also prepare for the future of autonomous vehicles and become a pioneer in this field. However, from the point of view of the Czech Republic, I greatly appreciate the initiative to simplify the procedure for granting authorisations for trans-European transport network projects.

In addition, the emphasis placed on railways ensures cleaner and safer transport of goods. We recognise that safety in transport in general is extremely important. Thousands of people are killed every year on European roads, but the measures taken must have a real impact and not just be obstacles that do nothing to citizens.

Even 92% of all accidents are due to human misconduct.

You said that Europe should indeed be the world leader in automated and connected transport. We have the chance to do so, that would be good for Europe. We have already tested this on subways, platooning, for example in the truck sector. This is more environmentally friendly, it is safer — especially when it comes to the dead, for example — it is more efficient. It would also be good for people with reduced mobility. It would also be good for rural areas, which is often forgotten, but it also has a chance. It is the last mile of the supply chain, probably very much changed in the future. The real problem is that we should approach this in a technology-open way, which is also better for emissions. Only electromobility, my colleague Pavel Telička said, is not the only beatifying one.

Now we must make sure that they are going to be accessible to every future car owner, because safety must not become a privilege of luxury-car owners. Secondly, while I fully agree that heavy-duty vehicles’ (HDV) CO2 emissions should be decreased, I must say that, if we really want to make a change, we must not focus only on tailpipe CO2 emissions. Instead we have to use a broader well-to-wheels analysis for tackling emissions.

Then we need a high-performance machine-building industry that can offer new models. We need research and innovation in the machine building industry and, last but not least, for sure, we need to support the potential of SMEs to enter this industry and be able to produce at European level and, why not, to be pioneers in alternative fuel cars.

First, meaningful electric mobility is contingent on the use of electricity from renewable sources. Electromobility, which uses electricity generated from fossil sources, only solves a local problem, at the cost of large efficiency losses caused during conversions and energy transmission. Secondly, if we want to talk about zero emissions, the entire production chain, the entire carbon footprint, including production, must be taken into account, not just the operation of the vehicle itself. Third, the wide use of renewable energy is impossible without its efficient, technically advanced storage. We need to support European innovators, reduce the leakage of new technologies to third countries and develop the entire battery production chain. In this context, I thank Vice-President Šefčovič for taking an active approach to this issue and I welcome the EU Battery Alliance initiative of the European Commission.

It is high time that you no longer kneel before the interests of the car industry, which has been lying to European consumers for decades.

Following the intervention of Ms Dalli regarding the achievement of our target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared with 1990 by 2030, let me start with some clarifications and explain how the transport sector will contribute. For sure, the Commission is putting forward a different set of proposals in order to achieve those targets, but in the new Effort Sharing Regulation, we set out binding national greenhouse gas emission targets for the period 2021-2030 for Member States. These targets cover all the sectors of the economy that fall outside the scope of the European Union Emissions Trading System, including road transport. No sectoral targets are set under the Effort Sharing regulation. Nevertheless, the analytical work underpinning the Effort Sharing Regulation proposals shows the cost—effectiveness of a European Union-wide emission reduction of 25% compared with 2005 for road transport by 2030. Under the baseline, emission reductions are around 70%, so there is an eight percentage point difference.  With our 2017 proposals for post-2020 emissions standards for cars and vans, this difference gets significantly smaller – it shrinks to four percentage points, and the gap could be progressively closed by one percentage point with the implementation of the proposed CO2 standards for lorries, which have to reduce their emissions by 30% compared with 2019 by 2030. The remaining gap will be addressed through other additional policies with impact on road transport greenhouse gas emissions. These concern, for example, the minimum share of renewable fuels in transport, which is proposed by the Commission in the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive as well as the proposals for the Eurovignette, Clean Vehicles and Combined Transport Directives.  With all this legislation, we will make sure that transport also contributes to achieving our 40% minimum reduced emissions target by 2030. To conclude, let me stress that the Commission has tabled ambitious and realistic proposals which we think strike the right balance between environmental, consumer and employment objectives. That is why the Commission would like to call on our colleagues later and all the stakeholders to work closely together to ensure the swift adoption and implementation of the proposal for CO2 emissions standards for lorries – so that the benefits for European Union industry, businesses and citizens can be maximised and generated as soon as possible.

Tomorrow, Parliament will vote on the trilogue to the multiannual plan for the North Sea. We were pretty fast with four trilogues. This does not mean, however, that the negotiations were easy. We had to make some compromises and compromises on the EP position agreed last year. And yes: compromises can hurt. Nonetheless, this second multiannual plan under the Baltic Sea Management Plan is a very important step at the right time. As we all know, the North Sea stretches between Britain and mainland Europe. A multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and for the fisheries exploiting these stocks should be automatically linked to or seen against Brexit itself and its various stages of negotiations. As rapporteur, it was important to me to lay down a management basis for the relevant Brexit negotiations. A basis that was only possible and made possible through compromises, both between the political groups here in the House and between the Council and the European Parliament. As far as relations with third countries are concerned, we have now enshrined in the plan that the objectives of the common fisheries policy should be primacy for agreements on jointly exploited stocks. This is where the stocks that are shared with Norway, but soon also those fished with the UK. What I currently know about the position of the British on their envisaged future fisheries policy, the UK would like to adhere to the MSY principle and to areas of value based on international and scientific advice. There too, discard practices should be a thing of the past. Much now depends on the development of future fisheries cooperation between the UK and the European Union. I would like to see a lasting solution for quota distribution and access rights for sustainable management. Returning to compromises, fisheries fishing for demersal fish stocks are so-called mixed fisheries in the North Sea. I have to say here that a lot of new mixed in the negotiations — I must even say: mixed up. Ultimately, as in the Baltic Sea Plan, we included the so-called MSY Fupper ceiling. For some, this is a really red cloth, a red line that has been crossed. Environmental NGOs have therefore also called for voting against this trilogue result. Two groups have tabled amendments to this effect. I shall vote against these amendments tomorrow. Yes, we had something different in the EP report in July 2017, and yes, I would be able to live better with a different result in this regard. But there are majorities, and these majorities, including the Commission and the Council, have been strong supporters of these ceilings. The risk of no North Sea management plan was very high. I could not be responsible for this to either the fish or the fishermen. In this context, the Commission and the Council have repeatedly used the argument of so-called limited species. The integration of “MSY Fupper” would be essential to cushion effects for limited types. This argument haunted my mind in committee the other day when I heard during the landing obligation and limited species workshop that limited situations have not de facto occurred yet. I also have a clear answer to the impact of various instruments from the CFP toolbox, such as selective measures, interspecies flexibility and so on. However, back to the objectives of a multiannual plan under the basic Regulation. These will be based on scientific, technical and economic advice. Neither the Council nor the Commission should accept a definition of best available scientific advice in the available part. Why was a definition so important to Parliament? Here too, as is so often the case, we are talking about quotas, in particular how they are negotiated. The incentive for the Council seems great to use the ceilings. There are three conditions for this — three conditions that we use when at all, only on the basis of the best available scientific advice. A clear reference or understanding of the expert reports to be used is also essential in view of the fact that we only envision the principle instead of defined numbers in the value ranges. The value ranges can be adjusted regularly to the best available scientific advice. In plain language, this is due to ICES opinions. We also had to reach a compromise on the by-catch, as the notorious limited situations also played a decisive role in this issue. What else is in the plan: recreational fishing. For reasons of control, the Council has long been reluctant here. The relevant section of the plan provides that, in the event of a significant impact of recreational fishing on fishing mortality, the Council may take recreational fishing into account in terms of fishing opportunities and limit its fishing opportunities. Well, there's a lot of good in the plan. Against the background of the Brexit negotiations, I consider rejecting the plan to be the absolutely wrong signal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 62, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like first and foremost to thank the rapporteur, Ulrike Rodust, and also to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their dedicated work.

I also want to thank the rapporteur for ensuring a timely adaptation ahead of the full implementation of the landing obligation. We have used the Baltic Sea plan as the blueprint for the North Sea plan, but where improvements were necessary, the co-legislators wisely agreed to find new approaches. For example, by introducing flexibility through the concept of ranges, which allows us to quickly adapt, following the most up-to-date scientific advice to the benefit of stake-holders and also to the benefit of sustainable stocks. The North Sea plan is very important, as it provides for reaching MSY for the demersal fisheries in the sea basin, and it also paves the way for the next multiannual plans yet to come. Let me highlight that the landing obligation enters fully into force in less than one year, and we are all aware of the challenges it entails for our fishing industry. The North Sea plan contains a range of tools to help towards this transition, and I would like to call on all Member States to use the flexibilities which exist in order to ensure smooth implementation. We need to ensure that fishermen have the tools to sustain sustainable fishing practices; for example, by adapting their gears so that they can alleviate choke situations in mixed demersal fisheries in a way that is in line with the CFP objectives.

It is important that we approve the multiannual plan and put it into action, despite acknowledging that it has come out of the diminished trialogue of some provisions adopted in the European Parliament at the time it was adopted.

Another is the lack of emphasis on the recovery of the springs of ancillary species, thus concentrating this concern in the target species only.

Our objective within the EU is for our fishing stocks to be restored and preserved above levels that ensure maximum sustainable returns. It's an excellent target for it would mean more fish-rich stocks, well above today's levels. Our oceans are the lungs of our earth and we need them to manage for future generations. More fish in the sea also leads to more profitable fishing. It will be easier to catch the fish, we spend less time and fuel and that way we make more money. We are disappointed with how the Commission formulated its question for stock estimation to the marine research council ICES. ICES advice allows us to fish more intensively than is stipulated in the basic regulation. The North Sea Plan permits it, and thus violates the basic regulation. Parliament long tried to hold against the Council of Ministers in the negotiations on this particular point, in both the Baltic Sea Plan and the North Sea Plan, but failed.

There are many species fished. We can mention, for example, cod, black place, whiting, sole, flounder or langoustine. And it is this variety of species that makes the North Sea a mixed fishery, that is, a fishery where several species are captured at the same time. Paradoxically, this poses a challenge for fishermen, who are confronted with so-called “limiting quotas”. This technical term refers to a practical problem. Each time a vessel raises its fishing gear, its catch consists of a mixture of different species. In principle, fishermen must cease their season as soon as a single quota applicable to a species is exhausted, especially since the landing obligation prohibits them from rejecting any catch exceeding the quota. That is why this plan, despite its imperfections, technicality and constraints, is ultimately a lesser harm for fishermen. It limits the impact of limiting quotas by easing the management of by-catch, in particular by allowing, to some extent, discards at sea, but also by allowing the exchange of fishing opportunities between Member States and with third countries. Finally, of course, this plan is multiannual in nature, which should give fishermen more stability and visibility.

All this conditions the income of our fishermen and causes fishing communities to face difficult situations. This report analyses the key points for optimizing the value chain of fishery products in the European Union, that is, to identify what can be improved so that local processors and fishermen retain most of the value generated. Among the proposals, some of them should be noted. The important role played by producer organisations in this sector should therefore be noted. It is necessary to facilitate the creation of producer organisations, eliminate bureaucratic barriers and provide them with greater empowerment, facilitating access to financial aid. An essential element is that the value chain be included within the production and marketing plans of producer organisations, with the aim of adapting supply to demand, ensuring equitable income for fishermen and that European consumers find products that meet their needs. Another key issue is that the labelling system be reviewed in an aspect that I will mention to you. For example, the FAO zoning that is included in that labeling. This zoning was created over seventy years ago with the aim of reporting catches, but it is not intended or designed to guide the consumer. Therefore, it does not point and abounds in the information. On the other hand, there is a need to establish mechanisms to improve the sales price, in order to benefit fishermen, increase remuneration for their work, and promote fair and adequate distribution of value added throughout the sector's value chain. The Union's fisheries sector needs inter-branch organisations, which is an essential instrument for strengthening producer organisations and providing them with greater bargaining power. Another claim we want to make from this Parliament, and which Parliament has always been making, is that, as envisaged in Community legislation, real preferential access to fishing opportunities for small-scale and artisanal vessels in the European Union is being given real preferential access to fishing opportunities for small-scale and artisanal vessels in the European Union, something that the Member States do not do. A scourge that fisheries professionals today have, and especially important for young people, is that they currently do not have access to training programmes, and therefore the needs of the sector cannot be met. We also call for the inclusion of the gender approach across all Union policies, and in this case, specifically in the common fisheries policy. It is essential that the important role of women in the Union's fisheries sector be visualized and their position strengthened in this way. In addition, there is a need to improve and coordinate, at EU level, the fight against unfair trade practices. I take this opportunity to denounce, also from here, the cut in funds for the new financial framework that this sector is going to suffer in the Union. This is a very small fund — for which a cut of EUR 260 million is envisaged in the proposal for the financial framework — and which I hope Commissioner Vella will defend before the rest of the College of Commissioners.

Fish is one of the most widely traded raw materials globally, and the EU represents the largest and most lucrative fish market in the world. In 2016 we imported 8.8 million tonnes of fish and aquaculture products, comparing with EU production of 6.2 million tonnes. Our dependence on imports is high as 60% of the fish we eat are fished outside Union waters. The EU's great need for fish and aquaculture products has a clear impact on trade policy within the EU. EU fishing fleets are governed by a complex regulatory framework; the common fisheries policy with the related control regulation. In addition, EU vessels must also respect a range of other regulations such as labour standards, training requirements, ship safety, environmental legislation, taxation rules and sanitary requirements. All this is so that we as consumers can feel confident about the quality of seafood, but also that fish have been caught in a way that respects our labour laws, environmental standards and other rules that are standard within the EU. But in the fish counter, there are also products that have a different origin, the imported products. It applies to both fresh and frozen fish but also processed products such as fish sticks, fish grains or imported seafood and squid. For several of these products, the requirements for production are lower, allowing them to compete with a lower price than fish caught within the EU can. We create a market imbalance that in many cases disadvantages EU-caught fish, which is drawn with higher costs to meet all requirements and standards. Much of the fish imported comes from countries that fish responsibly, but still the industry is drawn with major problems with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and in some cases it involves products based on pure slave activities in the fishing industry. In the light of the fact that more than 30% of the world's fish stocks are overfished and almost 60% are fished on the verge of what is sustainable, it is reasonable that we review the requirements we must impose on the fish that will access the EU market through imports. This report has made a review of the requirements imposed on imports today and comes up with proposals to fill the gap in the regulatory framework we have drawn attention to. I would like to be sure to thank all colleagues who have taken part and tabled amendments to improve the report. The requirements imposed by the EU on imported fish are mainly that it must be legally caught — and we are trying to ensure that through our IUU regulation — and that the fish meet sanitary requirements. As regards timber, the EU requires traceability and that operators in the sales chain should be able to ensure, as far as possible, that the product is legally harvested, known as due diligence. The same system is to be introduced for conflict metals. The Commission should examine whether fishing could also benefit from similar requirements for due diligence to discourage illegal fishing and to allow EU consumers to feel safe that the fish they buy is legally and sustainably fished. Consumer information needs to get better. Today, there are no requirements for processed, canned or processed products. For example, it should be mandatory to specify the flag state of the vessel that caught the fish. As far as labour standards are concerned, many Member States still need to do homework and urgently ensure ratification and introduce different conventions that apply to fishermen. It is important that the Commission continues to pressure other states to implement measures that prevent illegally caught fish from entering their markets. As the largest market for fish in the world, the EU can make demands, and that is how we raise standards for fish management globally. We have come up with a series of proposals and improvements in this report, but I have no time to go through all of them now. There is an incredible amount to be picked up here and I sincerely hope that the Commission uses this report and takes them further.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 84, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, in this joint debate let me follow your order. I would like first to thank MEP Aguilera Garcia, the rapporteur on optimisation of the value chain in the European Union fishing sector, and the Committee on Fisheries for their report on this very important issue. I fully concur with many of the points made in the report, and I would highlight three main areas where we have to continue working in order to deliver efficient value chains that allow fishermen to share the opportunities of our internal market. These three points are: first, strengthening the structuring of our sector; second, providing fishermen with adequate tools to operate in the market; and third, ensuring an adequate legal framework. First point: strengthening the structuring of the sector. I share your opinion that producer organisations and inter-branch organisations, by increasing the bargaining power of fishermen, can help them to take the most from the fishery value chains. I believe the common market regulation has already simplified procedures for the recognition of such organisations and reduced the administrative burden significantly. First, the minimum representativeness criteria for producer organisations are no longer set at EU level but at national level, which allows Member States to take into account local specificities. Second, the production and marketing plans as provided under the common market regulations give full flexibility to the producer organisations concerning the tools available to improve their management and marketing activities. Support to these plans is provided under the EMFF. Thirdly, we are also aware that more cross-border cooperation is needed, since we have an EU single market. Therefore we welcome the European Parliament’s request to carry out a pilot project to promote transnational cooperation among professional organisations. The second point: providing fishermen with adequate tools to operate in the market. I believe we should provide fishermen with the tools which allow them to choose what is best for them – but we should not make that choice for them by imposing measures. Production and marketing plans are the most flexible tool we can give to producer organisations to design better sales strategies that increase the profits of their members. I believe the flexibility of these plans should stay as it is, precisely given the complexity and variety of value chains across the EU. I recognise that the issue of market transparency is a critical one if we are to empower small-scale fishermen to exploit the value chains. The Commission has been producing a lot of information through its market observatory for fishery and aquaculture products. But here again, we can do more. Let me also recall that we will begin in a few days to survey EU consumer habits regarding fish products. This will allow us to detect trends in demand. And we are also planning to provide analysis on online sales strengths. Funding is also an important element. The current EMFF provides a wide array of measures to small scale fisheries to become more competitive – especially to young fishermen – and I think we should build on these positive elements. The recent proposal for the next MFF confirms this trend in terms of simplification, and I think this is a positive development for both Member States and the sector. The third point, which is the legal framework: as regards the need to ensure the adequacy of the existing legal framework, we have recently launched an evaluation of the marketing standards that apply to fishery products to see whether they can ensure fair competition in the EU market to improve the profitability of production, and whether they can deliver a level playing field with imported products. We have also started to collect evidence on the labelling of fish products and in particular on the provision of information on the origin of the fish, which is an essential element for consumers to adequately value local products. However, I do not think that the Commission should create a specific logo for small-scale fisheries. Consumer demands varies significantly across the EU, and the relevance of such logos must be measured against the market that operators target. I also do not think that we should take a more interventionist approach and impose caps on the profits that operators in the supply chain make. If these profits are the result of effective marketing activities, the operators should be rewarded for their work. If the profits derive from unfair behaviour, action is needed, and this is precisely why fishery and aquaculture products are covered by the recent Commission proposal on unfair trading practices in the food supply chain. I believe the EU internal market offers great opportunities to fishermen. We all share the obligation to support our fishermen in making full use of these opportunities and to ensure that the conditions in which they operate are fair. The EU is the largest market for fisheries products in the world, absorbing a quarter of all imports, and that brings me to the report of MEP Engström. I would like to thank MEP Engström for the report, which touches upon a variety of important issues across different policies such as fisheries, trade, food safety and labour standards. The points addressed in your report are of great relevance today, as the EU depends on imports for almost 60% of the total consumed fisheries and aquaculture products. Plus there is a high number of non-EU vessels authorised to export fishery products directly to the EU. Let me briefly share with you where we already concentrate our efforts to regulate imports and to ensure that imported fish products meet high standards. The fisheries control system and our policy to fight illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing play a key role in this regard. The introduction of the current control system clearly improved the control of fisheries and compliance with the CFP, but more efforts by Member States are necessary to ensure full compliance. As you know, we are finalising the revision of the control system to improve the current rules, including in areas highlighted in this report, such as the sanctioning and enforcement system and traceability rules, as well as better use of new technologies, including for small-scale vessels. We will adopt this proposal still this week. The Commission is also working on the development of an EU-wide database for the management of IUU catch to support Member States’ risk-based controls. This should lead to a reduction in the opportunities for fraudulent imports, and it should ease the administrative burden for Member States in terms of verifications. One of the purposes of this system is to ensure that illegally-caught fish does not enter the EU market, neither at the first port of entry nor at any other port of entry subsequently. As regards marketing standards, I take note that your report calls for an improvement in the labelling of fishery and aquaculture products, including those prepared and canned products that today are excluded from the obligation of informing consumers about where they come from. On sanitary requirements, your report acknowledges that the system and the procedures for inspecting and authorising the placing of fish onto the EU market generally functions well. The EU system has indeed been very successful in granting a high level of consumer protection for almost 30 years. Only third countries demonstrating that the legislation on fishery products and their control system are equivalent to the EU are allowed to export to the EU. The EU verifies the application of the EU rules in third countries via audits that are regularly carried out in the exporting countries with respect to hygiene requirements for vessels and establishments, but also their enforcement. Controls at the EU borders are very strict for all imported commodities and especially for food of animal origin. The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed informs all Member States and third countries as regards non-conformities found at the moment of import or on the market and allows them to take the appropriate actions. And finally, as regards labour standards, the Commission attaches high importance to the social dimension of the CFP, in particular to ensuring fair and safe working conditions in the fishing sector. The Commission welcomes the references in the report, reminding Member States of the need to ratify international conventions related to safety and working conditions and to promote ratification internationally, as well as to cooperate actively with other Commission services and with the social partners, notably in the context of the social dialogue. I have raised this very issue with Member States at the Fisheries Council in March, and I have written, together with Commissioner Bulc, to all ministers responsible for transport and for fisheries. However, so far only one Member State has actually set the ratifications as a priority for early 2019. This lack of response and of interest gives the impression that ensuring fair and safe working conditions in the fishing sector is not a priority for Member States, and this is very disappointing. I am therefore extremely grateful for the European Parliament’s support in this respect, but also for the strong support shown by stakeholders during the high-level discussions organised by the Commission at the recent Seafood Expo in Brussels where, together with key players, we managed to increase international awareness on the issue of labour standards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 85, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Francisco José Millán Mon", "mepid": "28400", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (ES) Mr President, first of all, thank the rapporteur, Mrs Engström, for her efforts as rapporteur.

This is how we protect our consumers while preventing our fleet from perceiving unequal or discriminatory treatment. That is why we need to homogenise controls throughout the European Union we will see what proposal you are making next week, Commissioner; what cannot happen is that products that are rejected at the border of one Member country are then admitted in another. In this vein of supporting our fisheries and processing industry, free trade agreements with some countries, especially Asia, have to treat our fishery products as sensitive, and not be swept away by Asian competition. The Commissioner for Trade in these negotiations must be in close contact and coordination with you, Commissioner, and I am pleased that these two aspects are reflected in the report we will be voting on Wednesday. Finally, I would like to call for support for the amendment I tabled with my group, which wants to put into value the products of the EU fleet which, as you know, meet high standards.

Only in this way can market access converge and become fairer and remain cohesion in the value chain.

The establishment of producer organisations should be promoted, the only way in the world to give fishermen greater negotiating power.

We have very positive examples from across the EU of producer organisations bringing together small-scale fishermen which have succeeded in increasing their members’ profits. These experiences can be replicated throughout the EU, and we will continue to work in this direction. Giving fishermen the tools to understand the market in which they are operating is also crucial, but value chains across the EU are so varied and complex that an optimal exploitation of the opportunities can only be made by focusing on the specific characteristics of each chain and each destination market. Funding to support small-scale fishermen is there and it allows them to promote their products and to improve their position in the value chains. Funding is extremely important to promote innovation, skills and community-led local development. In terms of value and profit for the fishermen, I would highlight one key aspect which I found could be more present in your discussions. What benefits fishermen most of all is the state of the stocks upon which their livelihood depends. In order to build healthy stocks we need to have responsible fisheries, and all segments of the fleet should contribute towards that effort. One of our key responsibilities remains to ensure that the context in which fishermen operate remains a fair and a transparent one. I have enumerated actions we have already taken or are starting at present, but we have to perform continuously. Let me highlight that with regard to the conformity of fisheries products entering the EU market, the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) remains one of our top priorities. We will continue to support third countries to take actions to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing and to encourage other states to apply measures to prevent IUU-caught fishery products from entering their markets. Speaking of the coordination between trade and fisheries policy, your report suggests that the EU approach to trade is frequently perceived as being counter-productive to good fisheries governance in the EU, as it opens up the EU market to fish products from countries which do not necessarily have the same standards as the EU. The EU’s recent free trade agreements include provisions on sustainable fishing, and this in itself is already a great step forward. But we will continue to work to strengthen our trade partnerships by including legally binding provisions on sustainability. Those trade partners which are granted favourable access to the EU market and which are commercial fishing nations and interested in access to the EU market will have to be committed to the requirements of the EU’s IUU regulation. However, let me be clear that IUU and free trade agreements are two independent instruments, and that any decision within the IUU dialog will be taken regardless of the situation of trade negotiations. As regards the origin of products, we are analysing what information would help consumers most to make informed choices. We will feed this analysis into the evaluation of the common market regulation which will be part of the future evaluation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The EU market is extremely dependent on imports since our demand significantly outweighs our production. Therefore our objective will always be to strike a fine balance between the requirements we set for the importing of products and the need to ensure the availability of supplies at reasonable prices for consumers. Finally, let me welcome very much the references in the report reminding Member States of the need to ratify international conventions related, as I said in my previous speech, to safety and working conditions and also to promote ratification internationally, as well as to cooperate actively with other Commission services and with the social partners, notably in the context of the social dialogue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 94, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Clara Eugenia Aguilera García", "mepid": "125045", "text": " rapporteur. Mr President, I would like to mention Mrs Engström's report in this last speech. I think that a great job has been done on this report. Just highlight a small mention: this report clearly aims to draw attention to the fact that in the European Union the same rules must be and must be required for all products marketed in its territory. This seems like a no-brainer, but it is a fact that is not occurring. All fishery products in the European Union should be required to meet the same level of requirements in relation to management and conservation measures, as well as hygiene standards and working conditions. This will help create a fairer market and increase rules for the exploitation of marine resources in third countries. That is why it seems to me a very good report and I will support it tomorrow in the vote. Finally, Commissioner, I would like to say that strengthening producer organisations is undoubtedly a substantial element. I would have liked him to have said that we are going to have the EUR 260 million which we have been subtracted in the proposal for a financial framework for the sector, because I think that, with such a small fund, no cuts should be made. You mentioned it, but you said that the financial framework has to evolve. Yes, evolution, yes; cut, no. I would also like to say that I think there is a more risky bet on the issue of labelling. I mentioned FAO areas: they are made for something else, not for clarity to consumers; I think that does not contribute to clarity. It will therefore have to be worked on in the future, but also in the labelling of processed fishery products there is a need to make some changes. Finally, I regret the news you have given us today, here, about the necessary ratification of international conventions on safety and labour standards. It is very regrettable that the Commission has addressed all Member States and only one has shown readiness to answer.

Thank you dear colleagues for all the encouragement, and thank you to Commissioner Vella, too, for your fine words. I hope that my report can give us a review of the challenges we face when it comes to fish products on the EU market and the double standards that still premium imported products produced under lower standards. It is important that EU consumers feel that they can rely on products on the EU market, that they keep good quality and that they are produced sustainably. The report contains many good ideas that the Commission can work further on to raise standards and quality imports of fishery products. It must not be that the lists of vessels approved for EU hygiene requirements become a backdoor into the EU market for smaller not-related vessels fishing illegally. The stamp from the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety indirectly becomes a signal to the EU customs authorities that everything is in order. Unfortunately, there are several such examples today, especially for ships fishing in the fish-rich West African waters. That is because the regional fisheries organisations of West Africa, Cecaf and SRFC, do not list which vessels are fishing illegally. Since the EU also does not list vessels fishing illegally in the region, fish caught by such vessels will not be denied access to the EU market if they are at the same time on the list of vessels that comply with hygiene requirements. Coordination needs to get better to stop these kinds of skewed conditions. It is also illogical that third countries warned by the EU of the risk of trade sanctions by the EU under the IUU regulation are simultaneously negotiating free trade agreements. This needs to be better coordinated within the EU, between the Commission's different entities, so that it becomes logical and sends a clear signal that the EU does not accept illegal fish on its market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by warmly thanking all the shadow rapporteurs who have helped me a great deal of work in the last few months. In a report, the Commissioner presented new ideas on the future of the CAP and presented the idea of a new delivery model. It called for a new relationship between the European Union and the Member States and the regions when it comes to the common agricultural policy. We do not completely exclude ourselves from such an idea. But I believe that the 'G' in CAP, that is to say the common one — the fact that the common agricultural policy must be a common policy — must continue to be preserved. We must also continue to guarantee the competence of the regions and countries in the field of agriculture. But let me move on to the first pillar of the CAP, that is to the area where the most money is spent in the common agricultural policy. I think we should just ask ourselves: what kind of agriculture do we actually want in Europe? And we should promote agriculture based on family farms, an agriculture that is sustainable, an agriculture that is also innovative, which characterises our cultural landscape, and also an agriculture that is attractive to young people who will be able to continue farming in Europe tomorrow. If we want such agriculture, then we need to think about a few things in the first pillar, then we need a fair distribution of funds between the Member States. And just can not necessarily mean that everyone gets the same amount, but the payments must be at least equivalent. We need a fairer distribution of funds in the Member States, especially where there is still a historic approach to the calculation of payment entitlements. We must ensure that the money is effectively received by farmers and not by those who have claims in their hands and thus create their return. We need coupled payments that do not distort competition. We have a lot to do here when we look at what is happening right now. And we also need — and not everyone likes this — clear degressivity, and we also need efficient capping. And efficient capping means that it must also work, so it's not just on paper, as it is today. We need a new green architecture. A new green architecture means that we need clear conditionality in the first pillar, that is to say clear environmental requirements, and that we need strong agri-environmental programmes in the second pillar. Green architecture, sustainability must not be reduced, but it must be more efficient and simpler. Two words on the second pillar: the second pillar is important, and we must clearly de-bureaucratise, streamline and make the second pillar simpler. In the second pillar, we need to create incentives for sustainable agriculture, that is to say, for real, good agri-environmental programmes, and we must also ensure that disadvantaged areas can play their role and get the funding they need from the second pillar. A few words on market policy: we still have common market regulations in a few sectors: wine and fruit and vegetables. We should continue to do so, and we should even consider whether, for example, we could extend the fruit and vegetable model to other sectors, such as the milk sector in mountain areas. Let me say two words about the financing of this whole policy: of course, this policy needs money, and what is currently on the table — the Commissioner's proposal — cannot be accepted from an agricultural point of view. First of all, it cannot be accepted that the second pillar is significantly shorter than the first pillar. I don't think this is innovative, and it's not promising for the future. Nor can farmers now pay the bill for Brexit. They will also be the ones that will suffer the most from Brexit if market distortions really occur. Overall, I think, we have already succeeded in providing a good template here. I hope, Commissioner, that you will then take our proposals into account in your legislative proposals, which we will receive in a few days' time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Herbert Dorfmann, for this report, which is the outcome of a very intensive debate that you have been having over the last number of months, pointing to the importance of the future of EU agriculture and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) as an enabling framework. I also want to complement Mr Dorfmann and all of the shadow rapporteurs and the membership of the Committee on Agriculture, and Rural Development (AGRI) for the efficiency with which they have gone about their work, culminating in what I hope will be a very strong endorsement of this report when you vote here on Wednesday. There is much that we could say in detailed response to the report, not least at this evening’s debate, which comes in the same week that the Commission, hopefully, is going to adopt and indeed publish the long-awaited legislative proposals on the future of the CAP. I do not want to pre-empt those proposals, which the Commission will publish; however, what I can say is that we have been following very carefully and listening very carefully to the views of the AGRI Committee, to the views of Mr Dorfmann and the shadow rapporteurs in the context of this report. We have met regularly and frequently. When you see the Commission’s proposals on publication, you will see very strong similarities between the content of this report and the recommendations contained in the proposals that will be published. The background against which all of us are operating is the budgetary one, which has been referred to by Mr Dorfmann. It is one in which one of the largest net contributors, the United Kingdom, is leaving the European Union. Against this reality, the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is set at a level of 1.11% of gross national income of the remaining EU27. The Commission, which cannot run a deficit – like any Member State – has to propose a budget in the context of this reality. We have proposed a budget of EUR 365 billion for the 2021-2027 CAP, which is a cut of less than 5%. The cut for direct payments is less than 4%. For rural development, the proposal is to rebalance EU and national support in the context of the co-financing rates. If Member States, of course, choose to increase their level of co-funding, there is no reason why public support to rural areas cannot be maintained at current levels. Alternatively, of course, if all Member States agree by unanimity to provide more finance to the European Union budget in various ways, then improvements to the agricultural funding can be made possible. A key feature of the Commission’s proposals and one I have flagged clearly in the communication which was published on the future of food and farming in November is the new delivery model, and I want to thank Mr Dorfmann and the shadow rapporteurs and the AGRI Committee for supporting this new initiative. It is a new relationship between the European Union and Member States. The motivation behind this delivery model is to take better account of EU diversity, to better target and simplify the support and to ensure performance-orientation and a result-oriented CAP. At European Union level we will maintain and define a strong and common framework to ensure the achievement of common objectives, and Member States will make the detailed choices and operational definitions, in line with their needs and integrated into a single and streamlined CAP strategic plan which will cover interventions in both pillars. An area of obvious common interest is our shared objective for a viable and resilient EU agriculture throughout Europe. Direct payments play a key role in this regard, and they must – and will – remain an essential part of the future common agricultural policy. We must also look at these payments through the lens of fairness and, in the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework, the Commission has made a number of important steps towards convergence between Member States. For all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU27 average, the gap between current level and 90% of that average will be closed by half over a six-year period. Without prejudice to the precise contents of the forthcoming proposals, they will offer various possibilities to better target support towards the needs of our small and medium-sized farmers. These are the foundation of European Union agriculture. These are our family farmers. As I think we can all agree, EU agriculture needs to better manage our natural resources, to limit our greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to climate change. We have to bolster environmental care and climate action and contribute to the environmental and climate objectives of the European Union, which are already agreed by this Parliament. The CAP will therefore have to reflect the higher levels of ambition and focus more on results, based on these objectives and the legislation that is already in force and the contribution that agriculture must make to these objectives. The current green architecture will be replaced by a new one that is based on the new delivery model, with environmental and climate objectives which will be set at European Union level, not at Member State level. In preparing their CAP strategic plans, Member States will take into account their local conditions and can devise a mixture of mandatory and voluntary measures in Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 that are appropriate to those conditions. There are a number of other areas identified in Mr Dorfmann’s report where the Commission and the European Parliament have similar views. Support for young farmers should continue and be improved. Attracting new farmers and facilitating generational renewal will be one of the main priorities of the CAP post-2020. We will have the opportunity for a further exchange on this important matter later on this evening with MEP Caputo. Innovation and knowledge-sharing is a key issue for the future CAP, with benefits in terms of competitiveness, sustainability and simplification. We will continue to support farmers in areas where agriculture is constrained by specific conditions, for example in mountain areas, and the new delivery model will enable Member States and regions to address these and other important issues in line with their needs within a strong and common European Union framework. The Commission will present its legal proposals for the CAP shortly and I will be meeting Parliament’s committee on 11 June to discuss these proposals in detail. In respect of the MFF, I can only urge you to make every possible effort to conclude your work within the current parliamentary mandate, though I am under no illusions about the challenge that such a timetable presents. However, what you would be doing in doing so is providing security and certainty for our stakeholders, famers and our people living in rural areas, particularly our young farmers. You can be assured, of course, of my constructive cooperation and that of my services in trying to make this a reality.

It is the European Parliament's duty to recall that this policy must remain a common policy, otherwise we will create distortions of competition within the single market itself. The CAP must have a harmonised environmental ambition at European level and thus help farmers wishing to go further in more environmentally friendly practices. We must promote double environmental and economic performance, and recognize the essential role of farmers: they are the first environmentalists.

It is important to establish a conditionality that there is public funds for public services. These things are right. I would like to say, however, that personally I also lacked the courage to go beyond these things. In concrete terms, payments without consideration should have been clearly denied. It should have been made clear that income support for farmers is actually a social benefit and is on a completely different paper. However, I would like to mention one more point from the point of view of the DEVE Group: the question was whether we should not include another chapter in order to highlight the specific responsibility of European agricultural policy in the field of development policy. And this does not happen, unfortunately. I very much regret this, because our agricultural policy has an impact on Africa, our agricultural policy with soya import has an impact on Brazil, our agricultural policy and our fisheries policy have an impact on whether or not there are refugal movements on the other side of the world.

We should also not forget the environment protection measures. Having regard to the aforesaid, in order to deliver the objectives of the common agricultural policy in the future, there are some important aspects which should be underlined. Firstly, provision of an adequate level of funding within the next MFF, thus ensuring sufficient resources for the sector. Secondly, simplification and modernisation of the CAP should be done while at the same time, the financial and performance control and audit functions should be performed to the same standard and under the same criteria across all Member States.

I am more concerned that bureaucracy will only be shifted from the European to the national level. But we will look into your proposals, and then we will continue to see how we deal with these proposals. The task of the common agricultural policy is to avoid distortions of competition and it is therefore necessary to balance payments not only between Member States but also in the Member States.

The CAP is first and foremost about supporting agricultural production. EU farmers proudly produce food to some of the highest standards globally and they must be able to continue to do so in the future. The sector has faced a number of challenges from all angles in recent times, such as volatility in domestic and international markets, climate and weather conditions, food supply chain issues and, of course, the decision taken by the people in the UK to leave the EU.  The next CAP needs to be able to give farmers the necessary tools to address these challenges so that they can support high-quality EU food production in order to keep EU farmers competitive in the international marketplace and to protect the rural economy from extreme volatility and market crises. Of course, there needs to be adequate funding and I believe – and I have made this point a number of times – the biggest challenge will be the budget, and I heard what the Commissioner had to say.

I wanted, first of all, to say, Commissioner, that solving the serious problems affecting rural and peasant farmers today at European Union level requires more than a distribution of aid: it requires political decisions; it requires a strong public agricultural policy. And in that regard, I would like to mention the major gaps in both the Communication you have tabled and the report we are discussing. The question of prices: prices are necessary to cover costs and production work; if not, we will not install anyone in rural areas. Secondly, the regulation of production is another fundamental element which cannot remain solely and exclusively on a matter of voluntariness. Thirdly: production model compatible with the environment, with water, air and soil conservation. And, as time is over, I did not want to end this speech without referring to another aspect forgotten in this Communication, which is the issue of equality between women and men in the countryside.

We are concerned about cuts, which today appear greater than originally announced. Again I want to reiterate that indiscriminate cuts will hurt the sector. Instead, focus is on savings and in measuring the results of the proposed actions. As for the transition to the so-called new delivery model, it is presented as a greater autonomy for the Member States, but it risks being a step backwards towards nationalizing the sector, where controlled and controller coincide, thus effectively going to further fragment the market and leaving room for national practices of unfair competition. We have the opportunity to draw an agricultural policy that is, yes, more environmentally friendly, but also that promotes a more sustainable model of food production and consumption, and above all profitable for everyone the actors of the supply chain. We must be ambitious, simplify procedures, reduce bureaucratic burdens, provide funds under a premium scheme, supporting those farmers whose activity really contributes to the good public. We reiterate the opportunity for a cap on direct payments, so as not to incentivise financial speculation and land concentration. We need to help small and medium-sized companies, and that is why aid should be modulated, to be really a help and not to drug the market for the big ones. Socio-economic circumstances should be taken into account in the allocation of funds between Member States. In fact, if the cost of living is different, the same amount granted as aid can have a very different concrete impact, and we do not want to generate further distortions in the single market.

When the European Union presented the 2014-2020 CAP, it welcomed, self-congratulated, and even sent a message of hope to the rural world: agriculture would be greener, more remunerating, more respectful of the territories. The CAP would even allow farmers to live with dignity from their profession and I'm going on... We are now at the sunset of the current CAP and on the next. Have all these pious vows been fulfilled? Ask the producers if their situation has improved. Ask grain farmers if they are happy to sell their grain below their cost of production. Ask the cattle, sheep and goat sectors if they welcome the free trade agreements. Ask the peasants. They are the users, so they will be the best and only justices of the peace in the common agricultural policy. On Wednesday, we will vote on Parliament's position on the future CAP. It is a fairly complete text that contains, again, many beautiful promises — and I would point out that they only commit those who believe in it.

I have read the report and I think, based on your report, I can tell you that we have a lot of common ground in relation to the proposals that will emerge. Your contributions from several committees this evening, other than Agriculture, shows the wide level of interest that there is in the common agricultural policy right across this House. The CAP is, as I've said many times, an economic, environmental and social policy and the legislative proposals that we are bringing forward must reflect that. The proposals will also reflect the principles that we have identified in the communication last November.  I agree with Mr Kelly, when he expresses his pride in our farmers, and I think everybody agrees that the key role of farmers in providing high quality food in a sustainable manner is crucial from the point of view of the policy that we are trying to improve. And since we published our communication, there have been some concerns expressed about the rise of renationalisation and these have been repeated by a few Members this evening. I want to reassure you that I'm confident that you will see in the proposals that will be adopted that there is no intention whatsoever to renationalise the CAP.  Our proposals would provide for genuine subsidiarity in the implementation of the policy, while also containing sufficient safeguards to ensure that the common nature of the policy will be maintained and farmers will not be put at a competitive disadvantage as a result of our proposals. The internal market and its integrity are essential to our agricultural policy and essential to our farmers, and that will remain the case. The budgetary situation has been mentioned by Mr Nicholson and others. It's a challenging one, based on the fact that we have 12 billion less from the fact that the United Kingdom is leaving. That is the present situation and I agree with Mr Nicholson, the end result of course nobody can predict at the moment, but we cannot predict as well whether we will have unanimity or not by the other Member States, the other 27, in relation to putting more money in various ways into the total EU budget.  So, it's a matter for the Council and the Parliament to negotiate. Madam Senra Rodríguez is right when she says that the CAP is about political decisions. I will be bringing shortly the Commission's responsibility in this regard and it will then be a matter for all of us to work together as co-legislators, particularly the Council and the Parliament, to take responsibility and we will be there to help in whatever way we can work closely with you to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  The issue of fairness and equity in payments is very important and it has been frequently raised, and one which we highlighted in the November communication, and we will be making proposals with regard to convergence. We will be making proposals in relation to capping and we will be making proposals in relation to small and medium-sized farmers. Also, we will be making proposals in relation to internal convergence.  Just to clarify issues for my friend Mr Eric Andrieu, but I don't know where you're getting your figures about 25% and 14%, you're talking to too many academics. But, anyway, the budget proposals that I have been involved in actually are generated on the same basis as the last occasion, which many people here were involved with. So, comparing like with like, I want to just reiterate that the proposal in the MFF for agriculture is less than 5% cut in direct payments and of course it is a cut in rural development, but the overall budget is less than 5% cut. So I don't know where you're getting these figures. But anyway, I'd be anxious to hear. The average cut in direct payments as I mentioned earlier is closer to 3% than actually 14% that you have mentioned and, with envelopes increasing from a number of Member States, the figures in relation to rural development can improve. These figures represent in the same way as was agreed seven years ago, and they'll stand up to any scrutiny.  The reduced level of EU co-financing of the second pillar can be compensated by Member States or by more contributions from Member States into the budget.  I want to assure my friend Professor De Castro that he doesn't have to worry about respecting any proposals or rejecting any proposals on renationalisation because there won't be any. There is no intention to make any such proposals and I hope there'll be no amendments put down in that respect either for to do the opposite. This will be explicitly clear in the Commission's proposals that I will publish. You don't need a straw man in order to push the haystack, we won't need to have to do that. Vice-President, the rapporteur’s report is a welcome and constructive contribution to the debate about the modernisation and simplification of the CAP and I look forward to presenting the Commission's proposals to the Parliament's Agriculture Committee, and when you do, and I am confident that you will see significant similarities, as I said already. Can I say to my friend Mr Marias, who is no longer here with us, from Greece, who was against free trade agreements in relation to agriculture, and I have just approved some promotion money for feta cheese, which is a very important product in Greece and which I regularly am asked by Mr Marias and others in Greece about how we can do to promote feta cheese internationally.

I have now heard many very coinciding speeches in this debate, and I do not really want to go into the content at all. The common agricultural policy is one of the oldest policy areas we have in the European Union. We have been pursuing a common policy for our farmers since 1962, and we should now simply develop this policy carefully and sensibly. We do not need a revolution, but we need a further development of this policy which is in line with the new circumstances. And we must not call this development into question — on the one hand, not through renationalisation, which I believe would only open the door to market distortion in Europe, nor through an austerity policy that ultimately eliminates this policy. Commissioner, you know as well as we do here that inflation should, of course, be taken into account for the fact that all occupational groups are also allowed to reduce the inflation of their income. You should also admit that to the farmers. And if you take that into account, then, unfortunately, the savings will be slightly higher than you have indicated here. But we will also be very clear about this with your colleague, the Commissioner for Budgets. In conclusion, I would simply like to thank the shadow rapporteurs once again, including those responsible for the opinions that have been made. I think it's just us now. We have really succeeded in finding a common position in this report on very important key points, and I hope that this common position will also survive the vote here in Parliament the day after tomorrow. And then, I think, it's up to us. We would, of course, be delighted, Commissioner, if this opinion were included in your proposal. But if not, then we are legislators here and we will also have to ensure that our opinions and our positions on various areas are then introduced and that Parliament will then process your proposals accordingly.

Generational renewal in the agricultural sector therefore needs incisive policy measures in the new CAP to promote generational change. In the text approved by a large majority in the AGRI committee, various policy recommendations have been made to improve the existing support scheme and to assist young farmers in access to agricultural activity. Access to land, as it is known, is the main obstacle preventing new agricultural entrepreneurs from starting agriculture businesses in Europe. Access to land is limited by poor land availability and of course also competition from other farmers and investors. The problem of access to land has been sharpened essentially as a consequence of the current structure of direct payments, which often leads to increases in land rent and purchase prices. Too many owners or renters tend to stay in business for as long as possible in order to continue to qualify for subsidies, using service providers to farm the land or working to a minimum the cultivated land they have. In my view, the levels of activity needed to allocate payments intended to support the achievement of certain targets should be increased, just as I think a ban on cumulation must be enforced not relevant to subsidies with the use of pension allowances. Member States must implement new measures to give new agricultural entrepreneurs and young farmers priority access to agricultural land by making full use of all instruments regulatory and also taking its cue from best practices already successfully implemented in some Member States. For example, tools such as rural banks could be envisaged, which could further facilitate access to land, but also provide a complete picture of land availability for young people farmers. Generational replacement with regulations, for example on succession and taxation, rules on access to land, territorial planning and corporate succession strategies should be facilitated. The current CAP does not provide incentives to foster the transfer of farms from older farmers to younger generations. It is a gap that needs to be filled, and it must be filled early, if we really want to incentivise young people. We can do this by introducing, for example, measures that can effectively motivate the elderly to transfer ownership of land, such as those on the early retirement scheme or other types of retirement incentives. With regard to the budget, it is vital to continue to provide support for the young farmers programme, but increasing the maximum level of national funding to more than 2% for payments compulsory first pillar, and increasing the percentage of support of the second pillar to encourage generational renewal. We recommend an improvement in measures to facilitate access to finance with facilitated interest rates on loans to new agricultural entrepreneurs, including by operators private financial instruments, implementing financial instruments to provide zero-rate loans for the investments of young farmers. Better cooperation is also needed with the EIB and the European Investment Fund, in order to promote the creation of ad hoc financial instruments dedicated to young farmers in all States members. An important point is simplification: the overall management of direct payments and measures of the rural development programme is considered extremely complex and difficult, in particular for new agricultural entrepreneurs who are not particularly familiar with the payment system, and therefore need a strong simplification of procedures and the reduction of time related to payment instructories. On training, the Commission and the Member States should be able to provide more opportunities for training and advice to young farmers, both potential and potential farmers confirmed, including competence for the start of business activities in agriculture and agricultural and technological skills related to new technologies and entrepreneurial, such as marketing, networking, communication, innovation, multifunctionality and diversification and skills finance. Innovation, finally, is one of the tools that can most contribute to improving generational replacement. Young farmers represent a great potential for innovation and diversification, given that they tend to have greater skills and managerial skills and to be more likely to access new markets, develop new production methods and make the best use of technological developments and innovations in the agricultural sector, able to enable them to respond to the environmental challenges of agriculture. It is therefore necessary to give strong support to young people who wish to introduce innovative production techniques and processes, such as precision agriculture and conservation systems, which are designed to improve the viability and environmental sustainability of the agricultural sector. Only by fielding these actions will young farmers be able to offer long-term prospects that can prevent the rural exodus. A strong support for young farmers is a sine qua non condition for securing the future of rural areas and should therefore be identified as the top priority in the framework of the new CAP for the period after the 2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 141, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Nicola Caputo and the shadows for this report. It comes at a very important time for European agriculture, not least for our young farmers. As you are aware, the Commission will adopt and publish its legislative proposals for the future of the CAP shortly, and I am very confident that you will see clear consistency between the recommendations that you have made, and the proposal that the Commission intends to bring forward in respect of young farmers. As Mr Caputo has pointed out, only 6% of European farmers are younger than 35 years, compared to 56% who are older than 55 years. Therefore, with an ageing agricultural community, generational renewal is increasingly important, and it needs to be accompanied by adapted policies. Currently, measures in Pillars one and two provide support to young farmers, notably the young farmer payment under Pillar one, which was introduced to provide an enhanced income support to newly-established young farmers during the initial setting-up period. In 2016, more than 300 000 newly set-up young farmers in the EU benefitted from this additional payment, which amounted to support of about EUR 360 million. The rural development policy also makes fundamental contributions to creating the best possible environment for young farmers. According to the targets that have been brought to the attention of the Commission by Member States and the rural development programmes, specific support for 176 000 young farmers will help a new generation of farmers to develop their businesses. So the Commission shares the views of the European Parliament that support for young farmers should continue and be improved. This is a position that I have consistently articulated over the last few years. This is why attracting new farmers and facilitating generational renewal will be an important objective of the CAP post 2020. Young farmers will benefit from a wide range of instruments, which will include a combination of mandatory and voluntary aspects. But the Commission will not be able to do this alone, and Member States will be requested to establish a generational renewal strategy and address key issues that your report has clearly highlighted, particularly those for which the Member States and not the European Union has competence. It will be important to describe how national instruments – for example taxation, inheritance law, regulation of land markets, territorial planning – can complement EU-supported interventions, and Member States will not get approval for their plans unless they are able to have a very important package for generational renewal, which is a good example of where we will have a common agricultural policy supported and approved at EU level. In relation to access to land and land transfer, the Commission shares the rapporteur’s view that this is a major barrier to young farmers setting up. This is why we have proposed to support forms of cooperation that could encompass farm partnerships between generations of farmers; farm succession or transition-planning services; brokerage for land acquisition; innovative national or regional organisations engaged in promoting and facilitating matching services between younger and older farmers. These are some examples that we can utilise more fully. On top of this, young farmers will benefit from investment support and knowledge transfer and training interventions, which are important to ensure the long-term sustainability of our farms. Member States will be allowed to establish financial instruments supporting working capital. This instrument can be of primary importance for young farmers and new entrants, who face more difficulties given the high investments and low returns of a start-up phase. The Commission continues to engage with the European Investment Bank, especially through our fi-compass platform, to learn from experiences and best practices on specific schemes for young farmers and new entrants. As part of the CAP planning process, the Commission will fully engage in accompanying Member State authorities to develop sound schemes for generational renewal, depending on the specific needs, focusing on innovative approaches, best practices and knowledge-sharing. So the Members of the House, particularly those who are members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), who have taken a very keen interest in, and constructive approach to, the needs of young farmers, can be assured that the Commission shares this view and will be bringing forward proposals accordingly. It is essential that we have more young people involved in farming in order to develop an efficient, competitive European agriculture and food production sector in the future. This report from Mr Caputo, together with the report that we have just discussed by Mr Dorfmann, are important contributions to the Commission’s policy development, and as I said at the outset, I hope that they will recognise many of the proposals and recommendations that can be seen in the Commission’s forthcoming proposals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 142, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Nuno Melo", "mepid": "96978", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (PT) Mr President, this report is important and timely; we have to consider that at European level there is one farmer under 35 for every nine aged over 55. In some states such as Portugal, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom or Bulgaria, the proportion of young farmers is very low, only one farmer per twenty over the age of 55. It is obviously about maintaining our food self-sufficiency, and the problems mainly lie in setting up farmers, access to land, the transfer of farms from the oldest to the youngest and access to credit. Finally, as amendments that we are tabling, there are several suggestions that make sense to us, such as the creation of an Erasmus programme linked to vocational training to improve skills and the exchange of experience between young farmers, support for young people who want techniques and procedures for innovative production. Finally, no one questions the strategic nature of agriculture, but there is a serious abandonment of land and young people in rural areas must be given the same conditions as young people in urban areas. I wonder, finally, whether it is understandable that, for example, farmers in my own country are now receiving less money for selling their products than in 1986, when Portugal joined the European Union.

The European agricultural population is not renewed. This is the observation that is made and it is not new, unfortunately. For more than 50 years, agricultural development, supported by the CAP, has promoted the concentration and expansion of farms and has led to a high capitalization that has made some farms difficult to transmissible. However, the issue of generational renewal — as we see it today — is a crucial problem for our food security, and it is also so if we want to maintain living territories. Faced with this major challenge, we must put in place a proactive policy, combining European instruments with national arrangements, in order to ensure better access to land, financing and training. The entry of young people into agriculture is a key element of dynamism and innovation if we are to foster a change in our agricultural models. It must be said forcefully, as Nicola Caputo does.

We are not going to solve this by giving young farmers more direct income support, direct income support paid by reducing the direct income support of the other farmers. Is that fair? Older farmers are also working hard every day to produce sufficient and good food. No, this can only be done by making the sector more competitive, making it more innovative and ensuring that the sector comes up with solutions to climate and environmental problems.

We really need a very determined European Union strategy here. My second point is public money for public goods. This principle is completely ignored by young farmers. It is not those farms that contribute most to the environment, animal welfare, landscape protection, but all without differentiation that are promoted. And the third thing: we want to make agriculture a place of the future. This requires fair incomes for peasant work.

There are three barriers to preventing young entrants to agriculture. The first is access to land. In the UK, local councils owned small farms and rented them out to young entrants as a first step on the ladder. The problem was that there were so few opportunities for the next step that young tenants became old tenants and the system just froze. The second is bed blocking by the older generation. Public money might be used to allow such individuals to retire with dignity and let the younger generation take the reins with new ideas. The third is access to capital by young tenant farmers. This could be facilitated by government loan guarantees. The guarantee would have to reduce in time, as the tenants should be able to demonstrate a profitable enterprise to interest commercial lenders on its own merits. The initiative by the Commission to give marginally more area aid to young farmers is fraught with bureaucratic problems and open to abuse. It won’t resolve bed blocking, it won’t increase access to serious capital, and on tenanted holdings, it will just roll out to the landowner.

However, I am also sceptical as to whether the support we have granted so far, namely to grant a supplement per hectare, is justified. The differences between the farms are too great. I give two examples: a young farmer can take over from his parents a farm where all the investments have been made, and another young farmer, whose father may have died prematurely and whose mother kept the farm afloat, must make huge investments in order for him to continue.

I therefore believe that young farmers should have an increase in support whenever they take responsibility for family farms, in order to continue this activity, not least because, as we know, young people have greater difficulties in accessing capital.

Better support is also needed than the one that young farmers have today through additional mobilisation of financial instruments in the second tier. Inability to access agricultural land, late transfer of ownership of the farm, unavailability of credit at favourable interest and unfair trading practices are obstacles in the business of young farmers that must be urgently eliminated. All young farmers should have the same starting position regardless of which Member States come from, so they should be given access to financial instruments and loans on the same terms and interest rates.

It is clear – and not at all surprising from the debate or indeed from the previous debate – that there is significant support for young farmers, and rightly so. We also spoke quite a lot tonight about the importance of innovation and knowledge transfer. The one idea of which we have no shortage, of course, is of innovative, knowledgeable young people who are anxious to get involved in farming, but sometimes there are many barriers in their way to doing so. The challenge is to remove those barriers and to encourage young farmers’ interest. Also, the challenge is to help them to overcome the many barriers to entry by Member States or, indeed, how we can help in the European Parliament and in the European Council, through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). As I have indicated in my opening remarks, there are a suite of measures available in the existing Common Agricultural Policy and often they are not being used by Member States. These measures have different but complementary objectives. Of course we need complementary measures between those which come within the competence of the EU and those which are within the competence of the Member States. We have to get the Member States to utilise more policy options than today in order to help people and encourage them to become involved in agriculture. Member States have competence, for example, on taxation, and more can and should be done in this area in order to incentivise young people into farming.  When the Commission makes its legislative proposals later, we will include proposals to support our young farmers and I hope and I know that we can rely on your support in respect of these measures, but I would also encourage you to press your national governments to provide appropriate and complementary measures at the level of the Member State.  The European Parliament, and in particular through Mr Dess, Mr De Castro and Mr Siekierski, through the Omnibus, played a very important role in highlighting and increasing the support for young farmers. The provisions in the Omnibus certainly should be implemented in full by the Member States, especially the increase in the farmers’ top-up payment from 25% to 50%. Many Member States have taken advantage of increasing the top-up, but many Member States have not taken advantage of this particular new opportunity to give additional income, as Mr Flanagan has said, which is essential to ensuring that young people are, at least, given more attractiveness in terms of the support that is available through the Common Agricultural Policy. The fact that so many Member States have chosen to use the facility is encouraging, but let’s hope that we can find a way where all Member States will be able to support these measures.  One of the ways in which we will be able to do so is by having a specific objective in the CAP strategic plans, which will not get approval from the Commission unless they are able to show that they have genuine proposals to encourage more young people into agriculture and the food sector. It will be very important to see the reaction of the Council and Parliament in relation to how the specific objective of generation renewal for the first time will give a clear indication, as I said earlier, of the competence of having a harmonised but also common policy in relation to the specific objective of generation renewal. When I spoke earlier of the CAP, I referred to it as a social policy. We have a responsibility to maintain the fabric of our rural communities and that cannot be done if we don’t encourage or get more young people into the heart of our rural communities through agriculture and food. Several of you have referenced the demographics of the farming population, and you are correct in doing so. Generation renewal is not only desirable but essential to secure the future of our rural areas and to create the much needed jobs for many people in the non-farming sectors in our rural areas. This is a very important objective that we must get right in the context of the co-legislative process that we are about to embark on under the CAP.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 160, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Nicola Caputo", "mepid": "124851", "text": " Rapporteur. — (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be forgiven for passing the minutes in my introduction, simply to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all those who have contributed to this debate.

The organic sector has grown by 125% over the past decade and is recording a remarkable ascending parable, gaining increasing importance. Growth, however, was strongly hampered by rules that were no longer fit for purpose and were absolutely revised. It is for this reason that I welcome the regulation adopted by the Council, as it will play a vital role by supporting the growth of the sector and providing an appropriate regulatory framework for purpose. I generally believe that the Commission and Parliament should direct young farmers and new agricultural entrepreneurs on the choice of crops to target. Many crops do not offer sufficient or reasonable margins in terms of market, demand or profitability, and this would greatly increase the entrepreneurial risk for young people entering the sector.

Despite these efforts, it appears that the current measures are not sufficient and that some adjustments will be needed in the future. The report calls on Member States to give new entrants and young farmers priority in access to agricultural land. Addressing this requires reassessing the direct payment system and creating an incentive for older farmers to pass on farms to younger generations. It also recommends that the focus be on reducing additional obstacles for young farmers, i.e. access to capital, lack of business skills and insufficient inheritance plans.

Unfortunately, there are more issues, which we should address such as demographic picture in some regions of the EU that are very unbalanced, with few or no young people living there. Obviously to counter these negative trends the EU and Member States should support young farmers. Young farmers and new entrants represent important sources of innovation and entrepreneurship within agriculture, bringing benefits such as the introduction of new knowledge or techniques, the development of new business and organisational models, more sustainable farming systems (e.g. share farming, pre-financing, crowdsourcing), the increase of connections between farming and the local community, and the adaptation of traditional knowledge to develop business innovations.

A strong CAP aimed at young farmers will also help address the main challenges of access to land and finance, reducing administrative barriers, additional training and developing business skills. Young farmers are easily embracing new technologies and are a bearer of innovation and entrepreneurship. The CAP should therefore encourage a new generation of young farmers who implement new end-user-based business models and develop smart solutions for sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices.

The Commission plans to adopt its proposal for the new self-regulation on 6 June. The MFF package adopted on 2 May already provides some key orientations concerning the possible design and priorities of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). We all have in mind the high investment needs in transport infrastructure in Europe for the period 2021-2027. We estimate that the TEN-T Core Network development alone will require EUR 350 billion of investments. In addition, we need to tackle much more decisively the challenge of decarbonisation and digitalisation of the transport sector. The cross-border dimension remains at the basis of the EU added value. However, efficient and interconnected mobility also needs to be smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure. This is why I have proposed to modernise the Connecting European Facility. CEF is among the very few programmes for which a reinforced budget has been proposed by the Commission. The overall CEF budget proposal amounts to EUR 42.3 billion, of which EUR 30.6 billion would be dedicated to transport. Our proposal is thus to keep the current budget levels both for the general and for the cohesion envelope with 12.8 billion and 11.3 billion respectively. In addition, we propose to deploy a EUR 6.5 billion budget for transport infrastructure of dual use: civil and military. I would like to refer to six points raised in the Parliament draft resolution that I consider particularly important. First, on the priorities. I fully agree that it is important to strike the right balance between the development of new infrastructure and the modernisation of the existing infrastructure. On one side, I agree that focus should be maintained on the development of the network, with particular priority on cross-border sections and missing links of the Core Network Corridors. This is clearly where continuity has to be ensured in order to complete the big projects supported by the current programme. On the other hand, a much stronger and broader emphasis should be put on the modernisation of the existing infrastructure. We currently need to keep up the efforts as regards ERTMS and SESAR to complete the deployment, but digitalisation should also be supported further. We want to accompany the mobility transition towards connected, cooperative, automated and autonomous mobility, as well as modal integration and new mobility services. At the same time, we want to make our network safer, more secure and more resilient to climate change and natural disasters. For these topics, the geographical differentiation between the comprehensive and Core Network is not always relevant, so we are planning to propose to also cover the comprehensive network where relevant. But this can only be achieved by a team effort – which brings me to my second point, which is synergies between the transport, energy and digital sectors. For instance, on automated mobility we will open possibilities for these synergies. Importantly, while providing a framework that is as open as possible to synergies, we should re-establish a list of areas of topics. This should be done during implementation with sufficient flexibility. My third point concerns the cohesion envelope. Based on the first positive experience, the Commission has proposed to transfer from the Cohesion Funds an amount of EUR 11.2 billion to the CEF for implementation and direct management according to CEF rules. Of course the cohesion and co-funding rate would apply. However, we are considering a higher rate to apply to cross-border links. Fourth, I would like briefly to mention InvestEU and blending. In order to streamline the instruments, the Commission has proposed to merge most existing financial instruments into one single investment – InvestEU. It will have a specific window for infrastructure and it will complement the CEF, which in turn will no longer have specific financial instruments. As regards blending, we should keep the possibility to blend CEF grants with InvestEU, but also to use CEF grants in combination with non-EU financial instruments, for instance from commercial or national promotional banks. My fifth point focuses on the new component of CEF – military mobility. This is an important component of the new initiative proposed in the area of defence. The proposed budget of EUR 6.5 billion would be implemented through CEF to support civil transport infrastructure in order to adapt it to military mobility requirements. In other words, investments necessary for military mobility purposes will also have to be serving fully the needs of civilian mobility. And finally, my sixth point, on energy. The European Union’s climate commitments require an unprecedented level of investment in energy infrastructure which enables decarbonisation of energy systems. Electricity grids will need to undergo massive reinforcement. Grids will need to become even more digitalised and smarter, to allow for efficient demand management. Some gas grids may be transformed to carry synthetic gas, reduced with surpluses of renewable energy. Therefore, a targeted public financial assistance will continue to be required to deliver the necessary investments. This will be potentially important where the infrastructure includes significant positive externalities such as security of supply, solidarity or innovation. The CEF has a very important and growing role to play here, so an ambitious financial envelope is required, as well as support for synergy costs as I mentioned before, where transport, energy and/or digital can act together. Furthermore, CEF will be needed to support some more outstanding investments in projects to ensure energy security. So we are set for an ambitious but realistic future CEF, and I hope I can count on the support from you, the European Parliament, to move it forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 168, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Marian-Jean Marinescu", "mepid": "33982", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the information presented.

Important investments have been made in railways, in SESAR, in airports. That is why the amount allocated for this facility after 2021 is surprising, even though there is still some confusion in the figures presented, both by the difference between current prices and prices in real terms, and by putting together military infrastructure and financial instruments. I hope the regulations will clarify this. However, I want to remind you that in 2011 the Commission proposed EUR 50 billion for this facility.

The period after 2020 will be crucial to ensure the successful delivery of the TEN-T core network within the given deadline by 2030. Various improvements to CEF 2.0 will significantly contribute to achieving these goals. I have, in particular, taken note of your interests, priorities and synergies concerning the support for infrastructure projects. Let me elaborate on some of your comments. First, regarding the CEF budget. The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) proposal incorporates an ambitious proposal for the future of CEF, which is among the very few programmes with a reinforced budget, amounting to a total of EUR 30.6 billion for 2021-2027, circa 20% more compared to the current period 2014-2020. Not only has the MFF proposal preserved existing elements of CEF in the general and cohesion envelope; the CEF has been further reinforced with a new pillar of military mobility. During the difficult times surrounding the withdrawal of the UK, this is an impressive achievement, showing that the CEF has been recognised by the Commission as an effective instrument, adding real value to the European single market. Let me stress here again that all the money allocated to military mobility is allocated to dual use; all the infrastructure is civil infrastructure used for civil purposes and then reinforced also for military mobility. On synergies: synergies between transport, energy and the digital sector will be implemented through a joint work programme, jointly financed and with the possibility to apply to the highest co-funding rate in the sector concerned. We are yet to define clear criteria under which the synergies will be taking place. Again, let me stress that the ‘use it or lose it’ principle will remain part of CEF. This was one of the most successful principles. It allowed us such a high level of delivery that, already in the first three years of this Commission, our deployment achieved more than 90%. One last comment regarding the priority projects that was raised by a respectful Member. Let me say that many of the Member States proposed new sections. We could not take all on board, but many of them will be taken on board, only of course those that were aligned with the Annex of the Regulation. Finally, thank you very much again for allowing me to introduce the initial structure of our proposal that is coming in the first week of June. Thank you very much also for your support. I will ask you to continue to demonstrate it, and I really look forward to continuing discussing it in the coming months, in close coordination with my colleagues in charge of the energy and digital sectors, to allow swift progress on this very important file.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 182, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "124812", "text": " The discussion is closed.

Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is one of the main instruments that aims to address this shortage by focusing on facilitating cross-border connections, leveraging funding from both the public and the private sectors. CEF Transport triggered successfully already EUR 41.6 billion of total investments by 2017 and statistics indicates that every billion euros invested in the TEN-T core network creates up to 20 000 new jobs. Therefore, the instrument brings a massive EU value added, enhancing cohesion, long-term sustainable growth and economic competitiveness. It also contributes considerably to the EU’s achievement of decarbonizing its economy in the context of the Paris Agreement.

Similarly, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur Richard Corbett for the excellent cooperation. Of course, our task is to evaluate the interpretation and implementation of the agreement, which came into force in April 2016. In general, it can be concluded that the existing application of the Agreement is satisfactory and in principle the Agreement fulfills its purpose. I believe that there has been goodwill for all institutions to fulfil the purpose of the agreement from the outset, and I believe that will continue to be the case. This is an interinstitutional agreement, which is why our assessment has included efforts to preserve and strengthen the elements of cooperation in which the European Parliament can contribute its expertise. One such theme is adherence to the correct legal basis. Unjustified changes in the legal basis are, of course, unacceptable to the European Parliament. On this interinstitutional level, I would also like to mention the question of the participation of representatives of the European Parliament in the deliberations of the Council working groups, also as an example of some disproportion, which still is in the field of awareness of the Council's deliberations, compared to the awareness of the deliberations of the European Parliament and its institutions. I think that in the long run, eliminating such disproportion would be of benefit. However, it should be emphasised that the report does not only cover institutional matters. First of all, they evaluate how much we have managed to fulfill the basic purpose of the agreement, which is to try to improve the adoption of legislation. I would like to mention here a few elements of the legislative process that are mentioned in the report and can illustrate how the principles of better law making — improving the creation of legislation. For example, we think that the European Commission should clearly state the legal nature of each proposal within its work programme and supplement it with a clear and realistic timetable. This, too, would contribute to better clarity of the European Union in its citizens. One of the basic things is a quality impact assessment of the proposed legislation. Personally, I have always supported the maximum possible consideration of the impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, which I do not see as favouring them over other entities or employees, but as taking into account reality. And the reality is that small and medium-sized enterprises are quite fundamental to the European economy. The big theme is gold plating. I consider it obvious that we need to demand in the future that, in the framework of the implementation of Union regulations, it is recognisable what is still a Union regulation and what is already a national initiative that introduces obligations beyond those adopted at Union level. That's what a regular citizen practically has no chance of finding out today. The European Union is a community of law, so it must take care that its law constitutes truly modern, effective, lucid and understandable standards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 186, "date": "2018-05-28.json", "name": "Richard Corbett", "mepid": "2309", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur. This was very much a team effort, not just between two co-rapporteurs but between two committees and indeed among multiple political groups. Our task, of course, was to assess the implementation of this important interinstitutional agreement that we made with the Commission and the Council two years ago and, overall, our assessment is a positive one, even if there are still two strands being negotiated on international agreements and on the delimitation between implementing acts and delegated acts – they will come back to this Parliament – but what has been agreed so far has, on the whole, been well implemented.  We have moved to having greater transparency in the legislative process. We have moved towards having better legislative planning. We have moved to improve our legislative procedures. We have improved the consultation of stakeholders and we have looked at and improved the process of impact assessments, which are very important. All this, of course, is a question of getting the right balance and take impact assessments and the whole issue of what we are trying to do with them. Yes, we want to be better informed about the potential impacts of laws that we adopt in this Parliament on those who will be affected by them. Absolutely right. But it’s not just how laws affect small and medium-sized enterprises as some campaigners seem to sometimes imply, it is about how the legislation affects other stakeholders – consumers, workers, third parties, government finances, the environment. It’s a question of getting all of these things in balance.  Secondly, this is not about deregulation, it’s about better regulation. When we adopt legislation it is usually for good reason and especially at European level. If we adopt legislation at European level, it is not, as some in the media sometimes portray, the European Commission spewing out regulations on hapless Member States who don’t even know that it’s being inflicted upon them. No, there is a high threshold to adopt legislation at European level. It needs the approval of this Parliament and of the Council, the Council composed of national ministers, members of national governments, accountable to their national parliaments, who need the high threshold of a qualified majority representing 65% of the population to approve anything. So the idea that we inflict legislation on hapless Member States is nonsense. We only legislate at European level where there is a high degree of consensus that it is advantageous to do so. That is an important political safeguard and I would remind those people, usually sat over there, but I see none of them are here tonight, those people who claim that the EU inflicts all this red tape and bureaucracy on small and medium-sized enterprises.  I’d add one further thing. When we get it right, European legislation is an exercise in cutting red tape for businesses, because having one set of rules instead of 28 different, divergent set of rules in a single market, makes things simpler for businesses. They don’t have to adapt to every single segment of the market, adapting their product, changing it, changing the labelling, changing the marketing everywhere. They have life simplified when we get European legislation right. So it is not about deregulating it’s about regulating better. At the moment we see actually an example of a Member State, my own country, beginning to discover the multiple problems that arise if you begin, as it intends to do, to diverge and its regulations from the rest of its main market, all the multiple extra costs that will arise, all the extra difficulties, all the economic problems that will ensue.

Issues that are still lacking with regard to the impact assessment include a better understanding of the impact on citizens, especially on gender, which was agreed in the Beijing Declaration but is still not in the majority of the legislative action budgets. As we are discussing sustainable finance next, what would be crucial is to add the cost of not acting and not regulating. Quite often in environmental and climate cases, people do see the cost if you have to invest or regulate or de-invest, let us say, away from diesel cars. But, then again, there is no comparison with what the huge cost of climate change will be if we do not act, and I hope this can be added in the future.

In its first annual burden survey, the Commission undertook a survey of businesses’ perceptions of regulation. I am sure that was worthwhile but we must be much more ambitious in implementing the annual burden survey. The point is, we may create a simple piece of legislation at EU level, easy for businesses and others to understand and comply with, but when it is transposed into international legislation it does not always stay like that: additional, or completely unrelated, elements are added to the legislation. The ABS should identify these cases of gold-plating. Member States must always be free to adopt higher standards where only minimum standards are defined in Union law. That is not gold-plating. By using the ABS to bring transparency to the legislative process, we can ensure that legislation remains simple, clear and enforceable and we can make sure that Europe is not blamed for unpopular legislation that has, in fact, been created by Member States.

It raises some important issues and will deepen further our interinstitutional cooperation.  In its short lifetime, the agreement has delivered some real improvements in how the institutions work together, as mentioned by Mr Corbett, for example the Joint Declaration on Legislative Priorities and the new interinstitutional register for delegated acts. We are also still busy working together on various follow-up actions such as the criteria to distinguish delegated acts from implementing acts, as mentioned already, the traceability of the legislative procedure through joined databases and the cooperation and information sharing on international agreements, as already pointed out. I hope this will also come to fruitful completion this year.  The report contains several criticisms, many of them aimed primarily at the Council. But, as you know, our agreement contains a monitoring mechanism to which the three institutions are committed. These issues will be for our next three-part, detailed stocktaking meeting, the first of which took place last December in Strasbourg and which already addressed some of the issues.  We should also recall that the agreement was a delicate compromise between the three institutions and it is important to bear this in mind as we identify how to follow up on issues where Parliament now calls for more ambition. A number of issues have indeed already been addressed. To improve transparency and predictability since 2017 the Commission Work Programme provides further information as far as available on the initiatives in its work programme. This information includes indications on the type of act, planned adoption, legal basis and whether an impact assessment will be carried out.  As a general rule, the Commission is committed to present an impact assessment in support of its legislative proposals and I can assure you that when an impact assessment is necessary, we do it. There were, of course, a limited number of cases where, typically for reasons of political urgency, we have not been able to. When this is the case, we explain the reasons why. Your resolution states that the Commission should complement its original impact assessment when deemed necessary. I want to underline that it is not an obligation, but a possibility. The Commission will launch a stocktaking of its better regulation tools in the course of this year, and this will include the regulatory scrutiny board. This will be accompanied by various consultation activities and we will, of course, be in touch with Parliament to hear your views. We intend to publish a report with findings in the first half of 2019.  Also, as stipulated by the interinstitutional agreement, I encourage Parliament to pursue the endeavours in their own impact assessment work related to the substantial amendments. The first best is that Parliament and the Council, in line with the commitments, assess their own amendments. The Commission may do this for them if it considers this appropriate. We assess in the impact assessment what kind of policy instruments we need for a specific initiative. We have to look at all the possible options and we have specific guidance for that in our better regulation toolbox. Sometimes soft law is just better to achieve the desired policy objective because it is more proportionate and better respects the principles of subsidiarity.  Let me use this opportunity to clarify that all responses to Parliament’s resolution are endorsed by the College and hence are political in nature. They constitute a particular form of communication to Parliament. Own-initiative legislative resolutions receive a specific attention. As foreseen in the Treaty, if the Commission does not submit a proposal, it always informs Parliament of the reasons for such a choice.

The fact that a Member State will implement Union legislation more broadly than necessary into its legal order is not negative in itself. Member States may, for example, provide citizens with an even higher standard of protection. But not always wider national arrangements by citizens are welcome, and the problem is that citizens cannot distinguish between which changes in the new law are brought by the EU and which state. Gold plating is fuelling Euroscepticism in such situations and is partly to reinforce populist sentiment in the EU.

As a former professor of green economics, I am delighted to see that this agenda now has almost universal support, not only in Parliament, but also from the Commission, who have made this a priority agenda, as well as from world leaders, especially President Macron of France. This indicates that the sustainable finance agenda has moved beyond the realm of partisan discussion. It is not the property of any political faction. It also shows that protecting the health and vitality of the planet we depend on is a cause that transcends normal political differences. While we may continue to debate about how banks should be regulated and what is the appropriate level of profits for enterprises, there is no longer any argument about the fact that we need to embark urgently on a transition to a sustainable economy and that finance offers a powerful tool to accelerate that transition. The urgent need to respond to the threat from climate change has led to innovation in the field of sustainable finance in different EU Member States: the French law of disclosure, German leadership in the field of public investment in the energy transition, the Bank of England’s timely action in encompassing the threat of financial stability from stranded assets, the Swedish FSA’s ambitious agenda to integrate sustainability into its daily work, and the consideration of the threat to pensions and insurance from the tragedy of horizons by the Netherlands. The aim of the European Parliament should be to encourage a race to the top on sustainable development, to take the best from this innovation across our Union and to combine it into minimum standards for all, guiding investment to ensure a just and rapid transition towards a sustainable economy and society. The sustainability transition is, as its name suggests, a dynamic environment. This is true of the hugely exciting technological innovation as engineers and designers respond to the sustainability imperative, and so it needs to be in terms of how we define and measure sustainability.  This is why our report takes a different stance from the somewhat static taxonomy proposed by the Commission. Our proposal would be for something that time limits the value of different assets, based on their sustainability potential measured by already existing indicators. This would allow investors to shift their asset holdings gradually through time and would enable an orderly transition away from unsustainable investments. The systemic risk posed by stranded carbon assets could thus be avoided, an important first step towards sustainable finance, but we also need to eliminate other stranded assets from investment portfolios. My report recommends extending the stranded assets concept to include fundamental ecological systems and services, so if an investment in intensive agriculture causes soil loss or the death of pollinators, it too should be considered a stranded asset.  When it comes to sustainable finance, my report makes clear that we look to our own institutions, particularly the ECB and the European Investment Bank, to set an example and to rise to the challenge of the Paris Agreement. This must mean an end to any investment that locks us into fossil fuel infrastructure and the inclusion of ESG (environmental, social and governance) goals in the ECB’s investment policy.  We welcome the excellent work of the Commission’s Expert Group on Sustainable Finance and applaud its level of ambition. Our report lends political support to their recommendations and we seek to convey to the Commission and Council our firm belief that the citizens of the EU look to them to show global leadership on this agenda.   Finally, but crucially, we need to hold the line as politicians as those who will lose value as we move towards sustainability seek to undermine our resolve. Oil will always be able to move vehicles and coal will always be able to drive turbines. For this reason we, the politicians, are deciding that these fossil fuels will lose their value – because the survival of our planet depends upon it. Future generations require us to stand firm and united to ensure that we use the power of finance to protect their future.

As our rapporteur has already mentioned, those kinds of indicators do exist, and it is only a question of putting them in place. It is a question of having a review of financial regulation and the pervasive incentives sometimes, be it in fiduciary duty of investors, be it MiFIDs, be it the duty for credit raters to grade the environmental risks and in Basel for the banks to reserve higher capital buffers for environmentally-risky investments. To conclude, I would just like to thank my colleagues for their excellent work.

I welcome the support that the report gives to the work on sustainable finance. I also welcome the large consensus among political groups on the best way forward. This is encouraging in view of our future work and discussions on the legislative proposals on sustainable finance that the Commission presented last week. These proposals already address some of your concerns. First, we will start the process of designing an EU classification system for sustainable economic activities which can inform future EU standards and labels for green financial products such as green bonds or investment funds. We are looking forward to the European Parliament support on this important proposal. Second, for those who manage investments on behalf of others, we propose to clarify that their duty towards their clients includes the systemic incorporation of sustainability risks into their investment processes. They will also have to disclose how they take this risk into account and what impact they expect these risks to have on returns. In addition, for investment products that actively pursue sustainable objectives, the way these objectives are incorporated into investment decisions would also need to be disclosed. Third, we propose to create a new category of benchmarks consisting of two specific types of benchmarks: low carbon benchmarks and positive carbon impact benchmarks. We also propose to establish minimum standards for the methodology of these benchmarks. This will increase transparency towards investors on how these benchmarks select and weigh their underlying assets and measure their carbon footprint. In addition, providers of low carbon benchmarks will have to disclose how their methodology takes into account the ESG factors. Finally, we propose that investment firms and insurance distributors consider the sustainability preferences of retail investors when giving investment advice. In the coming weeks we will establish a technical expert group (we’re going to call it TEG) that will further work on developing an EU classification for sustainable activities or taxonomy standards for green bonds and sustainable matrix. These are the first steps towards a more sustainable financial system. There is still some work ahead to address other concerns stated in your own initiative report. For instance, the Commission is evaluating the mandatory reporting requirements to make sure they provided the right information to market participants, enabling them to assess companies’ long-term value creation and their sustainability-risk management. Of course, further clarification of the role of European supervisory authorities in this process is really important. Let me conclude by stressing again my appreciation of the work of the European Parliament in this field.

The Commission estimates that the Sustainable Development Goals will require annual investments in sustainable infrastructure of between €4.7 and 6.7 trillion. Currently, investing in environmentally friendly technologies is not very profitable and rather risky. According to the report, investors underestimate the wage and social advantage of a decarbonised, green and sustainable economy. The report calls on the EU to learn from 'best practices' such as the German energy transition and to make them minimum standards for all Member States to direct investment and to ensure a fair and rapid transition to a sustainable economy. Investment incentives include market mechanisms such as the disclosure of climate risks, but also strong public investment and the issuance of green bonds. Although I fully support an investment boost for a greener and more sustainable economy, I think it is rather risky to interfere politically in forecasts of the creditworthiness and profitability of green investment opportunities.

I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteur for very good cooperation. This is Parliament's response to the Commission scoreboard for 2017, and this scoreboard is made every year since five years back. It is a comparative overview of the effectiveness, quality and independence of the legal systems of the Member States. In relation to previous years, in 2017, the Commission raised new aspects about the functioning of the legal system, such as how consumers can access justice and the length of Member States' criminal proceedings in money laundering. It is very good that it has come along, but we believe further improvements could be made so that the scoreboard becomes even more relevant. For example, we address in our report that an independent judiciary is the basis of a democracy, and in order to ensure this, legal systems must be free of pressure, both political and economic. We stress the importance of independent prosecutorial authorities and urge the Commission to produce reports to strengthen the position of prosecutors. This I think is very important. We also regret that there is still a lack of data in certain categories and we urge Member States to make more effort to provide comparable data. We call on the Commission to develop new criteria to better evaluate whether legal systems are in line with EU rule of law. Here I have suggested, among other things, that we should take on the Venice Commission's list of rule of law criteria. We also stress the importance of strengthening citizens' access to justice and legal aid. Information tools are needed so that people with disabilities, national minorities and migrants have better accessibility. We also regret that the scoreboard showed that the proportion of female judges in some Member States has decreased compared to previous years. Member States need targeted measures to improve outcomes. Better equality work is also needed in the justice system. It is an important basis for efficiency and independent legal systems and so we propose increased educational interventions, including which judges should be offered, such as education on norms and stereotypes. For me as rapporteur, it has also been important to broaden the scoreboard for the types of litigation processes the comparison refers to. And I am pleased that we call on the Commission to produce in future scoreboards a new indicator to monitor more carefully access to justice for discriminated groups. We also want the Commission to produce a new indicator of information on national procedures in respect of collective trials in the face of next year's comparison. The possibility of class-action is increasingly important in strengthening the protection of consumers, the environment and public health across the EU. The wide-ranging diesel-street scandal, for example, testifies to the right to claim compensation for improper business practices. It demonstrates the need to facilitate the status of citizens to judicial review and effective dispute resolution. Therefore, it would be reasonable and timely to look at this too in next year's scoreboard. Finally, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs once again for their excellent cooperation.

The legislative proposal by the Commission on collective redress does not, however, make the call in this report redundant.

We share the same commitment and interest to strengthen the independence and effectiveness of judicial systems in our Member States. These are essential for economic development, social peace and a secure Europe. The 2018 Justice Scoreboard was adopted by the Commission today. I am glad that your report takes into account many of its elements. It is important to remember that the Scoreboard is a tool which is being continuously improved, and your recommendations will be considered for the future as well. Your report calls for the expansion of the EU Justice Scoreboard into the field of criminal justice. The 2018 Scoreboard expanded the coverage of money laundering and now shows, for nearly all countries, the length of court proceedings in money laundering cases. It shows that, while in about half of Member States the first instance court proceedings take up to a year on average, these proceedings take around two years on average in several Member States.  You call for covering the status of public prosecutors and their autonomy. I am pleased to say that the 2018 Scoreboard shows for the first time an overview of how prosecution services are organised in Member States. The EU Justice Scoreboard feeds into the European Semester country analysis in this respect.  With regard to judicial independence, we are assessing the effectiveness of the national legal frameworks and safeguards in close cooperation with the judicial networks. We have developed a measurement of perceived judicial independence among companies and the general public. We also fully share Parliament’s prioritisation of the use of ICT tools, which is reflected in the 2018 Scoreboard, for example the use of electronic means in judicial procedures and access to judgments online. These are indicators on how the needs of specific groups of users of justice systems – for example, children, visually impaired people, non—native speakers – are being taken into account in the provision of public information on the justice system, in the training of judges and in surveys of court users. As regards judicial training, the Commission is currently evaluating the 2018 strategy, including public consultations. Having said all this, it is important to recall that one of the key challenges for the development of information tools like the EU Justice Scoreboard is the collection of data. We would like to thank Parliament for having called on Member States to cooperate with the Commission. When considering any new area of coverage, it is important to keep in mind the objective of the Scoreboard and the ability to collect reliable data from all Member States, based on a simple and clear indicator in line with European standards. Your resolution comes at a time when upholding the rule of law is high on the EU agenda.

Corruption does undeniable damage to the economy, but also to democracy: looting the coffers of the state is not to love Spain. But this problem is also a problem for Europe, a problem that splashes and calls into question the democratic quality of the European institutions and their commitment to transparency.

It's gonna be a first. But its preparation is in great danger. The fault belongs to the government led by Viorica Dăncilă, primarily because many ministers are incompetent. Even worse is the fact that the Prime Minister abandoned his prerogatives. The government's power was usurped by a criminally convicted person - Liviu Dragnea. He runs the PSD and, in a non-transparent way, dictates government action. The drift of the rule of law is worse in Romania than in Hungary or Poland. The majority of the PSD - ALDE is not ready to assume the presidency of the Council of the European Union. I remind you that negotiations for the MFF will have to be completed in the first 6 months of 2019 and the UK's exit from the European Union will be managed.

These are direct quotes from worried workers.  This isn’t new and there is a similar story to tell across Europe. Back in 2004, Verdi published its ‘Black Book on Lidl’, exposing a low—pay, high—fear culture. Lidl cannot be allowed to continue to expand at the expense of its workers. They need a voice, through an independent trade union. So my message to Lidl is: end your opposition to unions and meet with Usdaw. Talk about recognising it as the trade union for Lidl staff. Until you do that, we will keep campaigning outside your warehouses and stores.

In such cases, it is important to encourage corporate social responsibility and to promote the development of industry in the European Union. I agree with that. But as companies come to Slovakia, they leave it and leave the trigger behind. Example: At Bodet&Horst in Vrbovo, a large proportion of over three hundred employees had to submit mass statements because they were going to bankruptcy. For over thirteen years she's been producing in our house. She received up to five and a half million subsidies from the budget of the Slovak Republic for development. Meanwhile, it has also launched production in Romania. In April, it announced that it was quitting in Slovakia and moving to Germany and Romania. This must be accepted within the free market of the European Union. But it is inconceivable that he is leaving Slovakia with unpaid wages and claims. Only the social and health insurance company owes over six hundred thousand. Of course, mismanagement can also be behind its collapse, but it cannot be agreed that companies will leave debts behind, leave and we support them in business in another country.

In a sector ravaged by competition and overly precarious, which is experiencing extreme working conditions, drivers claim dignity denied them today, recognition of their rights and occupational safety. Faced with this urgency, you answer them with an extension of working time, a framework for rest time that too often leads them to no longer leave their cabin, a lex specialis for posted road workers, which will deprive them of the progress made in the general posting directive.

For more than 10 years, Romania has been monitored by MCV. Romanian citizens are wondering, and rightly so, whether this mechanism of cooperation and verification has not been used, in all these years, against public persons, as a pretext. At the same time, Romania fulfilled the recommendations that the last MCV report, the one in November 2017, made to our country. Moreover, Romania is the country that will take over the presidency of the Council of the European Union from 1 January 2019, and the non-establishment of the mechanism by this date will weaker the negotiating power of the European Union within Brexit. Romania has suffered quite and unfairly, as an image, because of this mechanism, which must now be urgently lifted because absolutely all the technical conditions of the lifting have already been met.

This project proposes not market practices, but administrative practices, infringements of the free market, infringement of freedom of movement, distortion of competition, and this is all hypocrisy and a double standard. There can be no European Union in which there will be firms that will work in the eastern markets, and eastern firms will not work in Western markets. This is wrong, unfair, and again I say, anti-European. These proposals themselves show a clear trend for dividing Europe into “two speeds”, which is detrimental to the eastern countries and would turn carriers from Eastern Europe, including from Bulgaria, Romania, etc. into guest workers.

The infringement of human rights by the Indian military has been widespread and systematic. Several generations of Kashmiris now have no civil experience other than conflict with the Indian state, but the iron fist has failed, and it has cost India dear.
