I thank the Prime Minister for accepting Parliament's invitation to take part in this debate on the future of Europe. As you know, Parliament wants to be at the centre of the debate on how to build the Europe of the future. Many things are wrong, of course Europe must be changed, but it must not be destroyed. Parliament wants to be a protagonist, we want more power for the European Parliament. Progress has been made with the Treaty of Lisbon, but we want parliament's power of initiative and we want to have discussions with the Member States not only in the Council. I have insisted to Prime Minister Tsipras on the importance to us of the Dublin reform, which is a key point supported by the European Parliament. We will all have the opportunity today to discuss, after listening to him, Alexis Tsipras, whom I thank once again for accepting our invitation, and I invite him to take the floor from the podium.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Αλέξης Τσίπρας", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Prime Minister of Greece. Mr President of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for the honour of inviting me to set out to the European Parliament my thoughts and concerns about the future of Europe and to discuss with you.  It is important but also symbolic that this opportunity is given to me only a few days after the end of a great adventure, after the end of the memorandums and the net exit of Greece from the support programmes, after eight whole years. Last time I had the honour of addressing you, Greece was in a great vortex. The politics of deficits, the breakdown of public money and the widespread corruption of previous governments had thrown my country on the brink of bankruptcy. But, at the same time, the inability of the institutions to prioritise the necessary structural reforms in the first two programmes, combined with the persistence of some of them in a recipe for extreme fiscal adjustment, had driven the country to the limits of social suffocation, economic suffocation and social explosion. From 2010 to 2014, Greece lost a quarter of its national wealth. Unemployment, poverty, social exclusion have soared, public debt too. Foreign investment has evaporated, young scientists have left the country by the thousands. Greece's economic crisis and the failure to manage it had also turned into a political crisis in Europe. And when I spoke before you, you will remember that half of you cheered me on, the other half disapproved of me, but few, very few, were among you who thought I would have hoped to make it.  And yet Greece did it! Three years later, it's a different country. Part of the problem, from a source of the crisis, became part of the solution for Europe. The clean exit from the last three-year programme is a success, above all, of the Greek people, who shook their teeth and fought the battle, which made great sacrifices to keep the country in the heart of Europe. But it is also a success for Europe as a whole, which has shown that in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation it can overcome crises. Through this adventure we come out stronger. Today we stand on our own two feet and look to the future with optimism because, for the first time since the outbreak of the crisis, the sacrifices of the Greek people have taken place. We've cleansed up the public finances. We have made deep cuts and reforms that should have been made decades ago. We escaped the spiral of recession and put the economy back on a growth trajectory. We have moved forward with projects and investments that make Greece a commercial, transit and energy hub in the wider region, but, at the same time, we have proved that there is a way out of the crisis without breaking up the social fabric. We supported the weakest. We've stopped the humanitarian crisis. We gave access to the health system to millions of uninsured people. But, at the same time, we also achieved primary surpluses, which, three years ago, no one could believe, because we control uncontrolled tax evasion, we stopped the waste and the party of corruption in public health and public procurement, because we have made key reforms, such as the consolidation of insurance funds and the rationalisation of the insurance system. And today, not only have we come out of the memoranda, but with the sustainable regulation of public debt, we are regaining our economic sovereignty and regaining the place we deserve in European life.  Last year Greece returned to growth with forecasts for this year approaching growth of close to 2.5%. Over the last three years we have proved to be champions in the absorption of European development resources. While also in 2017, we were the second country to absorb funds from the Juncker plan, while foreign investment reached 3.6 billion euros, which is the highest return of the last decade. In three years, we have reduced unemployment by more than 7%. We have created more than three hundred thousand new jobs. We supported public hospitals. We are implementing an integrated public primary care system, while drastically reducing organic gaps in schools and increasing spending on scientific research to 1% of GDP. At the same time we are fighting to turn the \"brain drain\" into a \"brain gain\" by incentivising youth entrepreneurship. We have also implemented the social solidarity income, the Greek version of the lower guaranteed income, from which more than 650 000 citizens currently benefit. We are thus reducing the rates of poverty and social exclusion by creating a web of social policies that protect the most vulnerable.  At the same time, however, and against the current of the time, Greece is one of the few countries that have extended the individual rights and freedoms of its citizens in Europe. For the first time, we are providing citizenship to second generation immigrants born and raised in Greece. We have enshrined the legal recognition of gender identity, as well as the cohabitation pact and child support for gay couples. We have abolished the mandatory application of Sharia law for the Muslim minority, and, at last, after years, we are also completing the construction of a mosque in Athens. Moreover, in a Europe where racism and xenophobia are reaping, Greece has done its best to manage the huge refugee flows in terms of humanism and the protection of international law. At a time when other countries were unilaterally breaking European decisions and raising fences, economically battered Greece resisted the sirens of hatred. Local communities have given lessons in humanity and civil society has been effectively mobilised in cooperation with the State, the European Union and international organisations. Today, the Asylum Service, which did not even exist five years ago, manages the largest number of applicants in Europe in relation to the population. At the same time, Greece, with its important geopolitical position, makes a decisive contribution to peace and stability in a more widely destabilised region.  Despite all the problems of instability and nationalist flare-up in Turkey, we have kept open channels of communication, preserving peace in the Aegean, promoting cooperative solutions to the refugee crisis, starting talks on a just and sustainable solution to the Cyprus problem. Together with Cyprus, we are the only European pillar of stability in the destabilised eastern Mediterranean region. We are expanding multilateral cooperation with Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Jordan and, at the same time, deepening Balkan cooperation and co-development, thus unlocking the European perspective of the Balkan states, with the crowning of our efforts the historic agreement of the Prespas with our northern neighbour and the ongoing dialogue with Albania. After twenty-six years of disastrous domination of nationalism, we managed with the Prime Minister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, to turn the page and reach a mutually acceptable agreement without the imposition and use of power, but on the basis of diplomacy and dialogue. An agreement that can be a model for dispute resolution in our region.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out this: Greece's exit from the last fiscal adjustment programme does not mean that the country is returning to its past. On the contrary, we are determined not to repeat the mistakes and behaviours that led to the crisis. The end of the memorandums is not a return to the past, but a historical intersection with the past. It is a new beginning that strengthens stability and security. He's healing wounds. It gradually corrects injustices and open up new development prospects for our people and our country.  In the coming period, I would like to assure you that we will continue the reform effort, with an emphasis on further streamlining the functioning of the state, modernising public administration, combating bureaucracy, deepening democratic sections through the forthcoming constitutional review. But we will also continue on the path of budgetary balance, while at the same time prioritising fair growth and the protection of work.  Greece and the Greeks have demonstrated in recent years how deeply committed they are to the idea of European unification, enduring and insisting on the European course of the country, even when Europe itself, or even its dominant expression, has often hurt and underestimated the Greek people. So let us try, from this eight-year Greek crisis that we are leaving behind, to draw our own conclusions and, above all, to draw conclusions about which Europe we want and how to shield it against possible new crises in the future. The stakes for Europe today are, I would say, existential in nature. The management to date of the economic and refugee crisis and the security crisis has highlighted huge deficits and contradictions and tends to turn all these crises into a structural crisis of the European project. From this step I would like to warn that the failure of the European Union to provide democratic and functional answers to modern challenges will inevitably result in the triumph of chauvinism and the resurgence of nationalist rivalries. It will make it a fragmented continent without unity, without cohesion, without an international role and perspective. During the economic crisis, the European Union, instead of becoming more democratic, taking advantage of whatever institutional political tools the Treaty of Lisbon has attributed, has become more technocratic and ethnocentric, with critical decisions unfortunately taken behind closed doors by informal bodies that do not answer to European citizens and keep citizens away from the Union and in the form of technocrats, such as the troika, holding the keys to economic sovereignty and not being held to account anywhere. The European Commission, the European Parliament and even the European Council have been second behind the institutionally unregistered Eurogroup and the technical ranks of the technocrats of the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Fiscal fetishism in the management of the economic crisis has further exacerbated socio-economic disparities both between and within the Member States. It has exhausted large sections of society and caused even greater economic insecurity and fear among our citizens. It is this failure of neoliberal crisis management that ultimately fuels the monster of chauvinism and far-right populism. He moved the far right from the stand of the accused of history and from isolation to the political scene.  The refugee crisis that followed simply confirmed Europe's inability to move forward, when a large part of its members did not embrace its founding values, when the logic of isolationism over cooperation prevailed, the logic of 'everyone alone' in the face of burden-sharing, the logic of national folding over European solidarity, when the poison of hatred and xenophobia , unfortunately, it springs back to the heart of Europe more than seventy years after the all-human tragedy of fascism. Because today we are not only faced with the electoral rise of some extreme forces of the nationalist and populist far right, but we are faced with the infiltration of its xenophobic and chauvinistic agenda within the democratic political spectrum, where racism and xenophobia become a hegemonic political discourse in traditional conservative forces and beyond, shaping the correlations in countries critical to Europe. It is this development, if not interrupted, that threatens Europe with decay.  Some of you in 2015 were afraid of SYRIZA and the left that was claiming and claiming a better Europe. You believed that anyone who questions today's Europe of neoliberal hegemony and social inequalities is a danger to our common edifice. Today, those of you who believed that, you have to admit that you fell out. If anyone really threatens Europe, it is not those who are fighting to change it, but those who are fighting to abolish it. Those who are on the opposite side of the umanist ideas of solidarity and cooperation of the peoples. All those who believe, friends and friends, ladies and gentlemen, in this European vision, must put aside our existing and great differences in the face of great danger. We must not let the European idea be crushed between destructive neoliberalism and the nightmarish far right. We must resolutely reply that the only way to save European unification is to revive it with bold reforms of democracy, transparency and justice. In other words, to support the prospect of a better Europe with European solutions to European challenges, to refugees and migration, to climate change, to security, to democratic reform of the euro area, so that hope can overcome far-right fear.  What we need today in Europe is not less solidarity and more borders but a new social contract for the social cohesion and prosperity of our peoples, deepening political integration, a stronger Parliament and stronger European institutions with democratic and social control. What we need is not a new priesthood of austerity and discipline but a growth-oriented eurozone with mechanisms for balancing inequalities; a multiannual financial framework that supports social cohesion and convergence; a legally binding European pillar of social rights; the revision of the common European asylum system with a fair distribution of burdens; a common European civil protection mechanism to deal with natural disasters; the promotion of Turkey's dialogue and accession path in order to respects international law and brings this great country back to democratic reforms;  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by saying that Greece has managed to become part of the solution to the problem for the last three years. Europe. It has overcome the economic crisis, put this great refugee crisis on its back with dignity on behalf of the whole of Europe. It paved the way for peoples' friendship with a consistently peaceful foreign policy that transforms it into a factor of cooperation and stability in a more broadly unstable region in the South-Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. All these examples of writing over the last three years are, I would say, a positive sign in the cloudy sky of the European Union. We've shown there's a way, if you believe it and if you fight it hard. I believe that this is also the way to Europe's future.  We have tough battles ahead of us. Next May's European elections will be more than just another election. It will be a political battle of principles and values to defeat the extreme neoliberalism and far-right populism that threaten Europe. To upgrade the European idea, to strengthen the unity and solidarity of the European peoples. In this battle, all progressive, democratic and pro-European forces have a duty to find themselves on the same side of history and not to let Europe turn back.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Are there any Members who have an interest in intervening in catch the eye?

I have had the opportunity to work closely with Prime Minister Tsipras over the past few years. Most recently, we had a very good exchange on Greece and the future of Europe when I visited Athens in June. Before I turn to our debate, let me first express our deep sympathy and solidarity to those affected by the terrible forest fires. The Commission stands by your side, Prime Minister, and we must make sure that such tragedies are never repeated. Greece, its people and Greek civilisation have shaped Europe and its underlying values. One can safely say that the Greeks invented democracy and, above all, they knew how to defend it when it was under threat. This allowed their country to join the European Union after enduring a terrible dictatorship, thus proving that the future belongs to those who have the courage not to succumb to resignation, and the determination to face up to difficulties and take their fate into their own hands. Yes, the future belongs to those who choose to be architects of history. Greece is not only of historic importance to Europe, but it is also important to the future of Europe. It is impossible to imagine the future of Europe without Greece’s contribution. I am thinking in particular of its vital role in the stability of the Western Balkans, a region with a turbulent history, which needs firm reassurance about the prospect of EU membership in order to avoid a repetition of the tragedies we witnessed in the 1990s. And I would like once again to pay tribute to the courage and leadership of Prime Ministers Tsipras and Zaev, who have acted in a spirit of openness and compromise in order to break a long-standing deadlock that served the interests of neither country. (Applause) They have set an example for the whole region and the wider world. I am also thinking of the future of our Economic and Monetary Union and the harsh lessons which, together, we had to learn from the crisis of the last ten years that hit Greece so hard. Although others took a different view, the Commission has always believed that Greece has its rightful place in the euro area. I would like to pay tribute to the unprecedented efforts that have been made by the Greek people to maintain Greece’s rightful place at the heart of the European Union. This summer Greece has turned a new page. It has brought the stability programme to a successful close: it has put its public finances in order and even exceeded its budgetary targets. Its economy is on the rise: this year and next it is set to grow by 2%. Unemployment has already fallen sharply, although it remains unacceptably high. Over 100 000 new jobs have been created since the stability programme began. The credit for this achievement is shared between the Greeks and their European partners. It is a product of Europe’s recipe for success, which combines solidarity with responsibility. The solidarity shown by the European partners has been unprecedented – both in terms of financial assistance and in terms of support for reforms. The people of Greece have been strong in assuming their responsibility. Their efforts and sacrifices have laid the basis for this sustainable upturn. These are solid foundations on which Greece can now build. Yet, there are still economic challenges to overcome. The best investment that Greece can now make is to build confidence in its economy. That requires staying the course of responsible fiscal policies and reforms. This is the way to ensure long-lasting economic growth and a constant improvement of living conditions for the Greek people. In such a case, I do not exclude the possibility of the Greek economy surprising us on the upside. When I see the courage and determination which the Greek people have already shown, I am confident that they will succeed. And Greece can continue to rely on the solidarity of its European partners. In our Union, responsibility and solidarity go hand in hand. We proved as much when we drew lessons from the crisis and made our common currency more crisis-resistant. In order to arm ourselves better to face future challenges, we must take the necessary steps to complete our Economic and Monetary Union. The Commission’s roadmap is clear, its agenda is well-known – and this is an urgent priority for the autumn. We are finally making progress to complete our Banking Union and I trust we can move swiftly towards a real Capital Markets Union. The example of Greece shows that we can overcome problems when we join forces. The euro area has emerged from the crisis united and stronger because we chose common European solutions. As we look to the future of Europe, we must apply this spirit of finding common solutions to common challenges right across the board. This is what being part of the Union means: working together to address the issues affecting us all. Managing migration is one such common European challenge – it is not the responsibility of only one Member State or another. That is why we stood side-by-side with Greece when it mattered most. Thanks to the EU-Turkey Statement, arrivals are now down by 97% in the Eastern Mediterranean. We backed up our action with the financial resources to match, with Greece receiving a total of EUR 1.6 billion of EU funds to address migration challenges. And we set up a European Border and Coast Guard to make our borders more secure. We now have more than 1 600 officers across Europe, including 662 officers in Greece, at the borders with Turkey, Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The decisive action taken by the European Union has worked. But we can and must do more. Together, it is time that Member States agreed on a long-term solution covering all elements of migration, to help us balance solidarity and responsibility. There would be no stronger or more tangible proof to Europeans that the Union will deliver on its promises and stay united on the things that matter the most. I believe that to achieve this we should look to the teachings of one of Europe’s, and Greece’s, greatest minds, namely Aristotle. He taught that virtue is the middle between extremes; that understanding and compassion are central to the way a society works; and that we are all, above all else, social beings. In our long and often tragic history, we can see the damage wrought when we lose sight of this humanism. So the lesson for our future is simple. We must never lose sight of what binds us together: the values that we share; the living together in a society that we hold dear; and the compassion and solidarity that we show each other. That is what our Union is built on, and that is what our future must be built on.

The last time we were lucky enough to hear from you was in July 2015. I'm very changed. You came in and left this House with the applause of the populists and the Europhobes. You'll remember it perfectly, and so will we. Today, as we entered, we all applauded him. Greece was then immersed in an unprecedented economic and social crisis. It was a country on the brink of eviction. You remember it perfectly, and so do we. We Europeans were by their side, we were at the side of the Greeks when they needed us, we were at the side of the Greeks when financial markets shut down their government's money tap. When the rest of the world turned its back on the Greek people, his European family reached out to him. And together we managed to get ahead. Together we have. It wasn't easy, but we did it together. You'll remember it perfectly, and so will we. I will not be the one who detract from your government's merits, Mr Tsipras. His government has been an essential and necessary actor, as was That of President Samaras. But your intervention today—let me tell you—has sinned of triumphalism and personalism. And he has omitted, I do not know if coincidentally or intentionally, some clearings that still weigh on his management. Greece's departure from the rescue programme is a success that we all applaud, but if anyone deserves to be applauded, it's not their government, it's the Greek citizens, because they have suffered and fought more than anyone else to get their country ahead. The Greeks are admirable, and their pain has been admirable. I have heard you speak of the merits of your Government, but I have not heard you speak of the merits of your people, I have not heard you speak of the merits of the Greek citizens. Greek citizens voted to continue in Europe and the euro, as some of their ministers fought windmills. I'm sure you still remember, and so do we. This success story you have told us today about Greece is incomplete if we omit the European contribution, but not that of governments and institutions, but that of European citizens. Today you have played to confuse the European Union with neoliberalism, with troika, with speculators, with money merchants. And yet that European Union, which you believe has become more technocratic and more nationalistic, has been the salvation of your government and the salvation of your country. Both have criticized stability policies from their party, which you should recognise that, thanks to stability policies, countries such as Greece, Portugal, Spain or Ireland are now emerging from the crisis. They're no worse, they're better off that they were economically and socially. You know that it was not the Europe of banks and corporations that lifted Greece out of the abyss, Mr Tsipras, but the Europe of taxpayers, who every morning get up to work. It has been savings from retirees, wage earners and small entrepreneurs across Europe that have made greece's bailout possible. I'm sure you remember it perfectly, and so do we. Europe is not just a market. Europe are values and principles, it is attachment to democracy, justice and the rule of law. Europe is solidarity, it is understanding, it is support, it is to help each other when we need it and not to throw stones at the glass ceiling, as should be the case with the migrant crisis, not only in Greece, but in all the southern states, just as happened this summer when the fires swept through Greece, and the Greek people had all our solidarity. Europe, Mr Tsipras, is to live up to the word given, is to sit at the same table, to see ourselves as allies and as friends, never as enemies. Just the opposite of what your Government did at the beginning of your term of office, when you were here precisely - you will remember and we remember too – when precious time was wasted criticizing the European family and handing over to the worst economic populism. Surely you will remember that EUR 100 billion has been lost because of the irresponsibility of your minister, Mr Varoufakis, your famous star minister. You remember him for sure, and so do we. Fortunately, that's the past. I see you changed, Mr. Tsipras, very changed, and I'm glad. Positive steps have been taken, but there is a long way to go and some doubts to be cleared. We are concerned that, nearly a month after leaving the bailout program, markets will continue to be suspicious of their economic policies. Understand that we're worried. We are concerned that growth will continue to stagnant and that the forecasts are not very optimistic, and understand that we are concerned. We are concerned that there will continue to be shadows of clientelism in Greek government procurement, and understand that we are concerned. We're worried that almost 500,000 young Greeks have had to leave Greece, and understand that we are concerned. We are concerned that a forthcoming election will change its political style and a return to opposition means a return to populism for your party. And understand that we care, because we, as we have already shown you, are your family. There are many lessons to learn from the crisis, Mr. Tsipras. We know that there are things that could have been done better and others that perhaps it would be appropriate not to have done. Now you have two options: continue on the path of reforms you have just undertaken or return to populism and radicalism. In your hand is, and we expect the best of you and your government. He was wrong in 2015 when he was here, as time and facts have shown. I trust you know how to choose the right choice this time. Because populism is neither right nor left, it is populism and always will be. Remember one thing: the far right is as dangerous as the far left, at least for democrats.

Prime Minister, you did not mention this today, but you could have mentioned it. How many children were put into poverty during the last eight years in Greece? How many families lost their homes? Here my dear friends from the PPE will disagree, but it is your austerity that caused this, it is not our austerity and it was the representatives of your family in Athens offering the Greek people to leave the Eurozone with an unforeseeable impact on the Eurozone, with an unforeseeable impact on the Greek nation and all over Europe. Don’t mix things up. You can be sure we will come back to that.  But we know exactly, Prime Minister, and you rightly did this in your great speech, to outline that Europe has to start on new endeavours and that we have to be bold and that we have not only to talk about the past but also about the future and that we have to shape the future, the European future. If you would like to do that, we need a new vision, a new objective, a new dream, a new policy and also our institutions have to be prepared for that.  This is the topic of today. But let me also be clear that if we would like to have this new vision in Europe, all revolutions start at home and each and every country has to contribute to this new endeavour. That also goes for Greece. You found a lot of problems in front of you when you took over in government and we have to be blunt on that. Our societies cannot be misled by greedy elites. Our societies cannot be fooled by those rich people who do not like to pay taxes and our societies cannot be irritated by public administrations working according to nepotistic politics and not according to the rule of law. Here everybody has to do his and her homework, but especially also Greece. You know that, Prime Minister, and you have reacted to that domestically. You have reacted to the situation in foreign relations; I can only praise what you did with Prime Minister Zaev. You are solving problems in the Balkans for the future of Europe, for peace in the Balkans. My Group is going to full—heartedly support you on that because this is a good step forward, a cornerstone for the new Europe.  I can only encourage you not to stop domestic reforms but rather to continue with the domestic reforms which are necessary, on the public administration, on the functioning of the rule of law, on striving towards a more fair and equal society.  Let me tell you the following: my Group started two years ago to renew our own programme. We decided that we cannot talk anymore about the economy without talking about the environment. We cannot talk anymore about the environment without talking about the social dimension. We are suggesting for the new programme for this European Union to strive towards the United Nations sustainable development goals, because we think this is the correct compass for the future. I do not have to give advice to you, Prime Minister, but only one idea. What if you go to Portugal? The newly—reshaped society of Greece goes to Portugal, talks to António Costa. You go to Spain, and talk to Pedro Sánchez. You could say, look, I have an idea. You could also go to Italy. Salvini will perhaps not listen to you – but Italian society I am pretty sure would listen to you – and you could say, look, this Mediterranean area has a great heritage, but it could also have a great future. What about developing a master plan for safe and sustainable energy? A master plan for better logistics, on land as well as on the sea, for fair and smart mobility. A master plan for high quality services, in tourism as well as in agriculture, for better products for a better future of the European Union, for a better world. You can say this master plan will be put up together, as the region, as the societies, as the countries of the south. Once we have this master plan for the Mediterranean we say, look, European Commission, we need your support, and you could support us on that because this is the future of our region, this is the future of the European Union and this is the future of the Mediterranean. Then you could say, look, political parties, if you come up with the lead candidates, if you would like to form the new mandate, the new governance, we will only vote for somebody who is full—heartedly supporting us on this master plan because the whole European Union needs a master plan like this for the sake of the next generation. If you go that path, we will be with you, we will support you, and that would be the best for our children and grandchildren.

Mr Prime Minister, Mr Tsipras, since I am the first of the Greek MEPs to speak, I would like to welcome you here to our European Parliament. Listening to you, you reminded me of Mr. Samaras who four years ago sat where you sit and told us about the success story of his second memorandum. Today you told us about the success story of your third memorandum and when, when you leave burnt earth, and I do not mean the Eye, when you have turned Greece into a vast social cemetery, when we have thousands of unemployed, when we have millions of poor, when our youth leaves the country, when there is a pension cut, when we have hunger wages, when there is looting of public property , with the Occupying Fund that will operate for 99 years, when we have a tax resalto in the pockets of the Greeks, the tax ENFIA, the increase of VAT on the Aegean islands, which cannot stand other refugees and illegal immigrants. You left unanswered unrelenting questions, Mr Tsipras, that is why Mr González Sons and the European People's Party are shaking your hand, you did not tell us where the EUR 288 billion that Greece took as loans went because, if you gave us an answer, you would say what Mr Dijsselbloem still said, that these funds went to save the lenders. , to save foreign banks, to really save the euro itself and not Greek citizens. Because that's the reality. You must tell us, Mr. Tsipras, why you are applying the memorandum measures at 100%, but you have taken only 70% of the loan capital of the third memorandum and returned EUR 24 billion, as a tip, back to the lenders, when you could use this money to create a Borrowers' Salvation Fund so that the Greeks would not lose their homes to the crows. , to recapitalise the insurance funds so as not to reduce pensions, to create 300 000 new jobs in order to have growth. And you're implementing the lenders' austerity budget. I ask you, Mr. Tsipras: will you implement what you said in 2014? Will you enter the German allowances in the state budget? Will you order the implementation of the Distomos decision on German reparations? Once you have implemented the enhanced supervision that you have accepted and Regulation 472, apply at least one point of this regulation, which allows you to audit the debt. That is the reality, but there is another way, Mr. Tsipras.  There is another way to go. You told us about the despicable agreement of the Prespas that really makes Mr Zaev a free dude, who will come here on Thursday and pretend to be Macedonian, talk about so-called Macedonian ethnicity, talk about so-called Macedonian language, talk about so-called Macedonian citizenship and not About North Macedonians. We therefore believe in a special relationship between Greece within the European Union and within the euro area, a special relationship with regulations in important sectors of the Greek economy that will breathe new life into Greece, in order to have a strong Greece within the Europe of nations and homelands, within Europe that respects national identity, respects national traditions, protects the Greek family , it will protect the European family and solve the demographic, not through mass migration, but with the support of the European family itself. These are our positions, Mr. Tsipras. We remain unrepentantly anti-monumental and we fight to throw the troika out of Greece and take back our country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, to Prime Minister Tsipras, I should say ‘Welcome back to the European Parliament’. You know, four years ago, Prime Minister, you were a little afraid, I thought, to come here to this plenary, but today, unlike four years ago, you are not here to talk about the Greek crisis: you have rather more solid ground under your feet, if I may put it like that. You want to talk, and you have talked, among other things, about our common future, the future of the European Union. Nevertheless, let me say something first on the Greek crisis. I think that, whatever our opinion about what happened in recent years, we can all say it is good news that Greece no longer depends on European aid. But, I have to tell you, I’m not as enthusiastic as the German Minister of Finance, Mr Scholz, who said the three Greek rescue packages were a sign of solidarity. If this whole exercise was a sign of solidarity, then, as far as I am concerned, he can keep it. I am more of the opinion of Mr Dijsselbloem who said, a few weeks ago in his assessment of the Greek crisis, that both sides were to blame: Greece, on the one hand, for not reforming deeply enough or fast enough and, on the other hand, Europe for focusing only on pure accountancy and austerity instead of asking for reform from day one. What didn’t happen were deep reforms in the Greek economy and in Greek society, and that has been, and still is, my problem with what happened in Greece. So the key question now extends beyond this Greek crisis, Mr Tsipras: is Greece, and by extension the whole eurozone, ready for the next crisis? Because we know that the next crisis will come. We don’t know when. If we knew, we would be rich, of course, but it will come. The end of the economic cycle is there and the question is: are we ready for that? Well, my answer in this debate is ‘no’. Europe is not ready for the next crisis that may overcome us. Greece was, in fact, a small problem, let’s be honest. I call it a small problem and, from another perspective, Mr Tsipras, you naturally call it a very big problem, but let’s face the reality: the accumulated debt of three decades was EUR 300 billion. You know what that is: it is 2% of the yearly European wealth that we create, EUR 15 trillion a year. I was in China and in the Treasury in America, explaining the Greek crisis, and I have to tell you that when I tried to explain it, and I gave the figures, they said to me: ‘What is the problem?’ The problem is, naturally, that 20 years after the introduction of the euro and the single currency – and this, I hope, will be the conclusion of our debate with you – 20 years after the introduction of the euro, Mr Tsipras, we are still not capable of facing such problems as we have had with Greece and as could happen tomorrow with other countries in the European Union, because we do not have the right institutions. We do not have the right governance. We have, in fact, only the European Central Bank and Mr Draghi to steer the European Economic and Monetary Union. And you know, and I know and everybody in this House knows, that this is impossible. We need a fully fledged banking union, and, Mr Dombrovskis, although you say that we are making progress, we don’t have it today. We need a common eurozone budget, which we don’t have today. We need a safe euro asset, which could be a eurobond or something similar – although the Germans will call it differently – to compete with the other big currency, the dollar, and we don’t have that safe euro asset. And we also need a European Minister of Finance (instead of three commissioners responsible for the euro as today), and we don’t have it. And that is the problem. The conclusion is that if, tomorrow, something happens again in Greece, in Italy or in another Member State of the European Union, this monetary union will not be capable of addressing the reality, and the worst will happen again. You will remember, Mr Tsipras, that four years ago we had an energetic – some have even said a ‘ferocious’ – exchange of views in the House here. This time I will keep it moderate because I have to save my energy for Mr Orbán this afternoon, so please be aware of that, but you will certainly remember that I asked you a question at the end: how do you want to be remembered in history, as an electoral accident or as a revolutionary reformer? Well, you’re certainly not an electoral accident, that is clear because you are still here, but my answer today is that you didn’t become one or the other. My feeling and my assessment, in terms of the reality on the ground in Greece, is that – in spite of all the efforts that so many people, so many ordinary Greek citizens, have made – the old Greek system is largely still in place. I don’t see markets opening, I don’t see professions being deregulated, I don’t see a vibrant private financial sector active in the Greek economy. But the same is true not only for Greece: the old system of the eurozone is also still in place. The word ‘crisis’, as we know, comes from a classical Greek word meaning, in fact, a moment of truth, a moment of decision, a moment of choice. Well, I think that Greece, Italy and the whole eurozone will remain under threat if we do not make a choice in the coming months and years, at this moment of the end of the Greek crisis, to bring about the re-foundation of our Union and reform of the Monetary Union. If we were not to do so, it would be a scandal, a tragedy not only for Greece but for Europe. So, what I would say to you, Mr Tsipras, is that I liked the end of your story, when you made an appeal to all pro-Europeans to come together. I liked it. Why? Because you did not fall into the trap of the extremists on the right or on the left (because they exist on the left, too), of saying ‘no’ to Europe, making war against Europe and thinking that only national recipes can save us. I liked that, and it is good that you said what you did to the face of your own friends.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for joining this debate on the future of Europe. There is much to talk about on the future of Europe and much is at stake because the very existence of this amazing project, here on this continent, is being called into question. We need to find new strength for our European project and, actually, I think a look back will be helpful in looking forward. For me, one of the key things about the Greek crisis was that one of the fundamental promises of the European Union was thrown into doubt – the promise that the European Union would bring prosperity and well—being to its citizens. That promise was broken. All of a sudden, Europe was bringing poverty. We can argue that it’s all right because there was a reason why there was a crisis and it was not in Europe, and you can say it was obviously national finance ministers who were doing the main part of the job, so not really Brussels – that’s all true, but it doesn’t solve the problem that Europe was not able to find a common solution of solidity and solidarity.  Prosperity and well—being: that is one of the Union’s fundamental policy goals. That is why we do policies – to fight for our citizens to bring them a better life. So far, we have had a lot of nice promises, including here in the EU, about how nice it would be to have a social Europe and to have more social policies, but we don’t have them yet. One of the key lessons from Greece is that we need to finally create that social Europe, and that we get binding social targets, which are on the same level as the economic rules that we already have. We don’t need more empty declarations. We need access to proper housing and to medical care for all Europeans. We need an unemployment support scheme to protect citizens from economic crises and to allow Member States to cope with asymmetric shocks and to recover more quickly, and we need a framework directive on minimum income schemes so that we have a safety net everywhere, ensuring well—being in the European Union. More than anything else, we also need to address the big problem of youth unemployment, which is becoming even more than an economic problem because if you have a whole generation without a perspective, this is also a problem of democracy. I would agree that since 2008 we still haven’t come to terms with how to prevent any future financial crisis. We have Member States who are blocking the banking union parts, like the Deposit Guarantee Scheme, and any proposals for mechanisms to absorb asymmetric economic shocks have been spineless so far. Also, our economic policies are being held hostage by national politics and we are not getting where we need to be. Crises can happen at any moment and we need to be prepared and resilient. We should really abandon the dogma of fiscal consultation for its own sake and instead focus on sustainable investments that soften the effects of economic shocks and prevent their escalation and proliferation. We also need a support mechanism for Member States in economic hardship that fits with European principles and European rules. This is not only an act of solidarity – it is not just a nice handout; it is a very vital piece for the survival of our Union. To have a sustainable economy that provides good jobs, we also need to finally start the social ecological transformation of our economy. We have some good examples of that in Greece. Local initiatives, such as on the island of Tinos on recycling and the energy social enterprise in Karditsa, are very important trailblazers for the future economy. It’s very good to have local initiatives, but we also need to have a European plan for social-ecological transition. Already, more than one million jobs exist in the renewable sector, so leading the way as regards the climate will also pay off in terms of jobs. Joint European action is also needed with regard to refugee protection. Greece was the main point of arrival for Syrians, Iraqis and Afghanis fleeing from war and persecution. Later on it was Italy, at some point it was Spain and Malta. Who knows – maybe it is going to be Poland tomorrow. We don’t know, but we can no longer leave a single Member State, or even an island, alone to do the job that we have to do all together. The European Parliament has put forward a good proposal. I really hope, Prime Minister, that your colleagues in the Council will finally make a move on that. It was the fishermen from Lesbos, it was the grandmothers in Idomeni and it was the many helpers all over Greece who saved so many lives, but they also saved humanity itself and they saved the face of all of us in Europe. I wonder – what are we giving back in return? (Applause) Those courageous people who are saving lives should not be criminalised, as we are seeing in some Member States. Greece has been hit hard by climate change. Many of the previous speakers mentioned the forest fires, which were really, really severe. Of course, it was not just Greece; we even had forest fires up in Sweden. Europe needs to get its act together finally to combat climate change. This is really a vital question for our planet and our continent. Greece has much to offer in regard to a solution: it has plenty of sun and plenty of wind. Oil drilling, though, is a thing of the past. It poses serious risks to the environment and it harms the climate that we all depend on. I really hope that Greece will abandon all drilling plans and that it will be a frontrunner in renewables and lead the path as it can be. Islands like Tilos show the way and I really hope that there will be more examples like this. Lastly, Prime Minister, I really want to congratulate you on your truly historic achievement. You have found a solution to a conflict where all predecessors have failed. The agreement on North Macedonia is an example for Europe. It’s an example of how to solve conflicts peacefully – without violence, without a big struggle – and try live in harmony with your neighbours. That is really an example for Europe. Thank you for that.

Mr President, Prime Minister, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his excellent work and for the work she has done. Yes, the third memorandum came to an end a few days ago. This is his great success, but – and here I expressly disagree with Mr Gonzalez Pons – it has not been an act of solidarity, but has been an enormous burden that has been placed on the people of Greece. And it cannot be seen as a prime example of how crises in the European Union will be dealt with in the future. That must be made clear. What has happened here has been a humanitarian disaster, and the institutions, and the right in particular, have helped to create it, because they felt that they had to put a left-wing government in check and say that alternatives must not be thought of in the first place. That was their approach! However, and we agree on this too, euphoria is not appropriate today. It really is not all over yet: the debt still exists. They have not disappeared with the end of the memoranda. The demand for the creation of budget surpluses remains. The country remains under some kind of control, and securing humanitarian supplies for refugees requires a great deal of commitment from the whole of the European Union. The conditions must now be created for Greece to really be able to act. What happened to the debt conference? Not just for Greece, but for all the other states that are also under a debt burden? It is quite clear that in a country like Italy, for example, you cannot act in the way that we did with Greece. We all know that we are facing an imminent financial crisis. Should the whole thing collapse like a house of cards again? We need sustainability, we need stability, we need more democracy, we must finally give the people of Greece, in other Member States, a sign of hope and common ground, of solidarity.  What is not possible, for example, and we must clarify this retrospectively for each other: it is not acceptable for a member of the European Union to be removed from European law, for the EU, including the Commission, to accept the violation of fundamental rights. The fact that we are no longer talking about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Charter of Social Rights – none of this is possible! Here we expect a rethink! Only then can we also give the people of the European Union the signal of what it is all about to be in a common Union.  Moreover, who represents the future of the EU? For me, these were above all those people, those Greeks, who built social networks of solidarity with great courage and commitment, be it as neighbourhood aid, medical care, much more. You have sent the message that it is solidarity between peoples, solidarity also between the peoples of the European Union, that holds us together. There must also be a people's Europe and not simply to get the highest possible profits or repayments for the banks.  Greece, as Prime Minister Tsipras noted, has endured its modern odyssey and reached Ithaca. But this is only the first step. This is only the first step, this is a stopover. We must now fight together to secure the future of the EU together with Greece, together with the other threatened states. In this sense: for more solidarity, for cohesion, for social justice between The Member States, for the reduction of imbalances – this is the future of the European Union.

A case in which Europe has shown its most ruthless and evil face, with bureaucrats and professors intent on playing the greatest socio-economic experiment in history. A few months ago you celebrated the end of the austerity programme. But the results of the troika are clear to everyone: 95 % of the 216 billion disbursed up to 2016 did not benefit the citizens, but ended up in private banks, also their own. As with privatisations: much of the public assets – airports, railways, ports – have ended up in the hands of German and French companies. Always them. And I do not list the dramatic litany of GDP data: income, poverty, unemployment, pension cuts, homelessness, suicides, starving children. And to think that for professors such as Mario Monti, former Italian Prime Minister, proclaimed by the spread and not by the people, Greece was the most concrete manifestation of the great success of the euro. A few days ago, he also announced that he was considering a return to politics, because the citizens are asking him to do so. Perhaps the first unfortunate attempt to deal with popular consent was not enough for him. Prime Minister Tsipras, you have not lost to Europe, you have lost to your people. Initially, it is true, he tried to resist. Then, Europe asked, indeed ordered, and you executed. And luckily he had to build another Europe. The truth is that this Union is always the usual one: either Germany, and a few others like it, or it is not. The Mediterranean countries, those that were supposed to be close to you, turned their backs on you. Even the previous Italian government, in words, promised you help, but then he was the most convinced accomplice of the unholy austerity policies. This is what Matteo Renzi did with Greece, and you know it. That is what the governments of the so-called Socialists have done. Prime Minister Tsipras, you are not asking me, but I want to give you some advice: think about it, two, a hundred, a thousand times, before joining the European Group of Socialists in the next parliamentary term. Think about it before you ally with those who humiliated Your people. That is the problem: a Union in name and not in fact, a huge gap between North and South, a strong Union with the weak and weak with the strong. And the truth is that we Mediterranean countries do not want to continue to be the useful idiot of Europe. This issue must be put to the European tables immediately. The European Commission and Mr Juncker must approach it with the same exceptional footing and the incredible determination with which they resolve other priorities, such as daylight saving time. Europe has been cruel to the Greeks, it has made a historic political, economic, social and moral mistake. On behalf of this institution, which is the only one elected by the citizens, I would like to apologise to the Greek people, and for the sake and future of Europe all this must never happen again with any other European people.

But that is not because of all these ‘hallelujah’ stories about a Greece that it is going so well. Mr Tsipras has achieved a lot, but is it over now? No. Still, the future of Europe is brighter every day, and that is because of the strong ties that are being built between Italy and the Visegrad countries, which show a victory of rationality over the destructive forces of socialism, liberalism or whatever they want to call themselves. These are countries with bright politicians that truly represent the people’s fight against the destructive policies of the EU: they fight mass migration; they fight a killing policy of austerity and they fight growing terrorism. And, therefore, I welcome Mr Tsipras, who was the hope of the Greek people. And I also understand from his words here that he has been forced by the Troika to bend to their financial demands, and now he is speaking their language. It has whipped and tortured the people of Greece into unemployment, into poverty and social disruption. Not least because of mass migration. And everybody knows it was not about the adjustment of the Greek economy: it is about saving German and French international banks. And that more or less succeeded. But is the ordeal over for Greece? No, it is not. I think that Greece will be enslaved by this financial burden for years to come. Perhaps for eternity.

Mr President, this lively debate in Parliament, and in particular in the European Parliament, is always very pleasant for me. Perhaps I did not cause the same enthusiasm or controversy as in my previous presence here, as Mr. Verhofstadt and other MEPs, but I imagine that I have provoked – and it was my aim to provoke – a strong and meaningful dialogue. Because indeed the case of Greece is a matter that must be studied very much by Europe. Because Greece was an experiment that set out our common European values. Because the crisis did not start yesterday, the crisis began in 2010. The adjustment programmes started in 2010 and it has been eight whole years since 2010 so that we can now look to the future with more optimism, so that we can today talk about the definitive end of the economic crisis and the adjustment programmes.  Allow me, dear and dear Members, to tell you that I am happy and happy that it is my government that has succeeded where three consecutive governments failed from 2010 to 2015. This in itself is an extraordinary political success. But what makes me really happy today is not that we have succeeded in completing the adaptation programmes. Because this could be achieved by another political force following a recipe that would leave the vast social majority in the works, leave it unprotected, as it did from 2010 to 2015. If I feel that we have achieved something, it is that on the one hand we have managed to deepen structural reforms, which have led us to fiscal consolidation and the exit from the crisis, while at the same time we have managed to protect, as much as we could in this budgetary margin that we had, the large social majority. This was the great difficulty and great success of these three years: the fact that, in 2015, when I had come here, Greece was on the verge of a major humanitarian crisis, because it had two million uninsured citizens who were not entitled to access health care; because there was no possibility of the minimum guaranteed income for 600 000 people. , social solidarity income; This picture today in Greece does not exist. No, I do not want to tell you here that it is the success story. But it is a path that, step by step, paves the way for the future. And if there's one thing I really want to tell you that I'm happy about, it's that we've succeeded in deepening structural reforms, in giving a path of consolidation of public finances, in achieving primary surpluses that no other government has managed to achieve with much, much tougher fiscal adjustment measures, while at the same time we have managed to protect the most vulnerable, not just the uninsured, not just the poor. , but above all to give a sample of writing to protect labour rights. For there was the core of the neoliberal hegemony of the policies imposed both before the memoranda and during the memorandums in Greece: the shrinking of work, the dissolution of work. Because some believe that only in this way can space be created for development. We believe the opposite: that space for development can only be created by supporting work and supporting social cohesion. This is a great ideological intersection and a difference that we, the progressives, have from the neoliberals. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like – because I have indeed listened with great interest to Mr Verhofstadt – to ask ourselves together: Why did Greece need three programmes in a row? Why did Greece take eight years, while other countries in this difficult economic position – Cyprus, Portugal, Ireland – managed to exit in three years? Big mistakes were made. Mistakes by both the Greek governments and the European institutions. And we have to admit that. Because the first programmes, instead of deepening the structural reforms that the country needs, rather than prioritising structural reforms, have prioritised an unprecedented fiscal adjustment, which has de facto led to an economic impasse. It has led to an unprecedented internal devaluation, a fall in consumption and a vicious cycle, a spiral of recession and austerity. On the contrary, we reached a difficult agreement in 2015, but it was a milder budgetary adjustment agreement, with prioritisation in structural reforms, which previous Greek governments did not want to prioritise. They preferred to cut pensions and wages instead of making structural reforms. Precisely because there were organized interests, which they did not want to touch, and customer relations. That's the truth, whether some of you like it or don't like it, because you want to defend political forces that belong to your own political families. I come to reply to Mr GonzálezPons, who has certainly told me that I have changed. I don't know if that's a bad thing. It is bad for some to remain incorrigible and try to defend what is not defendable. I have, of course, heard you criticise. And I think the criticism is very beneficial for the Republic and I am very happy that you did it to me. I want to remind you that today is September 11th. In addition to the horrific day of the terrorist attack in the United States, it's another black anniversary. It's the anniversary of Salvador Allende's death. I am sorry, Mr González Reasons, that in your speech you have reproduced – I do not know if you are doing so consciously or not – the theory of two extremes. I hope at least you do not think, like some of your friends, like-minded people in Greece, that dictator Pinochet has implemented interesting policies to copy, especially with regard to the insurance system.  But I would like to answer two things specifically from what you said. You talked about nepotism and populism. I would therefore like to remind you that, if you want to talk about nepotism in Greece, there is unfortunately a faction, the conservative faction, which has offered Greece so much – because I want to be fair and fair – in which the children of some successful or non-successful prime ministers usually become leaders. This is the tradition in Greece. Is this anywhere else in conservative parties across Europe? Don't look to us for nepotism or for a client state.  You also talked about populism. I'm sorry, but again in your own party you have to turn when you talk about populism. Because there's no greater populism than playing with national issues and changing your position to fish in the murky waters of the far right and not to break up your party. The attitude of the New Democracy party, which belongs to your political family, in relation to what is necessary for Europe, what is necessary for the Balkans, what is necessary for our region, to solve the problem of the name of our northern neighbour, the Macedonian problem, is an attitude that will be described in future history books as the definition of populism and opportunisticism. I would like to close my remarks to everything you have said in response to something that I imagine you have said without knowing much detail. Mr. Marias said a lot of it, inaccuracies. Mr Marias, of course, has come a long way from the left benches to be on the right benches of Parliament today, but I will reply to you, not to Mr Marias. You talked about 100 billion costs – you say it and many of your conservative fellow politicians say it again – which is the cost of negotiating Greece in that difficult six months; a six-month period in which mistakes were made on both sides, there is no doubt. But it is good that, when we speak in this Chamber, we do not speak in terms of political communication and inaccuracies. Because, if there were indeed a cost-burden of so many billions of euros, public debt would have increased accordingly.  But what exactly do those who claim that there was this cost say? They say that there would be growth momentum on paper in 2015, 2016, 2017, of the order of 20% of GDP, i.e. that the cost to the Greek economy that lost 25% of its GDP, i.e. a quarter of its national wealth, in the first four disastrous years, would supposedly be won if there was no political change in Greece. And how do you really? What policies? With what mr Samaras' previous governments, which you mentioned, had not even managed to have a positive balance, surplus budgets? When the primary surplus, for which he had signed up, was in the order of 4% and 4.5%, but had not managed to reach even 0.3%? With growth rates of 0.3%, which managed 0.4% in just one year in 2014? How would it achieve these rates that would bring back 20% of GDP? Well, these are targeted inaccuracies. As is the inaccuracy of the fact that, supposedly, Greece spent 40 billion on the recapitalisation of banks during this three-year period. Forty-five billion was the total cost of all three recapitalisations, but the recapitalisation made in our own years cost only 6 billion out of the 24 available from the third programme budgetary adjustment. I say this because some things have to be answered. And I say this because I believe that, if we want to look ahead, we must, with our existing ideological and political differences, at least, when we are at a dispute, stand against the real numbers and the reality that we have all faced.  I would like to conclude by saying this: during my speech I tried to point out, I tried to warn of a great and real and danger to Europe. This great and real danger, which concerns the very future of the European Union – an existential danger to Europe – from what I understand from many of the speeches, is not being treated as such. And I would like to say that we are faced with this great risk and because, if not mainly, of the fact that in previous years policies have indeed been prioritised with extreme signage, which were of course aimed at economic balance, but, in order to achieve it, have tried to save the banks without accounting for the cost of social. It is these policies that give the floor today, with a leading role, to extreme political forces. I would like to address once again the whole democratic arc, from the left of social democracy to the liberal centre, but also to you, the People's Party, because these forces are within you and are becoming dominant, hegemonic in political discourse. When you are forced to turn your political rhetoric towards nationalist, extreme, chauvinistic positions in order to reverse or stem the rise of the extreme right in your countries, you do nothing more than feed these extreme forces that will soon reach rates that will be worrying for all of us in Europe. And we have to stop that! To stop this, we must return to the founding values of the European Union, which are solidarity, which is social cohesion, which is the well-being of citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Μανώλης Κεφαλογιάννης (PPE).", "mepid": "125068", "text": "   Mr Prime Minister of Greece, I welcome you to the European Parliament.

Mr President, there have been many interesting questions, many interesting positions. Obviously I won't be able to answer everything, but I will try to answer as many as I can.  First of all, I would like to answer the honourable friend and acquaintance of the controversies in the Greek Parliament, Mr Kefaloyannis, to the question he asked me in relation to the presence in the European Parliament, in a few days, of the Prime Minister of our neighbouring country, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, who – if all goes well and I hope it goes well – in a few months will change both its name and its Constitution and it will be called 'Northern Macedonia'. Mr Kefaloyannis, in all the previous years mr Zaev's predecessor, Mr Gruevski, came to the European Parliament or other European institutions, what did he call himself and what did your colleagues, the vast majority of your colleagues, and of course the vast majority of your colleagues in the European People's Party call him? I don't know. A Skopje?  Mr Kefaloyannis, here we are in the European Parliament and therefore we cannot function, as we have often operated in Greece, putting our heads like an ostrich in the sand, with a taboo around us, only us Greeks, while the rest of the world – and of course here in the European Parliament you know this very well – was in another reality. Because 140 countries around the world, including the largest, the United States of America, China, Russia, recognise our neighbouring country by its constitutional name, which it has had for 25 years. And its constitutional name is \"Macedonia\". Of course, both Mr Gruevski and all the officials have called themselves 'Macedonians' over the years, but I have not seen you bothered by this. Just as I did not see you bothered when, all the previous years, both Mr Zaev and all his fellow citizens entered Greece – and they did well to enter Greece and also holiday en masse on the Greek coast, because this strengthened the Greek economy – so they entered the country with a passport which what it said? It said \"Macedonians.\" From now on, the passport will say \"citizens of Northern Macedonia\". This phrase will be added.  Nor do I know whether it has any value for you – to me it is of great value – the fact that in all previous years Mr Zaev's predecessor, with whom we have an excellent cooperation, Mr Gruevski, who belongs to the nationalist right, the far right, had filled his country, every city and every square in the neighbouring country. , with statues of Alexander the Great and with all those symbols that are characteristic of ancient Greek Macedonia and are an integral part of Greek history and tradition. From now on, no one will have the right to do this in the neighbouring country. Neither the current Prime Minister of our neighbouring country nor the future Prime Ministers will have the right to invoke Alexander the Great and Greek History as their own piece. Isn't that important to you? And, of course, what is perhaps most important of all is that it will confirm every Prime Minister of the neighbouring country from now on the clearly Slavic origin of his people and his language.  This, Mr Kefaloyannis, has not been the same until now. And I want to address both you and – not to turn the debate into an internal debate – and all MEPs to understand something. In Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, both I and Zoran Zaev are under intense attack. We're accused of being both traitors. Mr Mitsotakis in Greece and Mr Mickoski in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, who belong to the political family of the People's Party, accuse us, with exactly the same argument, which simply changes the sign, of being traitors and of having brought a damaging agreement. I would therefore like to put this to your discretion, ladies and gentlemen, and say that, precisely because both conservative leaders accuse us of being traitors and of having made a traitorous agreement, we have probably done something good for our peoples, and me and Zoran Zaev. We are probably going down a path to the future, towards peace, towards the prospect of cooperation and the coexistence of our peoples, a path that will make history. And I'm proud that we've accomplished that. One Member, I imagine from Hungary, referred to Mr Orbán, saying that he is 'the bad student', as opposed to me being 'the good student', on the occasion of course the fact that my colleague, Mr Orbán, will be in this Chamber in a few hours. Look, I want to answer you on Substance. Because, you know, you can't judge politicians or politicians by tagging, but by seeing and criticizing politically the ideas they represent and the values they stand for. Some in Europe, of course, can make policy with the European Union's money, because solidarity is à la carte for them; some in the European Union can make a safe policy, too, because their countries are enclosed and have land borders, not maritime ones; some in the European Union may remember European values whenever it is in their interest.  You said we brought the immigrants. I don't know. I thought the wars brought this great wave of migration and refugee flow to Europe. I would like to ask you, in reply: do you really think that any country in Europe, even if it is small and enclosed and not with maritime borders, can survive on its own? Without help? No solidarity? Without cooperation? Do you really think that cooperation, aid and solidarity will be à la carte whenever it is in your interest, and that, when the problem is not in your own backyard, you will throw it to the person next door? Europe cannot go ahead like this. I have also heard a colleague of yours talk about the traitoral future of Europe. Well, the logic of 'everyone alone', the logic of 'Greece first', 'France first', 'Italy first' is a logic that will lead Europe to disintegration. That is exactly the point I tried to raise in my speech.  I heard the friend of a Member of the European Parliament from the River, Miltiadis Kyrkos, say that he was confused. Yes, Miltiadis, the reality we live in is confused. And we must all unravel in this tangled reality what the primary threat is. The differences I have with many other colleagues, both from the left and from the Social Democracy area, even from the Liberal Centre or Ecology, are given. But the snake's egg is currently incubated in Europe, just like in the 1930s. And just as, in the 1930s, the primary threat was met with the widest possible coalition of forces that had differences, that is what I believe is our duty today. And to close all this reference to immigration, let me tell you that I am happy with what we have achieved inland, but the situation on the Greek islands is extremely difficult. We don't honor any of us in this situation. But we are obliged to support an agreement without which things would be much worse for all of us. That's why Greece needs support. That is why synergies and cooperation are needed in this direction. And of course it is necessary, when we talk about refugees or immigrants, not only to talk about numbers and brutal numbers and statistics, but to look behind the numbers and faces of those people who have names, names. They may not be European names, they may not be names familiar to us, but these people have a name, a person, feelings, values, \"believe\" and want to live a better life.  I heard the New Democracy spokesperson and MEP, Mrs Spyrakis, abandon me. I am pleased that, I repeat, dialogue and confrontation are the vitality of the Republic. I would like to tell you the following: you referred to me and the gathering of a few thousand extreme elements the day before, three or four thousand in Thessaloniki. Nothing to do with the big rallies that actually took place in February. You know I'll be the last to deny every citizen the inalienable right to demonstrate in a democratic state. But I would like to remind you, Mrs Spyrakis, that it was you who, for years, as a prominent journalist on a television station, almost every night, when we actually had mass demonstrations with a really great repression, the first five years of your station were going out and you were actually exercising the function of information, as you yourself admitted, in a way that concealed the truth. At the time, you had no particular sensitivity either to presenting the actual numbers of the demonstrations, nor to highlighting the repression and violence suffered by these demonstrations. Today I see that you are very sensitive. I'm glad for that sensitivity. But I want to assure all your colleagues here in the European Parliament that sensitivity must not be à la carte and that in Greece there is neither repression nor violence. On the contrary, in these three years the social, political and democratic rights of citizens have been upgraded by a series of legislative interventions.  I would like to close without distressing your other colleague and compatriot, Mr Kyrchos, because he has raised specific questions. Ladies and gentlemen, you are all aware that Greece, with its exit from the adjustment programmes, is now a country like all the other countries of the euro area, with a peculiarity, as of course all the countries that have been in enhanced monitoring and cooperation programmes with the institutions and in particular with the Commission. Like the other euro area countries, greece, from now on, will be obliged to meet the targets we have set together, our obligations, that is, the fiscal target of 3.5% of GDP surplus by 2022. That's our deal. But it will be the Greek government that chooses the instruments and policies to meet these goals, as is the case in all other eurozone countries and those that have come out of programmes. So these policies and these instruments, with full statistics and forecasts for each subsequent year, we will discuss them by submitting our budget to the Commission every October. So we will do this year in relation to 2019 and together we will take those decisions, which will be the right ones, in order to strengthen the growth momentum of the Greek economy. And growth momentum means no more austerity, no more cuts, a boost in consumption, to the extent, of course, I repeat, that this will allow us to meet the budgetary targets. It's that simple!  I close with a comment on the future of Europe. A question has been asked about how we dream of the democratisation of the euro area and the course of the European Union from now on. We do believe in the need for political deepening. And we do believe in strengthening Parliament's role. You will remember that I was one of those who tried and succeeded in ensure that the debate on the fiscal adjustment programme in Greece over the last three years does not take place behind closed doors and that the European Parliament plays an essential role in this debate; that policies are not decided behind closed doors. I don't know if we've achieved that in its entire right. But we have made an effort in this direction. I also believe that in the crucial next period we must decide on an enhanced Community budget, on a budgetary programme that will enable us to strengthen convergence between the Member States of the euro area and, of course, on the possibility of greater transparency and accountability in the next period. I support the view of a minister of the euro area finances, but I believe at the same time in the need for a minister of social cohesion working in the euro area. This is because I do not believe in one-dimensional fiscal fetishism, but in the need to be able to achieve the budgetary path within objectives at the same time as social protection. We are not and am not in favour of a two-speed Europe. We are in favour of a functioning Europe, the enhanced cooperation provided for in the current European Treaties, especially since it can achieve our objective of a democratic, social and ecological Europe through them.  With these thoughts, I would like to warmly thank you all for your interest, for your questions, for your opposition and to tell you that, despite our disagreements, our strong, despite our tensions, we have managed to go one step further. We have managed to escape the great vortex of crisis. Let us draw our conclusions on the causes that led us to it, so that we can now make the major changes that Europe needs, so that the same mistakes are not repeated, so that we do not find ourselves in the same difficult position we have found ourselves in in previous years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 45, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Mr President of the European Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to be present today at the European Parliament's headquarters in Strasbourg, in front of the elected representatives of 28 states who have chosen to make the European continent an unrivalled model in the world. A model of exchange, integration and unity at all levels, which transforms the countries of the European Union into a single space in which peoples' dreams are based and where principles and ideals are shared, while safeguarding every specificity and civilization and the belonging of peoples to their land, their language, their heritage and their homeland. The strength of this democratic construction and edifice has enabled the consolidation of a genuine peace within the European continent, thus extinguishing the desires of the use of war as the only method of solving problems. These peoples and states believe that their strength, interests and prosperity depend on their unity and the sharing of their democratic values, not on conflict to ensure their success. It is very regrettable to see the emergence of certain separatist and secessionist tendencies that threaten the balance of this pioneering edifice in the meeting of peoples. Ladies and gentlemen, at a time in our history when the voice of humanity is weakening and the interests of the great powers are oversteering all limits at the expense of human justice and solidarity, we believe that only dialogue, mutual respect and the return to implementation of the universal principles of human rights, of communities , and countries will help defuse the violence, wars and extremism that have made the world and our Region of the Near East a place inflamed by hatred, fear and tension. War, although the economy is the real engine, cannot be waged on a solid foundation; it requires a cracked, permeable terrain, ready to ignite. There is nothing like incitement to intolerance, religious, community and ethnic extremism, nothing like the rejection of the other to cause this disintegration, to crack the base and to light the flames of war. What is happening in our region today brings us even more attached to the very foundations on which the State of Lebanon was built and, above all, to the democratic regime that characterizes it, which, despite certain shortcomings, brings together all the components of the Lebanese people and reflects the very essence of lebanon's message of coexistence, diversity, pluralism and cultural richness. As a result of the conflicts in our region, Lebanon has experienced political divisions, but not at the national level. Political rhetoric was certainly inflamed, but it did not set fire to the powder. When some moved away from the normal path of embracing extremism and fundamentalist thinking, they were immediately rejected, both by their community and by the country. Indeed, Lebanese society, by its very nature, is not a breeding ground for extremism and rejection of the other. Respect for freedom of belief, freedom of expression and opinion, and the right to difference are an integral part of Lebanese culture. This Lebanese specificity helps the country to overcome its problems and consolidate its peace and stability. It can also serve as an example to other countries, in order to build a future more in tune with modernity and human rights, especially if we succeed in filling certain gaps and reaching the democratic maturity to which we aspire. In this context, Lebanon greatly appreciates the European Union's awareness of its specificity, its uniqueness. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed this in the second paragraph of its resolution 2150, in which it stresses the many specificities and the great religious diversity that make Lebanon a unique country. Lebanon is the oldest democracy in the Middle East, political power is shared equitably between Christians and Muslims, making it an example of peaceful coexistence that must be supported in order to continue on this path. Ladies and gentlemen, dear Members of Parliament, last May, Lebanon organised, despite some political tug-of-war which delayed its holding, legislative elections which were held according to a modern electoral law, based on proportional representation. These elections resulted in a more balanced and precise representation of the political forces involved, thus allowing for greater diversity within the parliament and thus strengthening democratic life. In this context, I must therefore commend the work carried out by the Union's election observation mission, led by Mrs Elena Valenciano, who accompanied the various stages of the preparations for the elections and the conduct of the elections. This European Parliament's election observation mission presented a positive report on the electoral process last July. This report contains various new recommendations, made to fill some gaps. These recommendations will certainly be taken into account in the future. In this regard, we wish to strengthen cooperation between our Parliament and the European Parliament by intensifying joint meetings and exchanges of experiences, in order to promote the performance and activity of our legislative power, in line with current requirements. Ladies and gentlemen, my country is currently facing many challenges, including difficult economic conditions. We recently launched an economic plan, outlined in a roadmap to revitalize productive sectors and modernize our country's infrastructure. This plan reinforces the decisions taken at the CEDRE conference. I have placed the fight against corruption and the promotion of transparency among my priorities. We have already made some progress in this area. Ladies and gentlemen, Lebanon has taken its share of the economic, social and security crisis in the region. Terrorist organizations have infiltrated our borders to the east and north to make it a springboard for their bloody operations in the interior of Lebanese territory. However, our army launched a successful military offensive, which resulted in the defeat of the terrorists and the liberation of our territories. Our army continued to work in collaboration with all organs and services of the state, in order to dismantle the dormant terrorist cells until their total elimination. In this way, we have been able to restore the security and stability of the country. Nevertheless, the crisis caused by the displaced Syrians is the one that weighs most on Lebanon. Its consequences are devastating for the economic, security and social sectors. In the name of human solidarity, Lebanon has welcomed more than 1.5 million refugees who have fled the hell of the war in Syria. However, in a small country like ours, with a high population density, limited resources and already suffering from weak infrastructure and rising unemployment, this burden is very difficult to bear. You are aware of the devastating effects of the presence of Syrian refugees. The international community has not taken its share of responsibility in supporting Lebanon in the face of the effects of the presence of migrants. We therefore call on the implementation of financial support decisions, particularly those adopted at the Brussels conference. We also call for consideration of the reservations we have expressed on certain points of the final communiqué of the Brussels conference, in particular those relating to the voluntary return of refugees or displaced persons, in particular the link between this return and the political solution, or the integration of migrants or displaced persons into the labour market in the host countries. It should be remembered in this regard that Lebanon is a country of emigration and not a country of settlement, much less a labour market. The Lebanese scattered throughout the world, and on the European continent in particular, are proof of this. Today, Lebanon aims to ensure the dignified and safe return of displaced Syrians and rejects any delaying manoeuvres in this regard. My country supports any move to find a solution to the mass displacement of Syrians on its territory, like the Russian initiative, and refuses to link the return of the displaced to a political solution that could be delayed. In this regard, I would like to remind you that the Palestinian people have been living in camps since 1948, particularly in Lebanon, awaiting a political solution and the implementation of Resolution 194. After 70 years of waiting, instead of a solution to the Palestinian problem, it is unfortunately a final settlement project that is beginning to loom on the horizon, as if the international community were adopting the policy of the adage \"giving what one does not have to the one who does not deserve it\". Ladies and gentlemen, on this day of September 11, we commemorate the events of September 11, 2001, a pivotal date that changed the course of world history and pushed the United States to declare war on terrorism, with the promise of freedom, democracy and a term for terrorism. Unfortunately, for the past 17 years and to this day, the war on terror has had the effect of spreading the war around the world rather than ending it. I quote in this regard a passage from an open letter I sent to world leaders in 1995, in which I warned them of the danger of the rise of fundamentalism that was beginning to emerge in some countries. Here is what I wrote: \"The latest events in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Algeria and, to a lesser extent, Paris, are only premonitory signs of conflicts that will threaten us tomorrow and that neither nuclear deterrence nor conventional war can stop. Fundamentalism, born of inequality in the application of international law and the frustrations of unbalanced development, risks drowning an entire civilization in obscurantism. No one is immune to the violence of ethnic and fundamentalist passions, and no border can contain them. Aren't these viruses grown in laboratories of political realism likely to contaminate those who, indifferent or complicit, have allowed them to germinate?\" Unfortunately, the whole world is now suffering from the repercussions of laboratory experiments of political realism and the neglect of the premonitory signs that could have put us on the path. I would add to this that international policy in the Middle East only exacerbates radicalization and hatred, and paves the way for violence and terrorism. There is no doubt that these justiceless policies are causing trouble in the application of democracy, and this in the pioneering countries, those who had been the first to establish it as a political system. Can preserving human rights at home and sacrifice them outside its borders help serve the interests of the great powers and be synonymous with democracy? This same policy prompted Israel to Judaize Jerusalem and make it its capital, ignoring all international resolutions as well as the votes of the Security Council and the UN General Assembly. Israel did not stop there, it even passed the law of the \"Jewish Nation State\". Added to this is the recent US decision to end UNRWA funding, which means the beginning of the de facto settlement of Palestinians in the countries that have hosted them, including Lebanon. This is something we reject in the name of justice and equality. Ladies and gentlemen, I come here today on behalf of Lebanon, as The Holy Father John Paul II described it. Its 5,000-year-old civilization, with its many and deep roots, has allowed its children, through its many and varied facets and dimensions, to spread throughout the world and integrate into all cultures, wherever they go. I take the opportunity to be with you today to renew an appeal, already launched especially from the United Nations rostrum, to make Lebanon a permanent centre for dialogue between civilizations, religions and races. This project is being followed by our ambassadors around the world and we hope that it will be proposed at the upcoming session of the UN General Assembly in 2019, just as we hope it will garner the support of European countries. For who better than the countries of Europe to know the importance of dialogue in order to fill the gaps, heal wounds and establish a culture of peace? Thank you for having me here today. Thank you for your attention. Long live Europe, long live Lebanon.

(Murmurs of disapproval) Today, we are debating the state of the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights in Hungary. Tomorrow, President Juncker will present his State of the Union, and I asked you before – I ask you now again, colleagues – today, what is the state of our Union? What shape are we in? Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union reads: ‘the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to a minority’. It continues: ‘these values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non—discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail’. By signing up to the Treaty on European Union, all the Member States made a commitment – an obligation to defend, respect and promote these values, regardless of political differences.  Are all the Member States fulfilling these commitments? I’m afraid not. The Hungarian Government has effectively silenced independent media. It has put academia on a leash, and future generations will not learn to appreciate critical thinking. It has replaced independent judges with those with a closer tie to the regime. It has rules on which churches are allowed to worship and which churches are not. It makes life miserable for NGOs that provide services to citizens in need, such as homeless people, migrants and refugees and marginalised groups like Roma. These are services that – to add insult to injury – lighten the work of local governments and are often financed through European Union funding. On top of that, individuals in the government have enriched themselves, their family members and their friends by means of public funding from European taxpayers’ money.  The report that is before you today comprehensively lists the actions that, together, represent a clear risk of a serious breach of the values of our Union. Unfortunately, nothing has improved since this report was voted on in June. On the contrary, this summer, one of the last independent news channels changed ownership and, from one day to another, became the mouthpiece of the government. The propaganda tax on NGOs got through Parliament, and whether the Central European University can continue to function in Budapest is still a big question. Since 2010, the European Parliament has been urging the Commission and the Member States to act. They did not do so. And it’s particularly disappointing that the Member States turned a blind eye to the structural erosion of the rule of law in a fellow Member State. It is not the Commission alone that is the so—called ‘guardian of the Treaties’. We are all the guardians of the Treaties. (Applause) We all have the task of protecting the rights of European citizens to live today in a society, as Article 2 reads, ‘in which pluralism, non—discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail’. It is therefore our duty to act, under the very same Treaty that Hungary decided to ratify. The Civil Liberties Committee, after consulting four committees of this House, concluded that an Article 7.1 procedure is inevitable. I do not think lightly about triggering that Article, but if this House fails to use this emergency brake, we fail to deliver to European citizens what was promised to them in the Treaty.  Colleagues, the time has come to make an important choice. Will you let a government violate the values upon which this Union was built without consequences, or will you ensure that the values of this Union are more than just words written on a piece of paper? Colleagues, I count on your support.

In concrete terms, we are dealing with sham legal systems in tenders: in more than one third of the procedures, only one company participates. And it is no consolation that things are even worse in Member States such as Poland. In the case of calls for tenders, your confidants, Prime Minister, are given special consideration, undermining procedures that undermine equal opportunities and prevent the development of a diversified economy.

Since the adoption of my opinion in committee, the situation has deteriorated further. The Hungarian Government is continuing its efforts to further depact the academic freedom and autonomy of its universities. In a latest attack, the government is once again attacking the most vulnerable in society and those who want to help them. It penalises all organisations that run programmes for the education and integration of migrants, including programmes financed with EU funds. A series of open and hidden measures further eroded media freedom. In doing so, the government is laying the axe to the foundations of our pluralistic society.  That is why the Committee on Culture is also calling for the opening of article 7 proceedings.

In 2011, the Venice Commission already expressed concern about legislative reforms in Hungary that threaten the rule of law understood as a democracy with separation of powers and independent justice. This year's elections were held in a hostile and intimidating atmosphere, according to the OSCE. The basic values of the European Union protect citizens from the arbitrariness of state power. Hungary has been a member of the European Union since 2004. When he joined it was a collective effort of Hungarians of different beliefs, realities and backgrounds.

The report covers a wide range of measures in different areas taken by the Hungarian authorities over the last few years which give rise to serious concerns from the perspective of our common EU values. In this context, let me stress that democracy in our Member States, in our European Union, cannot exist without the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights. They go together. These values characterise a society in which individual freedom, pluralism, non-discrimination and tolerance prevail. Sadly, the Commission shares the concerns expressed in the report, in particular, the concerns regarding fundamental rights, corruption, the treatment of Roma, and the independence of the judiciary. As regards fundamental rights, the report highlights important issues relating to civil society, academic freedom and media pluralism, which are crucial for the good functioning of democracy. Civil society is the very fabric of democratic societies and is threatened by measures taken by the Hungarian authorities that lead to a shrinking space for civil society organisations. As a consequence, the Commission has referred Hungary to the Court of Justice regarding its law on foreign-funded NGOs and has launched an infringement procedure on the Hungarian legislation criminalising assistance for asylum seekers. Moreover, the Commission is analysing the compatibility with EU law of Hungary’s recent law on the special tax on education, training and media campaign activities in the area of migration.  The Commission has also referred Hungary to the Court of Justice regarding the Hungarian higher education law for non-compliance with EU law, including academic freedom.  As regards the treatment of asylum seekers, the Commission has referred Hungary to the Court of Justice for non-compliance with EU law regarding its asylum and return legislation. Let me also stress that EU legislation provides that Member States have to ensure that the basic needs of persons in transit zones are covered and that they are treated in a humane and dignified manner. This includes providing food to asylum seekers staying in border zones. I would say that this is the humane – or, should I say, the Christian – way of doing things. (Applause) The Commission shows zero tolerance towards fraud against the EU budget and carries out regular audits to assess the functioning of the national management and control system, based on regularly updated risk management. If deficiencies are identified, adequate corrective actions are carried out. Through the supervisory role of the Commission, Hungarian operational programmes for EU structural and investment funds have been the subject of the highest amount of financial corrections in 2016 and 2017 of all the EU Member States. Moreover, the European Anti-Fraud Office has opened investigations where there was sufficient suspicion of fraud and other irregularities. On 13 July, following up on a proposal from the Commission, the Council issued Hungary with country—specific recommendations, stating that it should reinforce its anti-corruption framework to strengthen prosecutorial efforts and improve transparency and competition in public procurement. These recommendations are based on the 2018 European Semester country report for Hungary, where the Commission identified challenges related to the effectiveness of its national anti-corruption framework in preventing corruption, curbing favouritism in public administration, transparency and its access to information regime, and the prioritisation of fighting high-level corruption via effective investigations and prosecutions. The Commission will monitor and assess any measures taken by the Hungarian authorities to address these recommendations. The Commission launched infringement proceedings against Hungary in May 2016 for discrimination against Roma children on the grounds of their ethnic origin in the field of education. Hungary entered into a constructive dialogue with the Commission and has subsequently adopted legislative amendments to prevent segregation and to desegregate. Challenges concerning the functioning and independence of the judicial system in Hungary also require close monitoring. In particular, as raised in a 2018 European Semester country report, more could be done to better balance the powers between the President of the National Office for the Judiciary and the National Judicial Council. The Commission is also the guardian of the Treaties, I say to Parliament. When it comes to the application of EU law and the respect of the EU’s fundamental values, the Commission intervenes based on accurate and thorough legal analysis, it focuses on concrete national measures and it engages in a dialogue with the authorities. The Commission is using all the instruments at its disposal to address concerns, in the manner the Commission considers most effective. Let me remind you: it was the Commission which invoked the Article 7 procedure as regards a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law by Poland on 20 December 2017. This was an unprecedented step in the history of our European Union.  Unlike the European Parliament, the Commission has a right under the Treaty on European Union to launch infringement procedures and, in the case of Hungary, has launched many value-related infringement proceedings. It is also using other instruments, including audits and investigations relating to the use of EU funds and actions through the European Semester, the EU annual cycle of economic policy coordination.  The Commission remains committed to upholding the fundamental values of the Union and will continue to closely monitor the situation in Hungary in this regard. The Commission will not hesitate to take further action if necessary. My promise to you is that we will be relentless.

I know that you have already taken your position. I know that the report will be voted on by your majority. I also know that your opinion will not be changed by my post. Yet I have come to you, because you will be condemning not a government, but a country and a people. A Hungary that has been a member of the family of Christian European peoples for a thousand years will be condemned. A Hungary that contributed to the history of our great Europe with its work and, if need be, with its blood. They will condemn a Hungary that rebelled and took up arms against the world's largest army, the Soviets, and made a heavy blood sacrifice for freedom and democracy and opened its borders to its fellow East Germans when it was needed. Hungary fought for his freedom and democracy. I stand here now and see that hungary is being accused by those who inherited democracy, who did not have to take personal risks for freedom. And now they want to condemn the Hungarian freedom fighters of the anti-communist, democratic resistance. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for I stand here and defend my country because, for Hungarians, freedom and democracy, independence and Europe are issues of honour. That is why I say that the report before you is an Hungary, a violation of the honour of the Hungarian people. Hungary decisions are made by the electorate in parliamentary elections. You say nothing less than that the Hungarian people are not reliable enough to judge what is in their interest. You think you know better what the Hungarian people need than the Hungarian people themselves. I must therefore say that the report does not give respect to the Hungarian people. This report applies double standards, abuses power, overskras powers, and the way in which it is adopted violates the Treaty.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for For us in Hungary, democracy and freedom are not political issues, but moral issues. You now want to make a moral judgment based on a numeral majority and stigmatise a country and a people. You take on a heavy responsibility when, for the first time in the history of the European Union, you want to take a people out of European decisions. You would deprive Hungary of the right to represent its own interests in the European family to which it belongs. We have, and we will have, debates. We think differently about the Christian nature of Europe, the role of nations and national cultures, we have different understandings of the essence and vocation of the family, and we have diametrically opposed views on migration.  If we really want unity in diversity, then differences should not give rise to the stigmatisation of any country and the possibility of a joint decision. We would never be att to silence those who disagree with us. Dear Mr President,  They want to exclude a country that has also taken clear decisions in the European elections. We got a 56 percent majority in 2009 and a 52 percent majority in 2014. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, We are the most successful party in the European Parliament. Our socialist and liberal opponents are understandably not happy with our success, but to avenge the Hungarians for not chose them is not fair, and it is not European. Moreover, this report has been written by people who are not even aware of the basic facts. The report admits that you have failed to send a formal delegation to Hungary, so you will decide without proper fact-finding. The report contains 37 serious factual errors. Yesterday, all Members received a 108-page document on this. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your support. Our union is held together to settle disputes within a regulated framework. Hungary, I myself have concluded agreements and compromises with the Commission on the media law, on the judicial system and even on certain passages of our Constitution. This report breakes the agreements that were concluded years ago. But if you can do that and break it, what's the point of getting an agreement with any European institution? What you are doing is a blow to the Union and to constructive dialogue.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your support. Every nation and Member State has the right to decide how to settle their own life in their own country. We will defend our borders, and only we will decide who we live with. We built a fence and stopped hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants. We defended Hungary and we defended Europe. Today's incident is the first in the history of the European Union where a community condemns its own border guards. Dear Mr President, Let's talk straight. They want to condemn Hungary because the Hungarian people have decided that our country will not be an immigrant country. With due respect, but in the strongest possible way, I reject the fact that the pro-immigration and pro-migrant forces of the European Parliament hungary and the Hungarian people on the basis of false accusations. I respectfully inform you, whatever decision you make, Hungary t give in to blackmail. Hungary will protect its borders, stop illegal migration and protect its rights, if necessary, against you. We Hungarians are ready for elections in May next year, where people can finally decide the future of Europe and bring democracy back into European politics. Thank you for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 106, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, this is the first time the European Parliament has discussed an Article 7(1) procedure against a country. An important decision lies ahead of us and, yes, we feel a need for self-assurance, when we have this discussion ahead of us, about the European way of life. Let me share with you some of my concerns and, after the Prime Minister’s intervention, let’s bring it back to what is really of substance on the table: what we are discussing today. We are discussing, for example, something which has a lot to do with freedom. In May this year my Group honoured Lech Wałęsa, a member of the PPE family who is still actively campaigning in Poland in favour of our Civic Platform colleagues, and he spoke about his life. He spoke about the essence of what Europe believes in: about freedom, about freedom of expression, media freedom and freedom of science. With his words in mind, my Group and I cannot understand why the Central European University in Budapest is in a critical situation and can no longer award a US diploma. Freedom of science is a fundamental value for the European Union. (Applause) A second point I want to mention is the fact that, in a democracy, a majority in society governs. That’s clear but, for us, in a properly functioning state a lively civil society is also important. I want transparency about the funding sources for NGOs, I want to know who the internet giants in Russia are who are financing bodies in the European Union. But to have an atmosphere in a society in which government critics and NGOs have a problem in continuing their work is not what we, as the PPE Group, believe in. (Applause) There is a third point I want to mention. We may have different ideas on solving the migration issue, but one thing must be clear: if we say generally that you need to be afraid about Muslims, and we attack a religion generally, then we are doing the job of the jihadists who want to create a clash within our societies. The European ideals of freedom of religion and the separation between states and churches are the principles on which we invented human rights – not Christian rights – on this continent. (Applause) And now about Article 7(1). The PPE Group has always supported the debates here in the House with regard to Hungary. We worked constructively with Roberta Metsola in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the preparation of the document which is on the table. We have consistently supported Viviane Reding in previous times and Frans Timmermans today in relation to infringement procedures. And I have to say that, in the past, Hungary was always ready to compromise. I must tell you that Fidesz was even ready to change the constitution of the country to take account of some of the considerations of Viviane Reding’s Commission and to address them in the constitution of Hungary. My political family will finally decide this evening about our voting list for tomorrow, but I have to tell everybody that without a readiness on the part of the Hungarian Government to resolve the current issues – the legal concerns which are on the table – the start of a dialogue based on Article 7(1) could be necessary. As we are talking about dialogue, I want to underline that it is my wish that the dialogue in Council could start. Council members are publicly attacking each other, they are defining each other as political opponents but, as yet, in the European Council, the Article 7 procedure in respect of Poland has not reached reach the level of our political leaders. So what I would ask for is an end to public accusations among our political leaders. Let them put this on the agenda of the next Council and be honest with each other. I would expect this from the Council. (Applause) And we all must decide: that’s clear. We all must decide between egoism and partnership, between nationalism and Europe, between dogmatism and unity. These are at stake and there is a broader picture ahead of us. For myself, I must say I never had the need to decide because I was always a convinced European and it is also in my DNA that I want to be a bridge-builder. I want to try to achieve a compromise, I want to reach an agreement: that is part of my political DNA. And, with this in mind, I want to add a last point to the current discussion on the table. It’s about the party political dimension. We have been talking about media freedom, and journalists in Bratislava have told me that, since the killing of Ján Kuciak, a lot of colleagues are cautious about their articles. They don’t want to be the next. And, colleagues, demonstrators in Bratislava have showed their concerns on the streets, they have no trust in their Government. So I hope that, among the pro-European democratic parties, we can be united in the upcoming discussion in this House, in fighting for media freedom in all regards and not only when it concerns one country or one discussion. (Applause)  There is a second example I want to share with you. We had mass demonstrations this summer not in Budapest but in Bucharest, with violence on the streets. The President needed to intervene in these demonstrations and had to ask the police to be more careful. There is a Government misusing a majority to protect the already-sentenced Socialist Party leader. We all agreed, including the Socialists, to put this on the agenda in the next plenary, and again I hope that everybody is ready to fight against corruption in all regards and not only in one specific case that is on the table. (Applause) Yes, Europe needs self-assurance and we have to defend our ideas and our common values, in all our political families, and we have to use the platform of the political families to convince each other that we have a future only if we stick together. In this spirit, the founding fathers of Europe created the European Union: always to reach out the hand; to build bridges at critical moments; and to stick to the rule of law in every situation.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Defending the freedom of European citizens is the most important duty of this House, regardless of which colour which government belongs to. My group will therefore use this situation today to go into the details and have all the other discussions with you that have to be had. I would simply like to say that I am pleased that the Austrian Presidency of the Council has still managed – because there were rumours in the meantime that they would not be able to attend today. That is always a good thing, because it not only brings us into the conversation, but also gives us the opportunity to approach the facts. That is what we should be doing. There is a massive irritation on my side when I listen to the Prime Minister of Hungary, Mr Orban, because he did not understand what is at stake here. This debate is taking place because this House is defending the freedoms of the citizens of Hungary, because they are in the middle of the European Union, and not because we are attacking the people of Hungary. On the contrary, we need to talk to you about why their rights are constantly being violated. Yes, I would be pleased – you mentioned this example, then just take it away from a German Social Democrat – I would be pleased if we had personalities here of the figure of a Gyula Horn and an Alois Mock, who at that time tore down the Iron Curtain so that the people of East Germany could go to freedom.  (Applause) But that's not the discourse you're going to have. The Austrian Presidency knows nothing, and the Hungarian Prime Minister has never had a problem. That is why this discussion does not continue. I do not want us to simply watch the decline of European values without doing anything about it. You know very well, Mr Orban, that we have been having constant discussions with you since 2010. 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017 – we have constantly tried to engage in a constructive dialogue with you. It didn't work. Let us be clear: you now stand for the most corrupt system that exists within the European Union. We regret that, but it is. Why is there more... (Interjections) If you are capable of reading, read OLAF's report. That is precisely why there is only one tenderer left in more than 30% of the tenders, that Mr Orban's relatives play a special role in this, that his son-in-law benefits particularly from this system. I would like to repeat it: Mr Orban, you personally stand for the most corrupt system that currently exists in the European Union, and that must stop, ladies and gentlemen. (Applause) We believe that freedom of the press and freedom of expression must not be further suppressed in your country. We want Hungary to return to the path of European values. I can only appeal to the Members of the European People's Party – I hear that there will be a debate this evening on the voting list – that you choose Europe and not the corrupt system of Mr Orban. We have now heard three representatives of the European People's Party, Mr Orban, we have heard the Council representative from the European People's Party, and we have heard Mr Weber, whom I personally accept, to stand up for European values. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you must decide on the relevant vote on the resolution. That is what I would ask from the heart, and that is how we will handle it.

It has been rehearsed so many times. Nothing new. Another instalment of an attack on their democratically elected governments. The Fidesz government has had massive support for the last decade. You said it is not an attack on Hungarian society, but on the Hungarian Government. Well, somebody elected this government. It was not Snow White and the seven dwarves. If you do not like it, just abolish the election and appoint somebody from outside to be the viceroy of Hungary. I think Mr Timmermans will be more than willing to take the job. And after that you do that, do the same with Poland. That will solve all the problems. The resolution that you have read – at least some of you must have read it – is so biased. To say it is biased is an understatement. It is exclusively based on the information from anti-Fidesz groups, and the argument of the majority of the Hungarians on the government has been simply ignored, and this is a regular practice here. This has been done in the case of Poland too. The replies of the government had been thrown into the wastebasket. They are just not taken into account. Take the case of the Central European University. This school was established as a foreign institution with certain privileges, and the government wants to restrict these privileges. What’s wrong with that? It has nothing to do with teaching, research, academic freedom or freedom of thought. In many EU countries the function of foreign academic institutions is very restricted, far more restricted than the current Hungarian law provides. Why is it that you tolerate certain arrangements and certain practices in your own countries and you demand that the Hungarians change their law? This is absolutely unacceptable. The good side of this is that all this entire spectacle is counter-productive. In my country after each spectacle – I cannot say ‘debate’ – of Poland-bashing in the European Parliament, the support for my government conspicuously increases. So I suspect the same will happen in Hungary. So, Prime Minister Orbán, it may very well be that the authors of this resolution are your unwitting or perhaps clandestine supporters.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, you and Mr Orbán can be reassured that I will not go so far as the late John McCain, who on the floor of the American Senate called Mr Orbán ‘a neo—fascist in bed with Putin’. Those are not my words; they have been said before. Also, I will not come back to all the violations that have been put in this report. Let’s be honest between each other, the inconvenient truth is that, under these circumstances, it would be impossible today, Mr Orbán, for Hungary to join the European Union. That is the reality of today. (Applause) What I would really ask you to do – because I like Hungary and I certainly like Hungarian literature and culture – is anyway to stop saying ‘Oh, that’s an action against Hungary, an action against the Hungarian people’. You are not Hungary, you’re the government of Hungary and the leader of a political party and Hungary is far more and far more eternal than you are. (Applause) My intervention is not to you, it is especially to our EPP colleagues, and I have one plea, which is that hopefully this evening they will follow their conscience when they decide on this. I know that’s not always easy to do. We are talking about somebody of the family, and I can tell you that I had the same problem at a certain moment. That was the moment when we had the dilemma to push out of our family Jörg Haider of the FPÖ. We did it in the end, also based on counsel, because we thought that more important than size and power are in fact principles and values.  The second reason is for European reasons, Manfred. What we are living today is the survival and existential battle over the survival of the European project. If Mr Orbán is publicly siding with Salvini, openly discussing the disruption of this European project, well, we need that not to happen in the coming years. My last argument and reason is mainly because, and I will recognise it – that doesn’t happen often – that the European Union has been based on Christian democratic principles, beliefs and energy for decades. We all know them: Adenauer, Schuman, Monnet, De Gasperi. I want to use the words of one of these giants, of Robert Schuman, and I will quote him: ‘Christianity teaches us equality of all men without distinction between race, colour, class or profession [...] the dignity of each human person in protection of his individual liberty and with respect for his individual rights by practicing brotherly love to all’.  So I want to plead to you, my Christian Democratic colleagues, to recognise that the way Schuman looked at Christianity is in many ways exactly the opposite to the divisive, narrow and destructive actions and opinions of Mr Orbán.

Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, including the rights of people belonging to minorities. These values are common to Member States in a society characterized by pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union says, which, before being a major market, is a union of values. Values which, on the basis of our Parliament's factual report, are called into question by the action of the Hungarian government. No, Prime Minister, this is not about Hungary, it is not about the Hungarian people, it is about the actions of the Hungarian government, and I know many Hungarians who do not find themselves in your action. In a democracy, holding a majority does not automatically legitimize any action. No, Mr Orbon, neither the nepotism and the abuse of European funds, nor the violations of academic and religious freedoms, nor the asphyxiation of the media and NGOs, nor the implementation of the judiciary are compatible with European values. I would add, addressing the defender of the Christian values you claim to be, that refusing to feed failed asylum seekers seems to me to be totally contradictory to the gospel message. It is not enough to say that the Sargentini report is a web of lies to erase its reality. The reality is that if your country were now a candidate for EU membership, as Guy Verhofstadt said, it could not be admitted without fundamental changes in its structures and legislation. Like others before you, Prime Minister, you have repeatedly compared the European Union to the defunct Soviet Union. Such an analogy is scandalous, because it is free that Hungary has decided to join the European Union and, as far as I know, the tanks of the European Union have never invaded the capital of a country to ensure that it remains in the European Union. But make no mistake: for us, Hungary's place is at the heart of Europe, and in Europe there is no second-tier Member State. But if belonging to the Union creates rights and benefits, they come with responsibilities and obligations. The launch of the Article 7 procedure is aimed at one thing: to ensure compliance with these obligations. To our epp colleagues I want to solemnly say this: you count in your ranks The Fidesz, the party of Mr Orbon. For a long time, he was considered a bit like the black sheep of the family. Today, he claims to set the course! By adopting a language, posture and policies that make it the whooping cough - and we check it here at every moment - of the European and even American extreme right-wingers. How can you say that no red line has yet been crossed? But where are your limits? Are you going to abandon your humanist values to campaign on the themes of the extreme right, to make a common list with it, to govern with it or simply to implement its agenda? In a document adopted in 2015 by the EPP Congress, I read a resolution entitled 'Protecting the Union and Promoting Our Values'. You were defending, and I quote, \"liberal democracy, based on the rule of law and a multi-party system, a strong civil society, freedom of expression and association\" and I conclude, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on Judith Sargentini's report gives you a unique opportunity, my colleagues in the EPP, to join the words with a strong gesture.

I invite those who want to avoid caricature and who believe that the rule of law still makes sense in a democracy to read Mrs Sargentini's report, just to read it. It is based on the views of the Council of Europe, including the Venice Commission, and the United Nations.  No, it is not a question of condemning the Hungarian people, nor Hungary, just to respect the european Union's accession criteria in this area, accepted at the time by the Hungarian government and prepared by your government, Mr Orbon, when you were Prime Minister, from 1998 to 2002. But at the time, you were a liberal. For you today, freedom is no longer a central element of the organization of the state and democracy is reduced to a political majority that applies its choices, the strong against the weak. So yes, in Hungary, there is a regression of rights for justice, for the press, for education, for asylum, for NGOs.

This is the man who is one of the bosses of the European Commission that appoints Martin Selmayr, driving a coach and horses through all the rules that exist here. What is really happening here, Mr Orbán, is that they are just updating the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty. There’s no point pretending in this union that you’re independent, there’s no point pretending you run your own country. And Article 7 is the new method of adopting that. They want to strip you of your voting rights, they want to stop giving you European funding, and all of it because you have the audacity to stand up to George Soros, the man who has poured USD 15 billion all over the world in trying to break down the nation states and to get rid of our traditional forms of democracy. In Hungary he spent money to promote illegal immigration into your country and you, quite rightly, have stood up to him and closed him down. I wish we all did the same.

Ms Sargentini claims that you despise this Parliament, but this is already the third time that you have come to respond to the constant attacks on your government. In reality, it is not a report, but an indictment, that of a witchcraft trial heard exclusively on the charge. In particular, he accuses you of not respecting the independence of the judiciary, but at the same time he allows himself to criticize decisions made by Hungarian judges and gives his opinion on instructions that are being carried out.

Because what is the rule of law, honourable Members? The rule of law is when it is not the self-love of individual people, not of individual groups, but of the law.  Firstly, Parliament is empowered by the Treaty of the Union to act on the basis of Community legislation. In point C, the report acknowledges that it has not found enough cases under Community law against Hungary and therefore examines issues which are not covered by the Treaty. For the most part, the report lists such matters with exclusive national competence. Spreading beyond the law of the Union is arbitrary, contrary to the Treaty, contrary to the rule of law. Secondly, since Roman law, the rule of law also means that the accused is given a fair opportunity to defend. In this hours-long debate, Hungary can only speak for five minutes. It's not a rule of law, it's a thousand-year-old rule of law. Shame! Are you afraid of words?

We must take a stand when it comes to the union's existence, when its foundations are undermined. There can be no consideration. It is therefore not against a Member State, but we are fighting for our common interests.

The Union is in a state of decomposition, of crisis, of demands such as today's one, namely the demand to exclude Hungary from codecision on European Union matters. Look at le Monde two or three days ago, there were two Europes: Macron's Europe and Orban's Europe. This is the image of today's Europe that you want to share rather than unite. You are trying to stop the wind of history, because the wind of change is blowing through Europe today, and this wind is blowing not only through the Hungarian forest, but blowing from Sweden to Italy, and remember one thing – maybe Stalin was able to turn back the rivers, but the wind will not stop.

And I’m sure that you read Article 2 before you put your signature to it. So all we are doing is keeping you to your word. And you know what? The Hungarian people want you to keep your word, because they want to remain at the heart of the European Union. But then you have to play by the rules and respect the rules. Debates like this one today are about a very difficult situation, and some people are getting rather desperate about how to get out of that situation, but I think this is just a difficult phase in a bigger process of the European Union coming of age as a community of values and a community of law. And we will get out of this situation. Maybe we should do that by de-dramatising and de-politicising. You put a lot of drama in your speeches, Mr Orbán, but I actually prefer the approach of Ms Sargentini, which is very factual, fact-based and accurate. Her report is a very accurate picture of the state of play of democracy and the rule of law in your country, and it is not a pretty sight. You talk about the Hungarian people but – you know what, Mr Orbán – all of us here have voters, and my voters ask me why we have to respect the rules when the Hungarian Government doesn’t have to. Why are we giving Mr Orbán EUR 87 million a week in order to destroy the European Union? Why are they getting away with it? Well I have difficulty answering my voters. It is not just your voters we’re talking about, Mr Orbán, it is all the citizens of Europe. So we have a duty to hold you to the same rules and standards as everybody else. And then, finally, the real message of today’s debate is not about pointing the finger at Hungary or criticising Hungary. The strong message of the European Parliament is that we are not willing to let Hungary go. We didn’t walk the road to here, and bring Hungary on board as a member of this family, in order to let go. Hungary is a member of this family, and we will fight to get Hungary back on track and give Hungarian citizens the European values that they are entitled to, like anybody else.

This is not, of course, Brussels, but since Brussels is all that embodies the nefarious influences upon Hungary for you, I suppose that between here and Brussels there is no difference. Europe has to be Brussels, and Brussels is not good for the country. Because it would impose migration, because it would impose certain functioning measures and certain democratic standards, probably because it would also be looking after its money.

The only reason why unemployment is where it is, is not the prowess of the government; it is the fact that people have voted with their feet.  Now otherwise, what happens with the money?

It’s only about religion, the right form of family, the nation, and shutting the other out.  Among the many mails that we got, Prime Minister, there was one from Pastor Ivanyi, who I believe once officiated at your wedding. I do not think he is less good at religion and less good at Christianity than you are, and he is not feeling comfortable any longer. And I am not comfortable with this discourse because the Christian democracy that I want to belong to is a Christian democracy that accepts the secular state.

In eighty-nine, ladies and gentlemen, I was a 15-year-old teenager, and even then, with a poster for Fidesz, we were hoping for a better Europe, a healthier Europe. Looks like it's the same thing now. Then I spent 20 years defending rights in Roma matters, studying at CEU, studying at Western universities, and investing a great deal of work in making good use of the position that Fidesz then gave to a Gypsy woman, a young Gypsy woman from Central and Eastern Europe, in 2004, in order to protect the 16 million Roma in Europe. It was therefore particularly important that fidesz also delegated me to the People's Party as Vice-President of the European Parliament.  And it is therefore particularly painful to see you, led by my fellow German Members of the People's Party, who are really familiar with the very strong Hungarian attitude in the European Roma strategy – because we have made this strategy for Europe, we want to protect the poorest – they know that today it Hungary also the one who is really doing everything he can against the segregation of Gypsy children in schools.  We were the first country in 2004 to bring up this issue. You are talking about violating the rights of Roma children. In our country, children go to school from the age of three, integrated kindergartens, by the age of six they no longer need to be developed. We have dual vocational school programs compatible with sports programs that really bring the best workforce to your multi-large companies. By 2050, we have realised that if we do not train the Roma, all the states of Central and Eastern Europe and Western Europe will be at an economic disadvantage.  So I think that we should thank the Hungarian Government for what it has done for the Roma and not condemn it.

First of all, the Commission operates on the basis of the Treaty on European Union. The Treaty was signed by sovereign nations and was adopted in sovereign nations. If you’re a member of a club and you sign a treaty and want to be a member of the club, you apply the rules. You cannot use the argument of democracy to ignore the rules. If you have a democratic majority, you can change the rules, you can negotiate a change of the treaty, but you can’t violate the rules, nor can you ignore the rules.  Everything I put in my report at the beginning of this debate, and all the concrete issues I have put before you are based in fact. They are issues we have with the Hungarian Government on the basis of, in our view, rules that are not being respected. We will pursue this in a dialogue with the Hungarian Government and we will take the Hungarian Government to court if we believe that they violate the rules that were agreed at European level. That is a task of the Commission. Whether I was elected to this position or not is neither here nor there. What we do is we respect the Treaties and this role was given to the Commission in the Treaties. The Treaties are the fundament upon which we operate. I just want to add one issue to that: when we criticise the Hungarian Government and its legislative measures, we do this very precisely. I have to say – to then say that criticising laws and criticising the Government would amount to criticising a nation or a people, frankly speaking, Mr Orbán, that’s the coward’s way out. If you make these laws and if you stand for these laws, stand for them, and we will have a debate and dialogue and hopefully we will resolve them, but don’t try to deflect attention from criticism about the actions of your Government by saying that those who criticise the Government attack your nation or your people. That’s the coward’s way out.  One final remark: the emptiness of the arguments on this side need to be compensated by screaming and shouting. Volume will not compensate for the emptiness of your arguments, sir. Finally, I want to reiterate that the Commission believes that the only European way is through dialogue. If the dialogue doesn’t deliver the results, we will go to court, and I hope that Hungary will stick to its line to execute court rulings. That is the rule of law in Europe. Europe was created on the basis of rights of individuals. We’ve had a past – sometimes – of dictatorship through democracy. That is why we can never ignore the rule of law, nor fundamental rights, and using the argument of democracy against the law and fundamental rights is going back to a European history none of us want to see again.

I will explain why. It’s because within the Union there are no reports being written that are benchmarks on fundamental rights and democracy per Member State. For instance, the Fundamental Rights Agency in Vienna, one of our agencies, is not allowed to do that. And why is that? Because Member States in the Union have been shying away from looking at the state of their country when it comes to democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law. Some speakers asked why Hungary? Why not Romania, Slovakia, Malta? Well, I’ve been here since 2009. If you look at my track record I have been supporting every debate that deals with rule of law in a Member State, and I can tell you that Romania is going to be on the agenda next time if you all agree with a proposal that the Greens have made. And I know that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is going to visit Malta and Slovakia next week to look into the issues around the murder of journalists and corruption. I think that is important. But two wrongs do not make a right, and that’s the mistake a lot of people here are making. If you point to a mistake by somebody else, it doesn’t compensate for the mistakes you make yourself. I think we should keep that in mind. Now, if you, as a representative of a minority grouping, manage to break through a glass ceiling, good for you. It doesn’t mean that everybody else in your society is able to follow you through the glass you’ve broken, and it is that possibility that society needs to create because, in the end, what is a government? A government is a service provider to its people – all its people – and a government that is elected with such an enormous majority has extra responsibility to bring along all its people.

Mr President, Commissioner and Vice-President of the European Commission, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done on this report. We have all had intensive discussions, but what is the point of this reform that we intend to vote on tomorrow? On the one hand, it is, of course, a question of preventing the exploitation of our European artists, which continues on the Internet. We are talking about big tech companies that have been making huge profits with the works of our European artists and our European creatives for years. And that is something where I would say: we should not continue to accept this.  Now that the mandate was rejected before the summer recess, we have the opportunity to stand alongside the European creatives once again, and we should not constantly look for any way out and excuses for actually getting the big tech companies back there. I think we should start to stand by our artists and protect our values here as well. It is not just a question of how to make a profit. In fact, this is also a question of Europe's self-assertion. It is also a question of how we actually transfer the property that we consider to be normal in our online or offline world to a digital world, and the fact that these parameters are not shifting accordingly here. It's about taking responsibility for content on a platform. This is new. So far, we have not asked the platforms to do so. However, following the e-commerce directive, which was formulated at the beginning of the millennium, when platforms played a very different role, there has now been a development where we have to find massive copyright infringements and where we should now simply act to achieve a better balance between the artists and their works and the platforms.  Ultimately, it is always a question of cultural theft. We Europeans can be very proud that we can create so much content that we are creative, and we in the European Parliament should support that accordingly. It is not a question of destroying the Internet, as it has somehow always been collated in the summer by this great campaign. It is not a question of obstructing someone, of uploading their works, nor of preventing any dimensions of the future. Nobody in this house wants to destroy anything. Nobody in this House wants to prevent anything. But we should start thinking now about the other side that is in question here.  What is the point of avoiding copyright infringement? What is the point of wanting fair remuneration for journalists, publishers and artists? And what is the argument against large platforms taking more responsibility, including the rights that apply? In the future, we will have to regulate the responsibility of the platforms anyway. Let's start with copyright here! I believe that this would be a wonderful signal to all our European creatives.

There’s a broad consensus across this House that we should protect the work of artists, but I agree with consumer organisations, user groups, academics, developers – and the list goes on – that Article 13, as proposed, goes too far and could dramatically restrict the internet freedoms of our citizens.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Voss and all the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts to modernise the European copyright framework. This is a priority for the Digital Single Market, it is a priority for this Commission. Since the Commission put the proposal on the table exactly two years ago, as we all know, the discussions have been complex, difficult at times, but also subject to intensive lobbying from all sides. We are now at a decisive stage. Stakeholders and citizens all agree that copyright changes are necessary.  Today's rules belong to a bygone world, a world that did not know the high-speed internet, smartphones or social networks. With these new rules, Europe aims to provide benefits to our citizens, researchers, teachers, creators, cultural heritage institutions, and all in a balanced way. The new rules include a new exception for the search of texts and data, an essential exception for European research and innovation. They also contain exceptions for education. They will ensure the preservation of cultural heritage and access to it by our citizens. Finally, they improve the transparency of artists' remuneration. All these benefits for the cultural sectors and for our society are at hand. However, they will not happen any time soon if the European Parliament does not adopt a mandate tomorrow. I am aware of the intense debates on two provisions of our proposal, namely Article 11 and Article 13. In both cases, the objectives pursued are essential. Article 11 aims to support quality journalism, which today faces significant challenges, while continuing to be indispensable in a pluralistic democracy. Article 13 is intended to ensure the online consumption of creative content and to ensure that creative content is guaranteed fair remuneration. I would like to clarify the debate. The right of press publishers is not a tax on links, nor is it an obstacle to access to information. This right clearly excludes hyperlinks from the new protection afforded to press publishers, just as it does not change the scope of what is already protected by copyright. Similarly, Article 13 is not intended to create private censorship or an obstacle to freedom of expression. It aims to ensure that those who create content have a say in the possibility and how their content is made available by platforms, and that they can have a fair share of the revenue generated by the use of that content. Section 13 does not concern users and their ability to upload content; it does not in any way limit the use of parodies; it does not prohibit memes or limit freedom of expression. Finally, it contains strong mechanisms and safeguards to protect the rights of individual users. The Commission's proposals are balanced, and among the many amendments received, I see many amendments which aim to improve the Commission's proposal without altering its spirit. None of the provisions currently under discussion will destroy the internet, none will sign the Wikipedia shutdown, none will destroy Europe's cultural heritage. Tomorrow's vote will focus on European creative capacity. A vote to start the trilogue will demonstrate that Europe is capable of reforming copyright, and therefore modernising our society and ultimately safeguarding our values and democracy.

Tomorrow's vote on the draft directive on so-called copyright reform will be crucial for the functioning and development of the digital economy, but above all for internet users. I hope that, after the summer reflection, MEPs will eliminate from the draft the provisions which are unfavourable to internet users, which are included in the final text voted in the JURI Committee.  With regard to the controversial Article 11, I support the concept of presumption of copyright by publishers, not the introduction of a new related law without a due impact analysis, which has not worked either in Germany or in Spain, where it has been attempted. The presumption of law will make it easier for publishers to pursue claims while respecting the principle of fair use of the public domain without blocking access to information.  The proposed new related law will not, as its proponents argue, contribute to a better quality of transmission or the elimination of so-called facs, but will strengthen the position of large publishers by eliminating weaker, independents, who will not be able to afford a fee for the so-called snippet. As a result, these great ones will become monopolists, which I think I have been in Parliament for almost 15 years, and we have always tried to avoid them in this House.  Many experts warn that this means that the public is clearly at risk of neutral content search by limiting their choice, reducing media pluralism, jeopardising freedom of expression on the internet.  In the case of Article 13, which is even more exciting, I do not agree with the automatic filtering of content posted by users of platforms, as this means, in practice, internet censorship. Both the citizens and this Parliament have already once rejected the attempt to introduce such censorship in the infamous ACTA proposal.

That was not an exercise in democracy. That was an exercise in manipulation, and we must ensure that there is a greater balance that comes out of this process that we are undertaking at this moment in time.  Much of the campaigning focused on Articles 11 and 13. Whilst there are a lot of improvements there – and indeed we will be voting on that and much of that will receive support from my Group – our position on Article 11, the publisher’s right, is to support it, whilst narrowing the remit so that it would not apply to insubstantial parts of articles or short extracts. I think this is a balanced solution.  On Article 13, I support the rapporteur’s approach, which I consider to be the only text on the table which addresses the liability of large platforms such as YouTube, and makes sure that artists and authors are fairly remunerated.

Mr President, because the press is necessary for the vitality of democracy - and we have seen this again today in the debate with the Hungarian Prime Minister: let this warn us all - because culture is also an economy - 536 billion euros each year, which employ seven million two hundred thousand people in culture - and above all, , because we do not have a digital industry, we must help, in this Parliament, the enhancement of content, which is one of the elements of balance in our culture. European public opinion, as the polls have just shown, requires that users, i.e. aggregators, i.e. platforms, pay fair remuneration to those who create: artists on one side, journalists on the other.

On Article 11, for example, it is quite necessary to be a little more precise, but above all to remove the obstacle that we received in full appearing on 5 July, in order to bring together more political groups and ensure that protection is unanimous, or at least the majority in this House. On section 13, we also want to be much more specific. We have disseminated our intentions, those of my ALDE group, and I will not enter into the debates.

The problems that the rapporteur, Mr Voss, wants to solve are serious, but they are not, in large part, problems caused by copyright law. Copyright law cannot bring back lost newspaper subscriptions and it cannot bring back lost advertising revenues. If that’s the problem we want to solve, we need the Commission to bring in online advertising regulation, because this is how tech companies are threatening to destroy the news business. The truth is that news articles are already protected by copyright, and if platforms use them without paying they are already breaking the law. Our alternative proposal will allow publishers to enforce that law without limiting the freedom to link. The neighbouring right, on the other hand, has been tried and has failed before. Simply wishing it will work this time around is not a solution. It is time that we turned the discussion away from what we would like the proposals to do, towards what they will actually do. If we make platforms directly liable for everything, they won’t get a licence from every rightholder in the world. Even if they could find all the rightholders, if just one of them refused a licence, the platforms would have to filter. Mr Cavada may deny that, or say that these filters will only block legal content, but simply wishing that automatic filters can do that is not going to make it true. Until algorithms are smart enough to have a sense of humour, then they won’t know the difference between a parody and a copyright infringement. They would simply block both. If we want YouTube or Facebook to pay creators, let’s write that into the law, as many of the alternative amendments from the left side of the House actually do. Upload filters will just give YouTube and Facebook an excuse not to pay. Instead, they will sell their filters to small European platforms, a danger that even the United Nations Special Rapporteur for freedom of expression had called by its name: censorship. The proposals may be well intended, but they suffer from a reality gap. We have to stick to what copyright law can do to support creators without trying to bend it to solve other problems and without threatening fundamental rights. That is what the amendments I have tabled do. They are not what big tech wants and they are certainly not the Pirate Party position.

It does not censor, because we do not want to restrict citizens' access to information and culture, but to regulate relations between copyright holders and only those platforms that classify, organise and present content protected by copyright, on which they collect increasing and huge advertising revenues without recognising and remunerating producers, publishers and authors, and therefore we want to provide for specific responsibilities and obligations.

It is very evident that there is a clear consensus about the need to modernise the European copyright framework. Reform of copyright is extremely difficult to do, we all know this. There are so many interests to reconcile and the rules have a direct impact on the everyday lives of our citizens.  It is good to remind ourselves that this directive is important for the many reasons that were mentioned before. European citizens care about this directive in a very direct way. We saw this when the Commission worked on its proposal and we have seen it leading up to this debate and votes. Clearly we need to give Europeans the right kind of copyright laws for the digital age. They deserve nothing less and it is achievable. This is very clear to us after this debate.  As mentioned before, none of the proposals now on the table will destroy the internet nor the freedom of speech. None of the proposals will restrain our citizens from expressing themselves or sharing their ideas with others. More specifically, rest assured that Article 11 will not limit access to information. On the contrary, it will ensure the survival of a quality press in the digital age. As for Article 13, I think we are only aiming at a targeted and balanced intervention, to make sure that the European creative industry can get a fair share of the value generated by its content, which is nowadays mainly used online. After today’s debate I’m encouraged that all EU institutions share the common objective of ensuring a fair and thriving copyright environment in Europe.

I would like to make a brief point of this: because we have a legal situation here that deals with passive platforms, which cannot simply be extended to active platforms, and the case law is already much wider. There is a UGC exception there that undermines all the law there, and in the current legal situation we are simply one step further.  Why not the ALDE proposal? With the ALDE proposal, we cement the copyright infringement in the first upload and would then proceed to remove it with filters. This, too, falls short of the current legal situation.  These two options are therefore not really worthy of discussion, because we cannot carry out a reform for our authors, which will allow us to fall back behind the existing law. That is why my proposals – as Mr Wölken said – no longer contain any filters at all. I have proposed a procedure in which the parties are put together to find a gentle way of making progress here, without violating fundamental rights, without omitting the exceptions, in order to seek workable solutions, because I do not believe that we in this House will be able to do anything sensible there.

I know that this might look like a debate about some distant future or about science fiction: it’s not. Artificial intelligence is already part of our daily life – when we use our smartphone or when we watch a TV series, we understand that very well – and it is now starting to be weaponised and to impact on our collective security. So it makes a lot of sense to have this debate here today. We are entering a world where drones could fire and could kill with no need for a man to pull the trigger. Artificial intelligence could take decisions on life and death, with no direct control from a human being. The reason why we are here today is not that we are afraid of technology, let me start by saying that. Human ingenuity and technological progress have made our lives easier and more comfortable. The point is that scientists and researchers should and must be free to do their job, knowing that their discoveries will not be used to harm innocent people. After World War II, a large number of nuclear scientists started to oppose nuclear weapons so that research could focus on the peaceful applications of nuclear energy, and I think that today we are witnessing something very similar: scientists and artificial intelligence pioneers are warning us of the dangers ahead. Some of them are refusing to work for the military. I believe the best way ahead is to agree on some common principles regarding the military use of artificial intelligence, and to define the boundaries of its applications so that, within those limits, scientists are free to explore the immense positive potential of artificial intelligence. This is a core objective in the Commission’s communication on artificial intelligence and in the follow-up work that will also cover security matters. At the beginning of this month, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems agreed on an initial set of possible guiding principles. This is the first step, after a number of failures, towards a shared approach. It is a good starting point, and the new guiding principles are very much in line with the positions we have developed inside the European Union under European External Action Service coordination. Let me say that this is one of the points on the agenda where I could easily sit on both sides of the Chamber, because there is work being done on the Commission side and work being done on the Council side, as well as under the EEAS leadership.  The group of experts stresses that international humanitarian law applies to all weapon systems, both old and new, and that all weapons must always remain under human control. The experts have agreed that the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons is the appropriate framework to regulate weapons of this kind and that any policy measure must not interfere with the civilian uses of artificial intelligence. This is only the first stage of the discussion and there is no agreement yet on any regulation, so work will continue within the Group of Governmental Experts during the course of next year. I believe that we Europeans have an important contribution to bring to this table. Our Member States, it’s true, hold different views on some issues, but we all agree that the use of force must always abide by international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law, and this fully applies to autonomous weapons systems. States and human beings remain responsible and accountable for their behaviour in an armed conflict, even if it involves the use of autonomous weapons, and this is why our position at the UN has been that humans should always make the decisions on the use of lethal force and always exert sufficient control over lethal weapon systems. Of course, we do not have all the answers or all the solutions, and, partly for that reason, I decided a few months ago to set up a panel with tech leaders from different backgrounds and fields of expertise. We had the first meeting in Brussels in June, together with me and all of them. We’ve started to carry on a conversation between the tech world and the foreign and security policy community, and my intention as High Representative is to put this issue on the table for the defence ministers, too, at one of our next Council meetings: the question of how we can harness the opportunities of the digital era while also addressing the rising threats. Among the members of this global tech panel are some of the experts on artificial intelligence who have been most vocal on the issue of lethal autonomous weapons. Together with the experts’ community, we can find a solution that is both prudent and innovative. We can continue exploring the immense possibilities of artificial intelligence and, at the same time, guarantee full respect for human rights. This is a collective responsibility and I’m particularly glad that the European Parliament is leading the way and driving the conversation on this issue, so I am looking forward very much to listening to your views on this extremely important part of our common work.

Secondly, autonomous weapons systems must be subject to human control, and this is what Parliament will consistently ask for. Thirdly, it is necessary to build such a legal framework so that there is no doubt as to not only the use but also the responsibility for the use of autonomous systems.

How could it be that the negotiator of the same House, the same Parliament, disregarded this majority will and the negotiations between the Council, the EP and the Commission have now resulted in autonomous weapons systems being supported with European taxpayers' money in the EU armament programme? In fact, the legal text adopted by the EP on the EDDP, which excludes the financing and development of autonomous weapons systems, was disregarded. This is a scandal and must be reversed.  All the more important is the resolution to be voted on, which unequivocally calls for an international ban on the development and production of lethal autonomous weapons systems. There is no moral or international legitimacy for weapons – weapons that kill people without a court order, targeted and insidious. A weapon machine makes decisions about the life or death of people?

I am thinking in particular of the difficulty in identifying a true and sole perpetrator of crimes that could be committed against innocent people, their uncontrolled proliferation, not forgetting the risk of mistakes or even worse of hacking, not to mention the inability to deal with all the unforeseen events in the case, without human intervention, in full compliance with the rules of engagement and international law.

The already existing international ban on chemical weapons should be both a warning and an incentive for us. We must not produce, export and use autonomous weapons, which can kill without human choice and also spiral out of control. This is also what the SPD in the European Parliament calls for in its recently adopted core thesis paper on European security and defence policy. The development of autonomous weapons systems, which has already begun, must therefore be stopped as a matter of urgency. We must prevent technologies from coming into the markets to which the current human rights law does not apply and which raise previously unanswered moral and ethical problems.

Systems are already on the market that can target, track and destroy incoming missiles without human action. But these weapons have at least been programmed by man. But now we are still working. The next step is algorithms, where humans no longer play a role at all. Now the autonomous drone alone decides whether or not to destroy a target it recognizes.

Given the EU’s ambition to be a global actor for international peace and security, my questions to the High Representative are: how does the Commission and the EEAS define ‘meaningful human control’ over autonomous weapons systems, and what type and what degree of human control? How do they propose we strengthen the precedent in international and disarmament law for banning weapons without human control; and with the intrinsic dual-use nature of emerging technologies, how do we achieve not hampering progress in civilian research and development while having lethal autonomous weapons internationally?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 244, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice—President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, first of all let me thank you, as I said at the beginning, for putting this issue on the agenda, but also for the clear indication of all of you to the need to continue this work and to engage in this dialogue we have started already, in particular with industry and researchers, but also civil society organisations, to first and foremost better understand what we’re talking about, because I think we all have more questions than answers in discussing issues that can have very complicated technical implications, that can themselves have very complicated impacts on the political decisions that need to be taken. So I think that here the core issue is to keep at the centre of the debate human control and human responsibility for whatever affects the lives and deaths of human beings. The very definition of lethal autonomous weapons is not fully clear yet, and this is why we should define the key element of human control. Sound technical work here is key to getting the political decisions right, also because we are discussing a new frontier, so at the time we are discussing the norms and the regulations and the legal framework for all of this, we need to be sure that we are discussing the right things that will come. This discussion is I believe crucial, even if at the moment there is no agreement at this stage on regulatory measures, which could include a legally—binding instrument or a political declaration. I think that the right approach here is to first of all focus on the content of what we need to achieve and then, I believe, the forum and the consensus on the instrument, I hope, will come. If the discussion on the forum takes the lead, we might end up with an empty instrument that is not supported by the most relevant actors, and that in itself would be a problem.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been a member of the European Parliament. Today is 11 September, the anniversary of 11 September 2001, which killed 3 000 people by the terrorist attack. But this is also the day that led to Europe showing solidarity with the United States of America. Only once has Article 5 of the NATO Treaty been drawn, namely on this issue. That is why Europe's soldiers are still in Afghanistan today. In other words, when President Trump says that the European Union was created to harm America, we prove the opposite every day. And historically, it's wrong anyway. We should make it clear that we are continuing this solidarity, but we expect that, at the same time, there will be solidarity from the United States and that it will not be built in such a way that it is no longer a partnership, but rather degenerates into vassalism. Those who do not parry are subject to sanctions or indirectly with extraterritorial measures. It is the ally, even on trade issues, that follows American policy, and not that something can be done in partnership. This is a major threat in the face of world political developments. The West is moving farewell to a unified, global security architecture that includes not only security policy, but also trade policy and much more. As a result, China is the big winner of this game. As a result, the values of the West in this world will become weaker if we do not make conflicts of interest and cooperation here. I am glad that President Juncker has now managed to see negotiations conducted to avoid further action against Europe. But that's not all. I believe that this means that we continue to need NATO for Europe's territorial collective security, that we want cooperation, but that this also means that we need to get more on our own feet because of the uncertainties in the field of foreign, security and economic policy. I do not know whether the term 'autonomous sovereignty' is correct. But that we are less vulnerable, that we are growing more in strength to achieve partnership and to be recognised in it, and that, for this reason, when it comes to 'America First' policy, we need to be clearer in the area of security policy, not just discuss 2%, 2% more money for the military without the European measures. , creating synergy effects that have to do with PESCO and these issues makes little sense. Then it will only become a purchase programme for American weapons in Europe, for which this money is used. I do not believe that this will lead to the strength we must have. I believe that the pressure measures that are constantly coming to Europe, the measures that mean that we want to do less with Europe than with Member States, because we can do more deals with individuals in their own interests, that we need to see that we need a common policy towards Africa, that we have to see that the European Union has a security strategy. , which is more comprehensive. We are spending far more money from the EU budget alone on civilian external aid rather than on the gain of stability than the United States. If you add the money from the Member States, it is huge: 60% of the world's development aid is provided by the European Union. What we have done with the enlargement of the European Union, what we are doing towards Ukraine and other countries, is all that security policy we are pursuing, and we must take that into account accordingly in order to achieve a fair burden-sharing in this way. When we talk about trade surpluses, we have to say that if we take the current account and take the primary gains that come from other areas, then that is roughly in a tie. In other words, we need more common ground, more European strength, in order to get the European Union and the United States closer again .....

Just last week, that the European Union was just as bad as China, only smaller, really does not correspond to the facts.  We, as the European Union, are a fair trading partner. This fair trading partner does indeed have a trade surplus on goods. But if you look at the balance of services and, above all, the transfer of profits from Europe to the United States, that is almost evenifing out, and there is no reproach in this respect.  It is now good that we are talking again, and that is perhaps the positive thing about Mr Trump's conversation with Mr Juncker.

If you think of that day, if you think of that moment, you understand how close Europe and America have always been because it was an attack not only on the USA but on all of us. This is why I want to start this debate, from my side, by expressing all our sympathy and friendship to the USA, all its institutions and all its citizens, while they commemorate that terrible day. It was a terrible day for the USA and it was a terrible day for Europe. The world has changed in unexpected and unforeseeable ways since that 9/11, 17 years ago. Today, all global powers are rethinking their place in the world. Later tonight we will discuss our relations with China, but before that I am very glad of the opportunity to discuss Elmar Brok’s excellent work on the USA. The transatlantic relationship is evolving. The USA helped us in Europe, during the Second World War, to defeat Nazism and fascism, and helped us immediately after the Second World War to rebuild our continent. This is something we Europeans cannot, should not and, I think, will not forget. Never. Yet, after 70 years, the European Union has grown up. We are a global power and a global security provider. We have our own principles, our interests and our unique European way to peace, security and development. I have no doubt that the European Union and the USA are, and will remain, natural partners and natural friends in spite of some disagreements we may have with the US administration. As your report indicates perfectly well, Mr Brok, we work very closely together with the US administration on a wide range of issues. From the Western Balkans to North Korea, from Ukraine to Afghanistan – and the list can continue – our cooperation is strong because we share the same goals and the same interests and, I would say, the same vision of the world. We work together on a daily basis on counterterrorism and our cooperation within NATO is closer than ever. Since we signed the EU—NATO Joint Declaration two years ago, our personnel have been working together on a daily basis on the broadest set of security issues, from cybersecurity to maritime security. This is new and it goes beyond some of the rhetoric or the narrative or the symbolism we have been facing in recent months. US and EU staff, including at military level, are working together today as never before in the past. I also see the opportunity to find new synergies on our energy policies, in particular after our recent Energy Council with the USA in Brussels in July –at the very same time, by the way, as the NATO summit. Europe and the USA have a clear interest in diversifying our energy supplies, and this is just one of the many issues where our interests converge. I believe another such issue is trade, particularly in relation to China and World Trade Organisation reform. Divisions on this issue can only harm both US and European interests. In some cases, the divisions harm our interests but, conversely, by working together we can be much more effective in pushing for more just and fair international trade. Let me be very clear on this: we will always seek cooperation with the USA on trade, as on all other matters. At the same time, we have shown that we are ready to protect our interests when the USA has chosen a different approach. I think the report highlights perfectly well this balance that we have. We are together, as European institutions, on this. We responded strongly to the introduction of the US tariffs on steel and aluminium that, as you rightly say, are still in place, and we are engaging with various levels of the US Government and Congress to avoid the unacceptable threats of US tariffs in other areas, particularly on cars. President Juncker’s visit to the White House last July managed to avert the risk of new tariffs on our car industry. As you know, Presidents Juncker and Trump agreed on the need to find a shared solution to preserve transatlantic trade. Since then, contacts have continued at all levels. It is complicated work but it is ongoing. As you know, an executive working group is now discussing the details, with a clear political mandate, which is to agree on the way forward. The meeting of the two Presidents was a clear demonstration that there is always room for a win-win solution, even when confrontation seems inevitable, and that this is a matter of political will. The political will on our side is always to try to seek cooperation, and to defend our interests when we see that there is no other way to go. It is no secret that we have one main disagreement, which concerns multilateralism and the very idea of a system for global governance. We Europeans continue to see multilateralism as the best way to prevent chaos, conflicts and confrontation in a multi—polar world. By the way, our support for multilateralism is something we often discuss in this Chamber. It is based on our values as the best alternative to a situation where might makes right. But we also have a strong interest in preserving multilateralism and in strengthening multilateralism: namely, the interest that we have to prevent conflicts, to promote sustainable development, to promote human rights and to guarantee, in this way, our own European security. That is why we continue – and we will continue – to defend the nuclear deal with Iran and the Paris Agreement on climate change, and to fund the essential work of all the UN agencies, including the one for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. More generally, we will stand by the fundamental belief that international rules should not be seen as a constraint for some, but rather as a guarantee for all. We will continue to invest strongly in the UN system. I see in my daily work that we are not alone in this task. We are not alone in having this objective. It’s rather the opposite. From Canada to Australia, from South America to East Asia, from the African Union to the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), there is a whole world calling for effective multilateralism and for partners to build it. They are all looking to the European Union as the reliable and indispensable partner they need in this world of today. So we have a responsibility. Protecting and reforming multilateralism can only be a collective endeavour and that is why we should invest more and more in this alliance for effective multilateralism, in this effort to build partnerships at a global level to strengthen multilateralism. However, we should explore, together with the USA, any possibility to address the shortcomings of the current multilateral system and make our international institutions more effective and fit for purpose. I believe that you, this Parliament, have an important role to play when it comes to our relationship with the USA – and I think the report highlights this well – through the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on International Trade, the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and other committees and, of course, through the delegations for relations with the USA and Canada. The European Parliament’s Transatlantic Legislators’ Dialogue with the US Congress provides a very important platform for exchange, and I have witnessed at first-hand how crucial it is to engage with Congress and with different departments within the administration. This is vital work that we need to do together – and that you need to do, first and foremost. Your report, Mr Brok, concludes that we need to invest even more in people—to-people contacts across the Atlantic and I couldn’t agree more. Some of you might know that I myself benefited from an exchange programme with the USA. These kinds of exchanges are the best possible investment in the future of the transatlantic partnership because the ties that we have between Europe and the USA extend well beyond Washington DC and run deep into our societies. That is why I am so convinced that, whatever policy disagreements we may have with the administration, our friendship with the USA is here to stay. We will keep investing in this friendship, continuing at the same time to invest in European Union unity and strength, and we will continue doing it together – all the European Union institutions together with the European Parliament. This excellent report shows perfectly well the approach that we share in this partnership which has developed so much – sometimes with challenges, sometimes with easier work to be done, and in every case so crucially for the rest of the world.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Elmar Brok on his excellent report, which provides us with an in-depth analysis of the state of our relations with the United States. The report has the great merit of raising a crucial issue. Given the uncertainties introduced by the Trump administration and the many complex challenges facing us on the international stage today, what is the meaning of the transatlantic partnership? The third paragraph of the report is essential in this sense, as it reminds us how important this relationship is and how important it is that it remains strong. Beyond divisions and disagreements, I believe that both we and the United States should realize that what unites us must be stronger than what divides us. In the face of increasing conflicts around the world, the transatlantic partnership must be strengthened. In the absence of time, I will mention only two areas for which a joint transatlantic response will be crucial. First, Russian attempts to destabilize Western societies must be countered. Secondly, I believe that we must engage in a new high-level dialogue on the Western Balkans and work, both the European Union and the United States, to strengthen the rule of law and democracy in these regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 251, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Knut Fleckenstein", "mepid": "96840", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which The UNITED States is our partner and friend. For decades, we have worked together to ensure people's security and prosperity, based on shared values and mutual trust. Multilateralism and structural dialogue have always led to a common position and a common result, even in the event of disagreement. Even today, we still find many like-minded people in the United States – in Congress, in trade unions, in civil society. But we have also had to learn that it is better that we rely on our own strengths. However, the EU is a strong independent partner only if we are united, united and act together. The President of the United States is still our partner, and he is certainly not our friend. The solo actions on the Iran deal, the sending of ambassadors to promote openright populists, are two examples. And his downright hostile remarks not only damage our multilateral cooperation, but also destroy the confidence that has grown over decades. But once that trust is destroyed, it is not easy to restore even in a post-Trump era. That is why we hope for a strong Congress that, after the midterm elections, will put this president in its place. Yes, we want to continue the dialogue and together we want to continue our good, successful cooperation so far. We can do this if we Europeans remain united, if we show a clear stance and do not allow ourselves to be blackmailed, and if we work together to find a line with the United States. For this we need good ideas, courage and a will ingness to unite. However, we do not need any new scoouts for this.

Trump, with his simple answer to complex problems, his protectionist and anti—multilateralist America first instincts, is, of course, very concerning to all of us. Many of the worst predictions have – fortunately – not occurred, but his transactional approach to world affairs is indeed troubling to those of us who believe that the transatlantic partnership is a partnership rooted as much in shared democratic values as in mutual economic interests. Trump’s policies, such as the punitive tariffs on steel and aluminium, are particularly regrettable, given their implementation on spurious security grounds against the US’ own NATO allies, and his verbal attacks on EU and Member States’ domestic migration policies also shouldn’t go unchallenged. But there is an America beyond Trump and in dealing with his unorthodox approach, we must not allow this to overshadow the wider picture. When it comes to the tackling of many of the challenges we face mutually across the Atlantic, America is and will remain one of our key global allies. I welcome that the Elmar Brok report acknowledges this broad understanding.

My view is that it is precisely for this reason, and right now, that we, as the European Union, should be particularly guided in transatlantic relations by three recommendations for action. Firstly, transatlantic relations are unique because of the historical and strategic partnership and our common values. It is precisely in these times that we should try to strengthen them at all levels. They are stronger than the current American president. Secondly, differences of opinion must be addressed openly. We should defend our values and principles offensively. And thirdly, we must indeed take our destiny more into our own hands.

This is a day to look past tweets and trade wars and forget bullying and bravado. When Americans fought for freedom, help came from General Lafayette, a great European who became a true American hero. After World War II left Europe devastated, the US’ Marshall Plan helped us rebuild. We have always stood up for one another and not against each other. Today, however, our relationship is sadly and needlessly strained, not because of the peoples of Europe or United States, but because of misguided politics. Europe and the United States are the pre-eminent carriers of our Western ideas: democracy, rule of law and freedom of expression – values now under pressure both from foreign agents and from within.

That is why I also think that the report does too little to emphasise that the American military guarantee in Europe remains the only thing standing between us and President Putin in Russia. It is important for us to stress, in relation to the report that is now before us, that where we repeatedly complain about Trump's internal interference in European affairs, there are too many examples in the report of us interfering in American affairs.

Finally, if you really want good relations to continue, it would be good for the Union to assume its responsibilities since, for the time being, all we see is the continuous attempt to exploit the American market by mainly German European companies, while on the contrary the corresponding penetration of American companies into the European market is systematically undermined.

I therefore wonder about this famous Juncker-Trump deal, which in my opinion is worrying in many ways. First, because of its lack of transparency. What is the mandate by which Mr Juncker was able to negotiate with Mr Trump? Today, in this chamber, we do not know the mandate that Mr Juncker has been given. Second, by its lack of balance in interests. What are the European interests that have been defended in this agreement? It seems to me that the reintegration of the United States into the Paris Agreement would have been a precondition for any discussion with Mr. Trump. Third, because of its unreliability. We did not get, in those agreements, that tariffs on aluminum and steel could be removed by the Americans. Similarly, with regard to our partners, such as Iran, Pakistan, China, but also the Palestinians: there too, the Europeans have not obtained a guarantee of reliability.

First of all, the need from our side to be clear and consistent and I would say, simple, on what unites us across the Atlantic. Actually, no, I think we should even rethink the way in which we call this because ‘across the Atlantic’ also covers partners that have nothing to do with the United States. Think of Canada, think of Mexico and Latin America: that is also ‘across the Atlantic’ in a different manner.  So we need to be clear and consistent on what unites us and the United States, and on the EU positions and policies on all the issues where these positions diverge with the United States, in a very clear, realistic manner. I think this is a good basis for having what some of you called a ‘principled and pragmatic approach’ to keeping a strong partnership with the United States. Secondly, I very much agree with all of you who said that our relationship with the United States can only benefit from a strong investment in a stronger European Union.  A bolder, stronger European Union is good for itself, it is good for building other kinds of partnerships, and I very much agree that this is what we need to focus on now. As we keep working on the partnership with the United States we also need to differentiate and become a strong point of reference for all those around the world that are still looking for a strong partner on multilateralism and other things: free and fair trade, human rights – the list could continue.  But I think that history tells us that we need to be extremely serious as regards ourselves, the European Union, and how to strengthen our own means, be it on defence, be it on trade, be it on foreign policy, and the list can continue. This is an opportunity for us somehow.  I do not want to comment on the issue of ‘America First’. America First can mean America first but not alone. It can also mean America alone. This is subject to different interpretations even within the Administration or within the political debate in what is a very rich and lively democracy, but I think what we should focus upon is not so much ‘America First’ as ‘Strong Europe’. This is what is required from us and especially from decision-makers in the European Union today. How do we make our European Union stronger in this kind of context? I think that it is important for us to be extremely clear and bold within the European Union too about our principles, values and interests, and be consistent on the way to uphold them.  Last but not least, let me thank all the House, and in particular those of you who have been working intensely over these years on your constant contacts with your US counterparts in Congress. This will continue to be essential in the last months of your mandate, so I would like to ask you to keep this work going, even if most of you will be engaged in the electoral campaign. These months are crucial for parliamentary work to be continued between you and your colleagues in the US Congress, and I can only hope that the next Parliament will be as engaged as you have been in this fight.

Herzlichen Dank für die Debatte. Viktor Orbán ist in unserer Fraktion, und deswegen bin ich immer hin und her gerannt, weil wir eine wichtige Entscheidung zu treffen haben, wie wir alle wissen. Ich möchte für die breite Unterstützung danken. Ich möchte feststellen, dass die USA trotz Trump eine Demokratie mit checks and balances sind. Das ist der Unterschied zu China und Russland. Dies dürfen wir bei allen Bewertungen nicht aus den Augen verlieren, daran müssen wir anknüpfen. Damit müssen wir deutlich machen, dass wir die ganzen USA meinen, mit denen wir enger zusammenarbeiten müssen. Dafür müssen wir auch neue Instrumente nutzen, die teilweise angesprochen worden sind, wie auch den Vorschlag eines europäisch-amerikanischen Außenminister-Rates, den Frau Mogherini von unserer Seite leiten soll. Ich möchte an dieser Stelle auch John McCain erwähnen. John McCain was a man who did not always take a position that we liked, but he was a man of Western values. He was a man of American-European friendship. He was a man who was clearly convinced of Western values. For example, he was for democracy and the rule of law, and against torture. Therefore we should praise him in this way and, because of this moment, recognise that the global order should be influenced by the democracies of this world, which means that the Europeans and the Americans have to work closely together. It is not just a matter of facts in certain cases, and interest in trade treaties: it is about the overall values which should run this world, and that requires cooperation between the United States and Europe.

I do not agree with the report's criticism of the Withdrawal of the United States from the negotiations for a global UN agreement on migration.  Hungary takes a similar stance when it unequivocally and firmly rejects illegal immigration and defends the identity, religion and culture of Europe and the nations that make up Europe. The Hungarian Government has also decided to withdraw from the process of preparing a 'global compact on safe, orderly and orderly migration' and will not attend the Marrakesh Conference in December for the adoption of the document, as the contested convention is completely contrary to the interests of the country.

Therefore, without a stable government, capable of controlling the territory, migratory flows are set to increase, as is the arms and drug trade that fuels terrorism.

Spero quindi che la discussione di questa sera – che purtroppo, come vedo, non coinvolge moltissimi colleghi parlamentari, ma spero sia di qualità – rifletta questo bisogno forte che c'è di unità e di senso di urgenza sull'affrontare uniti come istituzioni europee una situazione che è davvero per noi prioritaria. Per noi come Unione europea e per la nostra amicizia con la Libia, anche perché, come ha ricordato, nelle recenti settimane, ancora ieri, abbiamo visto una nuova escalation di violenza a Tripoli e attorno a Tripoli, con differenti milizie che competono per le risorse e per il potere, e abbiamo visto civili, inclusi migranti, essere di nuovo vittime di scambi di colpi di arma da fuoco, e abbiamo visto ancora una volta importanti infrastrutture essere distrutte. Questo ci dice che la violenza in Libia, nonostante alcuni passi che sono stati fatti, ma sta ancora bloccando, sta ancora bloccando un intero paese che avrebbe un immenso potenziale sia per lo sviluppo umano sia per lo sviluppo economico. The attack on the National Oil Corporation yesterday that you mentioned, like the attack on the electoral commission on 2 May 2018, was both a symptom and a cause of the instability in Libya, and these attacks undermine the ability of the state to serve the Libyan people. The ceasefire is fragile but it is holding and – let me stress today, because we have heard statements and declarations in the past couple of hours – it needs to continue to be respected. It is important to send that strong message from this Chamber tonight, with our united voices, because various protagonists inside Libya need to refrain from stoking tensions, not just by their actions but also by their words. Libya needs serenity at this moment, not inflammatory statements. When the latest escalation started, I was first of all in contact immediately with UN Special Representative Salamé, supporting his work which has been essential in brokering a ceasefire. We also responded immediately with humanitarian assistance, sending doctors, paramedics and essential equipment. However, I want to stress that, beyond these latest steps, our engagements, as the European institutions, has been intense and constant throughout the years and, in particular, in recent months. The European Union’s delegation has now returned to Tripoli. The last time we discussed Libya it was May and your parliamentary delegation had just returned from a visit to Tripoli, after a long time without visits, for clear reasons. You, Mr President, also visited afterwards and I was there in July, honoured to be able to visit and to open the EU offices in Tripoli, and to be able to tell the Libyan authorities and the Libyan people: we are back, we have always been here with our projects, our support and our work, but we are also back physically, which is important. I reported to the Foreign Affairs Council right after I returned to Brussels from that visit. Days ago, I spoke again to Fayez al-Sarraj, Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya and Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord (GNA), and we agreed to meet at the UN General Assembly in New York in a couple of weeks from now. Libya will be very high on the agenda there, including at the European Union Foreign Ministers’ meeting that I will convene as High Representative of the European Union. But let me focus now on four issues that have been and are central to our engagement. The first is the political transition. Two-and-a-half million Libyans have registered to vote, showing their desire to turn the page. Tens of townhall meetings have been organised all around the country, in difficult conditions and with our support. The Libyan people have the right to choose their representatives safely and freely through the ballot box and we are helping the electoral commission in this: we were already helping it before it was attacked in May, and since then we have increased our assistance. As I’ve said before, the Libyans have to know exactly what they are voting for. A solid constitutional framework has to be agreed before the elections. It would be imprudent to elect a president in a legal vacuum. This has always been our common European position and I know that Parliament’s delegation conveyed these messages to both the High Council of State and the House of Representatives during their visit in May. My second point concerns the security situation. The Council is reviewing the mandates of both our civilian and our military operations and missions, working with the Libyan authorities, the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) and Operation Sofia. EUBAM plays an important role first of all in border management and we all know how crucial this issue is, first and foremost for the territorial borders of Libya and for migration management but also for all sorts of trafficking and for counterterrorism reasons. However, EUBAM is also working on law enforcement and criminal justice: it has facilitated training for the judicial police and the criminal investigations department, and it works with Libyan officials on border management. Operation Sofia is training the Libyan coastguards and enforcing the UN Security Council resolutions on the arms and oil embargo. So it is carrying out a responsibility and a duty that also comes from the UN system. Its strategic review is currently under way, and all the EU Member States – I discussed this with both the Defence and the Foreign Ministers a couple of weeks ago in Vienna – have confirmed that they want to preserve Operation Sofia. Its work is perceived by all the Member States, and by our Libyan counterparts, as essential for Libya and for Europe. So I cannot overemphasise how crucial it is that we confirm our commitment to Libya’s security with both EUBAM and Operation Sofia, working at sea and on land. The third issue is the economic situation. We discussed this at length with the Foreign Ministers in July, when we had Libya on our agenda, and it is another essential aspect in helping to stabilise the country and meet the aspirations of the Libyan people. Together with the rest of the international community, we managed to contain the July oil crisis, but the underlying issues remain and could flare up again at any moment. The UN Security Council will renew the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) on Thursday this week, and the Special Representative has asked the mission to act on economic reforms: on wealth distribution and on uniting the financial institutions. This issue has been placed at the heart of the work by the UN Special Representative, and rightly so. It is also an issue that the Libyan authorities are identifying as a key element in handling and managing the current situation in Libya, and I fully support this view. I think that handling the economic situation, in particular with economic reforms, wealth distribution and the uniting of the country’s financial institutions, is going to be a key part of our work. So we fully support this agenda and, accordingly, we have joined the economic dialogue together with the USA, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Our goal is to help Libya implement reforms to ensure that the revenues deriving from oil can be distributed in a transparent manner and benefit the people of Libya. My fourth and last point concerns migration. In our work with the African Union and the United Nations that we started after the EU-African Union summit in Abidjan last November, and together with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and in close partnership with the African Union, we have freed thousands of people from detention centres in Libya – changing the approach to some extent and addressing the issues from the point of view of partnership and cooperation with the international organisations. However, the lives and rights of thousands of migrants continue to be threatened, even more so as the result of a spiral of violence in the country. We know very well that migrants can become, and most often do become, the first targets and the first victims when violence inflates. All parties should ensure unhindered access for the UNHCR and the UN, both inside and outside detention centres, and all obstacles to their ability to operate fully should be removed, while we continue to work towards emptying the detention centres, providing those who want to go back home with an opportunity to do so, and opening a safe path to Europe for those who have the right to international protection. Let me say that emptying detention centres remains one of our key objectives and we are working towards it with, as I said, good results so far, but obviously the security situation also has an impact on that work. On this point, in relation to the international protection of those migrants who are entitled to international protection, let me say that EU Member States have a special responsibility. I call on them to accelerate the pace of evacuations from Libya through Niger because, just as we are working well with the IOM on voluntary returns by migrants who were trapped in Libya and want to go back, and we support that, we also have the responsibility and the duty to give international protection to those who are in need of and entitled to it. It’s a matter of credibility and it’s also a matter of efficiency. That goes too for our collective investment in the field of migration. Let me say here that the European Union has done its part. The Commission is investing more resources in the European Union Trust Fund for Africa. It is now up to Member States to do their part, in line with the commitments they made at the June European Council, and invest more money in Africa. The Member States need to do their part here because the European Union, the Commission and the institutions have increased enormously the amount of money we invest in Africa, not only in the traditional fields of development aid, humanitarian aid, peace and security, but also in economic issues, in trade, in good governance and rule of law, in human rights, in women’s and youth participation, and in many other issues, including climate change which is extremely important in relation to migration. However, we need Member States not only to say that we need to invest more in Africa but also to invest more in Africa themselves, with a partnership approach. Having said that, it is also true that the number of migrants who crossed the Mediterranean in this first part of this year – and now it’s already the ninth month – was down by 80% compared to the same period last year, and this is a result of the joint partnership that we have established not only with Libya but also, and mainly, with the UN and its agencies, UNHCR and IOM and with the African Union. It is also the result of the work we have initiated, together with our African partners, in the past couple of years following the Valetta summit. However, again, we need the Member States to put in more money and more resources. We have always been close to the Libyan people. I mentioned migration as the last point because I think that our main message today to Libya and Libyans has to be that our work with them, and for them, has them at the centre. We care about Libya not just because it is a crossing point for migrants but for the sake of Libya itself, and this is the centre of our work with them. We’ve always been close to the Libyan people, all the Libyan people, investing in their healthcare, in basic services, in security and in local governance, and it is even more important to do that now. It is important for Libyans. It is important for us Europeans because there is no European security and no European stability if there is no security and stability in Libya. Today it is our collective responsibility to remain a united and strong partner for Libya and a united and strong partner for the United Nations, as we are the first and most relevant supporter of their crucial work. So I trust, once again, that the positions expressed by Parliament will reflect this strong need for the European Union to pay attention to Libya, first of all as a matter of priority and, secondly, with full unity.

Elections before the close of this year looked increasingly unlikely, particularly as we now see Italy taking a more proactive role in the process. Prime Minister Conte has said getting the elections is right and is more important than their actual timing, and I agree. This seems also to mark a shift from the French position championed by President Macron at the Libya summit in May and a move now towards an Italian-led solution. Obviously, Italy’s historical links to Libya are extremely strong, but the EU’s southern neighbour’s stabilisation is, of course, in the interests of all the Member States, and we need unity on this if we are to prevent a greater migratory flux in future and the creation of a base for international terrorism, drug dealing and an arms trade.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 287, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Javier Nart", "mepid": "125005", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, Mrs Mogherini, I do not think we understand the contempt and spite they have in Libya towards us, for having imposed on him a puppet government, a non-existent person — Fayez al-Sarrach — with all the institutions, even the Council of State.

The UNHCR warns against sending migrants back to Libya and is highly critical of the establishment of reception centres in Libya.  The International Organisation for Migration is asking for four thousand evacuation sites in the EU. And that is why I ask you specifically, Mrs Mogherini: do you have any commitments from Member States to take in evacuees? Will cooperation with the remnants of the Libyan coastguard be cut off to prevent refugees from being returned to Libya?

Mr President, the debates on Libya are always a bit surreal. We act like Libya is a normal state. However, there is no state in Libya. The recent events in Tripoli have just shown us. Militias in the pay of a particular government faction are fighting among themselves to take control of the capital. One may even wonder if there is still a government and, more than ever, what it controls. All Libyans pay a high price for this lack of state, but sub-Saharan migrants are particularly hard hit. There are estimated to be around 8,000 in Tripoli, abandoned by all, starving, the objects of the worst abuse and the most monstrous trafficking, locked up, carried from one detention centre to another as the fighting unfolds. One wonders where humanitarian aid is going. The road to Niger, Commissioner, is cut off. European states have not fulfilled their resettlement commitments. Niger no longer wants any refugees until the European states have fulfilled their commitments. That is why we are a number of MEPs from several political groups calling for the evacuation of these migrants from Tripoli, the opening of humanitarian corridors and the cessation of support for the famous Libyan coastguard. They bring the migrants back to shore, where they are reportedly registered, but no one knows what happens next. We cannot turn a blind eye to these horrors, not hear the testimonies of the survivors. There can be no miraculous elections in such a context. It is a profound contempt for the Libyan people and Commissioner, you are well aware that if the number of crossings decreases, the number of deaths is not the case. There is one death for 18 crossings today, whereas there was one for 42 last year, that is not even at the height of the crossings.

It could be considered that, instead of re-establishing exclusive control zones of one militia or another, it would be done together so that none would have exclusive control of the institutions. It would be a temporary solution, under the auspices of the United Nations, that should be linked to a roadmap that sought the progressive integration of the different forces into unified units.

Now, there is no question of the European Union's commitment in recent years, but I think that the main task we have today is to help define a new roadmap for Libya, involving all the internal and external actors, including the militias that were not called into the Skhirat Agreement. The European Union's action in this respect is also decisive for the Member States.

The perverse spiral is all too clear: as long as they know that we need them to get rid of the migrant problem by hiding it, they will have a very powerful weapon of blackmail to gain political support and money. Pecunia non olet. There is no shortage of funding on both sides, and as long as they receive support from regional powers, and also from European countries, they will have the constant illusion that they can, if not win militarily, at least maintain a privileged position. This dismantling and unification will be a chimera, an evil and disintegrating game by actors who selfishly try to favor one group at the expense of another, only to be able to increase their influence. And it is time for them to tell us something about this too, such as the crazy idea of holding elections without security and without a legal framework. Some students don't really learn anything from history. In addition, there are other factors of instability: a resurgence of pro-Gaddafi supporters, the growing influence of the Radical Salafite Group of Madkhalists and the very serious situation in Fezzan, where endogenous militias are joined by rebel groups from neighbouring countries, as well as the consolidated presence of Al Qaeda and Isis militiamen.  We must strengthen the enlarged regional cooperation with the G5 Sahel, of course, but these tasks that we have abroad must first of all begin to do them at home. Without a compulsory preventive and permanent redistribution system, without a truly common asylum system and legal access routes, we will continue to feed libya's vicious circle.

I believe that is what every time we make a speech in this House, and while Mr Urbán was at sea with the NGOs , which we have also proposed precisely for the Sakharov Prize - we entered Tripoli precisely to say not only that the centres had to be closed, that IOM and UNHCR had to be supported to help migrants leave voluntarily , that there was the agreement signed with Niger but that Member States are not fulfilling their obligations to remove those who cannot even ask to return to their places of origin. And, therefore, I think it is important that the voice of libyans is also heard in this speech, because we saw that the small steps, the policy of small steps that may seem to some criminals, is the opposite: that is, you cannot change everything, but the fact that the coastguards are framed by lifelong learning , makes it possible for NGOs to receive, disembark and give them a kit and register returnees.

Can I start by saying you’re 22 in this Hemicycle tonight discussing Libya, and I think you expressed at least 15 different positions. You’re asking me to represent a strong, united European position. If I had to represent your views (and it’s not my job), it would be a difficult task. This is to make you understand that the effort we are trying to do is to represent a united, strong – not only political – position, but action: action, with Libyans, putting the interest of the Libyans first, not the interests of one group, or one militia or one militia against the other, but the Libyan citizens. Because you are perfectly right: reality on the ground is different from the theory of the negotiations. But those thousands of Libyans that have been registering to vote in the last months are asking for normality in their lives and are knowing very well that the state doesn’t exist, has never existed in Libya. But they want it. They want the oil revenues to benefit a normal organisation of services. They want the richness of their country and their natural resources to benefit normal people. They’re asking for a normal life, and this is our first thought; this is what guides our action: trying to create the unity that maybe you cannot find in this Hemicycle – I hope yes – but among our Member States. And let me be very clear on elections, because I have heard your voices and I know very well what is the current debate, especially among commentators and in the media about that, but we do have a clear, common European Union position that I have been expressing in these months, including to our Libyan interlocutors and on which we have been working with the UN special representative in these months on a daily basis, which is that elections will need to take place first of all in a sustainable security environment. Secondly, with a clear constitutional and legal framework: Libyans need to know for what they are asked to vote. And we need to have the reasonable certainty that all different stakeholders will accept the result of the elections the day after the elections. Then it’s not for anybody else to define the date; that is why we have an electoral committee that we are supporting, because we want the Libyans to run the process, to decide the process, but they need our help, they need our support, from the basic financial need to have computers in the offices to the even more basic need to have offices, because with the attack they had in May, they couldn’t even use the offices anymore. So we are doing this work, we’re trying to empower the Libyans to decide for themselves and to try to help the United Nations to run this difficult political process in a way that gives an answer to the demand of the Libyan people to have institutions that function, which is, I think, a natural expectation of anybody in the world. And I will continue discussing this and working on this, not only with the UN special representative Salamé in New York in a couple of weeks’ time, but also with our Libyan interlocutors and with the main regional players, because what is essential is that we coordinate this work not only with the UN, not only among ourselves in the European Union, but also that we coordinate with the neighbouring countries, with the African Union and with the Arab League. And believe me, it’s quite something. But I think that, on the support of the process of political transition, compared to a few years ago, we have a better international and regional understanding of the needs that need to be addressed. On migration: for me personally it’s quite painful, after all the fights and all the work I have personally tried to make in these years, swimming against the, how do you say, nuotando controcorrente (I ask the help of the translators). And you know very well that the mainstream in the European Union Member States and even in this Parliament is not to put focus and priority on saving lives. This has been my priority, and this is why today we have Sophia at sea that is fighting the traffickers, trying to train the Libyan coastguards, together with the NGOs and with the UN humanitarian agencies that are doing the training. We cannot be selective on when we like the UN agencies or the NGOs and when we don’t, or when we ignore that they’re working with us. We cannot can pick and choose. The work we’re trying to do is exactly because we know there’s a problem. You can forget it and complain and do nothing, or you can try to engage and you can try to have a different kind of picture. Is it perfect? Far from it. Is it better than before? Starting to get better and may be at risk of getting worse now again, because the fight against militias is creating a different kind of dynamic. But this is the reason why we have added to the mandate of Operation Sophia the training of the Libyan coast guards, including on human rights standards and including with the UN agencies and with the NGOs, because we want that to start to be part of the DNA of the extremely limited institutional work that is done there. Because we cannot say we need to empower the Libyans without interfering and then say it’s useless, they cannot run either the country nor the territorial waters. It’s a contradiction in terms. So what we need to do is to work with them on the international standards and try to upgrade the levels not only of efficiency but also of respect of human rights. This is the same kind of work we have been doing and we are continuing to do in extremely difficult conditions on the detention centres, where we finally managed – together with the African Union, which I want to thank, and together with the IOM and UNHCR, which I’d like to thank, because when we started this work, they were not even present in the country, and we are there together. When we started this work a couple of years ago, I remember perfectly well the first meetings we had with the UNCHR and the IOM, and they were telling us: ‘no way we’re going back to Libya, we’re not there, we’re not operating there, we only have a few local staff.’ And we have been working together in these years to bring them back, to be ourselves back (and finally we are), and to work with our African partners. I fully share with you – and I said it at the beginning – most of our Member States are not doing their part, especially when it comes to giving international protection to those in need. The issue of the refugees that are entitled to protection that are in Niger needs to be addressed by Member States. There’s an engagement, there’s a commitment that needs to be respected. That’s clear. And I appreciate you raising your voice on this as well as – I have heard that much tonight from you on this, but I trust we agree on that – on the resources we allocate for our partnership with countries of origin and transit, because they need our support in this. So priority number one is to diminish the number of people dying inside Libya, at sea, and in the desert before they enter Libya. Second is also reducing the number of migrants arriving, because we are working in destroying the system of business of the traffickers. These are the objectives we have. Is it easy? Is it accomplished? No, it’s not easy and it’s not accomplished yet. But the trend compared to when we had nothing – no European Union policy or presence on this fight (and that was just four years ago, I would like to remind you all: you were here) – there was no policy at all. No European Union presence at sea at all, at land at all, no work on this file. It was left to single Member States. But by the way: change in government, change policies. So I think that we need to keep working very hard on this, keeping in mind first and foremost the facts some of you have mentioned. We cannot talk about Libya only because we are worried about the migrants. I agree with you: there is some frustration. My experience is this: the biggest frustration of the Libyans is when we remember that Libya exists only in relation to the number of migrants arriving in Europe, whereas they’ve been suffering for years, for different reasons: first because of a dictatorship and then because of a state of conflict, and they deserve to have a normal country and a normal life.

It is a pleasure. We have another debate after this, but I have got used to that now. On this debate, I want to say seriously that I share the sense of urgency that has made you call for this debate. The demolition of this small Palestinian village would not only affect a local community, as one would think; it would also be a blow against the viability of the State of Palestine and against the very possibility of a two-state solution.  The Israeli High Court last week rejected the petitions by the residents of the Palestinian village of Khan al-Ahmar and allowed the Israeli authorities to proceed with the plans for demolition within seven days. Any day now, the Israeli authorities could start demolishing this community and evict the residents from their homes, including parents and children. This is why last week I called once again on the Israeli authorities to reconsider this decision. That demolition would have grave humanitarian consequences and it would be contrary to Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention. The demolition of Khan al-Ahmar, together with plans for further settlement expansions in the same area, would also severely threaten the viability of the two-state solution, as I said. The village is located in the so-called ‘E1’ area, which is of strategic importance for preserving the contiguity of a future Palestinian state.  The European Union and its Member States have been crystal clear about their opposition to this demolition. The Foreign Affairs Council has systematically drawn attention to the plight of Bedouin communities in the West Bank and has repeatedly stated its strong opposition to Israel’s settlements policy. Such a policy is illegal under international law, including the demolitions of Palestinian communities and the possible forced transfers of population. These are positions we share completely, as demonstrated by the European Parliament’s resolution in May last year. The EU and its Member States expressed their concerns about the imminent demolition through repeated statements, démarches and ministerial letters to the Israeli authorities, and the representatives of several Member States were present at the village on 5 July when the Israeli forces attempted to cordon it off. Until now, these efforts have been to no avail. Israel claims that the community has been built without the required building permits. It is important to note, however, that it is virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain any building permits in Area C of the West Bank, as confirmed by the quartet report we produced in July 2016. We Europeans, together with our international partners, have worked intensively to speed up the approval of master plans in Area C, but again, with little success. Israeli authorities have advanced plans for thousands of new settlement units, including attempts to regularise buildings that have been built without any permit or planning in Israeli settlements. This is the situation on the ground: new settlements for Israelis are built, while Palestinian homes in the same area are demolished. This will only further entrench a one-state reality, with unequal rights for the two peoples, perpetual occupation and conflict. The two-state solution is today under serious threat – more than ever before – and yet there is no realistic and viable alternative that would end the conflict and achieve a just and lasting peace. This is also mainly, I would say, in Israel’s interest.  This is why the European Union does not and will not give up on a negotiated two-state solution. We will continue our engagement on the ground in support of building a viable Palestinian state, in support of the essential work that UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) is doing, and in support of projects that keep the perspective of a two-state solution alive. Several Member States are involved in the funding of Khan al-Ahmar, in particular, the tyre school. Thanks to their engagement, hundreds of Palestinian children have been able to go to school and receive quality education, and I am glad that the European Parliament is also asking the Israeli authorities not to implement the decision to demolish and not to strip an entire Palestinian community of their homes and their children of the school. Again, I stress this: this would not be in the interests of Israel itself.  Any irregularity issues in the community should be solved in dialogue with its residents and not through demolition and displacement. All energy and resources should go into seeking political solutions for achieving peace, not into creating more grievances, which will only perpetuate the conflict.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 311, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Madam High Representative, my group has not supported the addition of this debate to the agenda. We have not been in favour because we believe that an isolated discussion of one aspect or another related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot lead to a balanced debate. Such a debate on an isolated aspect will not contribute to a lasting peace in the Middle East, which remains our ultimate goal. Our efforts would be better invested if Europe became more involved in the peace process. Secondly, for us, the European Union - through the declaration that you yourself made on 7 September - has taken a fairly clear position on the threat of the demolition of Khan el-Ahmar. The European Union's position on Israeli settlements is also well known, including in terms of demolitions and possible transfers of Palestinian populations. Now, where there is a fairly broad agreement, I believe, in our Parliament, is on the need to find a decent solution for the situation of these people. They have been in makeshift facilities for years, where safety and safety conditions are very difficult to bear. These facilities were declared illegal in 2009 by the Supreme Court and since then much effort has been made to find an alternative with the Israeli authorities with the proposed resettlement in Jahalin West. Moreover, the recent decision of the Supreme Court, rejecting the complaints of the inhabitants of Khan el-Ahmar, acknowledges these efforts and expresses the hope that a solution can be found peacefully and by mutual consent. I add the fact that I have seen the text of the joint resolution proposed by some groups. We will not support a text that goes all the way.

Of course it goes far beyond a specific situation of 180 specific people, although it is already worth making this statement alone.

Nevertheless, they have been using all legal possibilities to prevent a divorce scenario from happening. The decision of the Israeli High Court of Justice of 5 September did not come as a surprise, either for the Bedouins or for us. Israel is once again proving that it does not abide by international law, notably the 4th Geneva Convention, which prohibits the forcible transfer of a population unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.

Khan al—Ahmar is the most recent in a series of planned village destruction.

To add insult to injury, the Israeli State plans to forcibly relocate the inhabitants to a site right next to a public rubbish dump. This House likes to think it stands up for political freedom and democracy.

Thank you, Mr President. Under the absolute leadership of President Xi Jinping, the People's Republic of China is developing particularly dynamically and ambitiously internally and externally. Accurate tracing and interpretation of this complex process is necessary for a realistic European approach to close relations with Beijing. This report aims to make a responsible contribution to this. Thanks, much even, to the substantial input of the shadow rapporteurs. A crucial principle for solid EU-China relations is reciprocity. But please in all areas! In terms of market access, for example, but also in terms of press freedom. Reciprocity breeds mutual trust and forms a solid foundation of a strategic partnership between the EU and China that also deserves this promising name fairly. However, reciprocity is an ideal, and this report clearly points to this. In fact, the report makes no mistake that, from a European perspective, concerns about the policies of the sole Ruling Chinese Communist Party are growing. For example, when we talk about Tibet, Xinjiang, the sinification of all religions, the social credit system, the militarisation of the South China Sea, the law on international NGOs and the escalating tensions in relations with Taiwan, these are the sensitive issues of choice for Chinese censorship. This open view from the European Parliament on EU-China relations is appropriate, in addition to promoting European interests, the overall well-being of the citizens of the People's Republic. To use a winged official Chinese expression: a win-win situation on the ground of the citizens!  In the meantime, this report also encourages European self-criticism. China's ambitious global dynamism, and therefore to Europe (key word Belt and Road Initiative), urgently calls for a thoughtful European strategy. To name just one major challenge, Beijing is now considering northern and southern variants on our continent, following the controversial 16+1 format, with no less than eleven EU Member States from Central and Eastern Europe and five Balkan countries. Finally, Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to underline the last sentence of paragraph 14 in the report: the strong promotion of our knowledge of China through substantial European support for independent think tanks of a high scientific level! I have been able to taste and benefit from such European expertise in the work on this report. From Berlin to Beijing! With the EU's adequate political application of in-depth knowledge of China and its people, I wholeheartedly want, a European dynamic will mate with the Chinese dynamics and promote balanced relations between the EU and China. Thank you very much. I have been very pleased to work on this report. It's my last year of office. But as long as I have health, my interest will certainly continue to be on the EU-China relationship, because we are dealing here with an extremely important trading partner and an emerging power on the world stage. I was moved and still impressed by the enormous expertise in the European delegation in Beijing. The participants really looked at the general European interests, but at the same time also took into consideration the overall, material and intangible well-being of the Chinese population.

First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, for a very balanced report which accurately reflects the state of EU-China relations and the key issues at stake. And thank you too, Mr Belder, for your work to find a broad consensus on such a strategic issue for Europe – one which in the past has been more divisive. This is a major achievement. I’m also glad to see that the report echoes the EU strategy for relations with China that we adopted two years ago and I am very satisfied with the work you’ve been doing with our delegation in Beijing and with all our teams working in China and with China. The European Union and China are two of the great powers of the world of today and we don’t always see eye to eye. On the contrary, we have some fundamental disagreements. They are very evident. But, as two global powers, we both understand that our cooperation is essential to address the main challenges we face. If we want to preserve the multilateral system and make it more effective, engagement with China is an absolute must. And I have to say I’ve seen, in the past six or seven months, very strong engagement from the Chinese side, and also from the European side, which I have been able to channel, working increasingly in the multilateral framework on global issues in general terms. In recent years, China has become much more active on the global stage and China looks to the European Union as a partner on many issues where our interests converge. Our cooperation is already intense on most foreign policy matters: we’re working together to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran; we both support the ongoing negotiations towards a reconciled and denuclearised Korean peninsula; we both want to see peace in Afghanistan and we are both actively supporting the Afghan Government’s efforts to bring forward the peace process. As you can tell from these examples, China sees the European Union now not just as a huge market and an investor, not just an economic player – the traditional view – but also increasingly as a global political player and a global security provider. Our security cooperation is getting stronger in various parts of the world. For instance, we cooperate on the ground in Mali and in Somalia, where we are both present with our security personnel. We work together in various parts of the world global issues, particularly in the UN framework. This summer, at the EU-China summit, we agreed a very substantial and ambitious statement on climate change, for instance. We have agreed to step up our cooperation to reduce emissions and implement the Paris Agreement. But even when our starting point is not the same, there is still room for working together and building win-win solutions. Take investment in Africa as an example. As you know, whenever we Europeans bring new investment to Africa we always bear in mind the Sustainable Development Goals. We want European investment to create quality jobs, to increase peace, stability and good governance in human rights, and to focus in particular on opportunities for women and youth. Everybody knows that China is already a major player in Africa. Our approach is not the same, but if we want to promote sustainable development and sustainable security in Africa, engagement with China is key to achieving results on the ground. Even if we come from different starting points we can explore the possibilities for trilateral cooperation among Europe, China and Africa and find common fields of work that are beneficial for all. Another good example is the ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative. I believe we must not be afraid to engage with China, creating synergies between their initiative and our projects on connectivity. We believe that big infrastructure projects should, first of all, create opportunities and jobs in all the countries along the New Silk Road, and that these projects should be about sustainable development for local communities and not about crafting new spheres of influence. Only if we engage together with China can we make our interests, our goals, our vision and our connectivity converge. Both the European Union and China are part of the world’s economic G3, together with the USA. The choice ahead of us is straightforward. We could choose a conflictual approach, going for trade wars that would hurt everyone, or we can work together with China to make the global economic system more just and fair. We have a number of disagreements with China when it comes to trade – and I believe you have had the chance to discuss them at length, not only with me but also with Commissioner Malmström – ranging from the issue of over-capacity to intellectual property. Our choice is clear. We want to deal with these issues within the framework of a rules-based international system. We want our trade with China to be based on reciprocity and to be free and fair. This is the only way to achieve a solution that benefits both Europe and China, instead of going for a lose—lose trade conflict. Definitely we should go for the win—win solution, avoiding any scenario of a lose—lose confrontation. I believe we share the same approach here with China now on the need to find, or to build, cooperative win—win solutions and approaches, rather than entering on, or fuelling, the conflictual trends we are seeing. Dialogue and engagement are the best way forward for us, not just on trade but on all issues, when we disagree with China. I could mention – as you yourself – the situation in the South China Sea, or restrictions to freedom of expression in Hong Kong, and we regret that the dialogue with Taiwan has been frozen for the past three years. Of course, the most outstanding disagreement we have with China concerns the human rights situation in China as underlined in your report. During the last EU-China human rights dialogue we spoke up against the recent restrictions on freedom of religion, on minorities’ rights and on freedom of association and expression. We raised our position against the death penalty, as we always do with all countries that still have that penalty, and we discussed the impartiality of the justice system. We also focused on the situation in Xinjiang, especially the expansion of political re-education camps, and we discussed the detention of human rights defenders, including particular cases. We know that the Chinese Government does not share all our principles and values and they know that we are in different places in some issues. It is also very clear that we will not sacrifice our values in the name of ‘real politics’: we are always very clear on that. On the contrary, we will continue to engage with China precisely to advance our values and our interests, because Europe and China recognise and understand each other’s importance in shaping a more cooperative global order. I would say that this, in a nutshell, describes the state of play of our relations with China today. We recognise each other as fundamental key players on the global stage of today’s world. We know that, at this moment in world history, cooperation and engagement are simply the smartest choice and that, on some global and also some regional issues, if the European Union and China work together, this makes the difference in the world. Your report, Mr Belder, rightly points out that China is a complex partner, and our engagement takes different forms on different issues, but we should not be afraid of a more proactive and a more confident China. The Chinese look at Europe as a global power, and our dialogue can help the world to move beyond the current chaos towards a better global order. It is a dialogue based on clarity, on respect, and on our interests and values, and it can be one that benefits both Europe and China, as well as the rest of the world. I am glad this is also the spirit of your report, Mr Belder, and I’m glad that you built such consensus on what is a crucial issue for the present and the future of our continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 324, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Stefan Eck", "mepid": "124863", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

This shows that we attach greater importance to this issue, and I would like to thank Mr Belder and the other shadow rapporteurs. In fact, we have reached 27 compromises, and there are no amendments in plenary. So, this House has broad agreement on how we see China and how we are developing our relationship with China.  We have a strategic partnership with China and, of course, we have to define what that means. Are these just words or does it have any practical benefit? And the EU must ask itself: what are the fields in which we can also carry out this strategy with China? As has already been said here: climate protection is doing very well, and certain peace initiatives are also progressing quite well.  China has launched a number of initiatives where the EU is lagging behind. Mrs Mogherini, you mentioned the Silk Road or the gigantic investment programme in Africa. We do not really have an answer to that yet. I would also ask you how we deal with this. We lament at the Silk Road that it is a one-sided Chinese project. How do we get there as Europe? And in Africa, I read in the Global Times, the English edition of the official Chinese newspaper, that Europeans are doing the education and training of Africans and that China is doing the infrastructure projects. So we do not want such a division of labour. And we must commit China to international standards, including to the Sustainable Development Goals, which they have also signed. And there is the question of whether we have dialogues and whether there are signals that China is taking part in this. Well, the economy is still at the heart of our cooperation. Indeed, we must also protect ourselves where necessary because there are unfair conditions.  I would also like to mention the Internet and innovation. We see all sorts of discrimination. We cannot accept that either, we have to speak a hard language. Last but not least, the 19th Party Congress has developed a model that competes with our liberal model of democracy.

Madam President, Mrs Mogherini, I would like to thank mrs Mogherini for her work on this Nearly 47 years ago, the world was amazed when, after years of no relations and communication, Richard Nixon suddenly traveled to Beijing. The US wanted China as a partner in the fight against Russia. They were prepared to make economic concessions. None of this constellation is present today. If China prospers and has a strong influence on all world economic processes, after the social catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution, this is above all the self-determined way of guaranteeing social and economic progress to its population, which is almost one-fifth of the world's population. But this has implications for the entire world – for the economy, the environment, peace, resource consumption, international coexistence, and democratic constitution both internally and externally – and also requires political positions of all other partners. Much of the developments in China, the indivisibility of political and social human rights, and personal freedoms require justified criticism and open dialogue to resolve contradictions. For the European Union – and I have heard this from you, Mrs Mogherini – it is crucial to stick to the previous approach of working in partnership with China on rules-based solutions to the common challenges.

The facts: the United States has a 375 billion deficit compared to China, it wants to reduce it to 200. Europe has had 170 in the last ten years, almost 1,500 billion. Why do we need to regulate trade? Because it means loss of know-how, unemployment, relocation and loss of sovereignty. On the WTO, China should not have become a member, but Paulson, president of Goldman Sachs at the time, had negotiated in return for the purchase of bonds, issued by Goldman Sachs.

Above all, I want to draw attention to the massive repression of local religion and culture in minority areas. The Chinese authorities continue to prevent Tibetans from exercising their fundamental rights and it cannot even be said how many imprisonments for dissenting opinions have taken place in recent years. Regarding the situation in Xinjiang, the latest report shows that up to one million Uighurs are believed to be held in internment camps. In this context, I believe that a clear message must be sent to China: deepening the strategic partnership will also depend on concrete results in the field of human rights.

A strategic relationship that is even more crucial when Trump's United States is a dangerous factor in questioning multilateralism and international destabilization. But this strategic relationship has to seek to build synergies in which we do not expect China to act consistently with its obligations from the outset as a member of the Permanent Security Council, a member of the WTO and on the basis of the agreements with the Union. And for that we, the European Union, cannot in any way exempt ourselves from talking about human rights, from making Beijing look at a counterproductive shot in the foot, it is unacceptable to internally repression of human rights activists, trade unionists, Uighur, Tibetan, Christian minorities, falun gong, whatever. The credibility of the global power that is China depends, it is concerned, by its influence or by the fears it inspires, from the outset in its own region, therefore in the Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the South Seas and which is projected globally. But in to have this win relationship, as Ms Mogherini says, we have to know what our strategic interests are as the European Union, we must know how to assert our strategic autonomy. However, it was not wary when these last years of neoliberal policies led several companies and critical sectors of the European Union itself and the Member States to become controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.  Over the past ten years, China has invested more than US$318 billion in assets in Europe and today controls critical infrastructure, ports, energy networks, telecommunications, even defence and security technology companies in Greece, portugal, portugal and other Member States.

On this possibility of bilateral problem-solving agreements in Africa or African countries, those triangular agreements which you mentioned, Mrs Mogherini, I am somewhat skeptical. But, finally, we are in a world where economic and trade relations have become globalized, and this economic openness and the momentum of trade have enabled China's great economic and social development; but we too are a great exporting power, and many jobs in Europe— I always say this — depend on our ability to penetrate trade, even in Chinese space.

The Chinese are not kidding, according to the Example of Greece: the seaport of Piraeus is already in the hands of a Chinese state company.

I will do so also because I want to stress once again what I said in the beginning – my full appreciation for an excellent, very balanced report which, as I said, reflects perfectly well the state of play, the strategy and the policy we have with China, regardless of some interpretations of something I did or did not say in this Chamber.  It is obviously a complex partnership, a complex relationship, where neither of the two sides hides, or intends to hide, the differences and the disagreements – even the profound disagreements – we have. We have two completely different institutional and political systems, based on two completely different sets of priorities and values. That is clear, but it is not a mystery either for us or for the Chinese.  The point is that in the current geopolitical context of today, we are finding out more and more that on some issues that are of strategic relevance and priority for us, the European Union, autonomously determined, and for China, we have convergent views on some issues or possibly a convergence of interests that we can explore together, obviously in a very realistic way. We know very well how China approaches the rest of the world and the region. We are not shy in pointing out not only the differences, but also the problems when we see them, starting with the regional ones, from the South China Sea to others, but we also see the potential for cooperation in some other areas. Let me tell you, for instance, that the work that we do with China on Afghanistan has an added value that is real. The same goes for the work we are trying to do with North Korea. Obviously we have different viewpoints, but there is common ground and a common interest in trying to move forward a policy that is compatible. Let me stress two things that were raised here, namely our approach to two issues that are top priorities in China’s strategy and policy and where I see, finally – I think Ana Gomes was saying – an awakening on the Commission’s side and hopefully for the Member States as well.  One is the work we are doing with Africa on economic, infrastructure, energy and digital issues – on the non—traditional fields of EU-Africa cooperation. I think you will hear a bit about this from President Juncker tomorrow in the State of the Union speech. I will present, together with other colleagues in the Commission, the package we have adopted today in the College and about which President Juncker will speak tomorrow regarding our sustainable economic partnership with Africa. We are not doing it for China, but I think this response mirrors well the need we have to find potentially common ground or balancing ground when it comes to economic development in Africa. The same goes for connectivity. I do not know if I can announce this, but I think that I can. Next week we will present a communication in the Commission on connectivity between Europe and Asia, based on our European approach, where we will see very clearly the differences we have, and I mentioned some of them. One is to avoid investments playing into the hands of a few, or one, but ensure that they benefit the people and the communities of the countries concerned – this is especially important for Central Asia, but also for Europe – and that they respond to certain standards that are ours and not Chinese standards. So clearly there are differences, but there is also a convergence of interests in improving the connectivity between Asia and Europe. Coming from different points of view, we can on certain issues find common ground for work. I think this is exactly the spirit of the report, which highlights the differences – clearly, with no mystery and in a very candid manner – but also the potential areas for cooperation.

First of all, the country is the Union's second largest trading partner. There is a steady increase in trade between the two partners, but increasingly the balance of trade in goods is distorted in China's favour. However, there are many areas where cooperation could bring mutual benefits. Beijing, through its presence in Africa, Afghanistan or Pakistan, could help stabilise these areas and reduce migration to Europe. Also in the face of Washington's increasingly isolationist policies, EU-China cooperation could contribute to finding solutions to global problems, such as climate change. However, there are many areas where this cooperation is no longer so seamless. Since 2008 China has acquired assets in Europe worth more than €300 billion, which shows the scale of their presence in the Union. Since 2016, the country has been a net investor in the Union, but as many as 68% of Chinese investment in Europe has been carried out by state-owned enterprises, which are primarily guided by political guidelines.

Madam President, I would first like to thank my co-reporter Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar and the shadow rapporteurs for the good cooperation between the ECON (economic and monetary affairs) and LIBE (civil liberties, justice and home affairs) committees, which enabled us to arrive in a trilogue with a text of which I am quite happy, because it strikes a good balance between, on the one hand, , the effectiveness of national authorities' means of action and, on the other hand, the protection of citizens' privacy.  The Regulation on cash controls entering or leaving the EU helps to strengthen the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing by giving the competent authorities of the Member States, customs, the instruments they need to carry out their mission at the EU's external border. It establishes a system of control for persons entering or leaving the EU by carrying cash of EUR 10,000 or more, or equivalent to other currencies. The definition of cash obviously includes cash, but also gold or certain types of anonymous prepaid cards that are not linked to any bank account. A key role is, of course, the financial intelligence cells of the various Member States, which receive and process information from various sources and are therefore well placed to determine whether this money should be investigated further. This is why national information systems need to be interconnected and information to be made available quickly to the authorities. The European Parliament has also asked the Commission to consider whether it is appropriate to set up a financial intelligence unit at EU level. It is not a question of casting any suspicion on people who act in good faith, but it is not acceptable that within the European Union we do not have sufficient information on the sums that smuggle our borders because this information is dispersed between the Member States and the criminals rely precisely on non-cooperation between the authorities of the Member States. The regulation provides that a person with a sum of EUR 10,000 or more should make a declaration informing the recipient, the economic origin and the intended use of that money, and the competent authorities will have the opportunity to withhold the money on a temporary basis - under certain conditions, of course: when the obligation to report has not been met and when there are indications of criminal activity. This period of temporary withholding must be limited to the time required to decide whether further investigations are required, and of course a minimum amount should remain available to the bearer to enable him to support himself. In any event, the authorities are required to provide an explanation and describe the reasons for the temporary seizure. It is the Member States that set the sanctions for non-performance of the reporting obligation - they must be proportionate and effective - and the European Parliament calls on Member States to bring the sanctions applied at national level as close as possible, to prevent criminals from choosing the Member State of entry or exit in which the sanctions are the lightest. Finally, finally, I would like to mention that regular information campaigns should take place to remedy the current situation, where many people do not know that they are obliged to declare their cash beyond a certain amount.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 347, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Juan Fernando López Aguilar", "mepid": "96812", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, Commissioner Moscovici, to this late night and until certainly after midnight, this Parliament finally debates legislative acts — European legislation — after a few hours of discussing strategic relations with third countries over which we have no legislative competence, we now discuss European legislation, and not less, certainly.  Firstly, a regulation – a directly binding rule – of border cash control, which is part of the european Commission's set of initiatives to respond to the counter-terrorism security emergency that took place, in general, throughout 2016, following the horrific terrorist attacks that swept through and devastated Europe in 2015. This is indeed a regulation in which Mrs Delvaux and I have worked together as rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and I am grateful for all the cooperation over this time and also for the willingness to meet with the Council, which has not been precisely available for any legislative commitment to the European Parliament during this mandate. But here it has been possible, as in the Directive on combating money laundering through European criminal law, that we will discuss immediately afterwards.  This initiative seeks to strengthen European responsiveness in the area of money laundering, illicit cash flow and asset freezing and confiscation. It does so through a Regulation which is part of the fight against transnational economic fraud, money laundering and, in particular, the financing of terrorism. The purpose is to address a legal basis (Article 114 of the Treaty on European Functioning, in combination with Article 33), which provides for the strengthening of customs cooperation between Member States and the Commission on cash control. With a legislative precedent, 2005, a Regulation which at the time established the control of cash — cash up to an amount of EUR 10 000 — but with clear flaws that we are now correcting. First, incomplete coverage of cross-border cash movements. It is a question of completing a full statement and that criminals who send cash or resort to employment modalities know that these troops will be better and more effectively controlled from now on.  Secondly, the difficulties of exchanging information between member state authorities, because until now there has been an obligation to make available to a State financial intelligence unit, but from now on there will be an active obligation — not just the making available — to transmit that information.  Thirdly, to address the impossibility of the competent authorities temporarily retaining the cash reaching the threshold set. Fourth, the definition of cash, which includes not only the amount of liquid money, but also other high-liquidity commodities, such as gold; information can therefore also be transmitted at border entrance. Fifthly, to respond to the wide disparity in sanctions applied by the Member States, the heterogeneity of the levels of implementation. In this report we have tried to address all these elements and, in addition, we have tried to have the cash statement completed regardless of whether travellers carry the money in person or if they send it by any other means of transport, which is called unaccompanied cash, with a disclosure statement.  The authorities of the Member States should exchange all information where there are indications that this cash is related to any criminal activity which may adversely affect the financial interests of the European Union and should transmit this information to the European Commission. Customs administrations play a leading role in this front line. We have failed to establish a European financial intelligence unit, but we have a strong review clause which instructs the Commission to meet this demand from the European Parliament for the articulation of a European financial intelligence unit. And finally, the efforts of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs have also suggested that this European legislation directly binding on Member States and callable by citizens in court, is respectful of European data protection law, because we have a General Data Protection Regulation that must be consistent and should inspire , as directed by the Supervisor European Data Protection Agency, all European legislation. We put it in connection with the European criminal law file against money laundering which we will discuss immediately afterwards. We are taking a step forward and I can only welcome the exercise of parliamentary cooperation and the willingness to reach an understanding with the Council at this point.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 348, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Pierre Moscovici", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be here today to discuss a major issue, which is the fight against the financing of terrorism. The Commission's proposal to strengthen the rules on the entry and exit of cash at the borders of the European Union is one of the key features of our strategy to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and I would like to warmly thank the rapporteurs Mrs Delvaux, Mr L'Pez Aguilar for their work, their commitment, including their passion on this crucial issue. We are facing an ever-increasing inventiveness of terrorist networks, and there was an urgent need to update our rules on the control of cash movements in Europe. Indeed, terrorists and criminal organizations are now, as we know, able to circumvent existing rules, either by sending money in the mail or by using goods used as a reserve of highly liquid securities, such as gold or prepaid cards - it is an innovation - elements not covered by the current regulation which, by definition, did not incorporate certain technological advances. The Commission's proposal to be put to your vote tomorrow is to close the loopholes in the current regulation and to ensure tighter control of cash entering or leaving the European Union. We therefore proposed to amend the existing regulation, which we thought was obsolete: by strengthening the controls that apply to cash worth more than 10,000 euros, sent by mail parcel or freight; Expanding the definition of cash so that new means of transporting securities, such as prepaid cards or precious metals such as gold, can also be controlled; Creating a simplified and more robust mechanism for the exchange of information between national customs authorities and national financial intelligence cells; and finally, by allowing the competent authorities to act on amounts of less than EUR 10,000 in cash entering or leaving the EU, when there are indications that these amounts are linked to criminal activity. I would like to emphasise two aspects that underlie the architecture of this text: flexibility and cooperation. First, flexibility. Our legislation must, as far as possible, stand the test of time and be flexible enough to deal with the creativity of terrorist networks and criminals. That is why we have proposed that prepaid cards should, if necessary, be incorporated into this regulation by delegated deed. I am pleased that this aspect is present in the draft agreement between the co-legislators. Second, cooperation. Cooperation at European level, first of all. Greater cooperation between all relevant authorities is essential if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, and this regulation will provide them with the appropriate aspects and tools and strengthen their operational capabilities to detect cash movements that may be linked to organised crimes or terrorist networks. Second, global cooperation. The new regulation will also bring our rules in line with standards, on the most successful international practices in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. It is also fully in line with the recommendations of the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) and is a strong point of the proposal. I would also like to point out that this proposal is part of the Commission's broader strategy on counter-terrorism and its financing. I will say a few words about some of the initiatives taken during this mandate. As Commissioner of Customs and Taxation, I am fully committed to this fight. Firstly, in the area of customs controls, I have proposed to strengthen customs controls on the importation of the most at-risk cultural goods, which can contribute to the financing of terrorism. Tax evasion and tax evasion are also a source of financing for the terrorist networks that we have tackled, and I am delighted to be able to count on the support of this European Parliament on this issue. Since the beginning of my mandate, as you know, the fight against tax evasion has been one of my priorities, so I have called on the Member States to define the first European list of tax havens. This fight for tax transparency, I am also leading it with the European Union, I am thinking of the complete reform of the current VAT system or the strengthening of trade information between tax administrations. Tax evasion is not the preserve of tax havens, and we have evidence that it is one of the means of financing criminal and terrorist organizations. To conclude this introductory remark, I would like to emphasise the complementarity that exists between our proposal to strengthen the control of cash and the fifth directive against money laundering. This complementarity is reflected in cooperation between financial intelligence cells at EU level. By 1 June 2019, the Commission will have to assess the obstacles and also the possibility of strengthening them, including by creating a coordination and support mechanism. The revision of the regulation on the control of cash movements was highly anticipated, as you know, to allow the sources of income used by terrorist organizations to be dried up, and it is by also hitting them in the portfolio that they will be reduced. These new rules bring more transparency on financial transactions to improve the fight against money laundering throughout the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the Commission's proposal, which your rapporteurs are considering and about to vote on, provides effective solutions to the challenge of terrorism. I hope that I can count on your support in this vote, because we must all be aware, on all the benches, that this is an issue on which European citizens expect us to act, expect us to act strongly.

Even nowadays, despite the increasing use of non-cash payment methods, between 46% and 82% of all transactions worldwide are made in cash. Money laundering through their physical smuggling is linked to both organised crime and terrorism. In recent years, due to strict controls on bank payments, undeclared carried-over cash across borders has become even more important for the financing of terrorist activities. This requires tightening controls on cash entering and leaving the Union, as well as updating the rules available to the European Union since 2005. In order to respond to these developments, the customs authorities must have the appropriate powers to carry out checks while not violating the rights of ordinary travellers.

Recently, in the news, we have been given extensive attention to the drug traffic and how we can tackle it.  But what do we see?

The current rules on cash control need to be updated to address the new challenges. Recent events have shown that terrorists have managed to find ways to circumvent the current rules on cash control. In particular, public authorities have noted that criminals have resorted to sending or receiving cash via post, or in a parcel, in order to escape the obligation to make a declaration under the current rules. Moreover, French customs authorities found non-declared cash and gold worth EUR 9.2 million in postal parcels and freight packages during an investigation at Charles de Gaulle airport in 2015. National authorities have also seen that certain precious high-value commodities, such as gold, are now being used to escape the obligation to declare, since gold is not considered as cash under existing rules. I believe this new regulation will target these loopholes by imposing a simple rule. If you plan to enter or leave the EU with EUR 10 000 or more in cash, you must declare it to customs. As for cash sent by freight or post, the disclosure will have to be made. I was among those who believe that no differentiation should be made between accompanied and non-accompanied cash, and I was thus calling for a mandatory declaration for cash sent by freight or post. Unfortunately, the Commission was not convinced by this approach, nor were the other political groups. However, we all agreed to introduce this possibility in a review clause, and I hope the Commission will conduct these assessments thoroughly and update us on the outcome.

The real reason is not crime and terrorism; the real reason is fear on the part of the EU Weimar State teetering on the brink of financial catastrophe: Argentinian banks going bust, Italian banks to follow, followed by contagion across Europe – even Deutsche Bank is in trouble.

The aim of the Regulation is to adapt the system of control of cross-border cash flow, money in the European Union to the requirements related to the need to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  Cash flows are a favourite way for all kinds of criminals to convey value and action for criminal purposes, and it is very good that this initiative was taken by the European Commission and I also congratulate both rapporteurs – Mrs Delvaux and Mr Lopez Aguilar – for preparing this report. I believe that this report is needed because it fills the gaps in the current cash flow control system. Firstly, it also includes money sent by post or as goods, which has so far eerily eerily been controlled by the tax authorities. Secondly, declarations relating to the movement of those funds are mandatory. Moreover, these declarations should now be systematically transferred to the institutions responsible for financial control to the so-called financial investigation units.

The sharing of information between financial intelligence units and customs authorities has to be strengthened. The recent scandals surrounding many of the well—known European banks demonstrate how criminals have exploited weakness in the banking system to launder vast amounts of cash. Ten years after the beginning of the financial crisis, whilst we have strengthened the capital requirements of major banks, and they are supervised by the ECB, the policing of anti-money laundering rules is not covered under this system. Instead the responsibility for making sure that the banks carry out customer checks is down to national watchdogs, which leads to patchy implementation. This is the real core of the problem. So this system has to change. Tomorrow, President Juncker’s State of the Union address will announce the strengthening and enforcement of the powers of the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office in the fight against money laundering, but it is important that we have resources to back it.

I always listen to Mr. Coburn with pleasure. We rarely agree, but I respect his taste for freedom and, after all, our disagreements. But now, Mr. Coburn, tonight, no, I'm not following you. I believe that the love of freedom and what makes it possible to do business should not go against the safety of our fellow citizens when they are struck by terrorism, because that is what it is and nothing else. That is the only reason why the Commission has s heard of legislation in a context... (in response to an off-mic intervention by Mr. Coburn) Listen, you're talking to a commissioner who's also a Frenchman, and who was in bed, when, in Paris, we killed 100 people at the Bataclan. Believe me, to set up this type of operation, we need funding and that is why the fight against the financing of terrorism is a top priority that we must all share. We cannot put ideology where it has no place. I therefore fervently hope that this proposal to strengthen control of cash entering and leaving the European Union will be adopted as soon as possible. This is imperative, because the terrorist threat is still very present in Europe and it is the responsibility of all European decision-makers to give national authorities the means to fight this scourge effectively. We owe it to the 500 million European citizens who rely on us. I am convinced that this will go a long way to strengthening europe's arsenal in the fight against the financing of terrorism. As has been pointed out by some of you, the draft regulation will now allow customs authorities to obtain more data, to share it more quickly between customs authorities, as well as with financial intelligence cells, but yes, that is what this is about, and this is also electronically. I would also like to stress that the Commission will take its role to heart in the implementation phase of this proposal. As I have explained to you, this Commission has made the fight against terrorism one of its priorities and we are and will remain fully engaged with the Member States to facilitate their collective action, since we have been entrusted with many responsibilities: to adapt the computer tool for the exchange of data between authorities and to keep the Council and Parliament informed of the operation of the new provisions. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you are now all or almost all convinced of the need to adopt this proposal tomorrow in order to ensure its implementation as soon as possible. This is essential because the terrorist threat persists in Europe, because innocent people are still the victims, because we know that this threat is evolving and that it will take increasingly sophisticated forms, because we know that the current rules are outdated and no longer allow us to combat this phenomenon effectively. Finally, and I will end with this message, we must act quickly because the fight against terrorism is an area on which our fellow Europeans legitimately expect an effective and common response. We are a few months away from a European election, it is absolutely necessary to provide this proof of Europe.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, tomorrow we will vote on the result of a long work, which has lasted more than a year, on an objectively important directive that is particularly close to my heart, because it is aimed at combating a heinous crime, the social danger of which is often underestimated: money laundering. Money laundering is a global problem, which requires a strong response from the legislator if it is to be tackled effectively. Money is the element that allows criminal organisations to run their dirty business. That is why it is essential to draw up rules that affect their most valuable resource, the source of funding that feeds their criminal activities. Money laundering also has a further odious indirect effect: proceeds from illegal activities are put into the legal economy through hedging companies. In this way, the market is drugged, to the great detriment of companies that comply with the rules and are destroyed by this illegal and unfair competition.  Criminal organisations operate like large multinationals, diversifying their activities to maximise profits, and they are very good at taking advantage of legislative loopholes and ensuring impunity. For example, the proceeds of drug trafficking in Italy can be reinvested by buying restaurants in the Netherlands or Germany, which will remain on the market supported by such financing of illicit origin, regardless of their actual turnover.  For this reason, we have long worked on a text that will allow law enforcement authorities across Europe to investigate and prosecute this crime wherever it takes place. To do this, we have ensured that European legislation is brought into line with international standards in this area and we have gone further with the Warsaw Convention on Recycling. We have worked assiduously to conclude, as soon as possible, the institutional process leading up to the adoption of this directive tomorrow.  I would like to thank all my fellow Members here, the Commission and the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council for their excellent cooperation throughout the interinstitutional negotiations, which has enabled us to dismiss a truly comprehensive text and which marks an important step in the fight against organised crime at European level, offering the judicial and law enforcement authorities effective and incisive instruments. Since the beginning of our work, we have aimed to obtain a legislative text that is effective, clear and comprehensive, and that closes once and for all the meshes of the laws of the Member States exploited by criminals to escape justice, not forgetting respect for fundamental rights. The directive provides for a common definition and alignment of penalties for money laundering. We started with the Commission's excellent proposal and, together with the other shadow rapporteurs, we carried out extensive preparatory and consultation work involving the highest experts in this field, whose valuable contributions we then translated into amendments to the Commission's proposal. I would now like to say a few words about the main achievements of this directive. Thanks to our work, we have removed the main potential obstacle to investigations and ensured the punishability of money laundering. In fact, we have removed the requirement of double criminality of criminal conduct, from which the proceeds of particularly serious crimes, such as trafficking in human beings, terrorism or corruption, come from. This means that investigators in one Member State will be able to take action against money launderers without having to worry about whether or not such conduct constitutes a crime for the law of other countries that may be involved. As far as penalties are concerned, we felt it was essential not to limit ourselves to prison sentences, but we have focused on ancillary sanctions that we consider to be particularly effective and dissuasive.  (The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly) Member States will have to provide for sanctions such as a permanent ban on contracts with the public administration and access to public funding, a ban on the pursuit of a commercial activity or a ban on running for elected or public office. Those who commit such serious and dangerous crimes must stay away from the public administration. This is also our commitment in Italy, as we are already demonstrating with the decree \"spazzacorrotti\". The directive also lays down rules on the confiscation of the proceeds of this crime. On this point we would have liked to see a greater effort on the part of the other institutions to comply with Parliament's requests. My report, which was dismissed by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and home affairs, indeed, provided for much stricter and more innovative rules which, unfortunately, were firmly opposed by the other institutions involved in the negotiations. I hope that the Commission will honour the commitments it made during the trialogues and will soon present a revision of the existing directive on the freezing and confiscation of capital goods and the proceeds of crime, in order to provide for the seizure also for a non-final conviction, in the event of the limitation period or the death of the offender. This directive also includes rules on cooperation between judicial and law enforcement authorities which, as we have always said, is an essential prerequisite for ensuring the practical effectiveness of the rules. Finally, we wanted to significantly strengthen the exchange of information and the obligation to cooperate between the authorities and the Member States and, in expressing the position of the Committee on Development of which I am a member, we wanted to introduce specific rules to encourage ever more effective cooperation with third countries in the future with regard to the European Union, including developing countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 365, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me start by expressing my thanks to our rapporteur Mr Corrao and his shadow rapporteurs, as well as the Council, for this excellent outcome of the negotiations on our proposal for a directive on countering money laundering by criminal law. Mr Corrao, I do not see many of your colleagues here tonight in this Chamber at this late hour, but as you see there are two Commissioners present given the importance of this debate.  Today we are bringing all our Member States up to international standards in the money laundering fight. Money laundering, as you all know, is a serious affliction in our economies and in our societies. Never far from the news, it is a practice which undermines trust in financial institutions and entire economies.  Dirty money is unfortunately also a key security concern because laundering is instrumental to the operations of criminal, and even terrorist, groups. Terrorist organisations and organised crime need financing to maintain their criminal networks, to recruit and supply, and to commit terrorist acts themselves. Money laundering allows criminal organisations to reap fruits from illegal activities and maintain operations. Our existing criminal law framework against money laundering in the European Union suffers from gaps and loopholes. All Member States criminalise money laundering but the differences in how they do this, in the scope and sanctions for money laundering offences, affect in a negative way cross-border police and judicial cooperation. Information exchange becomes difficult and criminals slip through the cracks left by divergent national systems. Crime, of course, follows the path of least resistance and the criminals do their business where they see anti-money laundering measures to be weakest. The agreement you have reached in the trilogues will remedy these problems. Our new rules will reinforce our capacity to tackle organised crime and terrorist financing more effectively by providing police and prosecutors with the tools to crack down on money laundering. First, they will provide minimum common rules on the definition of criminal offences and sanctions relating to money laundering, including profits from all offences defined in EU criminal law.  Second, they will also provide common provisions to improve investigations of money-laundering related offences. Third, a comprehensive definition of money laundering, ranging from conversion and concealment to mere possession or use of criminal property and including self-laundering. Fourth, liability and punishment for both natural and legal persons involved in money laundering, and fifth, maximum sanctions for those convicted of money laundering of at least four years imprisonment.  This is the European Union providing added value to the Member States. My thanks once again to Mr Corrao and his shadow rapporteurs for the excellent work on this initiative.

Madam President, the fight against money laundering requires a complete and coherent legal arsenal. This directive is therefore welcome because it harmonizes at European level the definitions and criminal sanctions for money laundering offences. It also incorporates international obligations. This will facilitate judicial cooperation and strengthen our fight against financial crime. This is also the opinion of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic Affairs, which gave its opinion on this proposed directive in November 2017, an opinion adopted without any vote against it. As rapporteur, I am very pleased to see that many of our recommendations are in the final text. It was important, for example, to add tax offences to the list of underlying offences in order to also punish money laundering for tax evasion. It was also useful to add the possibility of additional sanctions, such as the prohibition of access to public procurement for a condemned company. I would like to thank all my colleagues for this important work, and I call on the Member States to apply the European anti-money laundering rules rigorously and without delay.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 367, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I am very pleased that at half past noon two Commissioners and their teams are with us and are delighted that Mr Corraro and also us, the shadow rapporteurs – I see Ana Gomes and Mrs Joly – have managed to take a very good step towards the fight against money laundering under criminal law. It has not been an easy piece of work, because the Member States have been extremely heterogeneous here. It is still not quite as far as we might have imagined, but we have made significant progress. I warmly congratulate the rapporteur on the fact that, for example, we have succeeded – which was really more than questionable before, because the Member States were very opposed – in achieving partial exceptions to the requirement of double crime. After all, we have been able to achieve exceptions in six areas. I think it is essential that, in future, we should no longer be sitting opposite prosecutors at our hearings on money laundering, who tell us that, in almost 95% of cases, money laundering does not end up in court and cannot be punished. I hope that, with this joint harmonisation, much more can happen in investigative results and in actual punishment of money launderers, especially as this is a very important component for the networks, both in the area of terrorism and in the area of organised crime.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 368, "date": "2018-09-11.json", "name": "Ana Gomes", "mepid": "28306", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, I congratulate rapporteur Corrao and the other shadow colleagues on the progress made in this negotiation under the Presidency of Bulgaria on an issue that should be a priority for European governments. This is the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. It should be, but it is not, because if some progress has undoubtedly been made, as has already been said, we have also seen Member States reject important recommendations from this Parliament, for example, on the extent of freezing and confiscation of property as products of crime, by the death of the perpetrator or suspect, or by reaching the limitation period, or on the criminalisation of negligence , or even, astonew, about aggravating circumstances for politically exposed people.  This has been shamefully rejected by the Member States.

But, more importantly, I believe that the text we agreed will complement another important directive we are working on, the Fifth Anti—Money Laundering Directive, by introducing a strong and efficient criminal law instrument to tackle money laundering.  The new rules, combined with other legislative instruments, will contribute to a cutting of the financial sources of criminals. The amount of money generated from criminal activity in the main illicit markets in the EU has been estimated at EUR 110 billion per year, corresponding to 1% of EU GDP. For criminals to benefit fully from the proceeds of their crimes, these criminal proceeds need to be laundered and the number of money laundering cases in the EU has been growing, according to Europol. In my capacity as Chair of the Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance, I can only recall here how important it is to agree on common minimal rules on the way Member States criminalise money laundering. The investigation we conducted in Parliament’s previous Committee of Inquiry on Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion clearly shows that differences in national legislation on money laundering are a major obstacle to cross-border cooperation and exchange of information.  By harmonising the definition of what constitutes a criminal offence, we facilitate the possibility for financial intelligence units to exchange information regarding criminal investigation of money laundering or terrorist financing. I believe we did it right and I am convinced that the trilogue outcome will gain overwhelming support in the House.

We look at the impact that laundering has on our security, on the financing of terrorism or on organized crime. But they're not the only risks. Often, the actors in these criminal activities are well-positioned people.  The fight against money laundering through the Penal Code is an essential tool to punish these practices and to limit their extent as well. We have no doubt that European scale is an appropriate dimension in combination with states, as long as they have political will, which unfortunately are quite often lacking.  The European Union must be put on the offensive in this area; go beyond the FATFI's own recommendations; establish mechanisms for assessing and monitoring agreed measures. To this end, it is essential to make the laws homogeneous, precisely so that these offences associated with laundering are punishable by prison sentences which are also deterrent.

And we all know what a huge phenomenon terrorism is. These are diverse dimensions that cannot be cut off by one initiative. They need to be combated systematically, and every effort must be made to suppress any groups and to create acts of terrorism. I therefore welcome the European Commission's action plan, which has a head and a stalemate and at least seeks to limit its funding and thus seeks to prevent its creation from scratch.  Most of all, However, I welcome parliament's successful in the trilogue to enforce sanctions on European funds. I welcome the operational provisions on the freezing and confiscation of the proceeds of crime.

It hasn’t quite struck midnight yet. Preventing terrorists gaining access to funding is, as has been said, a key security consideration, but more widely, the strengthened criminal response to money laundering helps counter the financial incentives that drive a whole range of serious criminal activity. It goes along with the proposal on controls on cash entering or leaving the EU that you were discussing just before this item. We very much welcome and support the new directive. We think that the rules on the definition of criminal offences and sanctions are an important step forward. We think the establishment of corporate liability for money laundering in certain circumstances and the specific sanctions are a key strengthening of our panoply of instruments for fighting this challenge. We welcome the fact that we have been able to find various compromises in discussion. I think the compromise on the issue of double criminality follows a clear logic and will make the EU more robust against money laundering. Likewise, the agreement on aggravating circumstances, proposed by this House, for example, cases concerning property of significant value or that relate to certain serious crimes, which are now going to be punished more severely. The potential risks posed by virtual currencies and politically-exposed people have been properly highlighted, and the Commission will continue to play close attention to those risks. Ultimately, the agreed text ensures that the laundering of proceeds of tax crimes will be criminalised in each Member State. Moreover, as has already been stressed, it ensures that differences in the definition of tax crimes from Member State to Member State will not be allowed to hamper cooperation between national authorities. Overall, the new directive is an important part of our comprehensive approach to tackling money laundering and terrorist financing. We will now consider the impact of the measures introduced under the 2016 Action Plan on terrorist financing and, based on the assessment, the Commission will make further proposals as necessary.
