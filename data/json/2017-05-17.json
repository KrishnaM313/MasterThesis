Our main purpose was to adopt political guidelines for the Brexit negotiations, a mandate that sets out the overall principles, objectives and process, and a mandate that the European Council will update as necessary, as the talks get under way. A key element of the guidelines is the need to conduct the talks on the basis of a ‘phased approach’. This means simply that there will be no discussion of the framework for our future relations with Britain before sufficient progress is made on ensuring an orderly withdrawal. Leaders fully supported this logic.  To ensure an orderly withdrawal, we first and foremost need to address the situation of more than four million people whose lives will be directly impacted by Brexit, on both sides. In a very real way, their futures depend on the outcome of these talks. It is our particular responsibility to secure the best guarantees for citizens – citizens of the Union – and for their families. That means guarantees that are effective, enforceable, non-discriminatory and comprehensive, accompanied by simple and smooth administrative procedures. There is a need to act quickly, and so we are ready. Now we must move from sharing objectives to actually ensuring that citizens get the necessary guarantees. That is also why I welcome the fact that the Commission has already listed a number of detailed requirements. The second priority in the first phase is the need to agree that all financial commitments undertaken by the EU of 28 will also be honoured by the UK. And thirdly, in order to protect the peace and reconciliation process described by the Good Friday Agreement, we must aim to avoid a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Only once there is sufficient progress on these priorities can we proceed to the next phase of the negotiations, about our future relations. And it will be for the European Council of 27 to assess and decide if, and when, we have achieved sufficient progress. When it comes to our future, the European Council shared the United Kingdom’s desire to establish a close partnership. It is obvious, however, that the relationship between the European Union and a non-Member State cannot offer the same benefits as EU membership. It is clear that a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK, which is what the UK has chosen, even if it is ambitious and wide-ranging, cannot mean participation in the Single Market or its parts. And at the same time, the UK must be aware that any free trade agreement will have to ensure a level playing field, and encompass safeguards against unfair competitive advantages through, inter alia, tax, social, environmental and regulatory measures and practices.  Today it is too early to tell much more about our common future, but we will make our guidelines more precise when the time comes, namely when sufficient progress in the first phase is achieved. Leaders responded with the urgency that the situation requires. There will be very little time to conclude withdrawal talks within the framework foreseen by the Treaty. Time is of the essence here, and much is at stake. Next Monday, the Council will adopt a set of negotiating directives, proposed by the chief negotiator on the basis of the guidelines we adopted on 29 April. These cover the three issues I have just mentioned, plus a number of other matters that need to be addressed in the first phase of the negotiations. Since the referendum in June last year, we – the EU27 – have been united, consistent, and demonstrated solidarity with one another. What was, and remains, most important for me, is that our conduct in these talks will show the European Union at its best: in terms of unity, political solidarity and fairness towards the United Kingdom. Finally, I can only praise the European Parliament and its leaders for the role they have played. Sincere thanks and appreciation for your constructive assistance. This bodes well, not only for the future of the negotiations, but our future as a Union of 27.

I will start in English by congratulating President Tusk on last month’s European Council. I have attended more summits than I care to remember and never have I seen agreement reached so quickly. I can assure you that this does not happen by accident. It is in fact testimony to the work of all Member States and all EU institutions, the work they have done together since last June. Michel Barnier and his team have been up and running across Europe to make sure every voice is heard. I would like to pay tribute to him. I won’t wish him luck for the negotiations, as I know he will leave nothing to chance. This is exactly the same approach that President Tusk and I have always taken. The Council Conclusions from April and the draft negotiation mandate proposed by the Commission earlier this month speak for themselves. I am confident that the draft mandate will be adopted by the Council next Monday, 22 May. The process shows how united and prepared the European Union will be. It underlines how deep our commitment to transparency already is. This is why I see no need this morning to go into any more detail on the negotiations. Michel will do this later on this morning. This negotiation is now in the hands of our capable divorce lawyers. Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to stress that on the sidelines of this European Council, we have been able to conclude three important agreements which confirm that it is often in the margins that the best pages are written. The first agreement between Denmark and Europol is particularly important for the security of citizens, as it will allow a sufficient level of cooperation to be pursued, in particular on the exchange of operational data. The second agreement concerns Portugal and Spain on the issue of the temporary deposit of nuclear waste at Almaraz and, finally, the third agreement with Slovenia and Croatia makes it possible to find operational and field solutions to better manage border controls and the application of Schengen rules between these two countries. In each of these negotiations, the Commission has built bridges between sometimes distant positions by encouraging the continuation of the discussions until they bear fruit. Without the Commission, these three agreements would not have seen the light of day. It is often said that the Commission should take care of its own problems and that it should not take care of the problems of others, but if it does not take care of the problems of others, they remain whole. In this, these three agreements say much more than long speeches. Europe is this constant effort to build bridges, seek agreements or find compromise solutions. This is also the task that the Commission has declared itself ready to take on and will continue to apply. I would like to thank this Parliament very much for the constant support it gives us in this mission. Herr President, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Diese Einigkeit, die wir beim Europäischen Rat unter Beweis gestellt haben, wird während der gesamten Brexit-Verhandlungen unser Leitprinzip sein. Dies ist im Interesse der Bürger und der Bürgerinnen, so wie es auch in ihrem Interesse ist, dass wir uns nicht auf die Brexit-Fragen exklusiv konzentrieren, probe unser Programm umsetzen. Das werden wir auch mit Hilfe des Parlaments tun. In der ersten Hälfte des Mandats der Kommission haben wir, die Kommission zusammen mit Ihrem Parlament, viel erreicht - viel erreicht auch dadurch, dass wir stets an einem Strang gezogen haben. So haben wir nicht nur den Investitionsplan in kürzester Zeit zum Erfolg werden lassen. Schon jetzt hat er Investitionen in Höhe von 183 Milliarden in 28 Mitgliedstaaten mobilisiert. Wir haben auch die Europäische Grenz- und Küstenwache eingerichtet, mit der wir unsere gemeinsamen Grenzen auch gemeinsam besser schützen können. Gleichzeitig haben wir mit dem Handelsabkommen mit Kanada einen großen Schritt nach vorne gemacht. Dieses Abkommen sichert Arbeitsplätze und stellt klar, dass europäische Normen und Standards international Geltung erhalten. Das sind nur drei Beispiele, um Ihnen in Erinnerung zu rufen, dass wir mit vereinten Kräften vieles gemeinsam schaffen können. Diese Einigkeit im Denken und im Handeln wird auch in der zweiten Hälfte der Amtszeit dieser Kommission an den Tag zu legen sein, beispielsweise im Zusammenhang mit der Errichtung eines wirklichen digitalen Binnenmarkts. Wir haben dazu bereits alle 35 angekündigten Vorschläge auf den Tisch gelegt. Einige davon müssen allantdings noch in trockene Tücher gebracht werden. Dazu brauchen wir die aktive Mitarbeit des Parlaments. Wir müssen die zweite Halbzeit dieser Kommission, die ja auch die zweite Halbzeit Ihres Mandates ist, dazu nützen, Ergebnisse zu liefern, damit die Menschen wieder spüren, dass Europa ihnen etwas bringt. Daran werden wir uns bei der nächsten Europawahl messen lassen müssen.

First of all, congratulations on taking one of the quickest decisions in the European Council on such an important issue! One can only congratulate them. I would like to do this primarily in the direction of Donald Tusk, but also of course in the direction of Michel Barnier, who was commissioned by Jean-Claude Juncker to take on this task. The preparatory work was excellent, the matter is in good hands with Michael Barnier. The preparation in Parliament - Guy Verhofstadt and Antonio Tajani - our preparatory work was valuable for the process. We are united, we are united, we can be proud of the fact that the European Union, the 27, stand together. We have made a clear statement about how we envision the method of first talking about the exit, then about the new relationships. We have given the cherry-picking, which some in London still imagine, a clear rejection. Anyone who leaves the European Union can no longer take advantage of this Union. And we have formulated a clear expectation, namely that over 78% of Europe's citizens expect the Brexit negotiations to first talk about EU 27 interests before we talk about other issues. That gives clear backing for this mandate, which has now been decided. Therefore positive. We in the EPP Group are pleased about that. One thing is still important to me, namely to describe that the family sticks together. We were with the group in Ireland last week to signal to the Irish citizens, in view of the conflict over the question of how the border will be shaped in the future, that they cannot stand alone, that they can build on solidarity in a network of 27. It is an important reassurance for the people there that they are anchored in the family. I would like to But today, because we are agreed on Brexit, above all take a look at the political situation in Europe. And I would like to remind you that a few months ago - at the beginning of the year - all the right-wing members met in Koblenz, the nationalists, the anti-Europeans and Marine Le Pen, for example, announced that 2017 would be the end of a world and the birth of a new world will be. So she announced it there. She's not even there today. I don't know what she's doing, but she's not here today. I want to look at it again. What actually happened in 2017 since we had these noble announcements from the anti-Europeans? I hold that Farage's party - UKIP - is leaderless, has no chance, is politically dead in Great Britain. I experience that Nigel Farage is cowardly because he does not run for the British House of Commons at all, does not care about responsibility, does not want to take any responsibility at all. I see that his policies are causing borders to be drawn up again, namely in Northern Ireland and Ireland. I think he still tries a lot to talk to his friend Donald Trump on the phone. I don't know if the talks are still going on because Donald Trump is doing a lot more other things than worrying about Nigel Farage now, but obviously Nigel Farage's approach has failed across the board. The history books will say that he wreaked havoc on his homeland with his way of doing politics. Then to the other participants in Koblenz: Wilders remained far below his expectations in the Netherlands, the AfD in Germany does not know how to deal with the neo-Nazis in its own ranks and cannot find a clear line of demarcation. And then of course France: Le Pen failed, historically it had the second worst result in all runoff elections in France retracted. Le Pen refuses the rule of law, hides here in the European Parliament from the French judiciary. Le Pen can no longer get her own family involved in politics, and 56% of French say they are afraid of the politics Le Pen makes. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what is left of this populist approach that we saw there. Populism has failed, and 2017 is an opportunity for us to make a new start for the European Union. A good balance so far for Europe! 2017 is a key year, yes! That is why the first meeting that we have now experienced on Monday between the newly elected President of France and the German Chancellor, because the Franco-German partnership is so important, is a positive sign, a sign of departure, a sign of hope. I would like to thank that we all agree that for the next two years we will not focus on Brexi, but on the future of Europe. Last but not least, I would like to say: when we see this momentum that we now have for 2017, the most important thing is that we finally talk positively about our European Union again, talk about what we are achieving. Let's look at the world situation: We are now debating in America whether the Paris Agreement will be terminated. It was we Europeans who put climate protection on the world agenda. Last year, thanks to the work of the Commission, we had more economic growth in this European Union than the Americans. All over Europe we have the principle that we have health insurance, we take care of everyone who is sick. And in America, Obama Care is being phased out and 24 million people are losing direct access to health insurance. And we have shown in Iran that we have big questions, namely the question of nuclear weapons, too Can solve diplomacy.I think that we Europeans shouldn't just talk about our crises from time to time, we should talk about our successes.That is what convinces people best of Europe.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Roberto Gualtieri", "mepid": "96892", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapid adoption of the guidelines for the UK withdrawal negotiation is a very important achievement, a sign of unity to which this Parliament is proud to have contributed with its resolution and significant involvement in the work. which led to the drafting of the final text. Anyone who thought we would split up made their accounts wrong. The European Union now has a clear, balanced and fair line towards Brexit and an excellent negotiator that we strongly support. We want a fair deal, which protects the interests of citizens, respects the principles and obligations arising from our treaties and allows us to have the UK as our close partner in the future, even if of course a non-member will not be able to. never have the same benefits as a Member State. To obtain these results it is essential to make the best use of the little time we have available and therefore the negotiating sequence indicated in the guidelines is essential. First of all, ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom, making substantial and sufficient progress on some fundamental issues as soon as possible. We know them well: citizens, financial settlement, safeguarding the peace process in Ireland. On citizens, which is priority number one, we appreciate the very clear words of the guidelines and the proposed directive. We are talking about all British and European citizens who live and have lived, who work and have worked in the UK or in the Union. We are talking about a set of interconnected rights, which also concern social security, the freedom of movement of workers, the recognition of professional qualifications. We are talking about rights that must be guaranteed forever to those who are entitled to them, with full reciprocity, without discrimination and under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. European. Our Parliament is determined and no discussion on future relations with the UK can begin, no agreement can be approved if these conditions are not respected. And we are convinced and confident that whichever government emerges from the elections, on the basis of these principles, constructive and efficient negotiations can begin, allowing us to give certainty to European citizens and businesses and to define a positive framework for future relations between the Union European Union and the United Kingdom. The European Parliament and our group are ready to actively contribute to this result and also, above all, to seize the great opportunity we have to work together for a revitalization of the Union. We are not satisfied, we are proud of the state of the European Union but we are not satisfied, we want the Commission and the Member States to be courageous and make significant progress on the path that this Parliament has helped to identify.

The Brexit negotiations cannot be marked by a spirit of retaliation and punishment against the UK and its citizens, who are preparing to leave the European Union but not to leave Europe. Whatever the views in this House, we need to be clear and unanimous on one point. It is in the interest of both sides to come to a fair and win-win agreement. Our citizens must be our priority, it is on their rights that we must reach an agreement as soon as possible and then examine fundamental issues such as trade agreements, because it is not simply the regulation of a relationship between the European Union at stake and a future third country, but there is much more. At stake are issues that directly affect jobs, lives, families, the safety of people in an era marked by diverse and lasting terrorist threats. This we must always keep in mind. It will not be an anger-driven Brexit that benefits both sides. Brexit is not a punishment, it should be based on the creation of a relationship with the United Kingdom that allows us to re-evaluate the functioning of the European Union, which allows us to understand why British citizens felt they were better off outside the European Union than inside. Despite the election results, and I also want to say this for the things I heard this morning, which may have made many in this House breathe a sigh of relief, let us ask ourselves why millions of British citizens first, Dutch and French then, but not only that, they felt the need to vote for parties or instances so strongly anti-Europeans. This is the question we should ask ourselves in this House. It is therefore time to look in the mirror, let's not make the mistake of telling ourselves that people want us to continue on this path, to continue in this way, people want a change of direction and concrete answers. So the theme is to take the opportunity of the negotiations that will take place between London and Brussels to discuss ourselves, the fate of the European Union, and to do this, as a group of conservatives and reformists, we have long supported the need to review the treaties, that is, to establish new rules of the game to make this Union more open and flexible. Now we read that the French President Macron and the German Chancellor Merkel want to change the treaties, but that is not enough, it is necessary to say in which direction the treaties must be changed. If the direction is \"less Europe, more flexibility, more fiscal competition, more respect for national parliaments\", then the direction is right. If, on the other hand, the direction were once again, as we unfortunately fear, that of \"more Europe regardless, more rigidity, more fiscal homogeneity, more centralist impositions than Brussels\" would be the worsening of the existing. Let's put aside feelings of rejection and self-preservation and see how we can really change, how we can get out of Brexit stronger and more efficient and with renewed confidence, especially on the part of our citizens. This is the work and commitment that we as a group of conservatives and reformists will carry out.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I think on Brexit everything has been set: we have a mandate and the European Union, the 27 other Member States and the three institutions have a unified position. Everything is also going well with the negotiation directives that will be approved on Monday. So I think there is only one thing to do now: to start the negotiations, and to start them as fast as possible. Yes, we have to wait for the outcome of the British election, but after 8 June let’s start.  I want to talk about something that is related to Brexit, and that is the future of the European Union and the reform of the European Union, because it would be a mistake to put all our energy only into Brexit in the coming years. At least the same energy, if not more energy, has to be put into the reform and the future of the European Union. Three times in a row now, the nationalists and the populists have been beaten – in Austria, in the Netherlands and in France – and I don’t think that happened by accident. I think that Brexit played an important role in this. People all over Europe have been shocked by the decision of Great Britain to leave the European Union. Don’t misunderstand me; people are today very critical towards the European Union – and for good reason – but what they don’t want to do is what Britain did: to leave the European Union. It’s very clear that the Austrians didn’t want an Auxit, the Dutch didn’t want a Nexit and the French didn’t want a Frexit. They say: reform the European Union, yes; leave the European Union, no bloody way. That is the message of the people of the European Union today.  But there is one mistake we cannot make, and that is to think ‘oh, it’s over; populism and nationalism have been defeated’ – and I have heard this reaction all too often in European circles – ‘Macron won, Le Pen lost, relief, let’s go to the normal agenda and let’s do business as usual’. Well, I think that is the one mistake that we cannot make. People voted for Macron for change and not for the status quo; not for a standstill. They voted for a radical change in France, but also in Europe, and so the best thing to do is in fact to back his reformist agenda – a reformist agenda that we all know now. A reformist agenda with the new European budget, minister of finance for Europe, European treasury, European investment bonds and the transnational lists that he is proposing.  I have to tell you, Manfred, that I was relieved to hear on Monday the positive reaction in Berlin: a reaction a little bit different from the ‘nein, nein, nein’ of Mr Schäuble and of a lot of German press since the arrival of Mr Macron. I like more Merkel’s ‘Wir schaffen das’, as she repeated at the press conference with Macron. So I think it is really time now to use this Brexit negotiation for a new vision, Mr Tusk, and for a new future for Europe. It is, in fact, a future that our young people want: look at what is happening – Pulse of Europe in more than 100 cities all over Europe, in the squares, young people are coming together and asking for more, and a democratic, European Union.

I would like to share this hope and this euphoria that it is enough to be more courageous when it comes to rescuing the European Union, and there is no doubt that we are still faced with this question. The perspective of many people on the consequences of Brexit is important. It is also important that conclusions are drawn from this, also on the part of the citizens themselves, that they say: We have to get involved. We have to show ourselves which EU we stand for. We cannot just leave it to the institutions, the governments. It is our EU, it is our living space, our future, and we have to fight for it. I would ask that we use the entire debate on Brexit, including the negotiations on Brexit, to also realize that it would be too easy to stand up after the elections in France and the Netherlands and to say: Authoritarian populism has failed. It didn't fail! We still have to see what a high proportion of people are willing to choose this form of authoritarian national populism. And here we can only counter something by saying: This European Union has a value in itself, but we have to constantly renew it. There is no social system that has a claim to eternity. If we do not protect it, if we do not stand up for it, if we do not renew it and if we do not repeatedly take up the questions that concern many people, then we will fail. Incidentally, Brexit also reveals the points at which we can definitely start positively. Who of the many people who have made decisions knows - that goes as far as the trade unions - that we have a social security system that we have to expand, not to cut back. When we talk about the Freedom of movement is important, then it must not only apply to posted workers. Then in future it must also apply to everyone who lives in the European Union, and we must not begin to want to secure the social systems only for the citizens of our own nation, to want to isolate them. We will only achieve a change in the European Union as a possible social union by opening up the national social systems - then we will also come to a common European pillar. I would also like to give this to those who are now placing the European pillar in the foreground, because what we are seeing there can only be the very first approaches, it does not go far enough at all, because ultimately the counter-movements are already emerging Member States are coming. If, for example, the CSU declares that it does not agree with parental part-time work, that it would like to block it in the Federal Council, then I consider that to be a huge problem. How do we want to solve this if z. For example, the reaction in Germany to the offer to Great Britain even before Brexit was that we in Germany are also thinking about how we can reduce the claims of employees in our country to child benefit and already have the corresponding plans in the drawer. We have to rely on precisely these points. Let us develop it together into a solidary, social EU in which the question of sustainable economic development must of course also be in the foreground, but not against the people, but with them.

We are particularly pleased that the preservation of citizens' rights, endangered by Brexit, has been put at the top of the list of priorities. But what does Brexit tell us? Did we learn a real lesson from this? I hear people reassure themselves that we have avoided the worst in Austria, the Netherlands and France, but I would like us to avoid any triumphalism. National populist forces are now reaching considerable electoral levels. When we add that to abstentions and invalid votes, we can see to what extent the confidence of our fellow citizens in their institutions and in their political representatives is shaken. The cause, besides a feeling of loss of identity, downgrading or fear of downgrading. Even quite recently, the International Monetary Fund confirmed to us that globalization and especially technological change are the main causes of the loss of the share of labor income in wealth, a wealth which is increasingly unequally shared. In the face of this, a shy realization seems to be emerging, even in Davos, even in the WTO and even in the Commission. We are beginning to understand that our economic system leaves many fellow citizens by the wayside. But do you seriously think that, for technological change and globalization to work for the benefit of all, it is enough to give each and everyone a training that makes them employable and that then it suffices to \"activate\" the workers without employment, that is to say to put them under pressure, this same pressure which pushes them more and more to vote for the parties which surf on anger and stir up fears? Rather, we think that in a world where increasing inequalities seem to be inevitable, where machine work increasingly replaces human work - an MIT study shows us that each installed robot eliminates seven human jobs - and where technological platforms \"à la Uber\" are increasingly precarious work, we must completely rethink both the organization of work and our taxation and ensure robust social protection for all, and not just - if you will allow me - shareholders. Likewise, rather than a race to the bottom under corporate pressure, globalization must aim to increase, level up social, environmental and democratic standards. It is under these conditions that we will show that we have learned the lessons of Brexit. It is on this condition that we will not content ourselves with containing, but that we will stem the dangerous tide of withdrawal into oneself, because then our fellow citizens will regain confidence, certain that their interests are defended. It is then that, armed with this regained legitimacy, we will be able to proceed with a deeper integration of the European Union, which is the only way for us - I mean the only one - to take our destiny back in hand.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Nigel Farage", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, imagine you invited a very important guest round for dinner, you had made all the preparations, there were some very important confidential conversations that needed to be had and you thought everything had gone well, and yet within hours your guest had told the outside world that you, the host, were deluded – that you were living in a different galaxy. And then all the contents of the conversation were blabbed to an opposition newspaper, and to add insult to injury, you say the food was actually not very good either.

The state of emergency has been in force in France since November 14, 2015. The UK has reached the right conclusion and has left. And the EU should too. Let the EU disband itself. The biggest issue of the British is mass immigration and the closing of national borders. When will that happen in the EU? When will the NGOs that are doing good business with people smugglers in Libya be prosecuted? When will the economic migrants be dragged hard back to the Libyan coast?

On first glance it appears reasonable but, like everything the EU says, on closer inspection you can see the malevolent intent of an EU that tempers no opposition to its control. Like a playground bully, it says no Member State can talk to the UK separately, like an emperor it grants Spain a veto over Gibraltar, and like a jilted spouse it says the UK cannot go out and get a new trade partner until the divorce is finalised, or else. But for those in this Chamber who want to bully us, threaten us or demean us, may I remind you of the English poem by Rudyard Kipling about a Norman king warning his son about taking advantage of the English: ‘The Saxon is not like us Normans. His manners are not so polite. But he never means anything serious till he talks about justice and right. When he stands like an ox in the furrow – with his sullen eyes set on your own, And grumbles, “This isn’t fair dealing,” my son, leave the Saxon alone.’ So when a French President says Brexit is a crime, we will say: we will not be imprisoned by your rudeness. When a Maltese President says the UK deal must be an inferior deal, we will say: no deal is better than a bad deal. When a German President says that without the EU, Britain cannot have its voice heard in the world, we will say: listen to the sounds of a free Britain, an independent Britain, an outwardly looking Britain, trading, growing and expanding in the world, looking forward and not backwards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Herbert Reul (PPE).", "mepid": "28225", "text": "- Mr President, Mr Presidents, my dear colleagues! The assessment of Brexit is clear. The point now is to deal with it properly and properly, above all effectively. I think the way it's been going so far can also become a model for how we work together. Barnier and the troop prepared it thoroughly. Parliament, Council and Commission have looked for common ground and found common ground. Thoroughly prepared, been concrete, worked practically, formulated common ground and then in the end also strong in the negotiations. If we did the same with other topics, we would give people what they are looking for. You are not looking for a new dream or any new concept or any reforms. I don't think so, they are looking for the result. They are looking for successful European politics, they want to see that the worries they have are resolved by us and dealt with as far as we can. Besides, we cannot solve everything; part of the responsibility also rests with the Member States. But the prerequisite for this is that the European institutions and above all the Member States work together and find common solutions. The answer that can now be derived from Brexit and from what the people who take to the streets and think Europe is great again is: We have to make new plans. Or as my colleague has just said: organizing even more regulation is totally wrong. We have to deliver very specific results. We have to prove that European politics serves the prosperity, the well-being of the people in Europe, that it makes sense to go this way. The Brexit negotiations as they begin now are a very, very good contribution to this. That is sober, that is pragmatic, that is not pretentious, there is hardly any dream dances on the way, there is also no insulting British on the move.In this sense: it can become a model or model for the way in which we will work together in the future.Thank you for the kind interruption, Madam President.The previous speakers were able to talk for hours longer.Maybe we do the same with the upper class as we do with the others.(The speaker agreed to answer a question on the blue card procedure under Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure.)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Luke Ming Flanagan (GUE/NGL)", "mepid": "124985", "text": "  blue-card question. – We are often warned that maybe the interpreters have got it incorrect, but I don’t know if they got it correct when you used the word ‘troops’.

My first words will be to thank your Parliament, its President, but also Guy Verhofstadt, later, for your numerous expressions of confidence in the mission entrusted to me and for the spirit of cooperation that reigns. from the start between us. And I would like - as I have just done for Parliament - to say a personal word of thanks to President Tusk, to his cabinet and to the General Secretariat of the Council because, from the start - it is no accident that we are so quickly reached an agreement in the European Council - patient, tenacious and sincere work of cooperation is being carried out between us. Here's how we're going to build that unity along the way. President Juncker, who was the first to trust me, then recommended that the European Council, through negotiating directives, adopt in detail the guidelines and modalities of this negotiation. On May 22, in a few days, the General Affairs Council will have to confirm this negotiating directive. President Tusk has made it clear how we are going to undertake this negotiation in stages and in sequences, under the authority of the European Council. And he made it clear that we must first find an agreement on the principles of the three big topics, ladies and gentlemen, on which the sovereign decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union today creates a very big uncertainty. We must remove this uncertainty as quickly as possible for the citizens first, for the beneficiaries of the European budget and for the borders, in particular in Ireland. Frankly, this sequencing is not done to create problems or to punish the UK in any way. This sequencing is done to organize and solve problems, as it is written in the treatise: \"to organize the withdrawal ordered taking into account the future relationship ”. The orderly withdrawal is precisely these three major subjects and a few others, such as the governance of the agreement or administrative and judicial proceedings. Ladies and gentlemen deputies - I tell you as a negotiator - this sequencing has another interest: to create the bases of confidence. We need to build from the start, solving these problems for citizens, for beneficiaries of structural funds and for borders, the foundations of lasting trust which we need to build the future relationship with the UK. This is the condition and I repeat to you that our objective is to reach an agreement. The options of no deal or a bad deal are not mine. We want to achieve an agreement with the UK, not against it. Moreover, I would appreciate it if the British side would get into the spirit of reaching an agreement with the European Union and not against the European Union. We will begin this negotiation as soon as possible, the day after the election Theresa May called on June 8. The fact that the elections take place just before the start of negotiations clearly gives our British partners the stability and visibility that we also need. This is, I believe, one of the elements of the success of this negotiation. The trust that I mentioned and that you all recalled has a counterpart on our side, it is that we will practice with you, with the other institutions, with the Council, transparency and be permanently available for involve the institutions and your Parliament throughout the round of negotiations. This is how I will be at your disposal, that is to say at the disposal of the entire team that you have appointed with Guy Verhofstadt and yourself, Mr President, to discuss before and after each of the negotiating sessions and, in the same way, the whole task force team that I was able to put together thanks to the daily confidence of President Juncker and all the Commission services will also be at your disposal. Likewise, we are ready for very high transparency on all negotiating documents, which will be made public. I would like to telegraphically respond to several of the questions that have been raised by all of them. On citizens' rights, Mr Weber, Ms Grapini, Ms Gardini and even Mr Fitto - who is not here - spoke of a fair and balanced agreement. At the start of this negotiation, we have an ambitious position set by the European Council, which is fully legitimate, since we demand that European citizens and British citizens affected by Brexit can continue to enjoy the same rights. This will apply to citizens, to their families, and it will be all rights: right of residence, freedom of movement, right of access to social security, right of access to the labor market. We are talking about the rights that will be acquired until Brexit day, of course, and we will also ensure that these rights are effectively guaranteed. We will not be able, on this very serious subject, which affects the daily and personal life of many families, to be satisfied with a simple declaration of intention. On the financial regulations - and I'm glad Mr Farage is here because he quoted me - I have never quoted, Mr Farage, any figures as far as I am concerned. Because these figures will depend on the methodology on which we have to agree and they will also depend on the effective date of the UK exit. It’s not Mr Barnier who is going to set a figure. We will work, as the European Council wishes, to find with the British, serenely, calmly, an agreement on the commitments that have been made. There is no penalty, there is no exit bill. We have made, particularly in this period of the current financial perspective, financial commitments together, at 28. We assume them financially together, at 28, and we benefit together, at 28, for all regions of the Union European, for universities, laboratories, students, farmers. It is a question of settling accounts as one does in any separation, no more, no less, and I will do it without emotion, without spirit of revenge, without punishment, by sticking to facts, figures and commitments. that were taken, no more, no less. On Ireland, where I had the privilege of visiting last week and being received by both Houses of Parliament together - Mr Kelly and Mr Nicholson spoke of this visit which touched me a lot and which was very useful - it is a unique situation which calls for unique solutions, which must not call into question the integrity of the internal market. We will do everything to find a solution which clearly and fully preserves the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions, which I recall - but Mrs Anderson or Mr Brok raised this issue - that the United Kingdom is co- guarantor. I just want to say a word about the transitional periods that Mr Caputo mentioned. We may be working on transitional periods after Brexit, after the UK departure, namely phase-out and phase-in periods for the future relationship. But the real transition period is now, before withdrawal, between now and the day of withdrawal. And I recommend all economic players, in particular, to use this period well so that the withdrawal, on the day it will occur - probably in March 2019 -, is as orderly as possible. But I would also like to say clearly to Mr. van Dalen, who mentioned earlier some specific questions such as those of fishermen - whom I know well from having been Minister of Fisheries in my own country -, to Mrs. James or to Mr. Vilimsky, something that everyone should understand: it was the United Kingdom that decided to leave the European Union and not the other way around. And many of us regretted this decision, but now we have to implement it. This decision has consequences and those who would say or who say that everything can continue as before are not telling the truth. We are going to have to unravel - because this is the UK's decision - forty-four years of integration, of economic, financial, technical, legal, human, social relations. Forty-four years! No one should underestimate either the consequences in all areas, or the legal complexity of this separation. I really recommend this if we want to tell the truth to citizens, and it is our duty to explain it to them. I also recommend calmly, pedagogically, democratically, that we explain what Brexit means - as I did in my speech, Mr Nicholson, last week in Dublin - what it means to be a member of the Union ”and what“ no longer being a member of the Union ”means for the daily life of citizens, consumers and businesses. We must tell the truth to citizens. And I also recommend that we take the time to explain to those who talk about no agreement what it means - I mean in the conditional - that there is no agreement at all. I recommend that we take the time to explain this to citizens, and not just to the UK. Ladies and gentlemen, we will work, as the Council wishes, in stages, to build a new partnership, a new relationship with the United Kingdom. Ashley Fox earlier raised this issue with great wisdom. This relationship - he is not too early to sketch the outline - will include a free trade agreement, free and fair trade, cooperation agreements, particularly in terms of universities or research, and a partnership, as we wish, in security and defense. There are two important points for this future relationship. We will never accept that a free trade agreement leads to unfair competition or to the lowering of our social standards. This is a point that the chairperson, Ms. Zimmer raised, but also Ms. Rodrigues, Mr. Sylikiotis and Mr. Kofod. We will not agree to lowering social, fiscal or environmental standards in the European Union, nor will we want to agree to haggle over security on trade issues. Richard Corbett talked about the complexity, especially of agencies, but I won't come back to that. I would just like to conclude with a more political word as we prepare to begin this negotiation which has not yet started - and the clock is ticking, time is running out to get to a good deal. I would like to come back to the point that Mr Niedermüller, Mr González Pons, and Mr Lamberts alluded to earlier. There are the consequences of Brexit - and I will have, on your behalf, to deal with most of those consequences in this negotiation - and there are the lessons of Brexit, which are different. I think that, in this regard, we have to listen to a number of reasons which have been expressed by British citizens, as indeed in other countries expressed in protest votes a feeling of incomprehension, of anger , social suffering and the feeling of being excluded from progress. I think, ladies and gentlemen, and I say it like the politician that I always am, that we should not confuse populism with popular sentiment. And I believe we all have an interest in listening to popular sentiment in this matter, as one of the lessons of Brexit. Finally, I would like to say to Mr. Gualtieri and Mr. Weber, who spoke about unity, that this unity that we have built together, under the authority of President Tusk and with the confidence of President Juncker and that of President Tajani, is important to me as a negotiator - because I need it - and that I will be careful to ensure that it is maintained, nurtured, cultivated, throughout the process. This unit must be able to be used - if I may say so - by heads of state or government, by institutions to do other things, because Brexit is not the whole radar screen of Europe. There are so many challenges to take up, such as those mentioned, in particular by Mr. Lamassoure, on defense, security, border management, the single market or even the euro zone. So I wanted to say as a negotiator - it is very important that everyone understands this - that we need this unity that we have built on negotiation. This unity is going to be useful for the rest of the European agenda and you and EU leaders, mobilized on a positive and proactive agenda on the other challenges, will strengthen the unity which I also need in the negotiation. This is an interactive unit that we need and that is why I really thank you for your trust, ladies and gentlemen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Donald Tusk", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for their words of support in today’s debate.

Good examples of savings are the many benefits offered by the EU, which the Member States cannot even dream of. The EU levies a very low tax on its tens of thousands of workers, often less than half of what Member States levy. In addition, EU child benefits and housing benefits are paid. Also, various transitional allowances, amounting to hundreds of thousands of euros, when, for example, a European Investment Bank resigns to a lower-paid job after a couple of years of work, are unreasonable. Completely additional costs are also caused by the two seats and, of course, the ever-increasing number of agencies and their staff. The EU needs to be more precise in its spending.

This is the sixth time that Italy has taken over the rotating G7 Presidency, and every time it has hosted leaders in some of the finest cities Italy and Europe have to offer. Venice, Naples, Genoa, L’Aquila and Taormina will be no exception. This year’s leaders’ meeting will have a new and different feel to it. There will be new and fresh faces around the table and together they will tackle some new and not-so-new questions, many of which go to the very heart of the debate on harnessing and shaping globalisation which we had yesterday in this House.  The EU’s position, going into the G7, is very clear. For us, working together with our biggest partners around the world in a rules-based system is a necessity. We believe in open societies and multilateral solutions, we believe in free and fair rules-based trade, and we see the benefits that it brings. Around one-third of our national income comes from trade with the rest of the world. For the EU, global trade has boosted EU economic growth, with every EUR 1 billion of additional exports supporting 14 000 jobs.  Cheaper imports benefit poorer households first and foremost, but it is not just about economics. The wider need to work together on issues which affect the whole world has become more acute, even since the G7 last met in Japan in 2016. Whether it be fighting climate change, tax evasion or international terrorism, whether it be promoting trade links, sustainable development or global economic growth, the questions of today are global in their very nature.  The G7 Summit will be a crucial moment to deepen our cooperation in all of these areas, but we cannot ignore some of the drawbacks of a more interconnected world. We need to tackle them head-on, because many people around Europe and in other parts of the world are concerned. They worry about high levels of inequality, job losses, and factory closures. They see identities, traditions and ways of living changing in front of their eyes. We have to respond to those concerns.  That was the thinking behind the ideas presented in our reflection paper on harnessing globalisation. We are not naïve free-traders; we believe in open competition based on level playing fields and that is why, when we had to,  we have shown our teeth with anti-dumping measures in response to market distortions or unfair practices. We will not hesitate to do so again and, in order to better equip ourselves, we will need to accelerate our efforts to equip the Union with modernised tools to tackle unfair trade. But Europe must also make the positive case for its place in a global world. When others step back from free trade, the European Union must step forward. Partners such as Japan, Mexico, Mercosur and India are willing to do likewise.  Take for example the ambitious EU-Japan deal that we are negotiating. This free trade agreement would send a powerful signal to the rest of the world that two of the largest economies are resisting protectionism, and that openness to trade and investment remains one of the best tools to harness and shape globalisation and create more economic growth and jobs. EU exporters to Japan still have to pay close to EUR 1 billion annually on customs tariffs and the vast majority of these tariffs would be removed with a trade agreement. EU exports to Japan could increase by more than a third. At the same time, more than 600 000 jobs in the EU are linked to exports to Japan, with Japanese companies alone employing more than half a million people.  These are compelling reasons why we aim to reach an agreement as soon as possible and, in any case before the end of the year. Together we must make sure that the rules of the game best serve and protect our citizens and our societies. That is the message the European Union must bring to Taormina and to our partners from across the world. That is what the European Union will fight for at every level.

I would like to thank you for the opportunity to intervene on the subject of the preparation of the G7 Summit which will take place in Italy next week. The G7 leaders, as well as Presidents Tusk and Juncker, who will represent the European Union, will be faced with difficult discussions on various topics of global importance. The international political environment is currently particularly charged, and the truth is that global cooperation can no longer be taken for granted. I refer in particular to the political transition in the United States, which seems to present us with challenges even with respect to basic policy principles which were, until recently, well rooted in the G7. I believe that the mission of European leaders is clear. The aim is to secure the G7’s commitment to keep the global economy open and keep multicultural multilateral cooperation on track. It is also crucial to give a clear signal that securing balanced and inclusive growth remains a top priority. Even if the global economy is showing positive momentum, political uncertainty surrounding the outlook is still very high. Against this background, I believe that the G7 should, in particular, confirm its determination to work together through strong, multilateral institutions, confirm the agreement to use all policy tools, fiscal monetary and structural, to strengthen the recovery and foster inclusiveness, and also to better share the benefits of growth and globalisation. But allow me to expand on a selection of issues of particular relevance to us. I will refer, in turn, to trade, climate, migration and foreign policy matters.  On trade, it should be the European Union’s priority to confirm the G7’s longstanding view in favour of open trade and multilateralism. Indeed, as recalled by the European Council of 10 March, the EU remains strongly committed to a robust trade policy and an open and rules-based multilateral trading system, with a central role for the WTO. The EU will also continue to engage actively with international trade partners, advancing on all ongoing negotiations for ambitious and balanced free trade agreements. I may add that, regarding the latter, the European Council has welcomed your positive vote on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and looks forward to its provisional application. As you know, in this House there are strong concerns over the negative effects of trade, economic integration and technological change. We have to take these grievances seriously. However, the solution is certainly not to close our economies. Instead, we need to improve the daily lives of citizens by ensuring that the benefits of globalisation are more widely shared. Beyond that, we must also be able to better communicate the actual benefits of trade to the wider public. This is also something for the G7 to consider.  On climate change, the global community needs to act urgently and move forward with the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The European Union is committed to ambitious global action against climate change and we insist on maintaining global ownership of the Paris Agreement. The EU, and its Members, are playing their full part in implementing the Paris Agreement, both through the development of our domestic policies and in keeping to our commitment to global solidarity. In this context, it is also worth noting that, on 6 March, the Foreign Affairs Council resolved to reinvigorate EU climate diplomacy and to maintain climate change as a strategic priority in diplomatic dialogues.  The Paris Agreement is a major achievement of the international community. It is proving, and it needs to prove, that the transition to climate resilience and low emissions economies, is irreversible. Progress on ratification has been extraordinary, making it possible for the agreement to enter into force less than a year after the COP21 in Paris. In parallel, countries have already started to implement their climate policies, while non-state action by cities, businesses, investors and civil society has continued to expand. The Council is aware that climate will be one of the most challenging issues at the G7 table, particularly in view of the positions expressed by the new US administration.  My third point is on migration. Dealing with the migration crisis has been at the core of the political debate in the European Union, including here in the European Parliament. Naturally, we tend to focus on our crisis in our part of the world, but managing migration is not a European phenomenon, nor solely a European responsibility. It is a global responsibility, requiring collective solutions that are in full respect of our obligations under international law. The G7 is a privileged forum to forge partnerships and launch collective initiatives for an equitable and fair sharing of responsibility. The areas on which we can work together with G7 partners include assistance to most—affected countries of transit, resettlement efforts, the exchange of best practices on return and readmission, as well as increased cooperation on the fight against smuggling and trafficking. We are also committed to taking an active part in the follow-up to the UN Summit on Addressing Large Movements of Refugees and Migration, held in September last year. The EU intends to play a prominent role in the process leading to the establishment of the UN Global Compact on migration and refugees in 2018. We ask all G7 members to engage equally in the consultation phase, as well as in the negotiating phase next year.  Before concluding let me make a few additional remarks on foreign policy matters. The summit will address a number of issues relating to our neighbourhood.  On Syria, we should stress that no effort can be spared to bring the Syrian conflict to an end. All parties, in particular Syria and its supporters, must allow humanitarian access to all people in need, and all parties must ensure full compliance with the ceasefire.  In Libya, it is urgent to advance on the part of inclusive political dialogue and national reconciliation in the framework of the Libyan political agreement.  On a more positive note, one can mention Iran. We support the joint comprehensive plan of action on the Iran nuclear issues, which is an important contribution to the international non-proliferation regime. Continued and full implementation of this plan of action is essential to build confidence that Iran’s nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful in nature.  As for the situation in Ukraine, the EU continues to stand united in the conviction that the conflict can only be solved by diplomatic means. It is necessary to ensure full respect for international law, and especially the legal obligation to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. We condemn the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia and we reaffirm our policy of its non-recognition, as well as that of sanctions against those involved. The duration of these restrictive measures is clearly linked to Russia’s complete implementation of the Minsk Agreements.

It will only come back with convincing results and concrete commitments. The challenges we face have changed scale, while our modes of governance are still very limited at the territorial level. First, I expect our leaders to ensure that all parties, including the United States, live up to their commitments under the Paris Agreement and adequately finance the fight against climate change.

On the one hand: to heat up the process of economic globalization even further with a new generation of international treaties and, on the other hand, to make social, ecological and democratic corrections. The question is this: while at the same time you are clearly trying to push ahead with bilateral trade agreements, which do not provide for binding social and ecological standards, you are not consistent in the ecological, social and democratic corrections that the globalization process needs. Two examples: firstly, the European Parliament has proposed to you to prescribe binding human rights standards for the textile sector along the entire supply chain. That means that everything that is imported into Europe must correspond to our values. We do not need a Buy European Act, we need binding social and ecological standards. If you come up with such suggestions, you will become credible. It is the same with the fight against financial crime. Six officers sit in the basement of the Eurojustice General Directorate in the Financial Crime Task Force. Make sure that the resources that a clean financial market needs are finally made available. Then you will become credible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 80, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo Castaldo", "mepid": "124812", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the theme of this presidency of the Italian G7 is to build the foundations of renewed confidence.

Then, in 2015, the phase-out of fossil fuels was adopted by the G7: that was setting the agenda for the Paris Agreement later on in the year.  That shows how crucial this G7 will be on what is going to happen with the implementation of the Paris Agreement. We know that the United States is trying to push back and trying to get the significance of fossil fuels back on the agenda, whereas we all know that Paris requires a phase-out of fossil fuels. So we cannot give in, in any way, to what the Americans are asking. We cannot slow down; investors are watching to see what will come of it. But this will also set the agenda for the G20 later on in the year.

I have been a parliamentarian in my own country for 23 years, and during three I was with your neighbours in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. So allow me to say, dear colleagues: the United Nations was created after the Second World War exactly because the world wanted to avoid another tragedy of the same dimension. But I believe this was exactly the main motivation for the creation of the European Communities – with one very important difference: the European Communities and the European Union are clearly the most successful project of peace sustainability in the world since the beginning of history. And that is why I want to express here my very deep gratitude and appreciation for the strong commitment of the European Union and all its bodies to multilateralism, and for the very generous and extremely important contribution you give in development cooperation, in humanitarian aid, and also in the key central aspects of peace and security that are the core of the United Nations action. (Applause) You see the European Union involved around Libya. You see the European Union involved funding the AMISOM mission of the African Union in Somalia. We see the European Union in both financial support and training in situations from the Central African Republic or Mali, and we look forward to the support of the European Union for the initiative of the neighbours of Mali, the G5 Sahel. European contribution is today an absolutely essential part of what is necessary to make the UN effective, and I want to express my deep gratitude for that. (Applause) Dear colleagues, it would be possible to come here and make the case that the world has never been better. It is obvious that globalisation and technological progress have in the last decades created the conditions for an enormous increase in global wealth, for a meaningful improvement in the leading conditions of the majority of the population, even for a very strong reduction of the number of absolute poor – probably the Chinese contribution being essential for that. And some might even say, looking for instance at the number of soldiers killed in the battlefield, that this is the most peaceful period in human history. Now these indicators might be true, but they are far from revealing the whole truth, and I think it is important for us to recognise that we are facing a number of unprecedented challenges that require the EU and the UN to work together. Allow me to mention briefly four of them. First, conflicts. We are seeing a multiplication of new conflicts in the last few years, and old conflicts seem never to die, be it in Afghanistan, Somalia or the Democratic Republic of Congo. But the truth is that, not only do we have a multiplication of conflicts, but they change in nature. We practically no longer have wars between countries, even if there are some threats looming on the horizon, but most of the conflicts are internal – many of them linked to fragilities in the countries, but being internal, they quickly have a regional dimension and sometimes even a global dimension. At the same time, they tend to be asymmetric, more and more complex, more and more interlinked, and more linked with the new threat of global terrorism in the world. If one looks at the situation from Nigeria to Mali, to Libya, to Somalia, to Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan – all these conflicts are becoming more and more interlinked. You see fighters going from one to another and then some of them going back to their countries of origin and potentially becoming threats to the security of those countries of origin, and we see these conflicts becoming more and more interlinked. They are indeed today a very relevant threat to our global security, wherever we live. At the same time, it is clear that power relations in the world became less obvious, and with power relations less obvious, it seems that there is no respect, and impunity and unpredictability became the name of the game. In this context, when one looks at the present trends of conflict, it is absolutely essential to create the conditions to reverse these trends, and for that it is clear we need to strengthen multilateral capacity to address conflicts, to solve conflicts and to prevent and sustain peace. And this is an area where the European cooperation with the United Nations is absolutely crucial. We need to strengthen our own capacity to solve many of the conflicts around the world. But that forces us to look into their nature. Look at Syria. These conflicts are conflicts where nobody is winning: everybody is losing. And not only is everybody is losing from the point of view of the citizens of the country – the enormous suffering of the Syrian people – but we see the impact on the destabilisation of the region. And with Syria, we see Syria clearly as one of the feeding factors of global terrorism. Now, the point is that we need to create the conditions to make those that are parties to the conflict, but especially those that have an influence on the parties to the conflict, to understand that, indeed, these are conflicts where nobody is winning, everybody is losing, and in which the contradictions of interest that might interest are much smaller than the absolute need to put an end to this nonsense and to eliminate these terrible threats for our own global security. (Applause) And there, as I said, we need to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations, both in conflict resolution – in preventing conflict – and sustaining peace, our new most important priority. But we will never be able to do it without a very strong support and commitment from the European Union. A strong and united Europe is an absolutely fundamental pillar of a strong and effective United Nations, and this is a very clear message I would like to address to you all. (Applause) But in these conflicts we also see horrible violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, and that is why I would like to mention the second challenge, and it relates to the fact that we see the human rights agenda losing ground to the national sovereignty agenda. That should not make sense. National sovereignty is a central pillar of the United Nations Charter, and indeed national sovereignty is reinforced when countries and governments are able to protect their citizens and to preserve human rights in their territories. But unfortunately we have seen national sovereignty many times being invoked to justify the lack of capacity of the international community to address the terrible human rights violation challenges that we see in several parts of the world. It is my belief that we need to mobilise a broader coalition for human rights, and the broader coalition must be able to understand that we only stress national sovereignty by strongly promoting and protecting human rights all over the world. But for that coalition to be effective, I think we need two conditions. First, we need to have a comprehensive view of human rights – civil and political rights, but also economic, social and cultural rights. And second, it is important not to be biased. It is important not to have double standards or even agendas. I think it is absolutely crucial to understand that human rights are a value in themselves and they should not be used at the service of other political projects. (Applause) To be very frank, if we want to champion human rights, we need to have moral authority. The recent migration and refugee crisis in the world has undermined to a certain extent the moral authority of several countries around the world to champion human rights in an effective way. This is why I want to say how important it is from my perspective, the strong commitment of the European Union together with us in making sure that we are able to re-establish the international protection regime for refugees in line with international law, and to have Europe strongly engaged in a positive and constructive dialogue in the preparation of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration that I hope will be approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2018. In relation to this I would like to make a few comments. First, it is essential that development cooperation policies are linked to our concerns about human mobility. It is essential that development cooperation policies are built in a way that allows for people to have the choice to remain in their countries, to have opportunities to be able to build their lives with dignity in their own countries – for migration to be out of choice, not out of necessity. (Applause) Second, I think it is essential to have a much stronger international coordination in cracking down on traffickers and smugglers that are, in my opinion, the worst criminals of today’s world. But third, I also think it is very important to create more opportunities for legal migration and more effective cooperation between countries of origin, countries of transit and countries of destination. I think that the European Union must be at the centre of this dialogue, and your role can be extremely positive to find the necessary consensus to make the Migration Compact a success. (Applause) This massive displacement we are witnessing in today’s world brings me to the third challenge I wanted to mention to you, and that has to do with the fact that, if one looks at the global mega trends that we face – population growth; climate change; chaotic urbanisation in many areas of the developing world; food insecurity, which unfortunately now has translated into famine in some critical areas where conflict and climate change have been aligning themselves to create terrible human tragedies; water scarcity – all these mega trends are interacting with each other in a stronger and stronger away in a world that is smaller and smaller, and they are having dramatic impacts in terms of the increasing fragility of states, the increasing displacement of people and the increasing human suffering in the world, and creating in several circumstances the potential for conflict over scarce resources. In this context it is important to recognise that climate change is the main accelerator of these factors, and, since climate change is the main accelerator of these factors, it is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement and implements it with an increased ambition. (Applause) If any government doubts these objectives, that is a reason for all others to come together and make sure that we stay the course in relation to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and that we build a broader coalition with civil society, with the business community, with the cities, with the regions, in order to be able to make sure that our ambitions are met and that we are able to tame climate change to the benefit of our present situation, but also to the benefit of our children and grandchildren. In relation to this, it is also important to understand that it is not only the right thing to do; this is the smart thing to do, as green business is becoming more and more recognised as good business. Those countries that will not bet on the green economy will inevitably lag behind in development in the years to come. So it is the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do, and we count on Europe to lead these efforts at global level. (Applause) But indeed, one of the key impacts of climate change is the acceleration of displacement, which is very much linked to the problems of migration and refugees that I mentioned, and this brings me to a fourth challenge. Globalisation has had an enormous positive impact, as I mentioned – together with technological development – in relation to wealth, living conditions, the reduction of poverty, as I said in the beginning of my intervention. But globalisation left a lot of people behind, and we see that in the rust belts of this world. We see that in massive youth unemployment in different parts of the world – even a little bit in Europe, to a certain extent compared with other areas – but very clearly in North Africa and the Middle East, which represents a tragedy for young people, a very strong limitation for the development of the countries, but more and more, a meaningful threat for our global security, as youth without employment, without jobs, without opportunities, is becoming, in some areas of the world, one of the key areas of recruitment of terrorist groups and one of the factors that facilitate the propaganda of extremist organisations. In this context, we need to recognise that globalisation and technological progress also have dramatically increased inequalities at global level and at country level. Eight persons in the world have today as much wealth as half of the world population. All these factors have contributed to undermine the trust between peoples and the political establishments at national level, but also the trust between peoples and international organisations like the UN and the trust in global solutions for our global problems. That is the reason why I am strongly engaged in the reform of the UN, to be able to make the UN more effective, more cost effective, but more than anything else, to make the UN closer to the aspirations, the needs and the perspectives of the peoples we are supposed to serve. That means, for us, the reform of the UN development system, to make it much more effective in supporting Member States in the implementation of the Agenda 2030 that we hope, as an agenda for sustainable development, can bring a very important contribution to re-establish the trust between peoples and the international systems based on making sure that no one is left behind, making sure that we have a more fair globalisation. At the same time, it means the reform of our peace strategy, operational set-ups and architecture in order to make us more able to face the challenges of today, namely of peacekeeping. We have more and more peacekeeping operations where peace is elusive and where peacekeepers see themselves in the middle of a conflict, with extreme difficulties to protect the people they are supposed to protect. This requires a strategic analysis and new partnerships, namely with the African Union, with several African regional organisations, but very central cooperation with the European Union in this regard, and reform of our own internal management system. Some of the rules and regulations that have been accumulated over decades in the UN seem to be created to make sure that we are not able to act effectively, and we need to make sure that we create the trust between Member States, namely Western countries and the G77, to understand that there is a win-win solution, making the UN more flexible, but at the same time with decentralisation, simplification of procedures, more freedom of movement of the secretariat, more transparency and more accountability to make sure that there is full responsibility for anything we do. Reform is essential at the level of the United Nations. I think reform is essential at the level of all international organisations, as is the understanding that we need to rebuild that trust, both at country level and at global level. All our societies are becoming multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious. In my opinion this is a good thing, and I believe diversity is a richness, not a threat. But it would be naive to think ... (Applause) ... that diversity will be a success automatically. For diversity to be a success, we need a massive investment – a political, social, cultural investment by governments, by local authorities, by civil societies – in the social cohesion and inclusivity of our societies, to make sure that people understand that their identities are respected, but at the same time that they belong to the community as a whole, with all its rights and obligations. And at the same time, we need at global level to understand that diversity will not be automatically a source of peace and understanding; that we also need a massive investment, an investment in international cooperation, to bring people together, to make people know each other, respect each other, cooperate with each other, and to do it in a way in which it is possible to have everybody working together to face the global challenges that are in front of us and that no country can solve in an isolated way. It is in this context – and allow me to say a few words as a European – that I strongly believe that the values of the Enlightenment are the most important contribution that Europe has given to world civilisation, and that those values of tolerance, la primauté de la raison, must be a very solid cornerstone of our capacity to build a more tolerant, more fair, more just, more peaceful and more prosperous world.

I see Parliament is full to the brim. Why are we doing this Draghi is the most important man in the euro area. The development of the Eurozone and the fate of millions of people depend on his decisions. To whom is he accountable? He then refers to the independence of his mandate. Yes, but he does not have the mandate to expropriate savers. He does not have the mandate to force insurance companies into the red. He doesn't have the mandate to make our banks struggle to cope with the Americans. He does not have the mandate to undermine the sustainability of pension funds. Nor does he have the mandate to create asset bubbles in our country. And how does he ward off these attacks? He says: I have to expropriate the savers so that their deposit systems are safe. How does he justify that? He says: With my cheap money policy, I am pushing the economy that would otherwise fail. And because the economy picks up and employment picks up, savers also benefit, and this is why their deposit systems are safe in the long term. That is his rationale. We know, however, that a zero interest rate policy and negative interest rates are putting banks and companies at risk. If the interest rate no longer reflects market conditions, but is simply pushed down to encourage companies to invest, then we know that this underpricing of risk leads the company to invest in risky ventures and thus get into difficulties for the future. But not enough! He also decided and enforced the massive purchase of government bonds. A total of 60–80 billion a month, a total of 2.3 trillion! And with it he floods the markets and also saves the euro zone, because he reduces the interest rates for the countries in need. But with With this zero interest rate policy it cannot “strengthen” the economy, so to speak, but it will simply drag ailing companies and ultimately banks along with it, so that we will have zombie companies like in Japan. Above all, he cannot bring out the difficulties of the euro zone with his cheap money policy. The trouble is that we have an incorrect exchange rate. All economists and intelligent politicians know that the euro in the zone is undervalued for Germany and overvalued for Spain and Greece. What is the consequence? Germany's exports are subsidized and exports from the debtor states are taxed. This thing is causing Germany to go from export to export record while the other countries import goods and export employment. You cannot cover up a wrong exchange rate with a cheap monetary policy, that is simply impossible! That is why we only have the consequence that the agony of different countries will now continue. What is Parliament's job? Parliament's job would be to point out to Mr Draghi what his mandate is. Namely to maintain monetary stability. What is this Parliament doing? This Parliament is closing its eyes to reality. This Parliament does not want to see that this policy is against the good of the people. This Parliament is sticking to a bad policy.

As we all know, the Treaty has bestowed independence upon the European Central Bank to conduct its monetary policy and to pursue its primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. International experience has indeed shown that monetary policy tends to be more effective in supporting a stable price level when it is shielded from short-term political influence. The Presidency believes that the accountability of the European Central Bank for its monetary policy is commensurate with its independence and can be inferred from the Treaty. When it comes to the ECB’s accountability for its banking supervision tasks, this is specified in the regulation on the Single Supervisory Mechanism. In this context, the Presidency sees no reason to question whether the ECB adheres to the accountability obligations towards the EU legislators.

On behalf of the Commission, I would like to limit myself to a very few remarks on this matter. The ECB and the national central banks are independent when exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by the Treaty. The principle of central bank independence is enshrined in the Treaty itself. It is put there to protect the ECB and the national central banks in pursuing their primary mandate of fulfilling their price stability objective and thus creating the foundation for a healthy and stable European economy.  Independence and accountability are of course intertwined. The ECB presents to Parliament an annual report on its activities and you hold a general debate on that basis. The quarterly monetary dialogues you organise with the ECB President provide a further forum for in—depth discussion. I understand you have regularly made use of this possibility over the past year.  The Commission has full trust in the ECB to exercise its mandates under the Treaty. We welcome the constructive engagement that has developed between the European Parliament and the ECB over the past years.

The role of the ECB within the new post-crisis supervision and architecture is absolutely crucial: crucial to prevent financial shocks in the future; crucial to secure the confidence of citizens. The decisions taken by the ECB, from quantitative easing to the various programmes of support are working. Growth has returned. Three million jobs have been created in the eurozone in the last year. Inflation is slowly moving towards the ECB target of 2%, and despite all of the Armageddon predictions, the euro remains and has not been fragmented.  The crisis came from light touch supervision. We are not going back to that. That is why we need a strong independent ECB, but that independence must also deliver accountability and transparency, and it is at that level that the ECB has much to do. I want the President of the ECB to appear before all parliaments of the 19 Member States of the eurozone; not just the big Member States. President Draghi has appeared before parliaments in France, Spain, Italy and Germany. It is time that engagement took place at all levels across eurozone countries. We cannot have an inside or outside track. All Member States must be treated fairly. Appearing before some parliaments and not others sends out the wrong impression.  The euro is our currency. We must defend it. The ECB is our central bank. It must treat all Member States with respect, and that is where the change needs to happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 128, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Roberto Gualtieri", "mepid": "96892", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, it is no surprise that Mr Starbatty’s positions are in a minority in this House because they are factually weak and wrong. A broad majority of this House supports the ECB, its independence and its policies because the ECB is the main pillar of EMU and has been a fundamental anchor of its stability and integrity. That such a great responsibility would fall on the shoulders of the ECB was unavoidable, taking into account the peculiar construction of EMU, with the explosive components of monetary policy, coordination competence on economic policy, and a small budget for the single market but not for the single currency. With the soaring debt crisis these responsibilities have been successfully honoured in full compliance with the task and the powers conferred by the Treaties and the Protocol in order to achieve the primary objective of maintaining price stability and to support the general economic policies of the Union, which of course include the integrity of the EMU. The Treaties are crystal clear. In order to achieve its objectives, the ECB and national central banks can conduct open market and credit operations. So it is not surprising that the OMT programme has been declared by the Court of Justice fully compatible with EU law. In the post-crisis phase of low growth and low interest rates, and with the additional negative impact of financial fragmentation on proper monetary policy transmission, other unconventional policy tools have proven to be necessary to meet the inflation objective. I do not need to recall them, but is important to underline that, without quantitative easing (QE), Europe would have fallen into deflation. QE has been – and is – an economic success and for all stakeholders the potential negative side effects have clearly been outpaced by the positive ones. Moreover, economic data clearly show that the necessary sustained adjustment in the path of inflation has not yet materialised. Enhanced non-standard monetary policy measures are to continue until that time.  The ECB is, and has to be, fully independent. Nevertheless, we welcome and appreciate the accountability framework vis—à-vis the European Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the improvements in transparency of the ECB’s monetary policy. As far as the SSM is concerned, a stronger accountability framework is appropriate and we are in line with our interinstitutional agreement to fulfil our democratic role.  It is evident that the current EMU construction, while it is not unsustainable, is sub-optimal and we need to complete it. We cannot rely only on common monetary policy and national fiscal and economic policies. Instead of contesting the excellent job of the ECB, it would be good if political groups and Member States would contribute to providing the instruments and policies that we need in order to face our current challenges.

It's so funny ...\" [sings]. Wonderful things are happening here in the European Union, wonderful things, but there are also many things that go wrong, that really go wrong. And the question for all of us is, \"How do we tackle those challenges?\". Unfortunately, I find that the Union's answer is all too often: \"Money, money, money\". We just throw in a big bag of money and our problems will be solved automatically. Mario Draghi also seems to be a fan of Abba. The president of the European Central Bank creates some money and he pumps it into the economy. Is this good for growth? Yes, in the short term. We will buy something today that we would otherwise have bought tomorrow. Because saving does not yield anything anyway, we simply spend our money. But everyone feels that this is growth on credit, that that is not sustainable growth, that this monetary hocus pocus will one day have to stop. And that's not the only side effect of this policy. There are more. The purchasing power of the people is declining. Savings no longer yields anything. Pensions are at risk. Inequality is increasing, between the middle class and the people who are really rich, and certainly between people who are poor and rich. We create bubbles, in the real estate market, on the stock exchange. You can see that this is not a sustainable policy. And that surprises me very much how all the traditional political parties in this parliament defend this policy. We talk a lot here about tax fairness, about fairness. How the hell can you defend that while defending the European Central Bank's policy of increasing inequality? I really can't reach that. I think we, if MPs, if politicians better choose a different soundtrack, a different song, we better not listen to Abba, but listen to the Beatles better, we better not listen to \"Money, money, money\" but to \"Money can't buy me love\". I won't sing that, that's for next time, but I really think that's the answer. We will not buy love for the European Union with a bag of money. We won't do it like that. What should we do? Reform. The hard way. Save. Don't take the shortcuts, do whatever it takes. And there, too, the policy of the European Central Bank is detrimental, because it is precisely undermining that need to reform. What annoys me most, however, is the fact that the European Central Bank is not transparent enough about this - it has also been mentioned by my colleague. There is a lot of work to be done there.

(Though if it was a Linux created by a young Finn with the nice surname Torvalds, it would probably be a totally different matter). Sometimes with a bad operating system, we have to run it in safe mode, and that is actually what the European Central Bank has been doing for the last few years. But my dear friend Loones is actually picking up the wrong music: ABBA is not qualitatively high music, it is dancing music for those who like it. It is high time to play Bob Dylan’s ‘The Times They Are A Changin’’. Why? With a forthcoming deal between France and Germany, we will have a time of change in the EU. That again will probably produce a turn back to interest rates. Those who are very interested in medieval politics know that in the medieval world interest rates were thought to be a sin. That is probably slightly the way in which the Central Bank has operated in the last few years. We need to go back to real interest rates, but as soon as we go back to real interest rates, we are going to have severe problems in those countries with a large state debt because what was 70%, 80% and 90% will all of a sudden be 100%. That puts on the agenda a new question: we need the redemption fund, because without the redemption fund those countries will be dragged down by an unsustainable state debt.

First of all, I would like to thank the previous speakers for not singing. The mandate of the European Central Bank commits to price stability. The ECB has violated the target of price stability of just under two percent inflation for many years, and if it was achieved in the short term, then only through higher oil prices. The ECB has also admitted why this is the case despite the large amount of cheap money: Because the trade unions do not enforce sufficiently high wages despite lower unemployment, because the rights of workers were constantly attacked by the Troika. The ECB is not only responsible for the supply of money, but also creditors and part of the troika. And that is exactly where the problem lies: It has castrated its own monetary policy, for example by repeatedly threatening to turn the euro off against Greece if governments do not implement labor market reforms, wage cuts, etc. There are similar conflicts of interest with banking supervision. There the ECB is the lender of the banks and the supervisory authority. That creates conflicts of interest. For example, it forced the Irish to knock out the ailing Anglo Irish with taxpayers' money. But one cannot, like Mr. Draghi in Jackson Hole, complain about the insufficient investment of the government and enforce cutback policies in Europe with the troika gang.

I would also like to say, however, that the way in which you introduced this subject, Mr Starbatty, is something of a scapegoat strategy. We have a common currency, and it was created with a common monetary policy and few rules - incidentally, rules that can be traced back not least to the economic thinking that you taught in Tübingen for years. The point is: This thinking means: you can introduce a common currency with few common rules and few common politics. This lack of a common economic and financial policy, with a lack of enforcement of the few rules that we have, led to the very crisis that made it necessary for the ECB to act in 2012. The ECB just didn't break the rules; after the European Court of Justice, the ECB obeyed it, Mr Lucke. Rather, the point is that the ECB made sure that the euro did not fall apart. And now all sorts of people are criticizing the ECB for it. Part of that is then personalized, like you did, Mr Starbatty, on Mr Draghi. The fact is that the Member States are slender feet. Instead of getting the common economic and financial policy in motion that this currency needs, the ECB is now regularly called to account for it. This is a scapegoat strategy. On the other hand, it is necessary to get this common economic and financial policy in motion in the euro zone so that the ECB has the space to return to normal monetary policy.

Putting in the hands of an unelected authority the power to create money outside of any democratic control, leaving it to pursue a senseless goal such as inflation targeting, an instrument that has nothing to do with the dynamics of prices, i.e. money supply, it is insane and undemocratic. The rhetoric that has supported this undemocratic system for decades is based on an assumption that the crisis has disproved, that printing money creates inflation. The need to keep money creation away from politicians would stem from this, from the need to avoid the inflation that everyone now hopes for. I don't know if anyone has noticed that for some time Draghi has been printing and pouring into the eurozone system trillions of euros and what has been the result? Deflation. Inflation does not depend mechanically on printed money, but depends on the demand for goods, on the money spent, and in a depression like the one we are currently experiencing, a government can be sure that printed money is spent only if it spends it itself. Without monetary financing of the expenditure, which the treaties and the independence of the central bank prevent, it will be impossible to revive the economy of the eurozone states. However, in this Union of equal states, where one is more equal than the others, the powers of the state are independent but one, the power of the central bank, is more independent than the others and is therefore what actually commands, making and undoing puppet governments to pleasure.

With the complicity of the majority of this Parliament, it has now acquired quasi-legislative power and control over the entire financial sector thanks to its new supervision missions.

There is a lot of cheap politicking, especially on this side of the Chamber, and not so much understanding or knowledge. Let me draw from my experience of working in the Central Bank for many years. First of all, central banking underwent a huge change at the end of the last century, going from secretive, non-transparent and politically influenced entities into highly professional bodies serving clear goals. Goals are set by the law as well as by instruments, targets and accountability principles. The establishment of the ECB, together with the creation of the euro, learned from all of this experience and benefited from best practice. That is why my view is very close to the one expressed by the Council and the Commission.  The debate today is not so much about the ECB’s position, but about monetary policy in the last few years; that should be understood. But while the legislator has given the Central Bank the targets, instruments and responsibility, we should not be surprised if they use it. It was an incredibly complicated time. Government fiscal policy did not support a way to get economies out of the crisis and I believe that central banks have done a great job, not only the ECB, but also the others. So, instead of blaming and criticising – especially personally – some people at the ECB, we should appreciate what they did, for the way our economy has got out of the crisis, for the jobs they saved, actually improving the situation in Europe.

But we have to tell the truth, because despite the geographic uncertainties it faces across the Channel and across the Atlantic, the monetary policy that is being conducted is an appropriate policy, whatever the economic challenges we are going through. The euro zone is therefore showing greater resistance than that which could have been anticipated. Its growth, it has been said, is expected to reach 1.7% this year and 1.8% next year. This good streak is not by chance, it owes a lot - as the Commission has pointed out several times this week in its economic forecasts - to the support of an exceptional monetary policy. Yes, the recovery remains too weak and the divergences remain too strong within the zone. But no, the central bank does not deserve to bear the burden of this responsibility. On the contrary, the financing conditions would never have been so favorable if they had not been pursued courageously, with independence, within the framework of a mandate which she was able to interpret in the interests of Europeans. On the supervision side, adjustments may be made necessary as part of the review of the European supervisory authorities. However, they should in no way call into question the single supervisory mechanism, the SSM, this fundamental device of the banking union which makes possible the direct control of around 130 banking groups - including as the Court has just recalled. about Baden-Württemberg's Landeskreditbank - totaling over € 21 trillion in assets, and undoubtedly represents a step forward towards the application of the coherent body of prudential rules in all countries of the eurozone. The supervision requirement is all the more critical today since the Central Bank will have to play a leading role in answering the systemic questions posed by the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, in particular that of the supervision of British CCPs and that of the future of netting contracts denominated in euros. Beyond the risk of post-Brexit regulatory easing, the European Central Bank will finally have to tackle the thorny issue of non-performing loans, NPLs. In this regard, the publication, last March, of its guidelines on the handling of these bad debts is a step forward that will improve the daily dialogue between banks and their supervisors.

It was a transfer union from people in the North to try and save the South, but asked for austerity programmes even more.

Mr Lucke said we had made a critical report. It doesn't go together. Third, of course there are problems with the ECB. The ECB thought it could stimulate the economy with monetary policy against the productivity advances in the IT industry and against falling oil prices - that was a mistake. But these are also design flaws. Why do we not have voting rights based on the liability shares? That is a question to ask. Why does the ECB define the inflation target itself? In the contracts it says “not less than 2%” - self-defined, by Mr. Trichet! Why was it not actually possible to separate states and banks? No, the loose monetary policy has brought the banks even closer to the states. So a number of critical points that can and must be discussed.

The well-functioning system of European film funding and the principle of territoriality could also be protected by a flexibly designed verification system, and this was a particularly important concern of ours in the Committee on Culture, because we are convinced that we are promoting cultural diversity and strengthening the European film sector can only be achieved at the present time by maintaining the territorial principle and a long period of time is needed to be able to establish new structures here permanently. A large number of Europeans who are temporarily abroad within the EU for various reasons - be it for work, for study or for leisure activities - will benefit from this regulation because it enables them to use their home program, which they legally do acquired to take with you when traveling. This corresponds to our ideas of mobility and the freedom to access content. I welcome the fact that we have a clear legal framework here, which on the one hand takes data protection into account, but on the other hand also gives room for maneuver that is flexible enough to also implement various verification systems so that we can apply them here can still remain simple and guarantee the necessary legal security on all sides.

It enables European consumers who subscribe to online contact services acquired legally in their Member State of residence to continue to access the service when they are temporarily in another Member State. I congratulate all colleagues who worked on this report and salute the important contribution of the Maltese Presidency in making this happen. To be more exact, the Portability Regulation ensures that consumers can use portable online contact services which offer access to music, games, films, entertainment programmes or sporting events not only in the Member State of residence but also when they are temporarily present in another EU country for purposes such as leisure, travel, business trips or learning mobility. We are speaking about almost 6% of the European population, around 30 million people, and the number could grow by 2020 up to 70 million beneficiaries. This regulation includes not only people who travel but also students studying abroad, people who work for a limited period of time in another Member State or cross-border commuters.

I refer here to: the absence of specific time limitations; the deletion of the formulation ‘regularly returns’; the closed links for the means of verifications; the restrictive IP checking in binary format; the safeguards in terms of data protection; the promotion of study mobility as an example for the use of portability; or the provisions that allow the waiver of the mandatory verification of the Member State of residence. These are great achievements, and it is important to mention that the European Parliament promoted them, but we have also to be clear that this report is implemented without affecting either the copyright protection framework or the principle of territoriality.

It strikes the right balance between providing online content to consumers while they are temporarily outside of their own Member State, whilst ensuring that sufficiently robust residency verification safeguards are in place for rights holders.

It is common sense and it is an important step forward, but this has to be the first step of many in the fight against geo-blocking; it cannot be the last. Geo-blocking will remain a widespread problem when this regulation is enacted. According to the Commission, almost 70% of video sites in the EU geo-block. Our own Parliament Research Service has estimated that people are actually willing to pay almost a billion euros extra per year if geo-blocking is abolished altogether. That is income, and that is an audience that we are currently denying our European creators.  Now the film industry has voiced quite a lot of concerns. Some feel that they have come to rely on geo-blocking as the sole means for their business model. Let us work together to find solutions to that, but the solution cannot be to accept virtual borders. The status quo is simply not working for consumers. It is failing at making Europe’s amazing cultural diversity accessible to all Europeans.  Let us be clear: geo-blocking is a form of discrimination. A common European public sphere cannot develop with geo-blocking in place.

First of all, the proposed text is a regulation and not a directive; it will therefore be particularly restrictive for States. Then, it risks ultimately calling into question the right to geo-blocking, which is a component of the sovereignty of States. In addition, he suffers from a serious internal contradiction in not specifying the time limit for stay in another state giving rise to the right to portability. As a result, portability risks becoming a principle and not an exception.

Now we need to go on to NGO blocking and ensure modernised and harmonised copyright fit for the 21st century, enabling access to content, not punishing audiences. We have to address this and we will be addressing this through a variety of legislative initiatives: the AVMS directives, platforms, copyright reform and electronic communications code in the SETCOM legislative proposals, just to name a few.

The credit goes to everyone who worked on this case and, first and foremost, to the European Commission. From the outset, the current Commission had been extremely compelling about the need to create a digital market. It was a good thing, but many ulterior motives persisted, both in this chamber and, probably, in other European institutions. What I like about this text as well as the positions you have gradually taken, Commissioner, is the idea that a dangerous prejudice needs to be exposed. Yes or no, should the digital market crush those who create the contents of this market? In other words: is the great European digital single market directed against creators, who should fold and abandon any form of law or control of law? Commissioner Ansip, dear President, you have committed your word and shown by this text that you had taken the opposite option. No, the digital market is not adversely affected by territoriality or geoblocking, contrary to what is said from time to time, including here, nor - naturally - the fair remuneration of copyright. Indeed, this copyright remuneration is the absolute backbone of one of the European values, and not the least. Concretely, around 530 billion euros a year come from creative activity. If this backbone were to be abandoned, by geo-blocking or by the elimination of territoriality, this would mean that we would open our doors wide to the main Anglo-Saxon and American groups which, in some cases, already use in their commercial activity content that they have not purchased, which is in principle prohibited in any form of commerce - and I am glad that your colleague, Mrs Vestager, be vigilant to sanction these facts. On the other hand, these same groups - and I draw your attention for the texts to come - allow themselves, thanks to our weakness, to pay their taxes where they have tax facilities and not where their consumers are. Commissioner, from this point of view, I would like us to have extremely demanding discussions on the texts to come. There is no shortage of people to say that slicing the Digital Single Market issue by topic is a strategy. I believe I can count on your good faith - you have just demonstrated it -, but we will naturally be very vigilant about what follows because it is defending one of the very great European values ​​to defend the single market for authors through their territoriality and their fair remuneration.

But first, let me recall why these new rules were adopted. The aim is to increase the internal security of the European Union as a whole, and the systemic checks are also to address in particular the threat from foreign terrorist fighters. The extended negotiations ensured the right balance between the security needs and the freedom of movement. During this lengthy period, Member States have had the time to prepare for the entry into force of these new rules. The Commission has provided financial support to Member States to make the necessary investments at the border crossings.  Thanks to this preparation, in many Member States the waiting time due to the new rules has not caused excessive delays, but indeed, in some cases, the waiting time at the external borders has increased. In particular at the land border between Slovenia and Croatia the waiting time exceeded a few hours during the Easter holiday period. However, we should note that even before the new rules started applying, some crossing points at this border section experienced occasional delays of up to two hours. Commissioner Avramopoulos and his services are in close contact with the Croatian and the Slovenian authorities to find the operational solutions to the situation at this specific border section. As a follow-up to the discussion between President Juncker and the Croatian and Slovenian prime ministers in the margins of the European Council on 29 April, an on-the-spot visit took place on 8 and 9 May at the most affected border crossing points. Following this visit, all parties agreed on operational guidance on the implementation of the new rules. This will take into account the specific situation of this border section to limit the impact of the new rules at this specific border to the minimum.

At the same time, the introduction of controls on the entry and entry of EU citizens at the Schengen borders must not jeopardize the Union's greatest acquis: the free movement of EU citizens. It cannot happen that there are several hours of waiting between two Member States on certain border sections, such as the Hungarian-Croatian or the Croatian-Slovenian border sections just mentioned. Yet even summer tourism dumping has not started. It is becoming increasingly difficult to explain to our citizens in these countries that it is impossible to travel from one Member State to another while the uncontrolled arrival of uncontrolled masses in Europe continues. This situation needs to be remedied.

In the context of the entry into force of the Schengen Regulation amended on 7 April this year, it is important to know that the European Commission has funds for the internal security of the Union from which each country has received money through national programs and the money must be used. For the period 2014-2020, about EUR 3 billion is available for the borders and visas component alone. Slovenia also received money to ensure smooth traffic for those crossing the Slovenia-Croatia border. So is Hungary and all the other countries. It is very important how this money was spent and how much it was accessed by the Member States. First of all, mobile and fixed scanners need to be bought so that the identity data of people crossing the border can be quickly verified in databases. Such a check takes ten seconds. If a problem with that person appears on the single screen of the scanner, then check separately. The rest of the people pass quickly. That is why I hope that Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and other countries that have not yet done so will do so as soon as possible, precisely to help those who cross the border to cross it quickly and to ensure their security and life. the health.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 221, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Ivan Jakovčić", "mepid": "124754", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Club. - Madam President, Commissioner, please listen to me carefully because I may be the main culprit for this item being back on the agenda today. Friday 7.4. when the Decree came into force, I was returning home from the last Strasbourg session and at the Kaštel-Dragonja border crossing I was greeted by a 2-kilometer column in which I waited for 2 hours. On Saturday morning, I immediately wrote a letter to President Juncker and Prime Minister Plenković, who really called me after an hour or two and promised to arrange a meeting with Prime Minister Cerar and President Juncker. That meeting really happened on April 29, and the result of their conversation is that in case the waits in the columns are longer than 15 minutes, they will switch from total to targeted controls. The intention of the three friends is good, but it aims more at calming outraged citizens, rather than at the right solution to the problem of unnecessary delays. After all, in practice this is subject to the arbitrariness of individuals and is not formalized at all by any regulation. The correct solution is to introduce targeted controls as a rule, as a written rule, especially at border crossings where security risk is minimal, and to introduce total controls as an exception only in the case of risky intelligence. Namely, this Regulation 458 does not objectively solve the problem of security of citizens, but significantly complicates the lives of especially those people who live along the border. I therefore ask the Commission to immediately propose a revision of the regulation and take into account the fact that targeted controls, which were in practice until recently, have proved to be an appropriate solution. And three more absurdities. The Commission is 15.5. reduced the GDP growth forecast for Croatia due to “unusually long columns at border crossings” because it directly harms tourism, which accounts for 20% of GDP. Thus, on the one hand, the Commission proposes regulations and then, on the basis of their non-implementation or enforcement, gives a negative forecast of economic growth. A concrete absurdity is what happens when a tourist who has already passed the entrance control to Istria wants to go on a day trip, for example, to Venice.There he is again greeted by several hours of control, which makes such excursions a torment, not a pleasure.I am sure that you share my opinion that the main absurdity is that we went from Yugoslavia to Italy and Austria easier than from Croatia to Slovenia and vice versa today, and we are both members of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 222, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Marie-Christine Vergiat", "mepid": "96858", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, a month after the implementation of the regulation on systematic border control, we are back in plenary to discuss the difficulties encountered, unsurprisingly: it was predictable, but perhaps a little quick. It was inevitable that these systematic checks, far from making borders more fluid, would have an impact on traffic. We did say so. In the front line are the airports, where customs staff have not been increased and where the queues have lengthened as a result, prompting the reaction of airlines. The same goes for land borders, especially the most exposed, with particular difficulties between states, whether or not they are members of the Schengen area. It must be said that implementing the new regulations at the time of the Easter holidays requires a certain sense of humor which tourists, especially Swiss, German and Austrian, have paid the price by going to the shores of the Adriatic, passing through Slovenia and Croatia. And the same dysfunctions must have been observed in Romania and Bulgaria. What solutions do we offer? Go back to targeted checks, in defiance of the stated security objective.

I was the negotiator for my group on this issue and I drew attention to several things back then. There was no impact assessment by the Commission on the impact - not from the start. It was clear to many of us that targeted controls would be much better. What we have now experienced, and Ms. Fajon has described it from her own experience, is that there have been massive disabilities here, especially in holiday traffic at the borders. The current system is simply not proportionate. It doesn't create more security. Anyone who believes that these massive border controls - and everyone is being checked - the terrorists will be caught: That is simply not true. The problem is that the European Member States do not even fill the database that is there with data. That means: It is often of no use because the relevant people are not included. In other words, it would make a lot more sense to simply do these targeted checks here and not suspect everyone - that would be necessary. I can only say that I very much support the proposal to the Commission, which has now also come from Tanja Fajon and others. I request that you actually include in the Schengen Code the proposal that, after a waiting period of 15 minutes, targeted controls can and should be introduced here. That is the proposal made by Prime Ministers Cerar and Plenković. But that cannot remain at the bilateral level, because the problems also exist between Hungary and Serbia, as Mrs Gál has just said.

These problems became all the more obvious after the accession of the Eastern European countries in 2004. Even the Head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, has said that Schengen not only facilitates the freedom of movement of people, but the freedom of movement of organised crime and criminals. To try and fix the problems and restore some kind of stability the first step should be to abolish the Schengen area. The only real solution is to restore the control of borders to nation states. They all have different challenges and they have to approach their particular problems in their own way. Unfortunately, the waiting times at borders are going to be longer in some countries than others. Regarding what databases are required to help with border controls, of course the authorities need the fullest possible information on police records, identity documents, fingerprints, criminal intelligence, etc. What we do not need is the EU’s own databases, such as the Schengen Information System working under SIRENE. SIRENE is a police organisation and is part of the EU’s own developing police force. These organisations duplicate the work of Interpol and are unnecessary. Interpol already has at least 12 databases which are at the disposal of nation states. These databases cover a range of information regarding DNA and fingerprints for criminals and missing persons, stolen and missing documents, and counterfeiting, to name just a few of many. The framework for increasing international cooperation in this sphere is Interpol and not EU organisations. When Britain leaves the European Union, which I hope will come sooner rather than later, it should withdraw from Europol and SIRENE and be at the forefront of increasing international cooperation via Interpol.

The application of the Regulation on Systemic Controls has been highlighted as an important reason why the Commission's projections on Croatia's growth have been reduced. It is paradoxical and inadmissible for the Commission to forecast reduced growth due to the implementation of the Regulation it proposed itself. Existing European security mechanisms have shown too many weaknesses following the terrorist attacks, primarily due to the lack of exchange of security information between member states. Better cooperation of security systems is a prerequisite for greater security of citizens. The political reality calls for strengthening the security of the Union, but this Regulation cannot compensate for fundamental weaknesses. The Croatian-Slovenian land border is not the only crisis point for the implementation of this Regulation. Longer waits have also been reported at the border with Gibraltar and at airports across the European Union.

Also, some members retained border controls within Schengen. All this calls into question freedom of movement as a fundamental value of the European Union.

It is ridiculous and paradoxical that the European Commission's growth estimates related to gross domestic product in Croatia have been reduced precisely because of the situation around the congestion on Croatian borders, which arose as a result of the Regulation proposed by the European Commission and passed by this Parliament. Therefore, it is good that there was a trilateral meeting between Mr. Juncker, Mr. Cerar and our Prime Minister Plenković, which resulted in greater propulsiveness at the borders, which means that after fifteen minutes of waiting, it moves from systematic checks to targeted checks.

Today, however, as confirmed by a recent report by Europol, the threat of terrorist attacks by European citizens returning from conflict zones, the so-called foreign fighters, remains high. To deal with the situation, the regulation we are discussing binds Member States to intensify border controls, controls which certainly must not lead to the loss of an acquired right but which, given the circumstances, represent a necessary tool to guarantee the security that allows freedom of movement to citizens and, in this context, consultation and rapid exchange of data through the SIS system and border controls become essential.

In essence, the Commission will have to ensure that the necessary strengthening of controls does not have disproportionate and unjustified impacts on the freedom of movement of European citizens and of those who reside and move legally, perhaps for work, in the Union.

An open Europe will only be able to retain its character, only then will we be able to enjoy the benefits of the Schengen area, when European openness cannot be confused with naivety, nor used by people of ill will. Therefore, enhanced control at the external borders, but also within the European Union, is a very good decision that serves the security of the citizens of the European Union. I also believe that the decision about mass, inevitability of this control is a good decision. Criminals are usually very clever and they can take advantage of all such system twists and turns, so it is better for this control to be massive. And if there are queues, well - we should shorten the queues, but not by avoiding control or giving up control, but by improving control, i.e. automation, digitization. We should do whatever we can to speed up this control. I now have a question for the representatives of the Commission about smart borders. How advanced is this project? To what extent are countries prepared to respond to these security challenges in a digital and not analogue way?

That is why it is time for prevention, risk analysis and the full exchange of European information to come to the fore again in the external border control of the EU and in the fight against terrorism, instead of spectacular actions.

At the same time, I believe that the possibility of terminating systematic checks in the presence of obstacles to free travel in the European Union and after a risk assessment represents a balance between the need to ensure European security and the economic and business interests of the countries concerned. The topic of border security is extremely important for my country, Bulgaria, which guards perhaps the most sensitive external border - the one with Turkey. Unfortunately, although the country fully implements the Schengen legislation, including systematic checks, and fully meets the criteria for Schengen membership, Bulgaria still does not have full access to the Schengen Information System - the same system in which European citizens must be checked under the new rules. when entering and leaving the European Union. Let me be clear - as long as Bulgaria does not have full access to the SIS, despite our good intentions and the enormous efforts we are making, we will not be able to guarantee maximum security at Europe's external borders.

As you know, she has had to return to Brussels for a very important meeting relating to the issue of international aviation safety, with which I am sure all of you are very familiar. I can assure you that she fully appreciates the importance of the issue of road transport and would like to have been able to be here. On her behalf, I want to thank you for the invitation to participate in this preliminary debate on the Commission’s forthcoming proposals on road transport. We plan to adopt a series of road initiatives on 31 May as part of a larger mobility package. I am very pleased to say that the motion for a resolution on road transport in the European Union, which was tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and which will be voted in plenary tomorrow, is an important contribution to the conclusion of these proposals. Road initiatives will contribute to the three main priorities highlighted in your draft resolution. Firstly, in relation to environmental sustainability. Road charging is one of the most prominent measures to implement the ‘user and polluter pays’ principles, which are guiding principles of the Commission to make road transport clean and sustainable. Clear price signals are essential to encourage the use of infrastructure in an efficient manner, as well as the use of clean vehicles. Among the main measures we are contemplating is an extension of the scope of the current legislation by including passenger cars, vans and buses. These vehicles are responsible for the lion’s share of pollutants and CO2 emissions as well as congestion on our roads. Adequate road charging can provide a decisive contribution to addressing them. Of course, Member States will remain free to decide whether access to any specific infrastructure must be charged for or not, but it should not be ignored that distance-based charging has clear advantages. These relate to fairness and efficiency. Distance-based charging ensures that users pay for their actual use of infrastructure, with account being taken of the relative share in pollution emitted. Distance-based charging is also a precondition for external cost charging, and this is what is requested by the motion for a resolution on road transport in the European Union. To this end, external cost charging needs to be facilitated, made simpler and made more attractive for our Member States. Secondly, in relation to technological innovation and digitalisation: for efficient road charging, Europe needs interoperability of national systems. Currently, there are many different, independent charging systems in the Union, which are complicating cross-border transport. The Commission wants to ensure that new service providers who wish to provide pan-EU services will be able to enter established markets and provide one OBE, one contract and one invoice to users. Similarly, effective enforcement of EU transport is crucial. At times when enforcement capacities in Member States are being reduced, it is especially important to have modern and efficient tools available for the controls in respect of our rules. It is also essential to improve further the cooperation between the public authorities of Member States. One good example is the optimisation of the European register for road undertakings and an IT tool which allows exchanging information between Member States. We also need to make better use of tachographs as well as e-Documents to improve enforcement. Thirdly, in relation with a fairer and deeper internal market: the road initiatives should contribute very significantly to the proper functioning of the road transport market. Status quo is clearly not an option. We are encouraged by the consensus emerging around this idea. The Commission will aim at finding truly European solutions which would combine the necessary protection of workers and at the very same time avoid the fragmentation of the internal market. One of the starting points is to fight letter-box companies. Transport undertakings could fulfil the conditions of a genuine establishment in a given Member State and carry out a genuine economic activity in that Member State. Solving this issue will contribute significantly to diminish illegal cabotage and periods when drivers are away from home. In relation to posting: Commissioner Bulc wants to be very clear. One thing is that drivers operating abroad are often in a posted situation. One cannot simply ignore the fact that road transport is by definition a highly mobile activity which requires sector-specific rules. In this context, three objectives should be borne in mind. Firstly, reducing administrative burdens for road hauliers, which in certain Member States are disproportionate. Secondly, making sure that the more efficient tools available in the sectors, such as the tachograph, are used to ensure the enforcement of the rules. And thirdly, to clarify the circumstances in which national minimum wages should apply. Another serious issue is the international nomadism of drivers. A right balance is necessary between flexibility for drivers and operators to plan international journeys on the one hand, and sufficient guarantees that enable drivers to return home on a regular basis and to have access to adequate accommodation when taking weekly rests away from home. In this context, the solution cannot be shorter rests and longer driving times. On the contrary, drivers’ working conditions and road safety should be improved rather than compromised. Finally Madam President, I would like to highlight one additional issue which I already referred to, which is the simplification of the rule on cabotage. Almost all stakeholders have told us that the current rules are too difficult to enforce and that there is a lot of illegal cabotage. These concerns are well understood, and we agree that enforcement is key in this area as well. Adapting the cabotage rules to this end does not, however, mean opening or closing national freight transport markets. Honourable Members, I have briefly outlined some of the essential considerations underpinning the preparation of the Commission’s road initiatives. I look forward to discussing the details of our forthcoming proposals when they are adopted. However, I would like to urge everyone to keep in mind the actual problems on the ground faced by our transport operators. These problems are substantial and they are real. Let us focus on the facts and try to avoid heated discussions and be prepared to enter a constructive debate. This is what Commissioner Bulc is certainly seeking.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 261, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Wim van de Camp", "mepid": "96754", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Commissioner Hogan for replacing Mrs Bulc.

Commissioner! European conservatives and reformists have always been a true single market in the European Union without protectionism, often dressed in magic words such as social dumping or referring to unproven and unconfirmed violations by market participants that cause problems. As we know, very strict laws have also been adopted in several Member States, which are already fragmenting this road haulage market. Also, as the Commissioner has just mentioned, the Commissioner's view is that these penalties are disproportionate to how it might work in a logical way. We must remember that the European Union has about 4,000 km in an east-west direction and almost as much, a little less, in a north-south direction. It is a huge area in which road transport plays a leading role in freight transport. We must be very responsible in working with this mobility package, because we can incur very significant economic and social costs in this sector and in freight transport in the European Union as a whole. As for the resolution that Parliament will adopt tomorrow, which we are debating today, I would like to say that I am relatively skeptical, because it is more about social issues, less about the economy, it is about liberalization, cabotage is not really affected, about tachographs. there is no real confirmation of the irregularities, as I said, and, in the end, the principle of setting up a new agency without knowing whether it will coincide with the principle of 'Oops, we have a problem.

We’ll have to see when we see it on 31 May, and then later on also in autumn.

In fact, we are talking about a sector that today faces three major challenges. First of all, the road contributes 20% of the greenhouse gas emissions of the European Union. This has to come down, and quickly, if we are to meet the commitments made in the context of COP21 to save the planet, the climate and humanity. For this, it is urgent that the Commission proposes, among other things, more ambitious standards in terms of CO2 emissions for all vehicles in motion. The second challenge is digitization. It should make it possible to facilitate the work of employees and cross-border mobility, but also to improve control to ensure compliance with the law. But all this cannot wait until 2034, the date proposed by the Commission to complete the equipping of the European fleet with the smart tachograph. Because the third challenge must be resolved before it is too late. The truck has become a social jungle because of the cheating organized by transport companies who use and abuse social dumping thanks to the low wages of workers from Eastern countries. It is time to affirm the principle of \"equal work, equal pay\" and to create a European road agency, a veritable gendarme whose mission will be to ensure compliance with European legislation. This unfair competition is wreaking havoc on employment, harming working conditions for employees, destroying lives, pitting European workers against each other and fueling the anger of both sides.

In the future there will be trucks that drive in platooning. In any case, everything that can come of innovation, intelligent traffic systems, can make traffic safer and also, for example, more environmentally friendly, more efficient of course anyway.

Third point: freighter. We need electronic shipping documents. If we have that, we can achieve a tremendous amount of efficiency. Another key word is the practicality of driving and rest times. There are a few things that could also be improved from the point of view of drivers. The toll, a Eurovignette.

These proposals are even more ridiculous when one considers the Dieselgate scandal, when the EU rules were not enforced and went unnoticed for years, resulting in an environmental scandal. By taking further and tighter control over the road transport sector, the EU is expanding its reach. As each new rule is implemented the Member States’ ability to manage this area is reduced, and as the rules become stricter so the economic costs increase, costs that consumers, drivers and passengers will ultimately pay.  All talk of the improving emission standards rotates around the ‘polluter pays’ principle. The tighter the rules, the higher the cost.

Taxes, levies, tolls, pollution control - all of this has its justification, especially from an environmental point of view. But we mustn't overstay. Coupling tolls and CO2 emissions is complicated. We must avoid bureaucracy and we must not punish companies twice or three times. Third, those who drive vehicles, the drivers, must not be exploited. I am very much in favor of applying the wages and social conditions of the Member State in which most of the drivers work. If that's difficult to do, sure, but the current practice is definitely exploitation. If drivers work for months in Germany or Benelux, but are paid for their work at the lowest European wages, I see it as an abuse of the European internal market.

This is because a circle of Member States is slowly emerging to introduce similarly designed unilateral measures, thus jeopardizing the functioning of the single internal market. With reference to elusive and hitherto undefined social dumping, a multi-speed Europe is being created before our eyes, in an area where it is not needed at all. The Commission can see this in the same way, as it has launched an investigation into several cases.

After all, there is a need for proposals that eliminate or prevent further fragmentation of the transport market and fully guarantee the freedom to provide freight services. This is not an easy task, and it is important that we find solutions in the interinstitutional debate on the mobility package that are viable and acceptable to all, as this is only a guarantee that the implementation of the legislation will also be complete.

The is non-refundable and subsidies contribute precisely to helping regions in this situation to catch up.Therefore, when designing cohesion policy after 2020, it is important that increasing the share of financial instruments does not lead to a reduction in the amount of grants, as this would hamper the achievement of the main objective of cohesion policy, the elimination of regional disparities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 289, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Christine Revault D’Allonnes Bonnefoy (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124287", "text": "- Mr President, today we are finally interested in the situation of 2 million workers and more than 500,000 road transport companies in Europe, which crystallizes the issues linked to social dumping and the fight against competition. unfair.

Electromobility is an important way forward if we are to have any hope of achieving this target. The electrification of transport would displace imported carbon-intensive fossil fuels and eliminate harmful air pollutant emissions in our cities and towns. There is great potential in this. The EV market share in Norway, for example, increased from 1.4% in 2011 to 17.1% in 2015, due to favourable policies. This is a blueprint for us.

A lot of investments are needed. The European Commission has allocated 70 billion of structural funds to this sector, of which 39 is earmarked for identifying strategies to limit atmospheric emissions in the transport sector and, in particular, road transport. These investments are made if there is a general framework of guarantees that guarantee a balanced market, in which the reasons of the investor are respected and the reasons of the worker are respected. A general concept within which there is no margin by exploiting the people who work, the economic pockets necessary for investments are not created by not paying people. The resolution is overall fairly balanced, but there are too many obscure points.

In this context, I would like to refer to the ongoing work on the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive. The provisions of the directive currently in force, and in particular the proposed changes, in no way take into account the specificity of the transport sector. How to calculate the salary of a driver who travels through several countries? How to determine which country is the place of habitual work and which labor law should be applied, if the employee stays in several places during one month? How to enforce the obligation to notify, appoint a contact person, and store documents in the cabin? These are matters that negatively affect the development of the transport sector, which is why many MEPs support the exclusion of the transport sector from the Posting of Workers Directive and the development of sectoral solutions that take into account the high mobility of the sector. We expect the road package, to be published by the Commission at the end of May, to provide solutions that will protect workers and allow transport companies to develop, especially as we are currently dealing with numerous disputes and controversies related to road transport.

Just to bring you up to date in relation to the business that Commissioner Bulc has been involved in over the last few hours, I can confirm that after this evening’s meeting in Brussels between the European Union and the United States that the European Union and the United States will continue to work very closely on aviation security. There is another meeting scheduled for next week, because of the great importance and urgency of the issues, to assess risks and provide practical solutions and approaches to the proposals that were put forward, particularly by the United States, which would have a very strong impact on citizens and on businesses and on people between the European Union and the United States, and indeed globally from a point of view of security. Everybody is on the same side in terms of protecting our passengers, and hopefully they can reach some practical solutions in the coming weeks. Just to take to speak about the rumours bit of business first which was mentioned by a few people regarding the road initiatives, I did state in my opening remarks on behalf of Commissioner Bulc that it is important to make clear that the rests will not be shorter and that driving time will not be longer in the proposals that would be put forward. This would compromise road safety which would not be acceptable and indeed would be completely out of tune with the Commission’s policies and Commission proposals.  In relation to other matters, I agree with most people who recognise that transport is economical, it is environmental and social in terms of all its dimensions. It is a bit like the area of responsibility that I know best: agriculture. But in any event the Commission plans, and I want to confirm this, to adopt all of the road initiatives on 31 May as part of the mobility package. I think that while some people were getting quite alarmed about possible rumours, hopefully we can put these to rest here this evening in saying that there is no need for people to be going on strike or writing to MEPs until such time that these road initiatives are adopted.  I would not encourage speculation, but some of the speakers have mentioned a number of issues to which I will refer. On cabotage, the current rules, which are based on three operations within seven days, cannot be enforced. The Commission plans to amend the current rules to make these enforceable within further opening or closing of the market for cabotage. In relation to the posting of workers, the Posting Directive applies to all economic sectors including transport, which means that drivers are posted when being abroad, but given the highly mobile nature of the road transport sector, there is a need for sector-specific rules for the road transport sector. The Commission intends to come up with these sector-specific rules as part of their own initiatives, which will lighten the administrative burden for road hauliers but guarantee workers’ rights and respect for drivers. This does not mean excluding drivers from the social rules.  In relation to rest times and rules, there are clear EU rules already on driving and rest times for drivers. For example, the daily rest time of at least 11 hours weekly, and the rest time of 45 continuous hours for the week. Some argue that these rules do not provide significant or sufficient flexibility and that they do not guarantee that drivers return to home on a regular basis. The Commission plans to modify the current rules to take these concerns into account.  Existing rules are unclear and interpreted differently across Europe about sleeping in cabins. At the moment, a few Member States prohibit drivers from taking the regular weekly rests in the cabin, while others allow it. This creates uncertainty for drivers and for hauliers. Drivers should be allowed to take some rests in their cabins if they choose to do so, but within certain limits to cater for social rights. This would be clarified also in the legal proposals of the Commission.  On the environment side, the CO2 emissions from transport are hugely significant in the overall emissions, and the limits that are expected of us now are rising from the Paris Agreement. Road transport will have to play its part. We will for the first time have the tool that is necessary for this: the VECTO tool to charge vehicles based on CO2 emissions, which would give users the incentives to purchase and use cleaner vehicles. This will be included in the road initiatives and the Eurovignette Directive.  I think Mrs Sender mentioned the phasing out of the time-based vignette, and Commisioner Bulc is indeed looking for ways to incentivise the use of distance-based systems. Such systems better reflect the ‘user pays’ and the ‘polluter pays’ principle than the time-based one and I know she is very sympathetic to your view on this. Current EU tolling systems lack interoperability, which is especially a problem for cross-border traffic. The Commission plans to put the conditions in place for new service providers to provide EU-wide tolling services. Besides better service to users, this will also reduce the cost of tolling and give the possibility for other ancillary services to be provided as well. With regard to what Commissioner Bulc has said in respect of the German road user charge for passenger cars and the inclusion of this in EU legislation, she stated clearly on 16 February during the plenary session of this parliament, that foreign drivers cannot be discriminated against. The Commission decided today to close the infringement procedure initiated in June 2015 against Germany regarding the introduction of a road charge for passenger cars. This decision follows the adoption last March of amending laws in Germany, and the Commission came to the conclusion that these laws have addressed its concerns by removing discrimination based on nationality. Of course, the Commission will now continue to monitor the correct implementation of this law, and the application of this law is very important. More fundamentally, we are also considering proposing rules that underpin non-discrimination of foreign vehicle owners as part of the road initiatives. This could include, for the first time, passenger cars, which are excluded so far.  In relation to the establishment of a European Road Transport Agency, which of course is the view of the majority of this House, this takes some time. I am not going to prejudge what Commissioner Bulc will say to you on the 31 May, but what I will say is that Member States in the meantime can continue with better enforcement regulations or rules if they wish, and they do have systems in place that they can enforce better. I think perhaps in the short term this is an area that we should look at and do more at the level of regional and national governments whilst we are waiting for the implementation of this over-arching overall agency that you wish to have. So those are just a few remarks responding to some of the concerns that have been expressed during the course of this debate. I think you will see that the Commissioner is very sympathetic and you seem to be going in the same general direction, pardon the pun, in relation to the proposals that are about to emerge in the mobility package. I am sure that this will go smoothly through with your help and support in due course.

These are clearly protectionism measures and should not be tolerated. These measures lead to risk of fragmentation of the EU internal market.

What is needed is not primarily a multi-speed Europe, but improved competitiveness and a truly single market where, in addition to capital and goods, services and labor can move freely! Thus, even more transport connections, more intensive trade in goods and even more better, cheaper services are needed so that consumers can spend more and more, creating even more new jobs. In a multi-speed EU, regional development policy (continued catching-up and convergence as a goal) would also be called into question, although its balancing function was one of the main attractions of accession, as was the single, free internal market.

July 1, 2016 marked the fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the free trade agreement between the European Union and its member states and the Republic of Korea. It is the first new generation free trade agreement concluded by the European Union. The agreement, in addition to removing tariffs, also includes rules covering the elimination of non-tariff barriers, thanks to which it creates new market access opportunities, also in the field of services and investments, and in such areas as intellectual property, public procurement and competition policy. Regulations concerning sustainable development are also a very important part of the agreement. For these reasons, this agreement became the model for all subsequent free trade agreements. Our agreement with Korea is not only a breakthrough in terms of the quality and scope of international treaties, but also tangible economic effects for both parties. An example is the fact that thanks to this agreement, inter alia, the trade deficit with Korea amounting to EUR -7.6 billion was transformed into a trade surplus of EUR 2.5 billion, while European exports to Korea increased by around 50% during this period. As a result, trade between partners last year broke the record, reaching almost EUR 90 billion. Korea has become the European Union's eighth trading partner, and the Union has become Korea's third. Similar successes are also visible in the growth of trade in services - we recorded an 11% increase - or the level of foreign direct investment - an increase in Korean investments by 35%. The European Union has become the second, after the USA, area of ​​foreign direct investment for Korea, while the EU states are the first investor in Korea in terms of the value of accumulated direct investments. Behind these exemplary figures, however, there are not only investments, but most of all new jobs, which means an increase in the welfare of citizens of both sides. These are facts that are hard to dispute. Of course, nothing is perfect in life, especially on 100%, therefore the concluded contracts must be analyzed from time to time and possibly corrected. The same will be the case here. Therefore, the report I have prepared includes provisions about the benefits and good results, but also information about the need to solve some important problems. For the Union, these include direct transport clauses and issues of repairing exported goods. For Korea, this is an investment chapter. We would also like to talk about non-tariff barriers, sanitary and phytosanitary barriers, environmental protection, intellectual property protection or the implementation by Korea of ​​the International Labor Organization conventions - this, I admit, is a big problem. Equally important, the final document also contains provisions on the need to promote the contract among small and medium-sized enterprises so that they use the contract to a much greater extent than before. Summing up, especially today, when protectionist slogans are becoming more and more popular, it is worth talking about the benefits of international cooperation in the field of trade and investment. This is clearly demonstrated by free trade agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Korea. Its effects are excellent, far better than previously predicted results for both parties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 334, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, let me thank the European Parliament, the Committee on International Trade and the rapporteur Mr Szejnfeld for the attention, the work and the commitment you put into this. As you said, it has been five years now since the EU-Korea free trade agreement entered into force, so it is very appropriate to evaluate it. We have done an external evaluation; the upcoming opinion of the Economic and Social Committee will deliver one; and together with the work you have done, this gives a good contribution to analyse the results of the first five years. This is, as the rapporteur said, an economic success story. During the first five years of the implementation, EU exports increased by 47%, or EUR 15 billion. Also, Korea increased its export, even if it was a little bit more moderate. This leads to more economic activity, more employment in the EU as well as in Korea. I fully agree with the conclusion of the report, saying that the FTA has and continues to have a positive impact on the socio-economic development of the parties. At the same time, I agree that Korea needs to do more on trade and sustainable development, particularly labour rights. To this end, we need to use all the available channels that we have to insist on the need of progress. I raised this matter with my Korean colleague when he was here just before Christmas, when we had the EU trade committee with Korea, and I have followed it up in a recent letter. In March, we also had a Committee on Trade and Sustainable Development (INTA), so Commission raised it there again. The efforts of civil society mechanisms that are established by the free trade agreement, as well as the government-to-government dialogue, have considerably raised awareness and pressure, and this is a driver for change – but it is not enough. I am fully aware of your request to open formal consultations with Korea on its commitment to freedom of association and collective bargaining. I believe that, as you know, there has just been an election in South Korea, and we should first talk about this with the new minister and the new government as soon as they are in place. Hopefully they will take a forthcoming position on this. Once we know what the new government thinks, we can reflect together on the most appropriate way to ensure better implementation of the trade and sustainable development chapter of this agreement. This would be a matter of priority with a new government, already inviting, as soon as there is a government; I hear this will happen in June, and then I will go to Seoul in September for a Trade Committee meeting that is already planned. There are also a number of items that we would like to address by an amendment to trade agreement: direct transport, repaired goods, truck tractors, and Korea, from their point of view, are interested in including an investment protection chapter. But the country has been hesitant when it comes to the investment quota system, so this makes rapid progress on an amendment package unlikely. In many other areas the implementation runs smoothly, but as you mention, further work needs to be done when it comes to sanitary, phytosanitary issues as well as intellectual property rights. The same applies to the adoption of new geographical indications and the further facilitation of customs procedures. All these issues are being addressed with our Korean counterparts in the different committees and working groups that have been established in the free trade agreement (there are in fact 15 of these groups). In addition, we have indicated to Korea that we will look at legal means if necessary if we do not see progress on these issues. The INTA Committee was informed about this in a report very recently. As I said, the next trade committee is planned for the end of September in Seoul, where I will attend.

We have managed to turn a negative trade balance into a trade surplus of around five billion euros.

The free trade agreement between the Republic of Korea and the European Union has been in force for almost six years. Economically, this agreement is certainly a success. The volume of trade has increased significantly over the past six years. The EU's previously existing trade deficit has been turned into a surplus in these years, and the interdependence of the two economic areas has increased overall. I think that is a very good thing, given the current threats of indiscriminate protectionism. However, we must also note that there are significant implementation deficits. The sustainability chapter in particular is being implemented very slowly by Korea. The obligation to ratify the ILO core labor standards has not yet been met. Union rights are ignored and union leaders are arbitrarily arrested in connection with demonstrations. For us Social Democrats, that is unacceptable. We have always said: For us, trade is not just an economic question. Trade without the observance of basic workers' rights cannot be accepted over the long term. Trade policy must also serve to anchor fundamental sustainability goals and fundamental workers' rights worldwide. We are in favor of free trade, but free trade needs a reliable framework and is not an end in itself, but must make a contribution to the implementation of sustainable development goals. We therefore expect the Korean government to finally tackle the implementation of the sustainability chapter decisively. We also have great hopes for the new Korean President Moon, who used to be an advocate for human rights. However, we also call on the Commission to press more vigorously than before to ensure that basic trade union rights are respected. The The Korean government's violation of union rights must be the subject of the dispute settlement mechanism provided in the trade agreement.How vigorously the Commission will proceed here is for us also a question of its political credibility, because sustainability goals can not only be propagated, but one must also try to enforce them more effectively.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 337, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Joachim Starbatty", "mepid": "124827", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. -  Mister President! The figures show that the fearful rabbits among the Greens, the left and the right have not found confirmation. It is interesting now why the deficit in Korea has turned into a surplus for the Europeans. The reason for this is that the won has appreciated by 20% against the euro. One could ask: Isn't that a disadvantage for Korea? No, just the opposite! Because if we look at the structure of trade, we see that 30% of goods are equipment goods, 20% are means of transport, 12% are chemical products. So that strengthens the efficiency of Korea. As for us: Because of this devaluation of 20%, we are now selling our products 20% cheaper and we also buy Korean products 20% more expensive. This devaluation was a change in the terms of trade to the detriment of Europe. We kind of give away products, but Koreans use it to build their economy, and we buy Korean products too dearly.

With the election of human rights lawyer and dialogue advocate Moon Jae-in, the Korean people have clearly spoken out in favor of an end to the saber rattling. So, congratulations, President Moon! The second major motive for voting was to revive the Korean economy and create good jobs. And here we have to admit that with the EU-Korea Agreement, the trade balance has developed to the disadvantage of Korea. The deficit has been reversed. With a view to our claim - to fair trade - a partnership should not run like this. The protests against the poor economic development have been suppressed dramatically by the previous governments. Trade unionists, human rights activists and journalists ended up in jail. The ILO core labor standards have still not been ratified. Attempts at discussions by the Commission - which I acknowledge - on the basis of the sustainability chapter of the agreement were ineffective.

The judgment of the ECJ will now also give us new possibilities, so that the competencies are clearly regulated here. For the European Parliament in particular, it represents an upgrade because we can safely go into the future with it.

I have listened very carefully to your comments here and I think we share in the assessment that, economically, this been a very good, successful agreement. It has created job possibilities, growth and increased trade, and it has been good both for Korea and for us. This is absolutely something that we should use as a model.  Even further, we have spoken to Member States and I think there is even more potential for using this trade agreement, especially by small or medium-sized companies. We must see how we can help Member States to reach out to small and medium-sized companies, to tell them about the possibilities so that they also dare to invest and to engage in this.  However, and I do not think there is any disagreement here in this House, or in the Commission either, there are some problems. There are some problems related to the trade agreement when it comes to phytosanitary matters, for instance, some technical problems and some customs problems that we are trying to address.

There are indications that this is the case and as soon as there is a minister I will liaise with him or her, and see how we can move forward on this issue.

We are all still appalled by what happened in the accident in Rana Plaza in Bangladesh and many other accidents in Bangladesh, where people who produce textiles for us are putting their lives and their integrity at risk. That is why it was right and necessary that we acted together after the Rana Plaza disaster and launched the Sustainablility Compact, also accompanied by the Accord agreement, so that it is ensured that there are improvements in working conditions in Bangladesh. Tomorrow is the third follow-up meeting on the Compact and I hope it will be a success. But it can only be a success if a clear agreement is reached about how to proceed, and that is one of the reasons why we are here today. Without a doubt, there has been progress with the Compact. We have seen a change in the labor code. New unions have been formed. I believe that especially in view of the question of wages and working conditions, the question of the possibilities of collective bargaining is of course crucial in order to achieve improvements. We have seen an increase in the minimum wage, and thanks to the Accord, we have also achieved inspections and improvements in building security in 1,700 factories, including with regard to the fire problem. So there we have taken steps. Of course, the international labor organization admonishes us to see here too that there are still major shortcomings. Thankfully, the Commission made this very clear in a letter. In this respect, it cannot be, in my opinion, that on the one hand Bangladesh uses the possibilities of the tariff preferences of the LDC very skilfully - they have also had growth rates of 6.6% in the last three years - but on the other hand the obligations that indeed not fulfilled by our GSP system with regard to the recognition of employee rights. In the resolution on the textile industry in the last plenary session, we once again made it very clear that we also expect that we can create more binding rules here for compliance with sustainability criteria or due diligence, in accordance with the OECD guidelines, and that our system of preferences will also change oriented more towards the question of compliance with employee rights. We have to reflect on that too if there is no progress. It cannot be that we tolerate everything within the framework of LDCs. Ultimately, Parliament must then also draw conclusions. In this respect, there are a few problem areas: What about employee rights in the special export zones? There is now a movement that the government is apparently reconsidering the legislation, but we need clarity that there cannot be two classes of labor law. We must also deal with the difficulties of registering trade unions and also the issue of work in factories and recognition. And of course the repression that has happened against trade unionists and others in Bangladesh is not acceptable. So our question is indeed: How can we improve the implementation? How can we ensure that the ILO comments are implemented? And I also believe that we need to extend the Accord beyond May 2018 because the work is not yet done. So our questions to the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 358, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for putting this question on the agenda and thank you for your support for the Compact and your concerns for Bangladesh.  As you know, the Commission is fully committed to addressing respect for international labour standards, also in EU trade policy. We can use different instruments to do that, we have our trade and investment agreements, we have the GSP, we have specific partnerships, we have different works and we have this Compact.  I do share your concerns when it comes to labour rights and the lack of respect for them in Bangladesh. The International Labour Organization included a special paragraph on Bangladesh in its report last year on freedom of association and collective bargaining, and this is a serious warning. I also welcome that Members from this House have visited Bangladesh; the message that you passed on is very powerful and it pushes and puts the issue on the agenda. It has also created awareness, which is very important, and it is contributing to some movement by the Bangladeshi Government. I also share the goal, of course, that the Bangladeshi Government fully respect workers’ fundamental rights.  Turning to the specific questions raise here by Mr Lange and others. There have been some positive signals from Bangladesh on the labour front. They include, for instance, the Tripartite Agreement of February and the fact that the draft export processing zones law, which was not in line with the ILO Convention, has been taken back. That is a positive signal. This Tripartite Coordination Council is a platform for dialogue between social partners. It seems to have been tasked to review the whole labour law and that is also a positive signal. We should welcome this and recognise it.  At the same time, there are still questions about the prolongation of the accords mandate. There seems to be a general acceptance that we need to continue the work beyond 2018 in one form or another, but this of course is not enough. We need to have more and continuous improvement, and significant work is still needed.  What we will do tomorrow, as Mr Lange referred to, is the follow-up meeting of the High—Level Sustainability Compact Group. It will provide an opportunity to take stock of where we are and how we see future prospects. We have made it very clear to the Bangladeshi authorities that we expect them to take urgent progress on respect for labour rights. This cannot happen overnight, but there needs to be a strategy that is clear and transparent and with time bounds. This strategy needs to address freedom of association and collective bargaining. It should be a priority to have speedy and efficient trade unions registrations, as well as making sure that there is investigation and prosecutions of all acts of discrimination and violence against trade unionists. At the same time, we should foresee to revise the Bangladesh Labour Act and the law on the export processing zones in line with ILO conventions. Furthermore, the strategy should facilitate private sector investor initiatives so that they can be more involved, as in the accord.  In addition to ensuring the accord mandate and that it can be reviewed and renewed, we are also looking for ways to facilitate and to support dialogue among brands and their suppliers on responsible business conduct. We are exploring the possibility to organise technical workshops in cooperation with the OECD on garment due diligence guidance, with specific focus on purchasing practices. We will have to rely primarily on international bodies such as the ILO which are specialised in this matter to assess the actions of the Bangladeshi Government. The Compact remains a very important framework for engaging with Bangladesh, together with the other international partners on labour rights. If sufficient progress is not registered within a reasonable timeframe, the Commission will need to see what other actions it can take. We have tools we can use such as the GSP Regulation, and as you know the GSP Regulation in fact foresees temporary withdrawal of trade preferences in case of serious and systematic violation of human and labour rights. So that is a tool that we have, but I hope that that we do not have to use it and that we will see progress in Bangladesh. I hope that the meeting tomorrow will bring some advancement, but we will have to monitor this very, very closely.

This sustainability pact was signed in 2013, following the tragic accident that occurred at Rana Plaza in April of that same year.

Dear Commissioner, I would like to ask you, and through the whole Commission, with the certainty that you will do so, that you do not lose heart in the work you are doing jointly with the Government of Bangladesh and the international organizations involved. I also ask that, when there is some relaxation in compliance with what has been previously agreed, put more pressure on the competent authorities to ensure that this commitment is fulfilled. We believe that international institutions, in particular the ILO, but also the private sector, should continue their work in improving the general conditions of workers in this country and the truth, and thankfully, is that there are many people vigilant about this achievement on the ground measures contained in this pact.

It is therefore necessary to amend the labor law to include expressions freedoms of association and collective bargaining, which are contained in the ILO conventions.A serious and respectful rule of law is also needed.For this reason, we ask the Government of Bangladesh to fight corruption, to prevent arbitrary arrests, and we also call for possible investigations or impartial trials by its police and judicial authorities.I conclude, just by calling attention to the need for the laws that regulate the so-called industrial free zones for export to comply with accepted international standards and for all alleged abuses reported against union members to be properly investigated.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 360, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Agnes Jongerius", "mepid": "125021", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, it is now four years since the Sustainability Compact was launched and we have to face the fact that Bangladeshi labour conditions are still quite bad and in some cases, for instance on trade union rights, are even deteriorating.

We have played our role in helping development, making sure that some of the most disadvantaged people in Bangladeshi society today find themselves in a situation where they can earn an honest living with pride, and this is something which this House really has invested in greatly.  When one looks at the tremendous achievements that have been made, then one has to look at where we are today. It is quite clear to me that Bangladesh, the Government of Bangladesh, is either not listening, or choosing not to listen, or it is not understanding what we are saying. That is why I intend simply to pass on a very clear message today. It is not to deal with the details, as the Commission is dealing with that, but it is simply to say to Bangladesh that we do not want to see a situation where, from the clutches of victory and tremendous achievement, you deliver a negative result.

Fortunately, the agreement between Bangladesh and the European Union, as well as the United States and the International Labor Organization, improved the situation to some extent. Amendments were made to the Bangladeshi Labor Act of 2006, and over 2,500 workplaces were inspected. It is important to know that 32 factories were closed, over 300 trade unions were registered, employment in labor inspection institutions was increased, but also in the fire service, civil protection and development authorities. These are all very good, positive effects of the action of the European Union, but also the effects of the concluded agreement. Importantly, the companies themselves also got involved, and this is fundamental. Of course, the repair process is not complete. The repair process must be continued and it will not be easy. But you also have to remember that the jobs that companies provide in countries such as Bangladesh save millions, and tens of millions of people worldwide.

This kept coming up time and time again in Bangladesh. It is in no one’s interests to withdraw trade access from Bangladesh, only to see business move to countries where conditions are equally bad or even worse than in Bangladesh. So what reassurances can you give us about the Commission’s future trade agreements with other countries, that they will be similarly tough in making sure people comply with ILO standards and other human rights obligations?

This is indeed an extremely important issue. I would like to thank you for your strong engagement. We share your goals and we will work as hard as possible in our engagement with the Bangladeshi Government because we of course want decent working conditions there. As many of you have said, the Compact is actually something quite unique. It has not only raised awareness, but has engaged countries, companies and civil society, and has led to some improvements – not enough, but some improvements. European and other companies that did not really engage in this have started to engage and to work with corporate social responsibility. They are working with regard to inspections, improving rights and making sure that what they produce and then sell is sustainable. This has led to a lot of improvement, but – as you all pointed out – it is far from enough. The Bangladeshi Government needs to do so much more. It is true that there have been a few positive signals, but not enough. There will be a meeting tomorrow. Let us be fair and listen to our Bangladeshi partners; let us see what they are planning and whether they have the strategy that we have asked for. Let us discuss this in friendship and openness with them. We have said before – and I reiterate it again – that there are measures that we can take if we see that no progress is being made, or even that the situation is deteriorating. We are ready to take them, but we cannot threaten that today, before the meeting. The meeting is tomorrow. Let us give it a chance. We have other means as well.  We have made it extremely clear to them that the four ILO recommendations, namely: to amend the Labour Act in order to bring it into compliance with ILO conventions; secondly, to ensure that the law on export processing zones allows for full freedom of association; to make sure that all acts of anti-trade union discrimination are investigated and prosecuted at a later stage; and to ensure that applications for trade union registrations are acted upon as quickly as possible and not denied unless there are really objective grounds for doing so. These are the four most urgent recommendations and we fully support ILO in their work there. When it comes to due diligence, such as with the conflict mineral agreement that we have – which we should be extremely proud of – it is more complicated with the garment sector. We are working very closely, not only with the ILO but also on the OECD, to develop the due diligence guidelines for this sector. So the priority now, on a short—term basis, is to make them materialise and to make sure that they work in practice. Garment supply chains are fragmented and complex. There is a lot of diversity and a number of actors all across the world, so doing this will be extremely complicated. We already have legislation on corporate social responsibility and responsible business conduct. We also have the non—financial disclosure directive for some large EU companies, which also apply to the garment sector. We are working with ILO and looking at what we can do with other partners in the region to support change, to train them, to encourage them, and to organise meetings in order to connect the different actors in the region. So technically and politically, there is outreach and engagement.  This has led to some results. We will continue to do this. I look forward, in close cooperation with you, to continue to see how we can jointly apply pressure and make sure that there is improvement for the workers, the labour organisations and, ultimately, the people. Most of them in this area are, of course, young women and girls. They still need us to be there and to continue this fight for them. Thank you for your engagement. I am sure we will come back to this issue before very long.

Commissioner Hogan, nice to see you here in plenary. This is always a pleasure for me. Tonight we are talking about relations with Norway, and there we have two threads that we have to discuss: One is Norway's decision to apply ad valorem tariffs of 200 to 400% on cheese, lamb and beef to raise. They did that back in 2013, and since then we have been calling for something to be done. We made this very clear in a resolution by Parliament on July 4, 2013, but nothing has happened yet. In this respect, the second strand, which we are also discussing tonight - Mr Borrelli is here as rapporteur - namely financial relations, the financial mechanism from 2014 to 2021 and a Fish Protocol, is on the agenda, although we are dealing with the first strand have not yet resolved. And of course that started some reflection processes in us. How can it be that on the one hand we have a conflict and on the other hand we conclude an agreement where we work very closely together? And therefore the question: what will the Commission and the External Action Service actually do to finally find a solution? We find it really difficult to give consent to the financial mechanisms if the customs issue has not been resolved beforehand. Hence the second question: What specific expectations and measures are there to find a solution, quasi in the context of the financial mechanisms, and are the Commission and the External Action Service really convinced that different negotiations can actually lead to success? That is the substantive story where we in the Committee on Trade, as the committee responsible, got a little brooding, Commissioner Hogan. And we also have a second thing, it's more about the formal work: we negotiate especially with the Commission and the Council on an interinstitutional agreement that is intended to ensure that the provisions of the Treaty, that Parliament is fully informed in the same way as the Council, are also implemented, and that there can be no provisional application of an agreement before that European Parliament has not decided. And that does not seem to us to be guaranteed with the Norway Agreement with regard to the financial mechanism and the fisheries agreement. That is why we have also said here: Do we really want to give consent now if this obligation, which in our opinion clearly arises from the contract, is not met? There are now signs that there is an improvement, and of course we do not want to hold Norway virtually liable for a case for which the Commission and the Council are responsible. But we have to address the problem. We must ensure that Parliament and the Council are given equal information and that there is no provisional application of agreements of any kind before the European Parliament, as the democratically elected body of the European Union, has given its approval.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 375, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "David Borrelli", "mepid": "124796", "text": "speaker. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, of course, as you rightly pointed out, will only deal with the question of the agreement. Of course, I totally agree with what has just been said on the question of tariffs, but I will concentrate much more on the question of the agreement. This is an agreement on the European Economic Area, known as the EEA Agreement, of 1994, which allows the participation in the single market of Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein, members of the EFTA. The EFTA countries have contributed since 1994 to reducing economic and social disparities within the EEA through a dedicated financial mechanism, complemented by a further contribution from Norway. These financial mechanisms, which expired in 2014, need to be renewed as well as the protocols concerning the fish trade. Today, therefore, at this stage we are examining four acts, or two agreements relating to financial mechanisms, one between the EU and Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, and one between Norway and the European Union, and two protocols on fisheries, one between the EU and Norway and the other between the EU and Iceland. These agreements will jointly provide a financial contribution for economic and social cohesion of the EEA amounting to 2.8 billion euros in the period from 2014 to 2021. This framework, which has so far been beneficial for the European Union, must be included in a political reflection broader than our EU-EFTA relations. There are no particular problems with Liechtenstein and Iceland, indeed with Iceland we will soon start discussing new agricultural agreements with Iceland in the INTA commission and here we will have to pay attention to the fact that Iceland still has a free trade agreement with China. , so we want to emphasize this aspect too. With Norway, as has rightly been said a moment ago, the issue is more sensitive due to some duties imposed on European meats and cheeses. This practice definitely has slowed down the process of the dossier and also gave rise to the oral question that is under discussion today, presented by the president. Political and economic relations between the EU and Norway have always been pretty good, but the issue of tariffs in recent years has been a vulnus in our trade relations, as has rightly been said. Norway is the fifth trading partner of the European Union in terms of imports and the seventh destination for the European Union in terms of exports. Strengthening our trade relations with Norway is obviously important, but these developments must take place in full compliance with the objectives of the EEA Agreement. We know that negotiations are underway between the EU and Norway for some liberalization of trade in agricultural products; these are favorable news which, however, should be accompanied by the quick removal of the duties that have been imposed for years. This removal must be a priority for both parties and thus contribute to strengthening commercial relations which are, fortunately, already strong. The European Union exports 4.1 billion euros of agricultural products to Norway and imports 488 million euros. Equally important is the import of fish products, which amounts to 5.6 billion euros. I therefore close by thanking my colleagues for the work done in the International Trade Committee and the colleagues who will now speak for their ideas, hoping that here too we can count on a broad consensus for this agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 376, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, I am here, of course, as you realise, on behalf of High Representative Mogherini, but also on behalf of Ms Mogherini and myself I wish to welcome the opportunity to contribute to this joint debate on the European Union-Norway Agreement. I am pleased to share with you our views on the agreement itself between the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway on the EEA Financial Mechanism 2014-2021 and the increase of Norwegian duties on agricultural products, which has been mentioned by both speakers. The Financial Mechanisms have played an important role in reducing social and economic disparities in the European Economic Area since the entry into force of the EEA Agreement in 1994. In addition, as of 2004, Norway has set up a complementary bilateral financial mechanism as well. But I would like to acknowledge the positive recommendation of the rapporteur, Mr Borrelli, to the plenary, in order to give its consent to the conclusion of the relevant agreements and protocols. In view of the continued need to alleviate economic and social disparities within the EEA, in particular after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the EEAS and the Commission received an ambitious negotiating mandate in January 2014 not only to renew the EEA-Norway grants, but to substantially increase them. The EEA and Norway Financial Mechanism agreements were signed on 3 May 2016 and have been provisionally applied as of July and August of 2016. These grants will provide a financial contribution by the EEA EFTA states of EUR 2.8 billion for a seven-year period 2014 to 2021, which is an increase of 11.2%. This includes a special allocation of EUR 100 million for promoting regional cooperation in order to fight youth unemployment. The European Union cohesion key will be used for the distribution of the financial allocations of both EEA and Norway grants. The Commission will have a stronger role in strategic planning by promoting complementarity and synergies with EU Cohesion Policy. The agreements on the EEA and Norway grants have been complemented by two other separate bilateral agreements with Norway and Iceland. Their aim is to renew existing preferential trade access to EU markets for their fish and fishery products. These concessions were in place in the period 2009-2014 and have now been renewed with a modest improvement in trade access. Furthermore, Norway has agreed to continue allowing for free transit of fish and fishery products landed in Norway from vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the European Union. The outcome of these negotiations and the provisional applications of these agreements were commended by all Member States, notably in the December 2016 Council Conclusions on the extended single market. The successful outcome of these negotiations would not have been possible without the tireless political support and interest by the Members of this House. You have regularly used the joint EEA Norway and Iceland parliamentary committees to call for an immediate and successful conclusion of these negotiations. Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway are part of our European continent and we share the same space, but also the same principled interest: to make growth in Europe more inclusive and sustainable. We have a responsibility to work together with our neighbours, strengthening a spirit of European solidarity and cooperation beyond the borders of our Union. So I want to thank you Members for raising the issue of the increase of Norwegian duties on agricultural products, and for the very keen interest which this House has shown in it, as evidenced by the resolution that has been adopted. In order to reflect your concerns, I want to assure you and reassure you that the Commission and the EEAS have done all they can to address the situation following the changes in Norwegian duties on certain cheeses, on lamb and beef products, from 1 January 2013. The issue has been raised at a number of high-level meetings, including at the highest political level. In fact, in 2015 the Commission requested the Norwegian authorities to include this issue in the EU-Norway agricultural trade liberalisation negotiations. These negotiations were concluded just five weeks ago, on 5 April 2017. Under the negotiated agreement, the Norwegian authorities will grant the European Union tariff-free quotas to compensate for the effects of the duty switch. The Commission is convinced that the deal we reached is beneficial to the European Union and that Norway provided sufficient compensation for the effects of the duty switch. The exact size of the compensation was detailed in the information paper that was sent to you, Mr Lange, and your committee at the beginning of April. The Agreement will formally be submitted to the European Parliament for your consent at a later stage, which I hope can be forthcoming. With that consent, the Council can then formally conclude the negotiations (it cannot do so before that) in order to allow the Agreement to come into force. As with Norway, another additional protocol was negotiated for fisheries originating in Iceland. Both EEA partners have made conditional their contribution of funds to the last three EEA Financial Mechanisms, upon obtaining temporary fish trade concessions. No other trade concessions or considerations, such as the improved market access for agricultural products or for the solving of the pending trade irritants, have to date been linked with the Financial Mechanism negotiations.

You are putting us in the position, in the current political circumstances, where we are speaking about the irrelevance of Parliament and, at the same time, you are trying to drive us into a discussion where you are presenting – this evening too – everything that has already been mentioned in the explanatory statement. We already knew all that!  Secondly, I think the pattern that we see here can also be seen in the passivity of the Commission regarding activities in the Arctic area and in the Commission office responsible for international affairs. We also see that in cases where we need to defend, for instance, our fishermen, who have already been arrested for half a year in Norwegian ports. So in this regard, we really would like to see in future a much more proactive and cooperative role from the Commission side, otherwise it will be very difficult for us to cooperate.  It has nothing to do with Norway, in this case. It is to do with you not responding in a timely fashion, and not defending in a timely fashion the interests which we are asking you to defend.

These agreements will provide, as mentioned above, a total contribution of 2.8 billion euros to the European Union for the period 2014-2021, with an increase of 11.3 per cent compared to the previous period. The funds will be directed towards those areas of the European Union where social and economic disparities clearly persist, with the aim of strengthening economic and social cohesion, always favoring a better functioning of the single market, to which Iceland, the Liechtenstein and Norway participate fully. Among the priority areas of investment, I would like to highlight that relating to youth employment and that relating to justice and home affairs, which therefore includes strategic sectors such as asylum and migration. It should also be emphasized that compared to the previous period these resources can also be assigned to those countries that in 2013 had a youth unemployment rate higher than 25 per cent. With respect to the question raised by the oral question, it will be crucial to find a quick solution as the imposition of increased duties by Norway on certain European products clearly violates the spirit and letter of this agreement. Finally, allow me a consideration, President. In post-Brexit debates there has been a lot of talk about the possibility for the UK to adopt the Norwegian model of participation in the European Union. We agree, contributing financially to the European Union and accepting its four fundamental freedoms are sufficient criteria to open the doors to our single market, as is the case with Norway and other countries, but it does not seem that this is the path that the British government wants to take and they will soon realize that, as our dear colleague said in the aftermath of the referendum, the best possible agreement for the United Kingdom is the one we already have.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 379, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Czesław Hoc", "mepid": "135540", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group.- Mr Chairman!The protocol on trade in fish and fishery products, as well as the Norwegian Financial Mechanism, are very important and necessary for European Union countries, including Poland as a country that is the largest importer of raw fish from Norway in the European Union.Therefore, measures to facilitate the flow of goods from Norway to the European Union as well as increasing duty-free tariff quotas are welcomed.Poland supports efforts that contribute to the elimination of barriers and thus ensure easier flow of fish products from Norway to the markets of the European Union countries.In addition, under the Norwegian financial mechanisms, we hope to establish closer and measurable cooperation in the field of scientific research in the field of fisheries management.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 380, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Jasenko Selimovic", "mepid": "134243", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating Norwegians on their National Day: ‘Gratulerer med dagen, Norge’. But, when it comes to the topic ‘liberalisation of trade’ there is no reason for congratulations. The EEA Agreement was signed in 1994. Since then, talks on liberalisation of trade in agricultural products have been slow and with no genuine engagement by the Norwegian side. On the contrary, during these talks, in 2013 Norway drastically increased import duties for EU products – 280% on cheese, 430% on sheep meat, and 350% on beef. So if you buy a hot dog – a lamb sausage – in Oslo, it will cost you about EUR 2, but if the lamb comes from the EU, it will cost you EUR 10, five times more. On top of that, there is a new import duty of 70% on hortensia flowers from the EU. Seventy! Do not even think of buying flowers for your girlfriend if she is Norwegian. Love has a very high price in Norway. I have to say to my fellow Norwegians, that if you respect your commitments and decrease import duties, I can promise you that the world will not go under. The sun will still rise in the morning. The lakes will be fresh and clean – era fjorder underbara – and you will still be able to eat your brunost since we have do not have any intention of buying it, whatever the price might be. If you do not care about us as a partner, please care about your citizens, who already pay some of the highest food prices in the world. Do not make it even more expensive.

We should recognize consideration for market access and contributions in the now updated agreement, which are regulated there.

The EEA Council has just confirmed that further liberalization of agricultural trade remains the goal. So everyone seems to agree and there is no problem.

In the UK, the Remain camp are obsessed with access to the single market. This is significant because this report talks about the entry fee that Norway must pay for such access. Clegg, Blair, Mandelson and other Europhiles tell us that the single market is so important that any price is worth paying to get into it. So what happens in Norway? They have been the lucky recipients of 12 000 directives and regulations. Some of these are exceeding the authority of the original agreement. A recent 56-page report by Nei til EU has found that the cost to Norway of this agreement has risen tenfold since 1992. It now costs them GBP 650 million a year for their five million people. In Norway, the polling company Sentio has found that 47% of Norwegians want a referendum on this agreement against 20% who do not.

We are actually discussing two things today: One is an agreement that the European institutions have negotiated with Norway. We don't like some of the content. I can understand then that the Norwegian government has come very close to its limits, which it could approach, given the fact that it is a minority government. But I am convinced that the European Commission and the European External Action Service have completely neglected to involve us in Parliament closely in negotiating this agreement, to take us on board and also to point out the limits to the Norwegians, whom we as Parliament regularly address to have. What annoys me most is that we have a clear agreement between the European Parliament and our Foreign Trade Commissioner that no trade agreement can be put into effect on a provisional basis until the European Parliament has given its opinion. We don't have that sort of thing with the European External Action Service, and we don't have that sort of thing with the other Commissioners, but that this agreement is being applied provisionally, and a large part of this agreement is external trade agreements. To put it bluntly, it is insolence and unreasonableness what the European External Action Service and High Representative Mogherini expect us to do here. And I call on the Commission and call on the European External Action Service: for all future agreements, we expect that we can vote in good time, we expect that there will be no provisional application, and I can only call on them to really take that into account. The second: what Norway is doing is also not in the sense of the agreement. Massively increasing tariffs, imposing trade barriers on us, all of this without prior consultation - this must also be said to the Norwegians very clearly. The colleague Scholz is right, they make it formal nothing illegal, but that is not amicable, that is not announced, that is not voted on.Here, too, I can very well understand that many affected farmers, many affected entrepreneurs and, above all, many affected citizens in our Member States are annoyed about this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 385, "date": "2017-05-17.json", "name": "Eric Andrieu (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "113892", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, four years ago - and it has been said - Norway unilaterally decided to increase its tariffs on certain European agricultural products such as cheese or lamb meat and beef, which is contrary to the spirit of our agreement with this country.

It is clear that Norway has kept its tariffs as they are. Four years after the introduction of these measures, I ask the Commission to communicate to us precisely, for each of the Member States, their consequences for European farmers. Moreover, failing today to have Norway come back on this decision, the Commission must at least make a firm commitment to protect our producers from this harmful situation and ensure that the losses suffered by our farmers are fully covered. compensated.

As you know, Norway raised tariffs massively on cheese, lamb, steak and certain flowers.

It was an act directly against the spirit of Article 19 of the EEA Agreement. It was a unilateral protectionist move on the part of Norway.

Margaret Thatcher once called the European Parliament a Mickey Mouse Parliament. As guardian of the Treaty, the Commission has treated the European Parliament like a Mickey Mouse Parliament.

A misunderstanding did happen, and it should not have happened. The interinstitutional discussions that are ongoing at the moment will hopefully ensure that this will not happen in the future. I acknowledge the criticism of the Commission that a number of speakers have made and we will try to make sure that there is no repeat of that.  With regard to the specific issue that Mr Pabriks mentioned in relation to a territorial dispute which emerged in relation to a Latvian vessel which was brought into port in northern Norway, this matter is very much part of the discussions that the Commission has been having with Norway over the last couple of months. Discussions are ongoing to try and resolve it on an amicable basis. We want to assure Mr Pabriks that our efforts are continuing to find a mutually acceptable solution.  Norway did unilaterally raise tariffs in an unacceptable fashion, and I agree with all the speakers’ sentiments on that. This is why the European Union intervened and, whilst we did not get a reversal of the tariff lines that were actually increased, we did get compensation in other areas and the best possible deal that we could get at this time. I am sure there will be other occasions where we will have to negotiate with Norway again and we can improve on this. The compensation that we received will be provided directly as a part of the additional quota that Norway grants for particular products. The negotiators in the Commission have estimated that the monetary value of the compensation required from the Norwegian authorities for these measures is EUR 9.8 million in terms of loss of duty, and EUR 5.3 million in terms of trade value. If we deduct these sums from the value of the tariff rate quotas (TRQs) that Norway will now open for the European Union, the remaining value of the Norwegian TRQ concessions will still be higher than the value of the quota concessions for the EU. So I hope that this is seen as a step in the right direction, and that the European Union acted on your behalf against this unilateral decision by the Norwegians to increase tariffs. We got compensation in a particular way and I am sure that in the future we will be able to revisit some of these issues when Norway will be looking for some nice gesture or some particular issues to be resolved by the European Union. It is unfinished business.  I reject the notion, though, that the Commission are passive in relation to trade negotiations generally, because I think Mrs Malmström, as Commissioner for Trade, has done all that she possibly can to be as transparent as possible in the context of negotiations with all countries around the world. I expect that she will continue to do that. She has been more transparent in trade matters than any previous Commissioner, in my view, but I have to bow to your superior knowledge in these matters. I was not a Commissioner before now, but I see that she is trying to keep all institutions fully informed.

We continue to make representations on your behalf, and others, in relation to reversing this decision as well. I know you did not specifically mention it, but I know it to be very firmly on your mind, and I want to assure you that we are not neglecting our duties in terms of continuing to make representations on your behalf in relation to this.  I would like to conclude by saying to Mr Andrieu that as far as I am concerned, as Commissioner for Agriculture, I will continue to find open markets and new markets for EU products anywhere we can around the world, from a competitive agricultural industry. I do not agree with Mr Andrieu that trade is bad in agriculture for our farmers, for our businesses and agribusiness. We have now a record level of exports of agricultural products right around the world and we hope we will be able to build on that. This is genuinely creating a lot of jobs in rural areas that would not otherwise be there and also contributing a lot to the economic surpluses of many of our Member States.
