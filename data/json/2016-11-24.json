I would, of course, like to welcome Mr Timmermans, the Vice-President of the Commission, who also contributes with his activity to tackling maladministration in the context of the operation not only of the Commission but of the European Union as a whole. Allow me to thank the shadow rapporteurs, who, through their intervention, contributed to drafted this report. I would also like to thank the members of the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions for the effort they have made. I think that the procedure we are discussing today is a very important one. It is a process of democratic accountability, a process in which we will listen and be able to judge the activity of the European Ombudsman. The institution of the European Ombudsman is very important, it started in 1996 - if I am not mistaken - and this institution is appointed by the European Parliament itself. Let me point out that the main element concerning the activity of the European Ombudsman comes from Article 24 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which states that citizens have the right to report cases and instances of maladministration to the European Ombudsman. By “maladministration” we mean poor and inadequate administration, an administration that violates the law, violates human rights, violates the principles of good administration, including transparency and conflict of interest. We have, therefore, raised a number of issues in our report which we need to look at. First of all, how does the Ombudsman deal with a conflict of interest or a possible conflict of interest in the context of the The European Central Bank, because the European Central Bank, as you know, participates in the troika, while at the same time being a lender to the Member States, is a banking supervisory authority and is an independent monetary authority. How does it reconcile all these roles and under what conditions do we control transparency in the decision-making process? The same applies to the Eurogroup, which is an informal but meaningful instrument, as it makes important decisions that affect the social and economic life of European citizens. Questions are also asked about ESM, the institution which gives loans to the Member States, but also imposes memoranda. This grey area, therefore, must be tackled, and I think that the remarks we make in the report raise these issues. We come to the activities of the Commission itself, which really checks on the way in which it has handled the issue of TTIP negotiation. There have been criticism from the citizens, there has been an intervention by the European Ombudsman for more transparency, and I think that the way in which the Commission subsequently provided information on this important issue has paved the way for substantive discussions and remarks. Another important issue that we have discussed is: what are the limits of the Commission's operation when it acts as guardian of the Treaties? Is it obliged to refer all Member States or does it retain any discretion? At the same time in our report we also refer to the way in which the European Citizens' Initiative should work, what are the rights of people with disabilities, what is the operation and control of Frontex, what we do in the case of “revolving doors”, under what conditions and The conditions are controlled by former Commissioners who have taken up positions in other organisations, the main thing being Mr Barosso, who has taken up an important position in Goldman Sachs. These are the key issues that we have raised in our report, Mr President, and I look forward to the comments of my fellow Members, to make my concluding speech and to conclude a debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Emily O’Reilly", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Ombudsman. – Mr President, good morning and thank you Mr Marias and all the shadow rapporteurs for your work on this report. The text before the Chamber today expresses strong support for the work of the Office of the European Ombudsman, for which I am profoundly grateful. I would like to thank in particular the Committee on Petitions, and its Chair, Ms Wikström, for its engaged cooperation and support over this past year. In our separate but complementary roles, we work directly with European citizens who seek our help. Honourable Members, this is my third time addressing you in plenary since 2013. Each time I have benefited from your expertise, your advice and support and that has fed directly into my work. My Office is driven by the complaints we receive and, as today’s report notes, over 22% of complaints concern access to document requests. Transparency and the Treaty-based right of access to documents must continue to play a crucial role in our EU democracy. The EU does indeed set higher standards than many Member States, and given its role and its global reach in many areas, so it should. The Juncker Commission is, I recognise, working to improve standards in this regard and I welcome the proposal made just yesterday to revise the Commissioners’ Code of Conduct, as both I as Ombudsman, and this Parliament, have urged. This is a positive step, although I do think that there are other possible future improvements to the Code on how this challenging issue is handled. In addition, the Juncker Commission, through Vice—President Timmermans, has proposed earlier this year a revised Transparency Register, which I welcome. Many Member States do not have a register, while others have been unsuccessful in introducing them. However, a register is only as good as its capacity to give citizens assurance that lawmaking is not being inappropriately or unduly influenced – and so I look forward to seeing the outcome of the negotiations with Parliament and Council on this Commission proposal. Much EU lobbying of course focuses either on the Permanent Representative offices of the Member States in Brussels, or in the national capitals, and so I hope the Member States will reflect on how this can be made more transparent for all European citizens. I am currently working on this issue with my colleagues in the European Network of Ombudsmen, both to raise awareness of lobbying transparency and to show the very real way in which lobbying directly affects people’s lives. Last June, I hosted a network conference in Brussels at which we discussed the refugee and migration crisis, lobbying transparency, and the rule of law. I was very pleased that my Ombudsman colleagues were able to have engaged and spirited conversations with EU officials, and I believe it was a valuable learning experience for both groups This report recognises the work of my Office in several areas in cooperation with the EU administration, and with the support of Parliament, to seek and achieve real improvements. These include: transparency and balance of Commission Expert Groups; Commission efforts to make the TTIP talks more transparent; Commission efforts to implement Article 16 of the Staff Regulations; whistleblowing rules to protect EU staff; how fundamental rights are upheld in EU cohesion policy; the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities; and the European Citizens’ Initiative.  I also wish to mention three other areas which I know are of interest to this House. Frontex became a particularly critical EU agency in 2015 during the refugee crisis. I welcome its efforts in implementing the Special Report I sent to Parliament concerning a Frontex complaints mechanism, but also the recommendations I made in relation to joint return flights.  The European Central Bank has also become a much more familiar institution to EU citizens and I thank it for working with my Office and boosting the transparency of its administration as also noted in today’s report. Given the heightened citizen awareness of EU institutions and agencies in the wake of the financial crisis, and now of Brexit, none of us can work in the shadows or resist citizen demands for greater transparency and accountability.  In 2015, I also launched an inquiry into the transparency of the Trilogues negotiation process and made several proposals concerning transparency, while respecting the legislators’ need to negotiate in confidence. I thank the three institutions for their good cooperation, and I look forward to their responses next month. Today’s report also notes the correspondence we have had with President Dijsselbloem in relation to boosting the transparency of the Eurogroup. I welcome his focus on that issue, particularly given the increased importance of this group in the lives of citizens within the eurozone. The Dutch Presidency, which ended this summer, also worked hard to boost transparency in the Council. This is an area I will continue to focus on, as it is important for citizens to be able accurately to disentangle, and understand, the separate lines of decision making at EU and Member State level.  But let me also mention some examples of the everyday cases my Office deals with, which assist in improving the experience of the EU for its citizens. A German citizen complained that the Commission had not properly explained why it was not investigating his infringement complaint about the E-Privacy Directive. I found that the Commission had not provided sufficient reasoning about why it was not taking action on the issues raised by the complainant, and the Commission has agreed to take my analysis into account when it reviews the Directive. Another important individual case involved a Parliament employee, who has a daughter with severe and irreversible brain damage. The employee came to me after Parliament’s administration had sought to revoke a derogation it had granted her from having to move from her place of work under mobility rules. Happily, Parliament agreed to my recommendation to maintain the derogation for as long as the daughter needs her mother’s presence and care. Another case concerned the Education Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency. A small community group had claimed that the agency had unfairly shortened the deadline for funding applications for town-twinning projects. Following my intervention, the agency clarified its actions and the complainant will be able to participate in a future twinning project. Before I finish, I wish to note again the high standards of the EU civil service, of the thousands of dedicated people who work in the EU institutions and agencies all over Europe. Europeans want to see positive change for their families in their daily lives. This is mainly a political challenge, but a strong and ethical public administration is a hallmark of a strong democracy. To recognise the work of EU staff and share best practice across the institutions, I recently launched the Award for Good Administration to acknowledge examples of good service, transparency and ethical behaviour. This award is open to staff in all EU institutions, agencies and bodies and nominees may be proposed by anyone up until the end of January of next year. I welcome of course any nominations from Members of this House. Honourable Members, we live in challenging and even frightening times. We must, however, not be afraid to ‘connect the dots’ in this new wave of citizen unrest manifested in increasing populism and nationalism, and we must examine at a deeper level our political and administrative governance structures in Europe. We must also detach our views of the personalities involved in some of these movements from the genuine citizen concerns and distress that sometimes fuel them. The power and responsibility to do that at EU level lies mainly within the hands of this Parliament, the Commission, and the governments of the Member States, and those are onerous and solemn responsibilities. Those of us who value and support our pluralist European democracy must now redouble our efforts and demonstrate clearly that we serve the public interest and the public interest alone. Thank you again to the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, their staff and the secretariats for all the work on this year’s report.

The work of the European Ombudsman in fighting maladministration by EU institutions and bodies is of the utmost importance. Our citizens have a right to good administration; they expect and deserve high quality service. It is our joint responsibility to live up to these high standards. I would like to take this opportunity to say that the Commission is very pleased with the consistently good cooperation with the Ombudsman and her services. We also welcome the recent adoption by the Ombudsman of the new implementing provisions governing inquiry procedures.  The report puts emphasis on the importance of the Ombudsman’s work on transparency as a guarantee of good administration. Transparency has been from day one a key priority of this Commission, and of me personally, and we have taken important steps in that regard. Since December 2014, all bilateral meetings with those who seek to influence our decision-making have been made public. In September this year we proposed to make the new transparency register mandatory, based on a new and binding interinstitutional agreement covering the European Parliament, the Commission and, for the first time, the Council. I would like to underscore all the remarks Ms O’Reilly made on the need to have the same standards applied everywhere in the EU, including in places where we do not have direct responsibility but which fall under the direct responsibility of our Member States.  All of us who serve in European public office have a duty to respect the highest standards of integrity and ethics. In the light of recent developments concerning members of the Barroso Commission, the Commission has this week backed President Juncker’s intention to revise the Code of Conduct for Commissioners. He will consult the President of Parliament, in line with a framework agreement between our two institutions, on proposals to increase the cooling-off period for members of the Commission to two years, and for the Commission President to three years.  I am also pleased that the report acknowledges the Commission’s efforts to follow up on the Ombudsman’s recommendations in various areas. This includes the publication of numerous TTIP documents, the increased information on senior officials leaving the Commission to work outside the institutions, the new rules on the composition and functioning of expert groups, and the introduction of a complaints mechanism for fundamental rights in the new European Border and Coast Guard. The Commission always takes the Ombudsman’s remarks very seriously. We take swift action to address cases of maladministration and comply with her recommendations whenever possible. From time to time there may be cases where the Commission and the Ombudsman disagree but this only concerns a very limited number of cases. In 2014, the Commission’s compliance rate was 86%.  Let me conclude by stressing that the Commission will continue to cooperate fully and loyally with the Ombudsman in her inquiries and to build upon the existing very good work relations with the Ombudsman and her services.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Julia Pitera", "mepid": "124898", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Mr President! In 2015, the office of the European Ombudsman dealt with many complaints and dealt with a number of important issues, including transparency of trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States or cooling-off period (grace period). Undoubtedly, work should be undertaken on amending the Code of Conduct of EU Cooling-Off Officers. The period of 18 months that must elapse between stepping down from office and taking up a new function is too short. By contrast, it is the foundation of democratic states, and citizens' access to documents is an important pillar of the system of disclosure. However, its limits must be determined. Do the intercessors of full transparency in trade negotiations, access for everyone to these documents and negotiations in their own countries have systems to allow everyone such access to knowledge of international relations, financial, monetary or economic policy? Do they really want documents from Member States classified as confidential to be overt on every request? After all, only these categories were included in the 2001 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council and should be respected in the course of the work on documents in the European Parliament. Because, after all, the knowledge available could be used not only by concerned citizens, but also those who would like to use the information obtained for self-interest or to the detriment of the public interest. Idealism is extremely socially carrying. However, the question is whether the implementation of such solutions would be safe for this society. I therefore call for a prudent vote on the amendments tabled to the report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2015.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Miriam Dalli", "mepid": "124970", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, First Vice-President Timmermans, Ombudsman O’Reilly, the report we will be voting on today proves what an essential asset the role of the European Ombudsman is for Europe and also for the European institutions.  As Socialists and Democrats, we positively welcome the Ombudsman’s efforts to ensure greater transparency in her work, and ensuring also the rights of the most vulnerable. The European Ombudsman is there to ensure that Europe’s institutions maintain the highest standards for all of our citizens and her efforts to remove the shadow of secrecy surrounding the TTIP negotiations have proved this. I urge her to be vigilant and to help us in ensuring that citizens will have full information when it comes to all trade agreements, including CETA. This is why I and other colleagues are insisting that the European Ombudsman should be given the power to issue a statement of non-compliance should our institutions refuse to release public documents which do not endanger public safety or security or put the privacy and the integrity of individuals at stake. Furthermore, we called for the European Ombudsman to be further empowered to take decisions, if the need arises.  Another important measure we are calling for is stronger rules on the protection of whistleblowers, together with legal safeguards at all levels for the individuals involved. It is all about trust. The EU needs to take greater measures to entrust its citizens with the power of information and to allow our citizens to play an active and engaged role in policy making. I believe that in doing so we will be strengthening our societies and I have no doubt that the Ombudsman and her office can be at the forefront to ensure such empowerment.

Mr President of the Commission! The Group of European Conservatives and Reformists will be in favour of this report. We point, after all, to several elements. First of all, of course this is political office, there's nothing to hide it. Since he deals with the TTIP treaty on trade and investment between the Union and America, it has a political dimension, and let's not pretend it isn't. I think the very relevant thing is the issue of the code of clerical conduct, the conduct of officials. This is the thing that is expected by public opinion — maybe not all citizens — but the public in our Member States. Here, EU officials should be like Caesar's wife — beyond suspicion. Finally, I think that sometimes disputes between individual institutions — the Ombudsman, the Commission and sometimes the Parliament — add credibility to the real debate that should be going on in the European Union, if the European Union is to be credible for citizens, for taxpayers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Cecilia Wikström", "mepid": "96677", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, Vice-President Timmermans, Ombudsman O’Reilly, I am happy to have you here in plenary this morning and I am sure that I speak on behalf of the whole Committee on Petitions when I say I am sure that all of us appreciate our mutual good cooperation. The European Ombudsman is doing an excellent job, especially in constantly using the possibilities to initiate own-initiative inquiries. It is important for democracy in general, and for the perception of the European institutions in particular, that the Ombudsman raises sometimes very difficult and sensitive questions and also investigates our own working methods and procedures. I am very pleased that the Ombudsman keeps pushing the European institutions to improve transparency in all different fields and bodies. Especially in these days of populism and euroscepticism it is crucial that the institutions live up to the expectations of EU citizens concerning transparency and good conduct. I therefore believe that the EU needs to take the issue of revolving doors much more seriously, otherwise the reputation of the European Commission and the European Union itself is put at risk. Therefore I welcome that Commission President Juncker yesterday proposed to tighten the Code of Conduct for Commissioners. However, I agree with the Ombudsman that some positions will not cease to be problematic simply because two or three years have passed. The rules therefore need to be made more explicit and possibly also include a range of sanctions for any breaches of the rules.  Something that I would like to have seen more strongly reflected in the report is to ensure that the European Ombudsman is able to order documents to be released from the Commission when needed. To be able to perform her duties with regard to maladministration of the European institutions, the Ombudsman needs to be able to act on her own behalf and not to be dependent on the goodwill of the European institutions. It is in all our interests if we want to be perceived as credible in these difficult days. Once again, I thank you very much for an excellent cooperation.

Thank you very much. Thanks to his work, we can see how complaints of lack of transparency by the Union institutions remain the main concern of citizens, and we can speak with many examples. We can talk about revolving doors, such as that of former Commission President Durão Barroso, now working for Goldman Sachs; conflicts of interest existing between the Commissioners themselves, such as the former Commissioner for Competition or current Commissioner Arias Cañete; the lack of information on the meetings of the Eurogroup, where budget cuts agreements are decided for euro countries; lack of transparency among Commission expert groups, i.e. lobbies with which Union policies are negotiated behind closed doors; lack of transparency in infringement files opened by the Commission to the States where they violate Union law; and, of course, the lack of information concerning the TTIP negotiations. I would like to denounce once again that MEPs are going to the reading rooms without being able to make copies of the information provided to us, of the little information. By the way, it is also quite offensive that the Commission has overturned the citizens' initiative against the TTIP, which received more than three million signatures. Finally, we would like to congratulate the Ombudsman for her investigation into the Frontex agency. Hot returns and mass expulsions are contrary to international humanitarian law. Although efforts are being made to reform, the establishment of a border police is not the solution to the humanitarian drama we are experiencing.

First of all thanks to Emily O'Reilly, but I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Timmermans. I seize every little bit of a chance I have to say thank you and praise him, and here I have an opportunity, so of course it has to be taken. It's not so often that happens, so thank you very much for a good reply from the Commissioner too. We are pleased that we have a real ombudsman, that we have succeeded in this House to ensure that no party politics has passed in our ombudsman, but that we have a credible, independent ombudsman. All three of our Ombudsmen have helped to strengthen the institution and trust of citizens. Your work has shown so brilliantly, and so has Marias' report. We are, of course, backing it up. I'll look at some of the hefty points. This is a matter of good governance practice. Here, several colleagues have mentioned openness and transparency. It's not good enough yet. We're going to make more of it. I am very pleased that we have got the desire for a directive to protect whistleblowers into the report. That will be one of the important things to go here. But we still also have administrations nationally thwarting openness, so this is a battle that is far from won. Let me also mention the other important side of good governance practice: conflicts of interest. It is strange that there are still many in the administration who believe that it is enough to make a 'declaration of conflict of interest'. No, that's not enough! They must not be there at all! We need to have that system properly incorporated, including in our agencies, including in the pharmaceutical agency, including in the food agency, EMA and EFSA, be clear that if citizens are to have confidence in the decisions that are made, then there must be no conflicts of interest. I think we should help each other strengthen this. Finally, I would ask that we get a majority in here to get rid of the excruciating reading rooms where you almost have to sit with your fingers in ears and almost blindfolded.

The annual report we are discussing today, which analyses the Ombudsman's activity, appears satisfactory in bringing this out. But the European Union is far from ensuring full transparency in its work. This is clearly deduced from the persistence of a situation in which full access to documents held by the European institutions is denied and there remains heavy opacity in the relationship with the powerful lobbies of the European institutions. private sector. It is not surprising to see, therefore, how a multiplicity of decisions taken by the European institutions appear immediately oriented to satisfy the special interests of the economic-financial elites. The worst is to see at the same time how serious the socio-economic and environmental implications of the same are to the detriment of the fundamental rights of citizens. Barroso's affair, who at the end of his term as President of the European Commission, accepts a summit post at Goldman Sachs International, appears emblematic in confirming the perverse union between European institutional summits and economic-financial elites. Much more stringent rules should have been adopted for some time to avoid not only cases of revolving doors, as in the Barroso affair, but also all those small and large conflicts of interest at the institutions, agencies and bodies of the Union which have passed down and continue to transmit the credibility of decision-making processes on a technical and political level at European level. Because of the existing situation, it is no coincidence to verify how the ICE instrument, the European citizens' initiative, which should have increased the direct participation of the citizens in the definition of the Union's policies, continue to be mortified by those glittering procedural deficiencies which affect their effectiveness. A marked change in the political and moral paradigm of the European Union must be put in place to regain the trust of citizens.

Thus, the number of requests processed increased from 23,000 in 2014 to 17,000 in 2015, demonstrating that Europeans are not very convinced by this institution. However, it is not for fault of knowing her. Indeed, 83% of European citizens are aware that they can lodge a complaint before the Commission, Parliament or the European Ombudsman. What is the cause of this disaffection for the Ombudsman? The results are not good. The first example is transparency. The Ombudsman welcomes the Commission's publication of documents on the transatlantic treaty, but it was mainly the NGO Greenpeace that allowed transparency against the very will of the European institutions. As for whistleblowers, the European institutions are not credible either. The best known, Snowden and Assange, did not even get asylum in Europe. The only small victory in terms of transparency is that the European Central Bank will publish the minutes of its Management Board this year. The balance sheet is therefore very modest. On the other hand, it becomes harmful when one examines its action in favour of illegal immigration. The European Network of Ombudsmen conducted a survey on the human rights of deported migrants. Following this investigation, the Ombudsman recommended that Frontex give migrants the opportunity to lodge complaints against border guards. He also reoffended in 2015 by launching a strategic initiative on immigration and the Asylum Integration Fund. This aid to illegal persons in itself disqualified the Ombudsman's action, because the financial and human cost of this immigration is unbearable for Europeans.

The rapporteur could not resist the temptation to politically overload the annual report on the Ombudsman. Nor is it fair to the Office to unsolve politically unresolved problems with the Ombudsman. This means that we in Parliament must first come to an agreement and discuss what we actually want at the major construction sites.

The Court of First Instance and in particular the Court of Justice of the European Union had said that access should normally be given to these documents. The Commission had appealed. Yesterday — and it is for this reason that this report is timely — the Court of Justice of the European Union won the case for the associations. This shows that when you are referred to you, you would like to have even more power in terms of access to Commission documents, but also agencies like EFSA. The second point concerns the links of interest between experts. Madam Ombudsman, I asked you to obtain the names of the experts and the links of interest of the experts of the Euratom Treaty who had been at the origin of the maximum permissible limits in the event of a nuclear accident. I got the names, but not the links of interest, and you told me that it is up to the panel to decide whether or not they communicate those links.

Of course, it also gives me new ideas about particular new areas that I should concentrate on, or about reinforcing the areas that I am working on, and thank you for that. I just want to stress a few things in relation to some of the comments that were made. First of all, my greatest strength as an Ombudsman is my independence: my political independence and also my independence from the complainants. In order to work, I need both the confidence of the citizens who come to me for help, but also the confidence of the institutions that I am independent and impartial. I would ask you to continue to support me in that, because it is very important for the work that I do.  Very briefly, in relation to three particular matters that were raised: there was a question in relation to a particular MEP. I just want to stress that it is not part of my mandate to investigate individual MEPs. If there are particular issues concerning MEPs that concern some of their colleagues, it is obviously Parliament that has to deal with that in the first instance. In relation to the questions on glyphosate and the court ruling, of course I will analyse what the final court ruling is and take guidance from that. The issue of expert groups is something that my office has done a considerable amount of work on, including conflict of interests, where we have made certain proposals in relation to that. Of course, I am always willing to hear or receive any complaints in that regard, because it is certainly an area which we take very seriously. In relation to MEPs’ assistants, I am very aware that some of them do have difficult and challenging work to do in a sometimes very stressful and political environment. We do, and we can, take complaints from them, but generally those complaints would be against the European Parliament administration in relation to how they have handled their complaints. Obviously that is something I am more than willing to discuss. Just to sum up, obviously once again a lot of your focus has been on transparency and I do acknowledge the work that has been done, particularly by Vice-President Timmermans, in promoting greater transparency. I think there is a particular urgency now, given what has happened, both here in Europe and also in the US, to really address citizens’ concerns and to listen to their demands for a greater awareness of what the institutions are doing on their behalf. The conflicts of interest, particularly in relation to the recent high-profile case, has also forced us all to join the dots between things that happen like that and the wider concerns of citizens and how, ultimately, they are expressed at the ballot box.

I would like to respond to anguish and remarks from colleagues by saying that in the report we do not refer to Mr Cañete first. The only reference is to Mr. Barroso. Secondly, the petitions that have been made are intended to demonstrate the position of the European Parliament and also to make it clear that there is a great deal of concern about how 'Revolving doors' work. And it is important that Mr Junker has now taken an initiative. It recognises the problem and considers that the code of operation of the Members of the Commission themselves should be changed. So, ladies and gentlemen, that is what you have to bear in mind. Thirdly, I think that the comments we made about the lack of transparency in TTIP have paid off. We made the same remarks last year and saw the Commission respond. We also all raise the following issue: it is not possible to go to closed rooms, to reading rooms, to read the documents. And this is something that we have to deal with and see next year. There are no 'sacred cows' in the European Union today. They're all under review. There must be transparency everywhere and everything, including in the Eurogroup, which adopts decisions affecting the social and economic life of millions of citizens, which are only available in English. Watch out for that. We cannot leave the European Central Bank out of our criticism, which also takes important decisions. So these are the issues that we are discussing. I think it is important that there is a very good cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman. I have raised this point in my book on the European Ombudsman, which I published in 1994, and I stressed that the basis for the institution of the European Ombudsman to work is for the proper cooperation of the Committee on Petitions with the European Ombudsman. It is on this basis that the European Parliament can operate. Our aim is to empower the Ombudsman to move forward, to proceed with impartiality and independence. If we here do not guarantee this independence and the possibility of action, I do not think that we will deliver any significant results. Control of lobbies, rights of people with disabilities, access to documents and information, even greater protection for complainants, improvement of the functioning of the European Citizens' Initiative - a matter of great importance, because citizens take matters into their own hands -, control also to the European Chemicals Agency to avoid animal testing: all these issues have been raised.

In a concerted effort the European Union expressed its concerns about his case to Hong Kong and Chinese authorities at high-level political meetings and through written statements. The head of the EU office to Hong Kong made numerous inquiries to the Chief Executive, Secretary of Justice and Ministry of Foreign Affairs Commissioner. Additionally, the head of the EU delegation to China inquired with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing. Consequently, the EU has seen reports that Sweden succeeded in securing consular access to Mr Gui, who remains in detention in China.  The European Union is not in a position to publicly comment on the consular contacts and the efforts of the Swedish Government. However, given certain aspects of this consular case, most notably Mr Gui’s disappearance from Thailand and his publicly broadcast statement after resurfacing in China, the European Union remains deeply concerned.

The interests of large landowners, agribusiness and mining corporations have always taken precedence in Brazil, and armed groups attack and kill indigenous people who legitimately oppose those interests. Far from defending their rights, the state offers such powerful interests impunity. Brazil’s National Indigenous Foundation (FUNAI) is tasked with defending indigenous rights but it has never been adequately resourced, and the current President, who holds his position as the result of a judicial coup, has reduced its funding to the lowest level in the past 10 years.

The EU also implements several projects in support of indigenous people in Brazil.

Indigenous people’s rights are regularly discussed in the framework of the EU-Brazil Human Rights Dialogue, including at the last dialogue, co-chaired by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Lambrinidis, in September 2015. The EU has called for enhanced efforts to ensure the protection of indigenous peoples, such as the Guarani-Kaiowá, and their representatives, and for the effective investigation of murders and other crimes against them. Our cooperation on human rights will also be on the agenda of the next high-level political dialogue in Brasilia on 25 November 2016, which is tomorrow.

The European Union has been vocal about its concern with this case.

We welcome the initial steps the Russian authorities have taken to investigate the claims, while continuing to urge the Russian authorities to carry out a swift, thorough and impartial investigation of Mr Dadin’s torture allegation. We are disturbed by frequent reports of torture in Russian prisons, and we believe that steps need to be taken to eliminate the use of torture and other ill-treatment in Russian penitentiary facilities.

Indeed, this law, which criminalises anyone found to have violated it more than twice within 180 days, is not in line with Russia’s international obligations. Mr Dadin’s case is another worrying example of the ongoing restrictions on fundamental freedoms and civil society by the Russian authorities.

The conflict in Syria shows most emphatically how much the world has changed in recent years. The tragedy endured by the people of this state is difficult to describe: death and suffering can come on any side at any point, and the world, including Europe, looks at it helplessly. No rules are respected, all parties carry out war crimes and crimes against humanity, international humanitarian law is not followed, humanitarian convoys are attacked and hospitals treating injured civilians, despite being clearly marked. You can see that the goal of all parties is to intimidate the civilian population, which is meant to help defeat the opponent. More than 400,000 people have died since the start of the conflict, with nearly 14 million requiring humanitarian support. Specialists point out that the conflict in Syria would have long ended if it had not turned into a so-called proxy war. On the territory of this country is Iran with Saudi Arabia, Russia with America, and Turkey is running a multilateral game. All of these countries are trying to support each other's forces and thus make it difficult to end the war. One must be clear: it is the outside world that is stoking this tragedy. The European Union should first try to persuade all parties to stop engaging in this conflict, later a peace plan for Syria can be discussed. At the same time, we should prepare for post-war action, because the very end of the fighting will not improve the situation of ordinary people.

In my view, when the price of feed is artificially increased it increases the price of flesh and artificially increases the amount of flat-rate VAT that can be claimed back.

This is but one aspect of the shocking gap between living conditions in our world, but it has a number of consequences for people’s health and safety, education, well—being and chance to earn a living; for women who carry out the difficult, time—consuming and sometimes risky task of collecting firewood and have to use unhealthy and hazardous cooking methods; for the development progress – or lack thereof – of communities and countries; for the preservation of vegetation, forest and biodiversity; for local climates and for the global effort to limit climate change and handle its consequences; and of course sometimes also for peace and security, as the energy issue can spawn conflict. Access to energy is a key driver of development. Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all is one of the SDGs adopted in the United Nations last year. This goal should be achieved by 2030. Getting there will take truly huge efforts but it is possible and necessary. How, then, should it be done? What is the EU’s contribution and what progress is being achieved with this contribution? These are the core issues of the oral question to the Commission and the motion for a resolution prepared by the Committee on Development. Our Parliament has been emphasising for years that the focus should be on the small-scale production of renewable energy, local networks and off—grid solutions. Such solutions produce the biggest contribution to development and are best at avoiding negative impacts on the environment. We have also seen that the regulation on the Development Cooperation Instrument prescribes this orientation of EU development policy in the energy area. Not least, we note in our scrutiny of the draft development assistance programming documents that the prescription is being followed. The potential for renewable energy production is particularly great in Africa, which is also where electrification is least developed. Solar and wind power generation should be expanded faster. Insufficient and hazardous traditional use of biomass, such as firewood and charcoal, currently dominates Africa’s energy consumption. A cautious approach to more modern types of bioenergy is necessary since such energy production can come at the cost of food production, affect land use rights, cause deforestation and degradation of land and reduce the availability of water for other purposes. Energy poverty is most widespread in rural areas, but providing access to energy in rapidly growing cities is also a massive challenge. The unsatisfied needs are particularly extensive in Africa. In fact, the number of people without electricity on this continent is increasing, while population growth is faster than the progress of electrification. Climate finance provided by developed to developing countries is another important source. Together with technology transfer, it also affects Africa leaders’ wish to focus on renewable energy sources and industrialisation processes. In parallel with public funds, more private money must go into energy investment. Public-private partnerships can be useful and the general trend in EU development policy towards providing grants, loans, subsidies and other incentives for private investment is particularly strong in the area of energy investment.  The EU has recently launched an electrification financing initiative, ElectriFI and facilitating energy investment is also among the central aims of the European External Investment Plan proposed by the Commission. Development effectiveness principles should always be followed. The EU can be proud of the scale of its work to extend energy provision in developing countries. In the period 2014—2020 we are spending EUR 3.5 billion on development assistance in the energy area. The Commission proposal for a new European consensus on development rightly points to the crucial role of energy for development and in climate action. In 2012 the Commission set out to provide access to sustainable energy for an additional 500 million people in developing countries by 2030. We are now asking the Commission to tell us about the general state of progress, the main challenges encountered and the outlook for the continued implementation of development assistance in the energy area. We would also like to know what proportion of the funds engaged is going to local renewable energy projects and how we can achieve the target of EUR 500 billion. I look forward to listening to the Commission’s reply.

European Union development cooperation in sustainable energy is supporting developing countries to advance towards economic growth powered by sustainable, affordable, reliable and modern energy for all. The three objectives of our energy and development engagements are to address the lack of energy access, to increase renewable energy generation and to contribute to the fight against climate change while ensuring sustainable use of resources. Specific attention is given to sub-Saharan Africa. Half of the global population without access to energy lives in this region and demographics aggravate the issue, with repercussions for political stability and migration to Europe.  In order to achieve our ambition, three factors are critical for success. First is policy ownership at the highest level. The promotion of energy, in particular renewable energy, must be owned by the partners. In the current financial framework, energy is a focal sector in about 30 national and regional indicative programmes. The Commission has signed, on behalf of the European Union and together with several Member States, 21 joint declarations on enhanced energy cooperation with developing countries’ partners. Second is the creation of an enabling environment. Through our technical assistance facility, the Commission provides support to partner countries on improving governance, legal and regulatory reforms and capacity building. Third is sufficient capital. The Commission has advanced considerably in generating more funding from banks and the private sector. It is estimated that, through blending, EUR 3.7 billion allocated for energy cooperation in the current multiannual financing framework period will leverage investments of EUR 15 to EUR 20 billion, or even more.  Earlier this year, the electrification financing initiative, the so—called ‘Electrify initiative’, which is an innovative mechanism to leverage investments, generated through its first invitation for applications 290 proposals requiring EUR 800 million of financial support to leverage a potential total investment amount of EUR 8.5 billion. This illustrates the significant contribution it can make to reaching universal access to energy.  The proposed external investment plan would be one more important step in this direction. Our vision cannot be implemented by governments and the private sector alone. There is also an important role for the participation of civil society, as organisations with a long presence and relationships of trust with local populations can be excellent partners in the energy sector. Likewise, women need to play a major role in the integration of renewable energies in local economies and everyday life. A gender window has been created in ‘Electrify’ to stimulate and exploit further this potential. There are still important risks impeding the investments which are necessary to meeting Sustainable Development Goal No 7 – among others political instability, current fluctuations and insufficient market sizes. The Commission is working together with all stakeholders to set up the right conditions in order to mitigate such risks.  Finally, let me address one specific issue. As regards the 11th EDF national indicative programme for Eritrea, the preparations for the implementation of a solar mini-grid programme with a pro-poor focus are underway. They are fully in line with the preconditions and principles defined by the Member States at the EDF Committee meeting in November 2015. I am fully aware of the Parliament’s concerns. Let me reconfirm that no 11th EDF projects in the energy sector will be presented as long as there is not a substantial project in support of the implementation of the UN-led universal periodic review recommendations for Eritrea under the governance sector. Progress in the field of human rights will have to be seen for the European Union to engage further in Eritrea by committing funds under the 11th EDF.

First, I will start with a sad constatation: we talk about energy, about opportunities to give developing countries better access to sources, including renewable sources, while we have only a dozen people in the hall. And they are overwhelmingly speakers. Unfortunately, during this meeting of Parliament, it was confirmed that a great number of topics not related to the main competences of Parliament appear earlier, and only later or at the end, those topics that I consider to be crucial. On this occasion, the push for economic, financial, transport, educational, creative industries to be preferred in this mainstream. Now I'm moving on to the essential topic, the question of today. We have two prospects here. The first shorter, six-year, financial. This is where specific amounts come in. Three and a half billion — that is the increase in the expenditure on this issue we are talking about, and 2030, which is what is related to the Paris Convention and the programme for expanding energy access opportunities for developing countries. These two perspectives in both the question and the draft resolution have been correctly formulated, so it can be said that the question has produced an effect in the form of a good, complete, understandable, consistent resolution. What do I want to look out for? First, the need to take into account the diverse possibilities of individual states, those countries that are developing, because they are not equal. The need to apply a variety of policies is so important that there are states that can't cope, but can cope, and there are states that can't cope with this problem, because such opportunities for various reasons simply do not have. The second thing also contained in the motion for a resolution is the variety of costs of electricity production depending on the sources used. I point out that in Africa alone, energy renewability is quite high, but the use on example of the capabilities of solar batteries — extremely modest. Third element — flexibility of the deployment process. According to my assessment, the more efficiently we manage new technologies, the better we take care of them, we will have higher efficiencies and lower costs for the project itself. Fourthly, I want to draw attention to the need to take into account also security, broadly understood security, that is related to the production itself, transmission, use of various energy sources and protection against random events. And fifth, using the satellite navigation system or satellite systems, primarily Copernicus, to diagnose, inventory, observe all that is related to energy consumption. This system that we are building in Europe, as the only civilian world, is designed to give us a chance to do some projects more specifically, know more and get better at doing it. I also want to point out one of the points of the resolution: the need to inform. There is such a demand that Europeans, but also recipients of our policy, have greater and better knowledge, more up-to-date knowledge of these tasks. I will also point out three slightly less relevant, but quite important issues related to the resolution itself. We are talking about the need to support local markets, the need to build also energy production capabilities based on small entities. It must be remembered that dispersal, this urban dispersal in developing countries, must also be taken into account. And another thing — sharing technologies. The technologies we can take advantage of are very many. We have to use them all, but importantly — we have to do better. At the end of these 18 paragraphs of the draft resolution, I will quote passage 11. It concerns, above all, the guidelines of the World Commission on Water Dams: “in particular, it is emphasised that the planning of any dams should be assessed in terms of five values: fairness, performance, stakeholder decision-making, sustainable character and accountability.” It seems to me that the third member of this point can be addressed to the totality of the problem.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 1742, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Gilles Pargneaux", "mepid": "96948", "text": " on behalf of the S&D Group. — (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally, we have this debate in plenary of the European Parliament on the most important foreign policy issue for our continent, namely Africa and its access to energy, because the figures are eloquent: out of more than 1 billion Africans, 700 million do not have no access to electricity. By 2030, if nothing is done, this figure could rise to 1.3 billion. In other words, it is the world's most populous future continent that will have the least access to electricity and light. Can we decently accept this for a continent that is separated from ours only about ten kilometres and with which we share so much, whether historically or culturally? I don't believe, we don't believe it. To that, of course, we must add the demographic perspective of a continent that will have nearly 2 billion inhabitants by 2050 and will undergo full climate change, with all that implies in terms of food security, access to energy or tensions around agricultural land use. That is why with some 40 of my colleagues first, and then through the Committee on Regional Development chaired by Linda McAvan, we wanted to have this debate in plenary this afternoon in the European Parliament. I thank them for supporting me in this process. Our message is simple: let's go, it is high time to help developing countries, especially Africa, to increase their access to energy. The stakes are enormous: education, economic development, but also migration, stability and security in a continent plagued by terrorism. This is what lies behind access to energy. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, much is now happening, because the African continent has understood the enormous opportunities that are facing him. Morocco has thus developed the world's largest thermal solar power plant in Ouarzazate, which will provide clean energy from 2018 to more than 1 million Moroccans. I take another example, Kenya, where only a third of the inhabitants have access to electricity and which has developed the Lake Turkana wind farm. It is expected to generate 20% of Kenya's energy by summer 2017. More generally, the water basins of Central Africa, the Rift Valley fault and the sunshine enjoyed by the continent in general are sources of water, geothermal or solar power that is not matched in the rest of the world. At present, however, only a tiny part of this potential is exploited (only 7% of hydraulic capacity and less than 1% of geothermal capacity) and photovoltaic initiatives are still too embryonic. We feel the first fruits of a continent that could become a pool of renewable energy if we accompany it properly, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. For this, the continent needs unconditional support from us and on your part. Yet, despite the urgency and consensus on the subject, there is a feeling that the machine is struggling to get started. Of the €10 billion pledged last year at COP21 — of which I was rapporteur for the European Parliament — to the African Renewable Energy Agency, only half was provided by the most developed countries. Yet the European Commission, in the European Parliament, the Member States or civil society do not lack good will. I am thinking in particular of the enormous work done by Jean—Louis Borloo with his “Energy for Africa” initiative. It is now time to pass the course and implement this great Marshall plan for access to energy in Africa, as called for by Jean—Louis Borloo and its foundation — in this way, i fully associate myself with his fight. That is the raison d'être of our parliamentary action today: to help transform undeniable political will into concrete actions. The COP22 last week, which just ended in Marrakech, carried a similar message. Africa is the crucial issue in the coming decades. Also, after decisions, action! With this great Marshall plan for energy access, we have the opportunity to implement this great and beautiful action in favor of the development of our neighbour. In this context, I welcome the launch by the European Commission of the External Investment Instrument. It seems to me to be absolutely necessary for such an instrument to focus on access to energy and be ready as soon as possible, especially before the forthcoming EU-Africa summit in autumn 2017, as proposed by the European Commission. Marshall Plan for the Electrification of Africa, external investment instruments, support for the African Renewable Energy Agency: this is how, Commissioner, we can, in a very concrete way, help the development of access to energy on a continent that needs it so badly. I expect you to give us the perspectives and the answers so that we can be in this way in concrete action, Commissioner. This is how we will put Europe in fact at the centre of the international scene, given the many ramifications that depend on African development. In a nutshell, Commissioner, let us go and let us not waste any more time!", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 1743, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Czesław Hoc", "mepid": "135540", "text": " on behalf of the ECR Group. — Mr President! Electric current is defined as the ordered motion of electric charges. If mother nature has so precisely ordered electricity, why can the modern world not or want to sort out and sustainably provide access to electricity to all regions of the world? Some countries therefore have far too much electricity, some not enough, and many countries don't have it at all. Close to 2 billion people in the world have no access to grid electricity at all, and after all, each of us knows that the power grid is a condition for the economic and civilizing development of the world. Moreover, there is a close link between poverty and lack of access to modern electrical services. The electrification rate for Central African countries reaches just 23% and 500 million Africans lack access to electricity. On the one hand, the Union is undertaking a development energy initiative to provide access to sustainable energy to an additional 500 million people by 2030, and at the same time accepts that by 2030 the share of gas flowing through Gazprom's pipelines will increase to 50% of all European gas supply, which is to be confirmed by the agreement between the German company and the Russian Gazprom. Thus, the Union is unlikely to balance access to energy, rather it calls for an element of political impact of electricity. Moreover, the Union promotes and even forces electricity-rich countries to produce biofuels, which, moreover, do little good for the climate and energy policies of these countries. And the same Union reduces and puts barriers to biofuel production in developing countries where the cost of biofuels is much lower and it is easier to do so. There is also a provision in the proposed resolution restricting the subsidies to fossil fuels gradually, a provision that disturbs the energy policy of certain Member States of the Union, for example, Poland, in which the primary source of energy is fossil fuel — coal. In the conclusion, it is very good that the European Union is betting on ensuring access to sustainable energy in developing countries, including sub-Saharan Africa or the Eritrean programme, because it requires a sense of solidarity with all countries in the world and skill sharing richer with poorer ones. Migration policy considerations also require this. It would be even better if the Union's policies in this regard were rational and balanced, without the characteristics of protectionism, and would not interfere with the energy policies of the Member States of the Union. And the question — can the Commission present its own assessment of the global conditions for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 and express its opinion on issues of new and urgently necessary actions, and can it initiate and implement opinions? How much has the Union come closer to the goal of access to sustainable energy for 500 million people?", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 1744, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Jozo Radoš", "mepid": "112753", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Club. — Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, a large part of the problems facing the world today, and also the European Union, is the problem of underdevelopment. A large gap in the underdevelopment of countries causes poverty, misunderstanding and conflict. And one of the important elements of how one can and should reduce the development gap is of course energy policy. And that is why I welcome the initiative of fellow MEPs as well as the European Parliament Development Committee who have raised this issue on access to energy in developing countries. I would also like to thank Mr Commissioner Mimica for the explanations he has given regarding what difficulties the Commission is facing and what the Commission seeks to do further with regard to the implementation of this programme. It is a very ambitious program, that not energy but only electric current, which is the most elementary form of energy policy, is brought to 500 million people by 2030, which is in itself, even if it is an elementary, not a real approach to energy in all aspects of action , one very ambitious goal and it is important that it is set. It is equally important that we in the European Parliament ask how this objective has been realised. This is just part of the overall development cooperation that the European Union has with the whole world. It should be noted that the countries of the European Union in terms of development cooperation give more than the whole rest of the world together, about 60 billion euros per year, and this is due, as I said, to reduce this gap in development, or poverty, which is the cause of this crisis. It is important to note that the modern energy policy of the European Union is essentially a new European policy because it is increasingly difficult to access energy, due to new clean energy requirements and it would be good that these new European policies in this form as modern and modern can be implemented in those countries that are energy-poor. Therefore, here is the most talk about how to bring electric energy, but Mr. Commissioner Mimica also talked about other aspects of energy cooperation that are much more serious than just bringing electricity to a village in Africa. A particularly important dimension of this project, namely the whole idea, is the fact that it is directed towards Africa, the continent in the most difficult position, and especially the fact that half of these thirty projects concern Sub-Saharan Africa, our neighbourhood, the space exposed to instability and from which they actually threaten and come to Europe big migration waves.

That is why we must learn from our own experience and not prescribe in Africa the measures that have led Europe to this drama.

And here we refer, for example, to large projects, large infrastructures, land grabbing and, for example, monocultures of agrofuels: these mean displacement of people, populations; they mean violations of human rights, more poverty, more armed conflict. If we talk about access to energy in the countries of the south, we need to talk above all about access to energy that is sustainable; to energy that is clean; to energy that fights for social justice; that fights for climate justice; that struggles to meet people's basic needs; and, also, that fights for rights human beings, starting with women, who are really the first to suffer from climate change. That being said, we are happy with this resolution, because what it does is also talk about a different type of energy: energy that is decentralised; energy that is small-scale, disconnected from the grid. That is, energy that is really tailored to the needs of these populations, especially in Africa. I would also like to go back to two important points. One is funding, and here we are quite critical of the tools of cooperation between the private and public sector, because experience shows us that most of these funds go mainly to large projects, large infrastructures that are not at all sustainable. On the other hand, we would also like these funds, at least if there is a private-public relationship, to be funds in line with the sustainable development goals and in line with the Paris climate agreements. We also agree on another point: we have to divest all fossil fuels as soon as possible, and that money will be put as soon as possible in the fight against climate change and, moreover, in favour of the sustainable development goals. Finally, I would like to conclude by recalling one phrase in this resolution: that policies to combat climate change have to be sustainable and must be above all consistent with trade policies; or, rather, we need to have coherence between agreements such as CETA and agreements such as Paris. And I would like this to be the general tonic of all European Union policies. May this resolution and what you have said, Mr Mimica, would be the tone of all policies, whether those of that resolution or economic policies of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 1747, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Jean-Luc Schaffhauser", "mepid": "124755", "text": " on behalf of the ENF Group. — (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by telling you about my experience. When I was head of the energy sector in Alsace — this was my first civil servant position — I wanted to do something for Africa. I did not have the support of the regional council at the time, and I had obtained a million francs. Thanks to this sum, in Sanaga-Maritime, Cameroon, we did rural electrification and, from this rural electrification, we launched farms, a small carpentry and we also put around the infrastructure that goes with development, i.e. water and health. Electricity is therefore an indispensable means for development. It is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient condition — I will come back to it. First of all, I would like to underline all the support our group gives to this initiative. 3.5 billion at Union level is good. One billion for France is also good. All this for targets that remain modest for 2020 — because I will not tell you about 2030 with 300 gigawatts. Let's first with these 10 gigawatts, which is quite possible. 1 gigawatt is around a billion. Let me give you a methodology. For 20 years, I devoted myself to the development of Africa, in a private capacity, apart from my other professional occupations at the Regional Cooperation Institute of the Alsace Region and the European Institute of Cooperation. First, it is about building on African local initiatives. I think that Youba Sokona's initiative with the African Development Bank, AFD, KFW (Kréditanstalt für Wiederaufbau) is really what we need to do, namely that we have development agencies at home and we have potential in Africa. We have to work together. We should not create new structures. I like Mr Borloo very much, but I am opposed to my colleague. Secondly, we must have a multilateral approach, not just a European approach. We must be aware that it is very good to associate the United Arab Emirates, the United States, China and Russia. All available funding means must be used with the coherence of African initiatives at the local level. Thirdly — and here I am addressing you, Commissioner, what I am going to say is very important and I do not know if your ear will hear it: we must avoid levers! Leverage will not work! You need to invest where there are people and not necessarily where there is the most money and profitability, if you want to do rural development and if you really want to develop Africa. Where it is profitable, it will be done anyway on its own. So we must have an approach like that of the Marshall Plan. This plan started from the idea of loans and ended in more than 90% of donations. We must have an approach where we are investing new money in rural electrification and rural development. I would like to say that even colonial France was able to invest without the prospect of return on investment when it developed, for example, the entire sanitation system in Douala or when it created the train linking the South to the North of Cameroon. We were able to have a long-term vision. Fourth, electricity is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Electricity is a way, like the road. It's not because you have electricity or you have a road that you create wealth. This is a necessary condition, but not sufficient. There is a real need to build development programs around electricity. I would like these programmes to be carried out as a priority in those countries that need it the most. I am thinking of the sub-Saharan region of the Great Lakes, where there is still some stability, in Cameroon, the Central African Republic and then in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with its full potential. I am also thinking of the Maghreb, Egypt and Algeria. But I come back to what we need, namely a real Marshall plan of donations by money creation, like France, which financed its power plants after the war. It did so through monetary creation. These are advances from the Treasury made to Électricité de France that allowed this. It was monetary creation, pure monetary creation. All of this, we must do so from a developmental perspective around industries so that we can truly highlight rural development and local development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 1748, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Andrejs Mamikins (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124746", "text": "— Dear colleagues! Mr Commissioner! One of the objectives of sustainable development is to provide all people with access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy services. African countries are facing huge constraints in energy supply at the given moment, which significantly puts a brake on its development. The African continent is booming and surviving a demographic explosion. Together with the weak education and health system, undeveloped energy supplies form a vicious circle of poverty from which Africans find it very difficult to get away. Colleagues, even relatively small investments in energy supply can bring a huge economic breakthrough and substantially, significantly improve living and working conditions for many of the inhabitants of the African continent. On the European side, it's not just a charity. Sustainable development of Africa will help soften the migration crisis and create new opportunities for our business in the future. The European Union's Energy Development Initiative aims to provide access to sustainable energy for another 500 million people by 2030. Half a billion people! And will allocate EUR 3.5 billion for energy development aid from 2014 to 2020. We have goals and money. So it is important that the envisaged 30 programs work accurately and efficiently. Here, Parliament, I mention the European Parliament and the Commission, must work together to fix the problems and coordinate our efforts to achieve the objectives. That is why it is important for MPs to get the Commission's vision and learn about the difficulties of implementing programmes in a timely manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 1749, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Ivan Jakovčić (ALDE).", "mepid": "124754", "text": "Mr. President, I will draw one parallel. You know very well where I come from - I come from Croatia, from Istria and you know that in Croatia I have been engaged in politics for a very long time, more than 20, about 25 years, that I have acted a lot in Istria and that I have done a lot for rural development of Istria. I can say that in the early 90's, when we started building infrastructure in Istria, electricity and water were key things. People were leaving the village in Istria, which is the westernmost and, by some criteria, perhaps the richest Croatian region, to towns by the sea. They simply did not want to live in a country where there is neither electricity nor water. It was only 25 years ago, which is not that long ago. I draw that parallel because we have the same situation a little more globally - we have the fact that we have no energy or water. If we don't have energy and water, we have no development. Then what do we have? Migrants coming to Europe. That symbolism, the parallel I want to draw is very simple, very banal and we all understand it very well. What to do in a situation like this? I am an advocate for the synergy of joint action of all key actors on the world stage. First of all I think of us, the European Union which is the most gifted of all partners on our planet anyway, but I also think of those who have interests in Africa, such as the US, China, Russia, and possibly someone else. I think sincere cooperation from all key actors should all be the goal to save the situation in Africa and enable people in Africa to come up with energy, water and everything they need in key infrastructure projects. If we approach it in such a way, we can resolve much of the problem we face today. It is likely that individual efforts will yield some results, but I'm sure not as synergy, if politically possible, because Europe is the only key political factor that can bring together perhaps some incompatible elements and make significant, rapid and strong steps in Africa. The other thing I would like to suggest is that maybe you should not give too much money directly to the African state. Maybe more money should be given, but indirectly. By investing in infrastructure where, after all, our European industry will have goals and benefits and thus we can avoid something that knows how to happen, which is a matter of corruption. In African and unfortunately, European countries it is ubiquitous and we know this very well. I am also inclined to talk about more resources that would be invested in energy in African countries, such as sun and wind energy, and not to make, which is my last and third message, those mistakes that we have made in energy development in Europe. So, that as much as we go towards renewable energy sources and even those local sources that won't be networked. And this is a good path for the development of rural areas in the territory of Africa. With these ideas, Mr. Commissioner, I want to congratulate you on your efforts and your work, and I believe that you will certainly pledge that at least some of it is accomplished.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 1750, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Marina Albiol Guzmán (GUE/NGL).", "mepid": "125048", "text": " Mr President, we welcome the fact that the resolution tabled promotes European development policies for the fight against energy poverty in impoverished countries, but the truth is that this is of little value while maintaining the current economic and trade policies of the European Union. It is of no use if we continue to export the European model of turning a basic need — access to energy — into a business and leaving a strategic sector such as energy in private and European hands. Here we have, for example, what happened in Peru: the gas available to Peruvians was cut in favor of the export of the resource by multinationals, such as Repsol, who get better prices on the international market. This is the way European companies act around the world. We are not in the European Union to give lessons about virtually nothing, but less on the fight against energy poverty. Without going any further, last week an 81-year-old woman died in Reus (Catalonia) because her apartment burned down by candles, because she had been cut off her electricity two months ago. In the European Union, the number of people suffering from energy poverty is increasing. For example, in Spain, since 2008, people in energy poverty have tripled and there are already about five million people, while energy companies have astronomical benefits. The three major Spanish electricity companies have earned more than 56 billion during the toughest years of the crisis: while the electricity receipt rose by more than 52%, electricity companies earned 20 million euros a day in profits. They were doing business with our rights here and plundering natural resources in impoverished countries. And clearly, as in all types of poverty, women are the most hit. Of the one three hundred million people in the world without access to electricity, 70% are women. It is the result of combining the policies of plunder with oppression.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 1751, "date": "2016-11-24.json", "name": "Xabier Benito Ziluaga (GUE/NGL).", "mepid": "135490", "text": " Mr President, access to energy by people in developing countries is a priority in our view. Energy is a right and is necessary for life as much as water; therefore it is a global responsibility to guarantee it. For many years, developing countries have been sought to travel the same path as the West over the centuries: to start their development with a highly polluting industrial era and low in labour rights to gradually become more technologically advanced industries and societies, and, in principle, fewer broadcasters of CO2. And I say in principle, because the West is still far from this goal. Fortunately, the consensus is that we must move directly to fair and low-emission developed societies on a global basis, in order to meet international objectives, such as the Paris Agreement, which set the goal of avoiding global temperature rise above two degrees. It is therefore universal justice and climate justice that developed countries collaborate in the development of the global south, ensuring, among others, access to energy through clean and renewable sources, but also by providing tools for adaptation to climate change. The opportunity to do so was Marrakech and it has passed. Developed countries do not want to accept and constantly dilute shared but differentiated responsibility. And this should not be an invitation to open the door to multinationals and the private sector. A clear example is the effect of biofuels or hydroelectric plants in Latin America. Multinationals use the pull of renewables to violate human rights, as is happening in Brazil and Central America with hydroelectric dams. In the Baixo Iguazú region in Brazil, the subsidiaries of Iberdrola, a company based in my country, in Spain, have expelled more than 1,000 families of their lands, without any alternative. The protests of these families in the face of this situation were responded with police brutality and tear gas, both adults or boys and girls.
