Two days ago, a devastating earthquake struck Nepal. At this hour, the death toll is almost 4 000, and well over 6 500 more people have been injured. We all have the pictures in mind. There is chaos in the country, in some villages all houses have collapsed completely, roads are torn up, roads are open, transport routes are blocked, historic sites in the country are completely destroyed, the hospitals are totally overloaded, there is no electricity and drinking water and food is scarce. The worst earthquake in the Himalayas in almost a century has affected hundreds of thousands of children and is in urgent need of humanitarian aid. We in Parliament welcome the aid that has been under way and call on everyone – the Member States and also all international organisations – to bring aid to the people affected as soon as possible. Our thoughts are with the victims and express our solidarity with the Nepalese people who have been so hard hit. Ladies and gentlemen! A week ago, another dramatic shipwreck occurred in the Mediterranean. It is likely that between 800 and 1 000 people have drowned – people who have set out to find protection from war and persecution, hunger and poverty in Europe. I know that many of you feel the same way as I do when I ask you again today to observe a minute's silence for the victims, that we ask ourselves why, at every meeting and over and over again, we have the impression that we are thinking of victims over and over again, but that we are not changing in politics what is necessary. to avoid such disasters. We will have a detailed debate on this here in plenary on Wednesday. I know – as I pointed out in the last plenary session – and I am deeply shocked, like many of you, that what I said in the last plenary session – that I do not hope to have to observe a minute's silence again in the next plenary session – has nevertheless happened. I can reach many letters from you, which have exactly that in their content. I know that is difficult. However, in view of the dramatic situation and also in view of the fact that a minute's silence is always a special event, we must not forget the respect for the innocent victims out of anger at the shortcomings that exist. That is why I therefore ask you to stand up from your seats, both for the victims in Nepal and for the poor people who have died in the Mediterranean. (The House rose and observed a minute's silence) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which I would like to pick up on a point that has been raised to me over the last few days and also today by a number of colleagues, but which is also very close to my personal heart. Nine people are awaiting execution in Indonesia in these hours. Among them are a French and two Australian citizens, an Indonesian citizen and five other people of other nationalities. Indonesia had a moratorium until the autumn of 2013 and has not carried out the death penalty. This moratorium has been lifted and the government, especially the new President, rejects any requests for clemency. The European Union has outlawed the death penalty and rejects it in principle. In this Parliament in particular, we have been working for many years worldwide to abolish this cruel form of punishment, which is unjustifiable. I therefore call – and I hope on behalf of all of you – for the Indonesian Government, and in particular the President, to refrain from carrying out the death penalty, to return to the moratorium and, in any case, to exercise his right of mercy, preferably abolishing the death penalty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-04-27.json", "name": "Richard Corbett (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "2309", "text": "   – Mr President, regarding Rule 32 and the composition of political groups, you made no announcement of any change in the composition of political groups.

But all the violence exists only because there is hatred against Christians. The buses are stopped there, then people are asked who is Christian, and they are then executed. That is why the cause of the violence is the Christians. Hatred of the Christian minority. We are dealing with a broader question. We had not originally asked to talk about Kenya, but we had originally requested that we talk about the global persecution of Christians. Kenya was just one example. I would simply like to remind you of the figures. 300 million Christians in this world live under the threat of persecution of Christians. 150 000 Christians die every year. In the Middle East, in North Africa, we had 20% Christian minorities at the beginning of the 1990s. Today, 4% are Christian minorities. This shows the pressure Christians are under all over the world. It is by far the most persecuted religious minority in the world. That is why we want this issue to be discussed and decided in the European Parliament. The draft resolution that we have already tabled deals precisely with these issues of the persecution of Christians worldwide. I cannot understand for my group that, although we are talking about the persecution of Christians in the text, we must not appear in the title. That is why we are asking for us to return to the old title. Persecution of Christians is such an important issue!

I therefore share the idea that it is a dramatic matter, which requires a sensible, serene debate in this Parliament. My group is prepared that, as soon as possible, a debate on the persecution of Christians in the world should be included on the agenda of the next Plenary. On the specific issue of the attack in Kenya, as the President well knows, at the Conference of Presidents we excluded the term 'Islamic', which was in the original title, so as not to raise it as a religious confrontation and, in fact, it was the EPP Group that then raised that the issue be that of persecution of Christians.

Today's debate on eCall is responding to the fact that on 2 March this year the Council adopted its position at first reading on the regulation on type-approval requirements for the introduction of an on-board 112 eCall system. The regulation is part of an initiative package aimed at ensuring the introduction of 112 eCall across Europe, which will be available free of charge to all consumers, regardless of the type and purchase price of the vehicle or country in which they are currently located. At the beginning of last year, the European Parliament and the Member States adopted a decision introducing a mandatory eCall system, which introduces from October 2017 the Pan-European infrastructure necessary for the proper functioning of the eCall emergency system.  The text submitted complements this Decision and lays down the requirements for the type-approval of eCall devices suitable for incorporation into vehicles. New types of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are to be designed from 31 March 2018 so that in the event of a serious accident, an emergency call to 112 is triggered automatically or manually. The European Parliament has long been one of the main backers of the introduction of the eCall security system. In the past, we have repeatedly pointed to delays in voluntary deployment, which have been caused by unavailability, high price and malfunction when travelling abroad. In July 2012, Parliament called on the Commission in its resolution to put forward the relevant proposal for the introduction of eCall as a public service. The requested proposal was presented by the Commission in June 2013, followed by intensive work by four parliamentary committees. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs supported the general line for the mandatory introduction of eCall and contributed several specific provisions to strengthening or clarifying the Commission's proposal. I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and colleagues for their cooperation and very valuable and beneficial opinions. In February 2014, the European Parliament approved the position at first reading. This post-election position represented a mandate for final negotiations with the Member States. The Council, like the European Parliament, has made several amendments to the original proposal. A total of three trialogues and many other working meetings took place in the second half of last year, resulting in an agreement between the two institutions in December. At this point, I would like to warmly thank the representatives of the Italian and Latvian Presidencies for their intensive and very constructive cooperation. In particular, the role of the Italian Presidency was crucial. I also want to thank the Commission, which has also made a significant contribution to reaching the resulting compromise.  During the negotiations, the European Parliament managed to push through a large majority of the amendments, including an explicit reference to the 112 emergency number, compatibility with satellite navigation systems, reporting and review, or an incentive for the Commission to further intensify its work on value-added services, which could bring additional benefits to consumers as well as to the competitiveness of European industry. Thanks very much for this to all the members of the negotiating team, the Secretariat and the services of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you for your excellent assistance. The resulting text also fully guarantees the right to privacy and data protection, which has been absolutely crucial for the European Parliament from the outset. The in-depth work of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has contributed to the detailed clarification of the rules on the protection of privacy and data. A vehicle equipped with eCall will not be traceable in normal operating conditions and will not be subject to any constant position recording. The system must remain idle until the emergency call is 9/11. The data set sent by eCall to emergency services will include only the minimum information required for the proper handling of emergency calls and will only be provided to emergency services. In addition, the internal memory data of the system must be automatically and permanently deleted.  Compared to the european Parliament's initial call, the effective date of the Regulation has been postponed. The launch of the system requires close cooperation between several actors involved and Member States have asked for more time to deploy the necessary infrastructure. I consider it reasonable to comply with this requirement so that the system operates 100% at the time of launch and that European citizens can fully trust it.  Ladies and gentlemen, in the light of these, I would like to call on you to express our support for the text tabled tomorrow during the vote without further amendments. The agreement, supported by the Member States, contains the priorities of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as well as the opinions of the associated committees, corresponding to the mandate given to me as rapporteur by the vote of the Plenary european parliament at first reading and is in line with the european parliament's earlier requirements.

Regrettably, the Commissioner who takes this file, Commissioner Bieńkowska, cannot be here today but I am taking this debate on her behalf.  I am convinced that without the enduring commitment from these committees we would not be so close to its successful conclusion. I would also like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN), the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), and the rapporteurs for the valuable contributions that they have made.  Road safety is a topic that concerns all of us and we have come a long way in making our cars and streets safer, but despite these improvements road accidents still happen all too often and, especially when a severe accident happens, we want to be sure that help is on the way quickly. However, until now, precious time is often lost due to delayed or inaccurate information about the accident. This time can make a huge difference between life and death.  The European Emergency Call System, eCall, was developed to solve this problem. eCall is an electronic system that automatically provides emergency services with the information they need immediately after an accident has happened, and by doing so it can drastically shorten the time between an accident and the arrival of help. This is the idea behind eCall and in Parliament this idea found strong resonance. One year ago, in April 2014, Parliament voted in favour of a decision that would put the infrastructure for eCall in place. Tomorrow you will have the opportunity to put the capstone on the eCall project by approving a regulation that will bring it into all cars and vans. I am convinced that we have arrived at a well-balanced and complete text. Parliament has played a vital role in shaping it and I endorse it without hesitation. As it stands, the text does not ignore the fact that private systems are already on the market and have proven their benefits. However, the eCall legislation will ensure that the system makes its way into all cars and vans in the future. As a result, many more people will benefit from it.  At the same time, data protection and privacy concerns have been taken very seriously. For this reason the public eCall system limits itself to the data that is absolutely necessary for its purpose. Information only leaves the car in the event of a severe accident and is not stored any longer than necessary. Therefore, drivers can be assured that their personal data is protected and that eCall cannot be used to track their movements.  I believe the compromise text can serve as an example of successful regulatory work on privacy and data protection. In this context, I would like once again to highlight the important contribution of the LIBE Committee. I know that many Members wanted to see eCall implemented earlier than 2018 and I can understand this impatience, but I am also convinced that we have a realistic timeline for manufacturers as well as the consumer. It will now be up to you, Members, to take the final step and turn this into law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 20, "date": "2015-04-27.json", "name": "Carlos Coelho", "mepid": "1892", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Sehnalová on her work.

As shadow rapporteur for this report, I support the text that comes to this plenary tomorrow and reflects an added value for road safety and the lives of our citizens. It's never too much to remember that the eCall system saves lives! In a Europe where thousands of families suffer from the drama of road accidents, the implementation of the eCall system with direct connection to the European Emergency Number 112 is not a duty to... It's more than a right. By automatically establishing, in the event of a car accident, a direct link to the European Emergency Service 112, transmitting a minimum set of accident, vehicle and passenger data, eCall will allow for faster, more effective and lower costly rescue. And at a time when many say that no more Europe is needed, the legislation on eCall, on the approval requirements for the deployment of the on-board system of vehicles on the basis of 112, is a good example that we really need 'More Europe'. And as at European level we can contribute effectively to matters as important as reducing mortality and better assistance to road accident victims. I would also stress that eCall is free, secure, works in all Member States and complies with strict data protection rules.

I think that the solution to the so-called sleeping system is exactly the right answer. This eCall system does not allow you to track which routes have been driven. Nor is there any provision for what many private systems already provide for, namely that data on the health status of the driver or the driver will also be stored. No, that is not what we want. We want a system in which the emergency workers arrive at the scene of the accident very quickly and so only the most necessary information is needed, namely: where has this happened, at what latitude has this happened, and how do I get to this place as quickly as possible as a helper?

Far too often we lose fellow citizens in traffic, deaths that could have been prevented thanks to the faster eCall system and therefore more efficient assistance. The eCall system can indeed save many lives. By automatically making contact with the emergency centres when an accident happens, a lot of time is saved, time that can often make the difference between life and death. The system also offers many other advantages: fewer traffic jams, more efficient assistance, lower costs of interventions, and so on. It is positive that in this way, the European Union can contribute to optimising the safety of our citizens on the roads. Other aspects are also taken into account, such as flexibility in future application and technological developments, as well as privacy protection. Only when the airbag opens will data be transmitted, which will then also be erased in a timely manner. That is why I cannot support the amendment that ALDE will table on this subject.

It requires a change of habits, it means trusting new technology, but technology such as eCall can help improve road safety.  For countries such as Estonia, with areas with a lot of traffic, it might be useful when rescue services are called immediately – although I would mention, to the colleagues who have said this system is free, that it is never free: the investments are made by the companies.

I appreciate that there have been significant improvements on the handling of the information being transferred in these systems. But let us be honest, the eCall regulation will not prevent accidents from happening. Road safety and preventing accidents is about solving the causes, for example high speed and alcohol influence on the roads. That must be done in order to significantly decrease accident rates.  Of course eCall is intended to send the emergency signal more quickly. However, I think that there is also a question regarding the capacity to really send that emergency signal, and that question has not been answered. Nonetheless, for the driver or the holder of a car, having the opportunity to have the eCall system in place is a good one, but why not allow the opportunity for the person who is buying a car to consent to this system; to say on his or her own: ‘Yes, I want this’ or ‘No, I do not want this’.

However, I still have some unresolved problems here. On the one hand, I see one problem in the fact that there are manufacturers who already have this system. What does this mean for them now? Do they have to install two systems, or what will be done?

It is therefore not proven that the system will work in areas of limited reception. Secondly, it will require significant infrastructure investment to make it work. Thirdly, independent research suggests that eCall will reduce serious injuries by only 0.5%. We will therefore have to divert measures from better and more effective road safety measures. Fourthly and lastly, the most important concern from my point of view is that of privacy and civil liberties. eCall will mean that all car journeys in the EU and their speed can be tracked.

This debate certainly made it clear that there is overwhelming support for the e-Call system and I am grateful for that support. I think overall that Parliament has once again shown its strong support and its determination to realise the benefits of the e-Call system, and it is certainly gratifying to witness such unity in general terms regarding road—safety issues.  It is primarily about new technology being put in place during the manufacturing process in cars and vans to establish the precise location and the precise detail of the accident. It is not about personal details of any individual – and this regulation provides the balance and safeguards on privacy that many of you were concerned about and concentrates on helping save lives following on from the accident. Of course accidents will always happen, unfortunately, due to driving behaviour, but no resources will be diverted, or should be diverted, by Member States from road safety, due to the fact that this is a technology that is included in the manufacturing process.

I agree that measures that directly save lives in an accident should be mandatory. A seat belt, for example, can mean the difference between life and death. The eCall system could help in the aftermath of an accident, but will not prevent it. The eCall would instead increase the chances of paramedics coming to the scene earlier, in the event that no one in the car is able to make a phone call or there is no other witness around to call emergency services.

This will save lives and bring us closer to our goal of reducing the number of deaths and fatalities on eu roads. For two reasons, I cannot agree with the speakers who reject the introduction of the system on the grounds of the protection of personal data. First of all, because for me, every single life saved is worth it to deal with it and introduce it. And that overshadows any other privacy rights. On the other hand, I do not understand the comments regarding the identification of the car. We all use GPS every day, just like we use our mobile phones. This can also be used to identify your current location or even your driving habits. Plus, it doesn't save any lives, it just makes our journey easier. So shouldn't we value the eCall system, which can save hundreds of lives a year, while significantly reducing the permanent damage to those who have been injured, because the system allows you to alert and receive help in a timely manner?

The great advantage of the automated eCall system built into cars is that it will be accessible to everyone, and it will not be a barrier if the driver has a disability, because the system will communicate independently via wireless connection to the 112 center. As early as 2011, I asked the European Commission in a written statement to put forward legislative and standardisation proposals in order to make service 112 fully accessible to all citizens and to facilitate the development of the next generation of fully accessible and reliable 112 services, independent of devices and networks, based on the concept of simultaneous communication.

The beneficial effects of a timely response in accident cases are manifold. With the application of the eCall system we can reduce these times by 50%. What does all this mean in concrete terms?

I would like to begin by thanking the seven co-sponsors for their excellent work on the resolution and the oral question that preceded it. I believe that the final text, which was reached following negotiations between the political groups on 360 amendments, reflects the European Parliament's position in a balanced way.  I start from a premise, namely that our work has focused on preventing and reducing excessive and extreme consumption patterns, thus making a clear distinction between responsible consumption and harmful alcohol consumption. Remembering that responsible alcohol consumption is compatible with a healthy lifestyle, we have dedicated ourselves to the issue of alcohol abuse and its harmful consequences. The harmful use of alcohol is still the third leading cause of foreseeable death and disease in Europe and is a risk factor for more than 60 chronic diseases. But alcohol abuse is linked to other problems, especially social ones, related to young people's habits, addiction, road accidents and certain forms of violence, including family violence.  Combating alcohol abuse must therefore remain a priority objective of the European political agenda, not only as far as public health is concerned; We must assume that not all alcohol consumption has the same consequences, since it depends very much on habits, methods and the type of drink.  The Eu ropean Union's alcohol strategy has been effective in supporting Member States' measures to reduce alcohol-related harm, and the work of the European Alcohol and Health Forum has encouraged the development of concrete and measurable actions to reduce the harm caused by alcohol abuse at local level throughout the European Union, but we need to do more Commissioner.  With our resolution, we strongly call on the Commission to start work immediately on the new EU alcohol strategy for the period 2016-2022, with the same objectives as the previous one, but with better differentiation within consumption habits and behaviour and attitudes towards alcohol consumption itself, in order to reduce abuse-related harm. The new strategy would also have a strong impact in terms of reducing health and social expenditure linked to the direct and indirect effects of alcohol damage and helping Member States to step up their efforts to develop policies and actions to promote healthy lifestyles and to inform citizens about the harmful effects of alcohol abuse.  We therefore call on you, in full respect of the principles of subsidiarity and better regulation, to step up your efforts to improve what has already been done and to fully achieve the objectives of this strategy. In the resolution, we also call for an examination of existing European legislation on the need to improve the alcohol information currently available to the consumer, stressing the importance of clear, concise and effective information on the effects of alcohol consumption and health risks.  But on one specific point we would like to ask the Commission for more information, namely the assessment of the effects of a possible adoption of labelling at European Union level that warns consumers about the dangers of abusing alcoholic beverages during pregnancy, for minors and when driving.  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that our aim is to make a valuable contribution to the Commission with a view to the adoption shortly of a new European strategy that can stimulate health prevention, promotion and education, reduce road accidents caused by drink-driving and make a better differentiation within consumption habits and behaviour and attitudes towards alcohol consumption with a clear distinction between responsible and harmful consumption. These, Commissioner, are the priorities expressed by the ENVI Committee in its oral question and subsequent resolution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2015-04-27.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I fully share your concern about the need to work together to address alcohol-related harm (ARH) across the European Union. At this stage, I wish to express my regret that Commissioner Andriukaitis is not able to be here this evening, but I am glad to be able to take this debate on his behalf. Alcohol is a killer and each year 120 000 EU citizens die from alcohol-related harm. The term ‘alcohol-related harm’ covers more than 60 types of diseases and conditions, including: addiction; injuries; liver, cardiovascular and mental diseases; and certain cancers. So it affects not only the individual drinker, but also many other people, particularly family members. Drink-driving, violence and the suffering of children and families with alcohol problems are all part of the bigger picture of the harm that alcohol abuse inflicts on society. Europe is still the world’s number one alcohol drinker, with an annual average of over 10 litres of pure alcohol per person and with significant variation among Member States, regions and population groups, and yet most alcohol-related harm can be avoided. The Commission is therefore keen to find the best way to work together with all stakeholders to deliver concrete results and to reduce alcohol-related harm. We therefore envisage shaping a framework of action to which the Commission, the Member States, Parliament and civil society can all contribute.  All our efforts need to be truly joined up and all of us have an important role to play. Of course, the Member States have the main competence and responsibility to address harmful alcohol consumption, for example by setting and enforcing age limits and regulating accessibility. Just last week at the informal meeting of Health Ministers, Member States expressed support for an EU approach to address alcohol-related harm. The Commission is indeed ready to do its part to support national efforts and, as such, the Commission intends to build on the solid foundations of the 2006 EU Alcohol Strategy and maintain its objectives and tools to work together with stakeholders. When I speak about the necessary tools I mean the European Alcohol and Health Forum as well as the Committee on National Alcohol Policy in Action, and the joint action we currently have with Member States to reduce alcohol-related harm. Along with the renewed EU Health Policy Forum, these tools can help secure the active involvement of all stakeholders, and in this way we can ensure that all efforts are unified and mutually reinforcing.  In addition to alcohol-related harm, we need to carefully consider alcohol labelling. I want to confirm to Mr La Via that the Commission has started preparatory work on a report about the possible use of ingredient lists and nutrition information for alcoholic beverages. Further discussions are, however, needed before we can announce a date for the adoption of this report. At the same time, I believe that we need to focus more on health promotion and disease prevention and place action on the main causes of chronic diseases – not only in relation to alcohol but also in connection with tobacco, nutrition and physical inactivity – into a wider context; in other words, we need a holistic approach to preventing chronic diseases.  Whether or not the paper or instrument that enshrines such action is called a strategy is not in itself important. What matters most is not the tool that we use or its name, but the achievement of positive results and outcomes. I am confident that the European Parliament, the Member States, the Commission and civil society, by working together, can succeed in reducing alcohol-related harm and, as such, contribute towards a healthier Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 61, "date": "2015-04-27.json", "name": "Alberto Cirio", "mepid": "124772", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Mr President, I believe that this is an important moment because we are closing work that we partly inherited from the previous parliamentary term and which we then tried to update, also respecting the sensitivities of the new composition of the European Parliament.

The social costs of alcohol-related harm are estimated to be over EUR 155 billion every year. I think Members will agree that this is quite alarming and shows the need for urgent action to reduce alcohol consumption and the harm it causes. Yet the EU’s previous alcohol strategy ended in 2012 and still we are waiting for a new one. We are also waiting for the Commission’s report on extending food labelling rules to cover alcohol. This was due by the end of last year. So it does not feel as though the Commission is taking this problem really seriously. My question is, why can we not have calories labelled on all alcoholic drinks? Why should alcohol be treated any differently to everything else? It does seem strange to me that we know how many calories are in a can of coke or a glass of orange juice and yet we are not told the calories in a large glass of wine, which are actually the same as in a slice of cake. Now you may prefer a glass of wine to a slice of cake – sometimes I do – but you need the information to make that choice.  One really important issue is to have clear warnings on the dangers of drinking whilst pregnant, because there is overwhelming evidence of the dangers of alcohol to the unborn child. Let me be clear, this is not about attacking our culture or trying to stop Europeans from enjoying a glass of wine or beer with their meal, but ultimately this is a really important public health issue – one which requires coordinated and targeted action from Member States and the Commission.

And in countries like Germany or the Czech Republic, people tend to drink beer. There are very different problems. We have the problem of binge drinking in the United Kingdom, which causes fewer problems in many other countries, and we also have a culture of wine or beer drinking, that is, an alcohol culture in Europe that looks very different.

However, alcohol abuse is the first risk factor for disease and premature death from 25 to 59 years of age. Its abuse also represents a negative economic impact of around EUR 155 billion/year. I therefore call for the renewal of the European alcohol strategy which has proved very useful and results-oriented and which ended in 2012. Central in the treatment of the alcohol theme is certainly the differentiated approach between what is different, that is, between drinking in moderation and problematic patterns of alcohol consumption, as well as admitting the regional and sub-regional variation of consumption patterns and considering the different vulnerability of different segments of the population to the harmful effects of alcohol. In particular, young people and the age at which they start drinking should be taken into account. We must give priority to issues of consumption during pregnancy, drunk driving and the adoption of healthy lifestyles. Consumers should be provided with the necessary information in terms of public health. There is a wide range of practices in the Member States with regard to labelling, lack of guidelines and some level of standardisation, which translates into unnecessary costs for businesses and barriers to the single market. Another important aspect is the definition of respect for the principle of subsidiarity and a minimum age for the acquisition of alcohol, since, from a medical-scientific point of view, brain development continues well beyond that age.

Personally, I am particularly pleased that we raised the issue in paragraph 30, that we must protect unborn life and that this also includes a strategy against alcohol abuse in pregnancy. We can learn from each other in Europe so that we can combat alcohol abuse in the best possible way. However, I also agree with those who say that much of what we can and must do falls primarily within the competence of the Member States and that Europe cannot regulate everything there. What is very important is what Alberto Cirio said: alcohol should not be put on a par with tobacco. The first cigarette is harmful, just as harmful as the tenth. But in healthy people in a normal environment, moderate alcohol consumption, for example the first glass of wine, is just not harmful. There are even studies that say that moderate alcohol consumption – and the \"moderate\" must be emphasized – can even prolong life. That is why we should not demonise alcohol, just as we should not, in general, avoid everything that people believe is part of an enjoyable life. In this sense, the motion for a resolution is broadly balanced, since subsidiarity and this aspect are also addressed with moderate alcohol consumption. However, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believe that improvements need to be made in some places. We are opposed to minimum prices, and even if this is only addressed cautiously, we do not need to have that in the resolution. I particularly believe that we do not need a uniform minimum age across Europe. As a result, there are different experiences in the Member States and different models, including how to start with certain drinks such as wine and beer and then allow other alcoholic beverages later.

In Germany alone, 42,000 people die each year as a result of excessive alcohol consumption. A new edition of the strategy, which has now expired, is therefore needed. I would also like to say something about the information on nutritional values on alcohol packaging. It is very important that we also tell those who consume alcohol how many calories they consume. For example, a litre of beer is equivalent to a bar of chocolate. Many people do not know this, and so obesity is also a very common consequence of excessive alcohol consumption.

But the first question is whether we really need a Europe-wide strategy that tries to tell people not to buy something by means of labelling. Alcohol can even be healthy in moderation. Paracelsus said the dose makes the poison. A small glass of red wine has more alcohol than a glass of cola, but, doctors say, if you drink little of it, it's much better for your health than coke. A glass of sparkling wine can also be positive in someone who has low blood pressure. I think it is very important to say positive for adults, not for children and not for pregnant women. Therefore, before you label – mandatory against pregnant women, for example – before you do something on the wine, which you have often done voluntarily, you should really educate.

I will continue with the young people, Mr President. It is necessary to raise the minimum age for alcohol consumption to 18. We are laughed at! This misses the reality of life! In most Member States, young people aged 16 and over are allowed to enjoy beer and wine, and then spirits from the age of 18. My own daughter laughs at me if I decide to do something like this! At the age of 16 you are allowed to get married in Germany, and you can drink the sparkling wine at 18? So, I don't think that's possible. The Member States have good laws on the protection of minors, which regulate this precisely. You may just have to make sure that these laws are complied with. That is not our competence.

Well. Warnings on bottles for pregnant women, for example: yes, fetal alcohol syndrome is terrible, and we must tackle it, but I think that if a pregnant woman drinks alcoholic beverages from the bottle – and there is the warning on it – then it is already too late anyway.

One in four young men aged between 15 and 29 has died due to alcohol consumption. For the same reason, one in ten young women dies.

As we know, 1 100 lives were claimed and over a thousand people were injured. It was a tragedy for everybody who lost their lives, for the families and for those who were injured, and it was a tragedy that could have been prevented. Although the garment industry in Bangladesh has been very successful over many years, this disaster drew attention to the shaky foundations on which it has been built. It also highlighted the world’s shared responsibility for taking action to redress the situation, given the links between the garment workers in Bangladesh and consumers all around the world. And let us not forget that EU citizens are the largest consumers as regards clothes made in Bangladesh. Through the Bangladesh Sustainability Compact, the EU, the US, the government of Bangladesh and the International Labour Organisation, referred to as the ‘compact partners’, have pledged their engagement to improve labour rights and working conditions in the Bangladesh garment and knitwear industry. Since the launch of the Compact in July 2013, health and safety conditions at the workplace have been improving in the Bangladesh garment sector. However, a lot of progress is still needed. These were the conclusions of the Compact follow-up meeting between all partners held in October 2014 and of the technical status report that we published last Friday. Since October 2014, the Commission has noted and welcomed the continued progress made by the government of Bangladesh to increase capacity and resources for safety inspections on buildings and factories, a responsibility they must fully assume in the long term. But there are outstanding issues and let me highlight them. The first of these is the adoption as a matter of highest priority by the Government of Bangladesh of the implementing regulations of the Labour Law. That was decided more than two years ago and it is imperative for the overall improvement of the situation, not least for the newly appointed inspectors in order for them to have clear rules to be able to work effectively. We hear that work is progressing, but I would urge the Government of Bangladesh to ensure that there are no further delays in adopting the rules and that all stakeholders contribute constructively to the process. It is also important that the implementing regulations address unfair labour practices, including remedies. This will correspond to the government’s commitment to prioritise effective investigation and the prosecution of those involved in unfair labour practices, including anti-union discrimination and reprisals. A matter of equal importance is that we expect the adoption of legislation to ensure that workers in export processing zones enjoy freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. I would also like to emphasise the vital role businesses should play in enabling labour rights and safe working conditions in Bangladesh. We have seen an unprecedented engagement by the private sector in all aspects of the Accord and the Alliance, amounting to more than 250 retailers from 20 countries, and between them they have inspected around 2 500 factories since the launch of the Compact. Inspection findings and remedial actions are publicly available online together with the summaries of government-led factory inspections. The Bangladesh Industry Association is also playing its role by actively raising awareness among its members of workers’ and trade union rights and the importance of a constructive social dialogue. We commend this engagement by the private sector. It must continue, including through building further on the supply-chain initiatives in line with internationally recognised guidelines and principles on corporate social responsibility. Going beyond Bangladesh, the Commission is actively engaged at multiple levels through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) with issues on corporate social responsibility in the garment sector. Finally, compensation is one of the burning issues and it was not directly covered by the Compact. The Commission continues to encourage garment companies and retailers to play their full part in the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund, regardless of whether they produced or sourced from Rana Plaza. It is important that the experience gained by the government from working with stakeholders on compensation contributes to ensuring that ultimately a sustainable system for insurance and compensation can be established in Bangladesh in the future. I thank this House for your strong involvement and support for the actions here and I am looking forward to the debate tonight.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 111, "date": "2015-04-27.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, two months ago I led, on behalf of the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights, a delegation in Bangladesh, in Dhaka. The main purpose of the delegation was to understand the extent to which working conditions of garment workers have improved following the Rana Plaza tragedy. It must be said that, despite progress, the situation of the 4 million employees in this sector, which provides 80% of Bangladesh's total exports, is cause for concern. We were able to visit one of the more than 4,000 garment factories in Bangladesh and realized that Rana Plaza was a serious wake-up call regarding the safety of the building and its employees, with increased attention being paid to this issue. Factories have begun to have fire protection systems, electrical installations made by engineers and, above all, to strengthen buildings. It's slightly better than it was before April 24, 2013 for those who work legally, not for those over 2,000 who work in the black.

The garment industry employs some 4 million people, many of whom are women, and accounts for its largest export sector. We can be thankful now that labour and safety issues have been improved as a result of the EU-Bangladesh Sustainability Compact – for instance 32 factories have been permanently closed in Bangladesh as a result of significant safety concerns.  Bangladesh must now ensure that the regulations required for the implementation of the 2013 Labour Act are adopted as a matter of urgency.

We are still stuck with the crazy model of over-consumption, throwing away clothes once they are ʽlast seasonʼ, and they are all costing the lives of the poor and voiceless people who are making them.

There were garments that we wear every day, intended to be sold by big brands such as Benetton, Camaieu, Kappa, Mango, Walmart and many others. Clothing giants cannot escape their responsibilities, they have no excuses. If you contract work in Bangladesh to certain companies and impose certain prices, you cannot pretend that you do not know and be indignant when tragedies happen. The European Union is not without fault either. Products made in Bangladesh enter Europe duty-free under a special agreement, and that is why the multinationals go there to produce, but these agreements must serve the development of poor countries, not the enrichment of multinationals, and despite the fact that the minimum wage has been raised, in Bangladesh the industry still pays the lowest wages in the world, imposing the harshest conditions.

Indeed I think there is general agreement that there has been progress in Bangladesh in important areas and the Commission was very quick, through my predecessor, to liaise with the US, with the ILO, with individual countries and the Bangladeshi Government to try to put together this Compact to see what we can do to prevent future tragedies, of course, but also to build sustainable development when it comes to labour rights, safe working conditions and a sustainable situation for the many women who work in this industry.  So, many things have been done but as I said in my introduction, we are far from happy. There is so much more to be done. We are pushing the Bangladeshi Government and we are repeating that they must do more, they must implement the provisions that they have enacted in the field of labour law, they must make sure that guarantees are also made in the processing zones and they must make sure that people can join trade unions and that they are allowed to act freely and independently, and here there is much more to be done. On the matter of compensation: the compensation fund was outside the pact. Around USD 24 million has been pledged to that fund so compensation has been paid out to many people, but not to all, and this must of course continue. The Commission is also providing support for the victims through rehabilitation and training for those who survived and those who have lost their jobs.  But we are encouraging companies to contribute to that fund. Many have; some are very public about that, there are lists online; some are contributing without giving their names; some are not willing to put down the figures and with others we are pushing for them to contribute. Many companies have contributed to inspection. More than 2 500 inspections have been carried out and we have jointly trained inspectors to be looking at this as well. The Commission will continue to monitor this situation very closely. As I said, we have just issued a report on implementation of the Compact which is available for Members to read and we have also made a joint statement with the US on what needs to be done further. In that report there is, as many Members asked, a reference to minimum wages and we will continue to monitor this very closely, in cooperation with partners in the Compact but also together with the Bangladeshi Government, working with them, pushing them, to do their part in this.  We are also considering a high-level follow-up meeting in Dhaka later this autumn to take stock, on the spot, of where progress has been made and what is still to be done, and I will be happy to continue the dialogue with this House on this issue. So I hope that we can soon be in a position to report further progress while knowing that this is not a situation that will change very quickly. We are also, as many Members mentioned, working on the issues of due diligence and responsible value chains with the ILO, with the OECD and with other partners. The Communication that the Commission is preparing for the autumn, in which we will outline our priorities for trade for the coming five years, will also play a role: sustainable value change, encouraging companies to exercise due diligence and to see what we have learned from the whole tragic Bangladeshi experience, to put that in the future strategy as well. In this, of course, I am looking forward to working with the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and others as well. We owe it to the victims of Rana Plaza and their families not only to commemorate the tragic events but also to make sure that we really bring about long-term change. It is not easy, it will not change overnight but we can do more, we are doing more and, honourable Members, you can count on the Commission to keep on monitoring this very closely; I am also counting on you.

I believe this approach is much more effective than management based on a single species. It aims to take account of interspecies interactions, such as the influence of the cod stock on herring and sprat stocks, and the other way around.  The plan should provide for a balanced, sustainable exploitation of these stocks and for the stability of fishing opportunities and thereby the livelihoods of fishers. At the same time, it should guarantee that management is based on the most up-to-date scientific advice regarding the status of the stocks covered, interactions between species and other aspects related to the ecosystem and fisheries. The most controversial part of this dossier concerns the scientific advice, namely target fishing mortality ranges as set out in Article 4 and Article 5. To explain to our non-fisheries Members, those ranges will indicate how much fish fishermen will be allowed to fish. Obviously the smaller the range of values, the smaller the amount of fish; and the broader the range, the more flexibility for the sector from one year to another. Values in the Commission’s proposals are provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) which is the scientific advisory body of the Commission. These figures are advised after careful analysis of all available data and applying scientifically reviewed and tested models. Some may say that the values of those ranges provided by the Commission were not in line with the reformed common fisheries policy (CFP). Frankly, that is partly true. They are not yet in line, but only because we have until 2020 to reach the targets set out in the reform. The basic regulation says: ‘In order to reach the objective of [...] restoring and maintaining populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, the maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate shall be achieved by 2015 where possible and, on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.’ So we have five years to fulfil the obligation of the reform of the CFP.  While setting fishing mortality targets, we should also take into account the most recent scientific advice. Let us not forget that we are politicians; we are not scientists. We should not play around with arbitrary formulas. We should listen to the scientists and wisely use their advice.  At the same time, I want to dispel some doubts. It is probable that future plans will be modelled on the Baltic Plan, but only in terms of structure. In terms of content, the principle of regionalisation will be applied. Therefore what we adopt for the Baltic cannot be copied for the Mediterranean or the North Sea. This also includes the targets. However, on the contrary, accepting arbitrary formulas would create a very dangerous precedent. This means that such an approach would also be used in other future plans for the North Sea or the Mediterranean Sea. How are we going to explain this to the fishermen? Many amendments have been tabled asking to follow the most scientific advice and this is exactly what I try to do. I want to use the FMSY (fishing mortality consistent with Maximum Sustainable Yield) figures advised by the scientific body, ICES, wisely.  Finally, I would also like to underline that I am against including seabirds and sea mammals in the text of the Fisheries Management Plan because we have different legislation for that. Let us not experiment with the Baltic. Let us follow science. Let us not mix the legislation and let us not confuse politics with science.

This is a big step forward for the European Union’s Common Fisheries Policy and I am very happy that, again, Parliament has taken the lead in making that step possible.  With your vote this week we will come one step closer to a modern fisheries policy that our citizens and the fishing sector can understand and support. The Council, under the Latvian Presidency, has also made considerable progress. Last Monday, it adopted its general approach on the Commission’s proposal. I believe that by maintaining this momentum we can finalise the plan by the end of this year.  This is the first multiannual fisheries management plan after the adoption of the new Common Fisheries Policy. We have to make this plan work to prove that the reform, as intended, can bring benefits to our fishermen, increase their income and provide for the sustainability of the fish resources. Those benefits include regional decision-making by those who know the regions best. They include more flexibility in setting fishing opportunities, and they include sustainability of the fish stocks on which local stakeholders rely. Allow me now to make a few comments on the report that you will adopt this week. As a Commissioner not only for fisheries but also for the environment, I welcome the amendments to include references to the Union environmental legislation. I believe this will strengthen the coherence between our two policies. I would also like to stress that the scientific advice has always been, and will always remain, the core element for decision-making in fisheries management. This is something that we must base our decisions upon when we manage our fisheries. The Commission has always followed the most recent and the most up-to-date scientific advice, as has already been mentioned by the rapporteur Mr Wałęsa, and I can assure you it will continue to do so.  I am certain we will have an interesting, lively and constructive debate and hopefully we can make good progress very soon after this week’s vote, but let me say one more thing. This plan is not only very important for the Baltic region and the countries that are directly concerned, but it will also be a positive precedent for other management plans to be adopted in the future.

It is clear that we are looking at a plan that has to be implemented in a specific geographical area with particular fishing characteristics, but also that it can somehow mark the future of other plans, and that is why we have to make sure that we get things right. It is committed to long-term management rather than annual planning, which will allow fishermen to make their forecasts while ensuring that they are always fished according to Baltic catch capacity. The rapporteur has tried to maintain a balance between the powers by making scientifically-based proposals and presenting a solution to the fishing mortality target, a sensible solution that ensures a balance and clashes head-on with those who propose, arbitrarily and without any scientific basis, percentage reductions that ignore factors to be taken into account.

This is the first proposal for a multiannual plan after the entry into force of the new CFP reform and at the same time a blueprint for subsequent plans. The Commission's proposal for a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea does not fully meet the objectives of the reform. We do not want the CFP to be watered down, but an improvement. Contrary to the CFP reform, Article 3 – objectives of the proposal – does not set the objective of replenishing and maintaining the fish population above a biomass level guaranteed by the MSY. The Commission's explanatory memorandum does not explicitly take into account the interactions between these stocks – cod, herring and sprat – and other ecosystems. The point of contention is Article 4 - Target values. Here we want to limit the target for fishing mortality.

It was caught uncontrollably for industrial purposes. In this way, the food chain was interrupted and the cod population and pelagic species collapsed. The only way to restore baltic resources is to temporarily cease all fishing and introduce conservation and compensation programmes for fishermen.

All of us who have fought for the new EU fishing law, which says that you cannot fish more than the sea can tolerate, are proud and want to see political action in the same direction. We are on the right track, but there is still much to be done. Cod in the Baltic Sea is not doing well. After a positive development over a few years, the number of cod is now falling again. The ones that exist are small and skinny. It is possible to reverse the trend if all countries around our sensitive inland sea cooperate. By reducing fishing for a number of years, we are giving cod a chance to recover. It is important to take a holistic approach that takes account of the fact that all species in the sea affect each other, so that, for example, the larger predatory fish are not deprived of their food. The EU is now to adopt a management plan for cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea. For us, it goes without saying that the plan will lead to sustainable fishing and a long-term good marine environment.

I would like briefly to reply to some more specific points which were raised by some of the honourable Members.  First of all, I totally agree with the statement that we are politicians and we should listen, we should rely more on scientific advice for guidance and this is exactly what we are doing in this plan.  With regard to some of the comments made about the Commission proposal, I would like to highlight that the situation with the Baltic sea stocks is quite good. Five stocks out of seven are at maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The Commission, together with the Member States, used to establish fishing opportunities delivering high biomass levels. Now that all the stocks are in good shape and low fishing effort may then cause reduced growth, to avoid this it should be possible to fish temporarily above the MSY. But this is something that ICES has confirmed and we are still adhering to the precautionary approach. I think this point was also mentioned by Richard Corbett.  I also agree with the point raised that different areas, different regions, obviously have different particularities and we cannot adopt exactly the same approach in the Mediterranean as we are adopting in the Baltic. As was mentioned, this is a great step forward and using the same words as were already said, a blueprint for the other multiannual plans.  One Member said that hopefully this will become a reality. It is important now that this plan is implemented so that it becomes a reality, but to become a reality, implementation is of the utmost importance. I do have faith however in the stakeholders in this region.  Mr Mato again spoke about the importance of taking the long-term approach rather than simply the annual approach, and I think that this is very important. This is one of the strengths of the multiannual plans. Again, the Baltic is a very sensitive ecosystem that we need to protect, and this is always kept at the forefront as one of the priorities. With regard to the long-term approach, ICES stated that the ranges are considered applicable for at least the next five years.  To Ms Hazekamp I would say that yes, unfortunately biodiversity is being threatened: not only that of cod but of most species unless we continue, or unless we make it a point that we need, to fish sustainably. Again this is in the proposal and that will help us to rectify this situation.  Mr Affronte, who I know made a very good contribution to all this, said too that this is a test for other multiannual plans. Yes, it is, and that is why we have to get this one right because if we want to look forward to other multiannual plans then we have to get it right first and foremost. I agree with what Mr Santos said as well: that this Parliament is committed to the common fisheries policy reaching its objectives.  Other points were raised and obviously we have taken note of these points, but to conclude I can only hope that after the Council’s general approach last week and after your vote this week, we will soon be able to engage in trilogue negotiations so that we can hopefully reach a political agreement during the period of the present Presidency, the period of the Latvian Presidency. This would then allow us formally to adopt the plan this year which would be an important political signal for the upcoming future regional management plans.

I would like to remind you of a very important point. I believe we have to stay true to our word, the word we gave last year when we voted in the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP).

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have negotiated for two months the measures that fishermen and national authorities will have to implement in order to implement this reform, which, it must be said, upsets the rules of the common fisheries policy. As I have always said, and I repeat today, the landing requirement will be extremely difficult to implement, particularly for multi-specific fisheries and small-scale fishing. Please, Commissioner, when your services are required to make legislative proposals, you must measure the social, environmental and economic impacts. The measure of requiring fishermen to disembark all catches made during a fishing trip is a generous idea, in itself, because it is intended to encourage professionals to be more selective, and that is what we want.  However, as I said, we see in practice that this implementation will be difficult. Our common concern is obviously to preserve the resource while maintaining a viable economic activity, but I remain convinced that we must focus our efforts on the selectivity of the machines. Fortunately, the agreement we reached in the trilogue helps to mitigate the negative effects.  First, the Commission will have to publish annual implementation reports that will assess the problems faced by fishermen and find solutions to them. These reports will be prepared using data from Member States. Sanctions for non-compliance with the landing requirement will not come into force until 1 January 2017, giving fishermen time to adjust. Measures to prevent the creation of sub-size parallel capture markets will need to be put in place by producer organizations. In addition, measures to facilitate the stockpiling and opportunities of landed juveniles will have to be put in place by Member States. Storage conditions for unsired catches on board have been relaxed in relation to the Commission's proposal - it was necessary - and finally, video surveillance for the inspection will not be mandatory.  You discussed the multi-year management plan in the Baltic Sea in the previous debate. This plan is very important, as everyone has said. It is the first developed under the new Common Fisheries Policy. It will serve as a model for all other plans, as Mr Affonte said, as you said, Commissioner Vella.  With regard to this management plan, I am also very concerned about the attitude of some Member States which, in the Council, are trying to override Parliament's prerogatives. Despite the court's recent ruling in the Venezuela case, which proved Parliament right, these Member States continue to challenge the codecision procedure for multi-year plans.

However, these conclusions do have a status, that of mutual trust between Parliament and the Council. However, France and Spain want to break that trust.  As Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I strongly condemn this attempt to breach the treaties.

It aims to end the wasteful practice of discarding fish back into the sea. Discarding casts a negative image on the industry, has a harmful impact on sustainable stock exploitation and marine ecosystems and affects the financial viability of fisheries. The omnibus proposal you are discussing today, and voting for on Monday, is an important step and will bring legal clarity and create a level playing field for the industry in implementing the landing obligation. I want to specifically thank Mr Alain Cadec and the shadow-rapporteurs for their very hard work and their commitment to find compromises. I am delighted that we have, in the end, reached an agreement that is acceptable to all parties. The compromise text agreed fully respects the basic elements and underlying principles of our initial proposal: to ensure legal clarity, to remove inconsistencies with the landing obligation from existing legal instruments, and to enable proper implementation of the landing obligation. But the next phase regarding demersal fisheries in the north-western waters, the south-western waters and the North Sea is approaching fast, so we absolutely need the kind of legal certainty that the omnibus will now provide.  I am happy to report that the development of discard plans for these fisheries is progressing very well. Member States’ cooperation has evolved, learning from the first experiences with the pelagic discard plans for the 2015 landing obligation. Work with the advisory councils has intensified along the way and the Member State groups are now bringing them more on board in the preparation of joint recommendations. Interaction between the Commission and Member States is also smooth and we are well on track to having plans in place before the start of next year.  What about implementation so far? This is a very important element and here I have to say that we are in close contact with industry and national authorities and stand ready to assist with the policy instruments already available in our toolbox. We have also been in discussion with the Pelagic Advisory Council to set up a Committee with a hands-on assignment to closely monitor the introduction of the landing obligation. Even in the absence of the omnibus regulation entering into law, we have not heard of any major problems since the start of the year.  We have received and replied to a few requests for clarification from Member States and the Advisory Councils, but these have all been relatively minor issues. Cooperation seems to be good between the inspectors of the different Member States regionally, and by and large our information suggests that fishermen are complying with the rules. In conclusion let me say that we are very appreciative of the responsible attitude shown by the Member States and the industry so far. We hope that this will continue to be the case in the future.

Some will like it more; others will like it less, but this obligation is already a reality that we have to assume. The objective we have set ourselves is to move towards sustainable fishing, but in order to achieve this, we must also know that measures must be articulated to make the changes we are proposing take action. We must therefore be flexible in adapting our fishermen to the new circumstances and, therefore, I believe that the agreement reached in Parliament on the proposal that there be a period of adaptation to the new obligation before sanctions are applied, as well as the need to submit annual studies or analyses on the functioning of this measure, has been a great step. We have reached an agreement, a good agreement on the 'bus', to clarify a little bit the rules to be applied. And I say 'a little' because the process of change , which is 180 degrees - initiated with the common fisheries policy has just begun and there is a long way to go in which we will have to take measures that require everyone's commitment.

Changes will have to be made in the context of the revision of the Technical Measures Regulation, as well as in the context of the desired regional plans, to address the new situation.

I am happy that Croatia has been granted an exemption from the landing obligation provided that the discard is less than 5 percent because such a decision is saving for our fishermen. Due to the fact that swimmers do not provide a sufficiently high level of selectivity when fishing, as well as an evident lack of facilities for the disposal of unwanted catches, Croatian fishermen were put in big troubles that have now been significantly alleviated.

The 'bus' regulation which we will vote on tomorrow aims to eliminate the contradictions between the new discard ban and the rules on technical measures and control. Following intensive negotiations, we have reached an agreement which adds a margin of flexibility to the obligation to land all fish caught. It must be noted that the commercial outings for fish that were previously discarded will be very limited and I believe that from this Parliament we have endeavoured to introduce in the Commission's initial proposal a number of essential amendments to facilitate the european fishing fleet's application of the new Community requirement. The fishing sector needs time to adapt. We know this well in a region like Galicia, where I come from, the first fishing region in Europe; hence the importance of flexibility and graduality contained in the Regulation. Landing all catches will possibly involve some changes in boat capacity and network selectivity, and the fleet, especially artisanal ones, may have practical difficulties that we cannot ignore. We will study carefully in the coming times the impact of the new requirement, and action will have to be taken accordingly.

It will be very difficult to implement, particularly in the mixed-species white fish sector which is crucially important in Scotland and elsewhere. I therefore welcome the allowance to give time to adapt, but there must also be support for additional methods of reducing unwanted catches in the first place.

In these cases, it is enough to have a species with a depleted quota or zero quota in case of closing the entire fishery.

Some Members have again highlighted a number of challenges that will be faced in the implementation of the CFP reform. We all have a common interest, which is to strengthen fishing and make it a sustainable industry. So we have to take on the challenges and work together collectively to strengthen our important fishing sector. As was mentioned, the transition is from discarding to landing bycatch, but the ultimate aim is to reduce and to try and eliminate bycatch as much as possible. One way of doing this is by going for more selective gear, while the landing obligation also promotes this idea. We have also to keep in mind that, when protecting the industry, we are doing this in the best interest – and in the interest of the long-term sustainability – of fishermen themselves. Some Members mentioned the need for flexibility. Flexibility does exist, with the de minimis provisions and quotas, which will be adjusted to take into account the discards as well. As many have mentioned, the omnibus is a temporary reform of technical measures. Other multiannual plans will follow and the review of control regulations will follow as well.

The European Commission should be able to tackle this problem by proposing a form of European cooperation between the various support services. This could be done in particular with the help of the European EURES network.

It is also a clear and strong call from the European Parliament for higher education ministers to take concrete action and commitments on the effective reform and implementation of the Bologna Process. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs, CULT Members, NGOs and the European Commission for working together on this report effectively.  The Bologna Process is an attempt to organise a higher education system in Europe so that it becomes widely understood, accessible, trustworthy, while remaining diverse or even boasting of its diversity. Our report focuses on assessing this process, on the issues that need to be improved and on the new challenges that this process has to face – such as youth unemployment, the economic crisis or demographic change. Although the Bologna Process has achieved a great deal over the last 15 years in terms of quality of education, mobility and recognition of academic diplomas, there are still many areas where urgent action is needed.  We consider it necessary to carry out the jointly agreed reforms in the countries of the European Higher Education Area consistently and to strengthen the bottom-up approach. There is also a need to focus the teaching process more on the student. What matters is the results of education – what the graduate knows and knows, not necessarily how he learned it. We also need clear and clear communication on the Bologna Process in order to raise citizens' awareness and support for higher education reforms. There is no doubt that the recognition of qualifications acquired abroad, periods of study abroad and previous education should be improved. This would directly benefit students. It should be possible for any student studying in any country of the European Higher Education Area to recognise their qualifications throughout the European Union. To achieve this, we need better strategies and practices to further improve the recognition of qualifications, to implement a European credit transfer and accumulation system and to develop and implement national qualifications frameworks.  An important priority for many countries is to improve the quality of higher education and to establish quality assurance systems. Increasing social inclusion and equal opportunities for access to education and the international mobility of under-represented and vulnerable groups remain a challenge for the Bologna Process. It is also important to strengthen the link between higher education and research by facilitating dialogue between the scientific world and society and promoting the beneficial applications of technological innovation in teaching and learning. Continuous investment, more effective use of available funds and the development of new funding models are essential. The objectives of the process cannot be achieved without sufficient funding for higher education. The Bologna Process is not only a 3+2+3 system, but a series of quotas that must lead to the creation of a European higher education system. That's what we expect from......

It must be acknowledged that significant progress has been made in the internationalisation of higher education. What is worrying, however, is the reluctance of students to use the Bologna Process or the Erasmus programme. This reluctance is due to two factors: concerns about language qualifications and insufficient funding. It is therefore necessary to consider measures that could solve these problems. Perhaps expanding the use of erasmus intensive language courses would encourage students to go abroad. It is also worth considering increasing scholarships even while reducing their amount or making them dependent on family income.  In addition to these problems, the structural flaws of the Bologna process hampering mobility should also be pointed out. The rapporteur mentioned one of them, i.e. difficulties in transferring ECTS credits. Students going to a foreign university very often have trouble with the recognition by the parent unit of the subjects passed there and have to re-pass the exams.

Dear colleagues, in the 21st century knowledge is a resource that is was exhausted faster than any technique. I therefore believe that European higher education must aim to provide the highest possible level of knowledge through continuous updating of curricula. It is essential for the sustainable integration of young people into the labour market that curricula enable the combination of knowledge with professional skills, promote the development of entrepreneurial skills, exploit the potential of new technologies and digitisation in order to develop a wide range of skills.

This report gives a good overview of developments since the Bologna Declaration, which was signed in 1999. It recognises the complex and broader context that higher education and the Bologna Process operate in. The Bologna Process has transformed higher education systems in Europe, and many member countries have made significant changes in order to bring a common higher education area into being.  As the report acknowledges, countries have modified their higher education structures and established mechanisms for better mobility, recognition and quality assurance in education. They have addressed ways of improving the social inclusiveness of higher education and ways to equip graduates with employable skills, to deepen how higher education contributes to society.  These reforms support core issues at the heart of EU policymaking too, by promoting social inclusion, enhancing learning mobility and employability of European citizens, as well as promoting the international competitiveness of higher education in Europe. But many of the commitments are still only partly implemented. The Commission continues to argue for wider and deeper implementation, and for this it is crucial to fully involve the academic community and relevant stakeholders, as Parliament’s report also underlines.  On the road towards a fully-functioning European higher education area, we face particular challenges and opportunities that we expect will be addressed at the Ministerial Conference in Yerevan on 14 and 15 May this year. The issue of youth unemployment and how higher education systems can ensure graduates have employable skills is at the top of the agenda and, in the light of the recent attacks on fundamental freedoms and knowledge inside and outside of Europe, we expect that Ministers will also address the contribution of higher education to maintaining democratic and inclusive societies in Europe.  Ensuring that higher education is properly inclusive of all sectors of society is indeed a constant challenge. Recognition in the wider sense is important for reaching talent where talent lies, for promoting more flexible learning paths, and for ensuring lifelong learning. Other challenges that the communiqué is likely to address go to the heart of the teaching and learning process and it is essential that we continue to put students at the centre of this process, in using the ECTS credit system or in quality assurance mechanisms, for example.  Last but not least we expect technology-enabled learning to be one of the main points on the agenda at Yerevan. New modes of delivery and a better use of online tools are crucial and offer a variety of opportunities for creating even more high-quality international education institutions, students and staff. The aim is the same as with traditional mobility – to ensure high-quality learning and teaching.  The Commission acknowledges Parliament’s call to help reinvigorate and indeed accelerate the Bologna goals. It also agrees with Parliament’s contention that education is one of the main pillars of society when it comes to promoting jobs and growth, and that necessary funding must be guaranteed when tackling youth unemployment.  Reforming higher education boosts the quality and reputation of Europe’s learning institutions, mobility and internationalisation, while at the same time generating sustainable growth and jobs. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that countries continue on the path of structural reforms, modernising and internationalising higher education in Europe to improve quality, transparency and trust.  The Commission welcomes Parliament’s call for countries to implement the agreed reforms and to support those countries encountering difficulties in this. We both recognise the challenges that have their roots in the different context and circumstances of the various member countries. The Commission agrees with Parliament that countries should be supported in delivering on their commitments, for instance through partnerships or working groups to ensure better peer learning.  The Commission has been a strong advocate for including targeted peer learning measures in the Bologna Process work plan, to support full implementation, and I am pleased to note that through Erasmus+, the EU is already supporting countries’ Bologna reforms. Last year, 20 programme countries received funding to address identified gaps in implementation, and the capacity-building strand of Erasmus+ provides support to the remaining members of the Bologna Process.  All our efforts for reform in education must be underpinned by the sharing of democratic values, in order to ensure an open, inclusive space for higher education to help sustain the future of Europe and its next generations.

In my speech today, the film, the European film, will play a central role.  In 2014 , a year of great success for the European film industry, almost 1,500 European films were produced, twice as many as American films. By contrast, the number of viewers who watched European films turned out to be inversely proportional. Most European films are shown only in the country where they were shot, and they rarely travel to other countries. Europe is a leader in the production of films in the world, but they are not always watched by viewers. We need to change that. And it is thanks to the film that we have the best opportunity to promote cultural diversity, learn the history and traditions of our neighbors. That is why, in my report, improving the distribution and promotion of European films is a key point.  In addition to cinema, which of course is the most important place for film screening, we have more and more opportunities for legal access to films on the Internet or via video on demand. In this context, there is room for innovation and a little more flexibility in media chronology. The European film industry should seek new business methods and distribution channels, increase the cross-border provision of audiovisual services and the portability of European films, thereby ensuring that EU viewers have access to an ever-growing and richer film offering through a growing number of platforms. However, the European film industry needs a stimulating environment in order to make full use of its cultural and economic potential, which will encourage investment or diversity of creation. One of the solutions to better circulation of films is to increase the number of European films with subtitles, as well as dubbing. Nowadays, when digital copies have replaced analog film tapes, translating subtitles is much cheaper and it is possible to add them in different languages to one copy of the film. Numerous film festivals, such as Cannes, Berlin and Karlove Vary, and lux prize films, which help european films reach a wide audience across Europe, play a major role in the promotion of films. A great example is the film \"Ida\" by Paweł Pawlikowski, which initially had a low viewership in Poland, and the huge notoriety and success in our country managed Polish to achieve only after receiving numerous European awards and an American Oscar. Of course, all these objectives will not be achieved without adequate funding. That is why creative Europe and the MEDIA sub-programme are so important, as well as funding at regional or Member State level and funding opportunities from the European Investment Fund. Public funding should focus more on expanding the audience of European films and increasing aid for international promotion and distribution. A very important point of the report is also the call for film education and, more broadly, media education at all levels of teaching from an early age. Film education enables citizens, especially young viewers, to use the media critically and bring them into the world of film art.  I would also like to stress the need to archive the film heritage for future generations. It is important that Member States adopt legislative measures that improve the level of digitisation by collecting and transmitting mandatory film copies. In conclusion, my report is only the beginning of a debate on the potential of European film in the digital age, which I hope will continue at the European Film Forum and will also be reflected in the legislative proposals announced by the European Commission, which parliament and the audiovisual sector as a whole are waiting for.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 246, "date": "2015-04-27.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which We actually have to keep to 11 p.m. I said earlier that I would take a few more speakers because there were only two members on the list of speakers.

European cinema and productions must be protected, especially when the nation states, instead of protecting our production system, grant derogations from the obligation to invest 10% of the revenue in the production of European works. In Italy, for example, the Communications Authority has granted a derogation of millions of euros to the American multinational Walt Disney which, by mortifying us, has made it impossible to find productions of sufficient quality to be transmitted in its channels, to the complete detriment of our creators and our workers.

I wish to thank the honourable Member Mr Wenta for delivering this document. It is in line with the Commission’s diagnosis on the European film sector and the policy orientations that are presented in its communication of May 2014 on European film in the digital era.  Parliament and the Commission recognise the value and wealth of European films. We also agree that the main weakness of the European film sector, compared with its US counterpart, is reaching out to wider audiences, especially across borders. In 2013, 1 546 feature films were produced in the European Union and only a very small fraction of those films were released in countries outside their countries of production. Of course this is linked to a number of factors, for example the linguistic and cultural diversity of the EU, the fact that European films are mostly financed with support from national or regional public funds, as well as the very small size of production companies active in the European market.  At the same time we believe that the sector needs to be encouraged to develop new business practices and to reap the benefits that digital technology can bring for this purpose. So the Commission has launched a stakeholder dialogue called the European Film Forum, which has as its main objective to bridge the gap between European films and their audiences.  There will be structured dialogues with Member States’ public bodies, the film industry and other stakeholders in conferences or in smaller groups in different locations on issues such as: the overall efficiency and effectiveness of policies in support of films, regardless of whether they are national, regional or European; the need to develop new working methods and business models in the face of today’s digital revolution; new strategies to increase public awareness and interest for European films and stimulate dialogue within the audiovisual sector on the impact of the forthcoming copyright reform; and review of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive in the context of the digital single market strategy.  Operationally the European Film Forum will adopt different formats depending on the issues discussed. Conferences, round table discussions, workshops and expert group meetings will be held and the first deliverables of the European Film Forum will be shared at a major public event due to take place in Brussels in the last quarter of next year. Parliament will of course be involved in this process. Furthermore, allow me to draw your attention to the European support programme, Creative Europe, and its media strand. This programme will continue to play a key role in promoting and distributing European films across borders. It promotes distribution in theatres, in particular through the network of Europa Cinemas. Furthermore TV programming as well as video on demand services receive support.  More recently the programme has taken over the preparatory action on the simultaneous release of films in cinema theatres and through video on demand, which provides incentives to the sector to innovate in the way that films are released. The Creative Europe guarantee facility makes available seed money to mobilise private investment and thus encourages the sector to become less reliant on public funding.  As for the Cultural and Creative Sectors Guarantee Facility, the Commission and the European Investment Fund will launch this new financial instrument for the benefit of audiovisual and other creative SMEs early next year.  In conclusion, at this time marked by the digital revolution, it is essential that a creative industry such as the film sector remains at the forefront of innovation. The Commission and the Creative Europe media programme will support this course in the coming years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 250, "date": "2015-04-27.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.

As a person from the digital industry, I believe that we need to stimulate the adaptation of the European film industry to this new era by providing additional funding, creating dialogue groups, supporting initiatives that help preserve our cultural traditions and the memory of European film, or supporting private initiatives that respond to competition from other countries in terms of film distribution.

It should be remembered that film is a cultural good, constant contact with European films is one of the best ways to learn about the history, culture, traditions or language of European neighbours.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work Our forests and forestry provide very good answers for an additional economic pillar and at the same time are the best guarantors of quality of life, sustainability, jobs and added value. With more than 3.5 million jobs, the forestry sector ranks third in Europe in terms of employment, directly behind the metal and food industries. More than 452 000 forest-based farms contribute 7% to EU economic growth. Only 60% of the annual offspring are taken in across Europe. Wood is therefore an important and, above all, European resource with great economic importance for rural areas and beyond. The careful care and sustainable management of European forestry companies and more than 16 million forest owners ensure that forests fulfil their ecological, economic and social functions. More than 50% of Europe's forests are privately owned. Guided by these figures, I have drawn up my report. The aim is to further strengthen forests and the forest-based sector in their social, economic and, above all, ecological role, to put the raw material of wood first as an important resource for Europe and, above all, to make sustainable use of it. The key points of the report include, for example, better coordination at European level. Energy, environmental, climate and economic policies have a major impact on the management of forests. Forests need to be better positioned in the various European strategies, while respecting the rights of the Member States. Furthermore, a very important demand on my part is not to create new bureaucratic hurdles for forest owners and foresters. Parliament is therefore strongly in favour of a clear separation of forest management plans and management plans for Natura 2000. This Parliament does not support the mere passing on of these public duties to forest owners. It is also important that there are no legal obligations on cascade use, but a real resource efficiency for the sustainable use of wood, and this is also required. Criteria for sustainable forest management are also important, which must also be a quality seal and are constantly targeted and targeted at the entire sector. Here it is important that there is no one size fits all criteria, but above all a strong focus is placed on regionality, taking into account, of course, the Forest Europe criteria, sustainable criteria as the basis for sustainable certification systems. Of particular importance for sustainable forest management as an economic factor and a workplace guarantor are also the so-called green jobs, which forestry supplies with its raw material wood and which make a particularly important contribution to environmentally-oriented production and also to education and training in this area, above all through sustainable forest management. Another important point is research and development. This has also been highlighted in particular. Our goal is to support new production possibilities and product ideas here, especially further development in the field of bioeconomy, environmental protection and climate change. And once again, a particularly strong focus on a low-bureaucratic implementation of the forest strategy. This is really about setting real priorities for growth, employment and investment. I also believe that we should upgrade the Standing Forestry Committee and strengthen its mandate in order to be able to involve the Member States more closely here. I would like to express my sincere thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture. We have worked very well together on this, but above all the opinion of the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Industry has contributed a great deal to the success of this forestry strategy and the position of the European Parliament.

Many things are on the right track – and I would like to support the previous speaker, Mrs Köstinger, on many things – the triad of economics, ecology and social issues, but also the very great importance of forests for rural areas and for urban areas and, of course, the commitment to the sustainable management of the entire area. These things are on the right track. But some things are open. Here, too, there are three things to mention: it is very important that we get European sustainability criteria. It is essential that we think about the fact that, although forests are constantly growing, there are also limits to their use in the forest.

On the first of these, tackling climate change, we already sequestrate – absorb – 10% of our carbon emissions at the EU level through our forest cover. If we could increase that forest cover, and I believe we can – in the Republic of Ireland they are going to go from 10% cover to 18% cover by 2050 – we will sequestrate more carbon and play a better role in tackling climate change.  Secondly, we can create a large number of new jobs in this area – in my own constituency of the North-East there is big job potential.

I am pleased to represent the Commission in areas where other colleagues are associated with the implementation of our new EU Forest Strategy – in particular Commissioner Vella, Commissioner Bieńkowska and Commissioner Arias Cañete, to mention but a few. In this sense, all of us would like to thank Parliament for its interest and engagement with the EU Forest Strategy, and in particular the rapporteur Elisabeth Köstinger and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this very important own-initiative report. We are glad that the EU Forest Strategy was also discussed in the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Let me start by saying that, while we do not have a common forest policy, the EU has a long history of contributing through its policies to implementing sustainable forest management and to Member States’ decisions on forests in line with the principle of subsidiarity. We have common values, objectives and common concerns regarding European forests and their future. Moreover forests, covering 40% of the EU land area, are an essential element in our environment, our economy and our society.  Several EU policies have an impact on forests, including rural development, climate change, industry, environment, bio-energy and the broader bio-economy. Through these policies the EU also makes a very important contribution to the implementation of sustainable forest management and Member States’ decisions related to forestry and the entire forest-based sector, as well as forest protection. From a political perspective too, I would like to underline that the new forest strategy is very much in line with the political guidelines of the Juncker Commission. For example, the strategy addresses the issue of growth and jobs, not only in forestry but across the forest-based sector. We should not forget that the EU forest-based industries represent about 7 % of EU manufacturing GDP and almost 3.5 million jobs, in particular in rural areas. Obviously this varies from Member State to Member State, given the large diversity of forests in the EU. For a country like Finland, let me just recall that when we include pulp and paper, roughly one quarter of its total exports come from the forest sector – but the services and the economic and social environment benefits that they provide to citizens are common to all Member States. Therefore the forest strategy aims to ensure that such an important natural resource for our economy and society will continue to deliver its economic benefits in spite of new challenges such as climate change and related threats.  But this is not all. The strategy also relates to climate change as it contributes largely to both climate mitigation and climate adaptation. It relates to biodiversity, as forests host a significant part of EU biodiversity and half of Natura 2000 zones are forests and other wooded land. It relates to energy: forest biomass continues to be the most important source of renewable energy and currently accounts for around half of the EU’s total renewable energy consumption. It also relates to other broader areas such as the race for innovation and skills, or the contribution towards sustainable bio-economy. As I said, forests are very different in the EU from Finland to Malta, from Portugal to Romania, so it is clear that the principles of subsidiarity, proportionality and better regulation will be at the core of the implementation of the forest strategy.  When you look at the strategy itself, the basic aim is to establish a framework for forest-based actions and support for sustainable forest management, based on the coordination of the different forest policies in Member States and of EU policies and initiatives relative to forestry and related forest-based sector activities. The strategy provides a holistic approach to forest management, it covers the economic, social and environmental benefits of forests. It takes an integrated approach covering internal and external forest policy issues and addresses the whole forest value chain, considering the important contribution that the sector can make to growth and jobs in the EU and, as I said, particularly in rural areas. Therefore, in accordance with the Council conclusions on the forest strategy, the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is developing a multiannual implementation plan of the EU forest strategy, which will contain the specific actions to be carried out by the Commission and the Member States, with clearly defined outputs and a timetable for implementation. Stakeholders will also be fully involved in this implementation. This will also increase the synergy between the work done by different Commission services for the implementation of the strategy, and it would facilitate stocktaking. So the timing of the initiative is very good and the Commission will carefully consider this Parliament report in the preparation of the multiannual implementation plan of the EU Forest Strategy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 266, "date": "2015-04-27.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Forests and forest managers play a prominent role in the life of the countryside, without them the development of the countryside is inconceivable. Forestry should therefore be adequately supported within rural development programmes under the 2014-2020 CAP. The Hungarian rural development programme adequately supports our forest.
