There is no doubt that relocation is vital for the success of our policy. The success of our migration and asylum policy is based on solidarity and responsibility. We have said this many times before in this Chamber. This is why it is so essential that relocation works, in all its aspects, and is implemented by everyone. One element remains critical for the success of this scheme: political will, political determination and mutual cooperation and trust between the Member States offering relocation and the beneficiary Member States. This is not for the benefit just of Italy or Greece. This is for the benefit of the entire European Union and our European asylum system because a properly functioning relocation scheme is also essential to prevent secondary movements and preserve the integrity of the free—borders Schengen area. Member States have so far relocated, in total, more than 18 000 persons, and we have to acknowledge the tangible and important progress made on relocation, especially during the past five months. However, further efforts are needed and Member States should therefore deploy additional effort and flexibility to make the relocation of all eligible applicants currently in Italy and Greece happen. But this cannot be the responsibility of just a few Member States: it has to be shared by all Member States. Our common goal is for all Member States to contribute fairly and proportionately to relocation. Right now 12 500 eligible applicants in Greece and around 4 000 in Italy are registered and ready to be relocated. If all Member States step up the number of relocations, it is entirely possible to achieve this goal by September. It is time – as I said before – to show political will and determination. Member States should also fully implement the recommendations that we put forward in our regular reports. Most importantly, Member States should increase their monthly pledges in proportion to their relocations and increase their capacity to process application requests. While many Member States have increased their contributions, there are regrettably still a few Member States that have not relocated a single person. I want to be clear that this is in breach of their obligations. More generally, Member States should also avoid overly restrictive or arbitrary preferences, should limit requirements causing delays in the transfer procedure and should give priority to applications concerning vulnerable applicants, in particular unaccompanied minors. In addition, the Commission urges Italy to speed up the procedures to identify and register for relocation all eligible applicants and to find mutually acceptable solutions on security interviews with relocating Member States. All those eligible for relocation arriving in Italy need to be channelled in an orderly manner to specifically designated relocation hubs. All Member States should relocate more unaccompanied minors, in particular from Italy. I am glad to see that Parliament’s draft resolution includes many of these recommendations and I really count on your support, honourable Members, to convince Member States – or rather governments – to implement them fully and strictly. Relocation is a joint effort that requires all Member States to contribute. Relocation is both an obligation and a moral duty. Thank you for your attention and I thank Parliament for its continued support.

Thank you, chairman. Thanks also to Commissioner Avramopoulos for his contribution this morning and for the many updates we have received over the past year and a half. I do not believe there has ever been a subject where we have had so close contact with the Commission. At the same time, it is a pity that the Council is not here today. After all, many of the questions we have should be put to the Council. I therefore deeply regret that the Council is not here today. It was two years ago in September that the Council took these decisions. That happened at a time of crisis: 180,000 people came in every month. It was political hassle. It took a long time. That is why I am again calling here today for the creation of a permanent system to be able to prevent such crises in the future under the Dublin Regulation. I agree with the Commissioner that the last few months have given cause for cautious optimism. We see that more people are actually being redistributed. But at the same time it is also a bit too little, too late. Given the reduced influx, that number of 160,000 is indeed no longer relevant. However, we must ensure that all eligible candidates actually get a place. Then I wonder how in God's name it is possible that some countries have done nothing at all, but also how it is possible that in a country like Italy only eight thousand people have actually been registered in the past eighteen months. Something has to be done on both sides. Finally, I would like to point out that I have never been in favor of mandatory quotas. But we have seen in September 2015 and over the last year and a half that it does not work on a voluntary basis.

Solidarity and full sharing of responsibilities are cardinal principles of our legal system and not tools to be used voluntarily if certain conditions are met, if the nationality of the beneficiaries is, for example, to our liking, if age and gender seem to us more appropriate. This restrictive and discriminatory system of preferences is punishable as much as the absolute lack of commitments. Choosing the path of denial of the right violates the human dignity of thousands of women, men and especially children, we deny them fundamental rights, we distance them from legality, we deprive them of a future. Rejoicing in an effort made by the Member States is a bit like considering a glass filled with a few drops of water full. 11% of the beneficiaries of international protection actually relocated is certainly not an achievement to be proud of. Only two Member States out of 28 that respect their commitments, two Member States that really do not want to know about welcoming asylum seekers in their territories, many others instead of words promise but in fact deny. There are only a few who, with great difficulty and slowness, are doing their part. And what will happen after September 26, 2017? What guarantees will we have that the obligations do not run out after that date?

It is accused that it is difficult to fill these places because the Member States would not cooperate sufficiently, but reports from the Commission show that Greece and Italy are not succeeding in organizing the flow. For example, there is a huge registration backlog in Italy. So it is unfair to just point the finger north. Moreover, it is not at all true that hardly any asylum seekers were relocated. Most of the asylum seekers who entered Europe traveled further to Northern and Western Europe themselves. Relocation is therefore already a fact in practice, because the Dublin rules on reception and registration in the first Member State of arrival, from which one can subsequently be relocated, are hardly respected in practice. In any case, the N-VA insists that the external borders must first be closed, otherwise it is mopping with the tap open. In concrete terms, we must return any asylum seeker who arrives illegally in the EU with the help of people smugglers to a safe place in the region of origin. As long as the EU continues to reward illegal arrivals with papers, families will continue to risk their lives along the way.

The decision on the relocation of refugees was taken by the Member States as an urgent and also necessary solidarity measure. However - and I would like to emphasize this very clearly here - without an associated EU asylum system, which is based on a shared sense of responsibility. Because that is precisely what is still missing at European level today. To this day, the only answer from the European side to refugees coming to Europe is mainly one: close borders and control borders. There are still 62,300 asylum seekers and migrants in Greece, waiting to be accepted into one of the 28 member states, while countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey have had millions since the beginning of the Syrian conflict five years ago Have taken in refugees. With this in mind, I would also like to remind the European Council that the relocation decision was a decision by the Council itself and was adopted by it. During this plenary session, we will be voting on a resolution on Syria, the EU strategy on Syria and relations with the Middle East. So I ask myself: how can we remain credible at international level if we are unable to implement small solidarity measures within our own borders, if our own heads of state and government do not fulfill the commitments they have made and which they themselves have made made mandatory for all Member States? To date, the Member States have actually and actually implemented only a small part of the redistribution that they themselves promised. This is not due to the ability, but the willingness, because the capacities are there. I think that is clear to us all.

We also ask the Member States to avoid subterfuges, I am thinking of the refusal to relocate migrants who arrived in Greece after 20 March 2016, in the aftermath of the agreement with Turkey, an illegal refusal, according to the Court of Auditors. For my part I add a consideration. Relocation risks being a deception if combined with the hotspot approach and the decision to relocate migrants who have traveled to other countries to Greece and Italy, based on the Dublin system. Taken together, these measures undermine the ability of Greece and Italy to manage the flows of refugees and migrants. As for Italy, in 2015-2016 there were 5 049 Dublin transfers and 3 936 relocations, i.e. more people were sent back to Italy than were transferred from Italy. Relocation, therefore, is necessary but not enough. The truth is that the Commission often goes to great lengths to help Italy and Greece perfect a wrong system, generating situations that have become unsustainable.

It shows how united Parliament is in calling for solidarity both among Member States and also with refugees. I would also like to thank the Commission, and the Commissioner especially, for again and again emphasising the fact that this solidarity needs to be shown: that this relocation needs to be made to happen. Relocation is a very important tool for solidarity, but it is also a very important humanitarian tool. It obviously helps Members States which have received a lot of refugees, and it helps the refugees finally to find a place of safety and a place where they can build a new future. But I would go so far as to say it gives a great opportunity to Member States which have not yet had much experience with refugees. They will get support from the Commission, they will gain experience and, in terms of accommodation, it will be a situation in which they know when the refugees are coming, and which refugees are coming – which is not the situation that any Member State could face at some point in the future. Therefore, it is very disappointing that the Council is not present here today because the problem, obviously, is not with the people speaking here today: the problem lies with the Member States and, as colleagues have pointed out, the problem is not one of capacity, the problem is not one of how we shall do this, it is purely a problem of political will. There is a scandalous lack of political will. We are talking here about people who are fleeing from war and persecution, and we are talking about unaccompanied minors: those are the people who are mainly stuck in Italy and Greece. How horrible can that be: to leave unaccompanied children alone, in overcrowded conditions without any possibility of a safe future? I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has said it will take action, insofar as possible, against those Member States which are doing nothing. Yes, relocation does not solve all the problems in the world. Yes, we still need a good Dublin system that puts solidarity in place.

They have each other's phone numbers. Together they provide an endless stream of illegal immigrants. The boats are waiting for each other off the Libyan coast. Frontex has confirmed this, but of course that does nothing to it. The cooperation with the people smugglers goes so far that last week there was even almost a collision between the Sea Watch sailing under the Dutch flag and the Libyan coastguard. In addition, the coast guard was even fired at. In a normal world, Italy would not allow these emigrants at all. But the EU obliges Italy to do this. The UN has meanwhile announced that no more than 3% of these people would ever be eligible for recognition. That means that 97% of those hundreds of thousands are not only illegal, but also hopeless, unwanted. They should be returned, but it is not. Therefore, the following must be done: First, no redistribution of these migrants. After all, that is rewarding criminal behavior. Second, illegal entry into an EU country must automatically mean exclusion from any residence permit, because then the whole route is immediately unattractive. Finally, any cooperation with the NGOs should be ended and, where possible, prosecuted for aid to human trafficking.

Therefore, participation in relocations should be voluntary for member states, but states must fulfill their voluntary obligations: prepare infrastructure, staff, and properly educate their communities. This is what the municipalities of Sicily do, basing relocation on two principles: voluntary and proportionate. Member States should fulfill early voluntary commitments, so I do not understand why the government in Poland has not accepted 7,000 refugees, including children. The previous government of Ewa Kopacz undertook to admit so many people. A country of 40 million can really afford it. That is why I am proud of the initiative of the authorities of many Polish cities and towns, which expressed their willingness to accept refugees, even if it concerned five or six people. If a small community is ready to look after one family, let them make this gesture. It is a scandal that the government does not support this. So not everyone in my country is immune to the misfortune and suffering of others. Our civil society is still doing well, although the PiS government is trying to limit its freedoms.

In practice, we see that the results do not justify us. Only twelve and a half thousand have relocated from Greece and the target deviates significantly.

The migrant resettlement program currently under negotiation and the prospect of punishment are also unacceptable.

Solidarity can also be expressed through border protection, law enforcement cooperation and humanitarian programs. Hungary has so far spent about 900 million euros on border protection and the Hungarian government is constantly expanding its humanitarian role in the Middle East. Mandatory resettlement is interpreted as an invitation for migrants and is also an encouragement to human traffickers.

I would like to repeat what Ms Kyenge said, that there is no solidarity à la carte. We have said it many times; and as Ms Ska Keller said, solidarity is one of the tools and ways for showing unity in practice. Madame Griesbeck, you's avez, you's aussi, you are very much in tune with the moral aspect of relocation. Let me say that I share many of your views and I count on your continued support, as I said in my introductory remarks. Relocation is often reduced in numbers, but we should not forget that we are talking about people who are in need of protection. Our shared duty, moral and political, is to make sure that they get this protection as soon as possible and in a manageable way for the European Union. This is the essence of emergency relocation schemes. That is why our focus right now is to make sure that everyone eligible is relocated to all Member States before September. Member States that have not yet relocated anyone, or have not relocated for more than a year, should make progress immediately. If no action is taken within a month, we will specify our position on making use of our powers under the Treaties, and in particular on the opening of infringement procedures: I am very clear on that. Let me also say that I understand your concerns and remarks on the deadline and the future, but these relocation schemes have not been set up as an intermediary step in view of the reform of the Dublin system: they are an emergency measure. Of course, as we very clearly said, Member States ’legal obligations do not stop after September 2017: if you have an outstanding bill, you have to pay it. I also took note of your views on the opportunity to revise the scope of the relocation decisions. But, as I said, our priority at the moment is to relocate all migrants in need of protection who are currently eligible. We need to focus on that objective. If all Member States actively contribute, this is perfectly possible and feasible - and I count on you to help us make it happen. Let me now shift to Greek since my compatriots have asked me some questions. Dear Greek MEPs, give me the opportunity to say a few words in our language on this very important issue for Greece, which, as we said earlier, is at the forefront together with Italy, with the result that these two countries accept the greater pressure. Regarding the situation in Greece, I would like to emphasize that, if the Member States finally meet their obligations, it is entirely possible, as I said earlier, to relocate, by September, all the candidates in Greece, about 12,400 people. I would like to emphasize here that Greece has completed all the procedures and, if this good cooperation continues, we will achieve our goals. As I said, some Member States are not cooperating and, at this point, I would like to say that tolerance and patience are now running out. I firmly believe in the value of understanding, dialogue and persuasion. So we had to start and that's what we did. But now we have reached a tipping point. The proof that this strategy is yielding end results is that relocation rates have increased significantly in recent months. But, as I said at the beginning, if there is no compliance, the Commission's next step will be, and you have no doubt about it, to support its policy both politically and legally. As for the European Union-Turkey statement now, I would like to tell you, because some comments were heard earlier, that it works and operated even under stressful and difficult conditions, with significant results and, as some of your colleagues referred to figures, I want to tell you that about a year and two months ago, there were up to 12,000 crossings a day, while this number has now dropped to an average of 50 to 60 people and we must keep this agreement, this conciliation, alive. Returns, on the other hand, to Turkey continue. Yesterday I was in Athens and had a meeting with the competent ministers of the Greek government and, I do not hide from you, that I was pleased to be informed about the acceleration of these procedures as well. And finally, as Mr. Kyrkos rightly pointed out: yes, unaccompanied minors are indeed our priority. This message must be sent to all Member States because, especially from Italy - I think some of your Italian colleagues have touched on it - not enough minor relocations are taking place. Finally, I would like to note that there is progress on this point as well. In any case, the debate that is taking place here today has shown that the European Parliament supports the relocation policy and the efforts of the Commission, and at this point I would like to commend the work of the Greek MEPs, but also to express publicly the My thanks to the European Parliament for supporting our policy. From the very first moment you have been the main supporters and finally the success of our policy will be judged by your contribution, which fully corresponds to the spirit of the Treaties and to the deeper moral and political content of the decisions and policies that we have jointly adopted. .", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 55, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Lorenzo Cesa (PPE)", "mepid": "28451", "text": "in writing.- There is no doubt that a global strategy on the issue of migrants is needed.To try to stem the crisis, in the summer of 2015 we took two emergency decisions to relocate thousands of refugees.Frontline states such as Italy, Malta and Greece have already done their homework in terms of hospitality.My country has rescued more than 625,000 migrants since the beginning of the exodus.In 2016, the number increased eightfold compared to the last three years.Now it is up to the other states that are part of the Union to participate in a solution in line with a welcoming duty.Four Member States are accepting very limited numbers of migrants, while two are refusing to participate in the redeployment.The concrete application of the principle of solidarity, evoked by the Treaties is decisive!If we do not know how to respond to this emergency we will have failed the primary task of our Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Maria Grapini (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124785", "text": "signed up. - Relocation and relocation are necessary policies to resolve the refugee crisis, but we must also consider prevention.

Today we are discussing the reflection paper on harnessing or shaping globalisation. We are not passive in this regard, but rather an active operator in shaping or harnessing globalisation. This is the second of five planned reflection papers to steer the broad debate on the future of the EU further, following publication of the White Paper on 1 March. It takes an honest look at what globalisation has brought to the EU. The fact is that, even if the EU has greatly benefited from globalisation, this means little to our citizens if the benefits are not shared fairly and more evenly. The benefits of globalisation are numerous. People travel, work, learn and live in different countries. They interact with each other on the web, sharing their ideas, cultures and experiences. Students have online access to courses run by leading universities across the world. Countries can produce more for less by specialising in what they do best and exploiting economies of scale. International competition and scientific cooperation have accelerated innovation. European exports have grown as customers worldwide demand the high—quality goods and services we supply. Eighty percent of our exporters are small and medium—sized companies so the beneficiaries of global value chains are those European SMEs and their workers. Actually, EUR 1 billion of exports supports 14 000 jobs in the EU. Imports are equally important as 80% of them consist of raw materials, capital goods and components necessary for the EU economy to function. Globalisation has also helped lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and has enabled poorer countries to catch up.  But globalisation also brings challenges. The benefits of globalisation are not shared evenly between regions and people. Many Europeans are concerned that globalisation is leading to inequality, job losses and social injustice or to a lowering of environmental health and privacy standards. For instance, countries with lower wages, environmental standards or taxes have increasingly competed with Europe in low-skill and low-value-added segments of industry, leading to factory closures, job losses or downward pressure on our workers’ pay and conditions. Some foreign companies and governments have engaged in unfair trade practices, such as dumping, tax evasion or subsidisation, that can lead to overcapacity and unfair advantages. These strategies deprive EU governments of tax revenues and contribute to unfairness. Many citizens consider that globalisation and uncontrolled migration directly threaten their identity and way of life. Citizens are anxious about not being able to control their own future, let alone the future of their children. These concerns must be recognised and addressed. However, the solution lies neither in isolationism, which has led to disastrous outcomes in the past, nor in laissez-faire politics.  The evidence presented in the reflection paper shows clearly that globalisation can be beneficial where it is properly harnessed. The EU must ensure a better distribution of the benefits of globalisation by working together with Member States and regions, as well as with international partners and other stakeholders. Together we should seize the opportunity to shape globalisation, in line with our own values and interests, in order to respond to its opportunities and challenges.  The question is how to do so, and it is vital to have an open and wide-ranging debate about that. The reflection paper offers some ideas in this respect. On the external front, the paper focuses on the need to shape a truly sustainable global order, based on shared values and a common agenda. The EU has always stood for a strong and effective multilateral global rulebook, and it should continue to develop this. For example, the EU could push for new rules and higher standards to create a level playing field by addressing harmful and unfair behaviour such as tax evasion, government subsidies or social dumping. Effective trade-defence instruments and better enforcement of domestic and international rules could also help the EU to act decisively against countries or companies that engage in unfair practices. The EU’s progressive trade and investment agreements should continue not only to open markets in a reciprocal way but also to enhance global governance on issues including human rights, working conditions, food safety and environmental protection. On the domestic front, the paper insists on the need to protect and empower citizens through robust social policies and to provide the necessary education and training support throughout their lives. This will equip people for the future and will redistribute wealth more fairly. The paper also underlines the importance of ensuring that Europe remains a competitive and innovative economy that will allow it to maintain its leading role in the world. This requires a vision for the future, in order to modernise our economy by embracing digitalisation, technological and social innovations, decarbonisation and the circular economy. It also requires smart specialisation, smart digital, industrial, tax or innovation policies and an improvement in the business environment. The EU cannot achieve all of this by itself. It is a shared responsibility, not only of the EU and the Member States but also of regions and municipalities throughout Europe. The main word we have to assess carefully is ‘resilience’. What are the policies needed in order to strength the resilience of our people – our citizens – and also our Member States?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 61, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Françoise Grossetête", "mepid": "2025", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the concern of our fellow citizens about globalization is very great and it is this concern that feeds populism of all kinds in Europe. We saw this again recently in France, during the campaign leading up to the presidential election, where extremes totaled 40% of the vote in the first round. I therefore congratulate the Commission, which seeks to provide education on Europe’s place in the world and on the concrete responses to be implemented. The European Union must live with globalization, but it must master it and it is essential not to turn in on ourselves. However, the European Union must actively defend itself to avoid suffering the harmful consequences of globalization which is sometimes savage. Furthermore - you said this, Commissioner - fairness in the sharing of benefits is essential. We must therefore urgently speed up the modernization of the Union, our economy and trade defense instruments so that the case of steel, for example, is not isolated. We need to be more ambitious on reciprocal access to public markets and support our industry rather than buying what we produce in Europe elsewhere. Our companies must be able to compete on an equal footing internationally, our jobs depend on it. By 2050, no single European country will be one of the ten largest economies on its own. The European Union therefore finds there a major reason for existing. How do you negotiate a trade agreement when you have a derisory economic weight against countries like China, India or the United States? This is where European competence in this area is very essential. That's why I would have liked us to be more ambitious, because your concept paper is a good thing, but it does not go far enough.

With this reflection paper, the Commission is putting its finger squarely on perhaps the greatest challenge facing EU citizens: harnessing globalisation. Former UN Secretary-General Mr Kofi Annan captured the challenge before us when he said if globalisation is to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. It must deliver rights no less than riches. It must provide social justice and equality no less than economic prosperity and enhanced communication.  Globalisation has created enormous wealth. However, it has not been fairly shared. Instead, it has been enjoyed by a privileged few. Globalisation has spread industries, trade and services but it has also put established rights, standards, values, wages and even jobs under enormous pressure. When 45% of Europeans feel threatened by globalisation, this is not a challenge. It is a problem. And let us be honest. Unmanaged globalisation creates real problems for ordinary citizens. Real wages for middle class Europeans have stagnated or even decreased, and youth unemployment remains close to 20% in the euro area. While citizens bear the burden of austerity-only policies and reduced welfare, the world’s richest companies and individuals pay as little as 0.005% in tax, as was the case with Apple in Ireland. Since 2015, the richest one per cent of the world’s population has owned more wealth than the remaining 99%. This is not harnessing globalisation. This is globalisation run amok.  The latest Eurobarometer shows that 74% of Europeans want more EU action against tax fraud. Let us take our cue from them. Let us act now. Therefore, I propose that the Commission develop a public ‘harnessing globalisation’ scoreboard. Let us make it crystal clear what the EU is doing to harness globalisation. When we adopt the EU blacklist on tax havens with strong sanctions, when real wages across Europe stop rising, then we will see real change.

In recent years, trade agreements have been hotly debated and I remain convinced that the EU should lead in promoting rules-based trade as a frame around globalisation. This frame of rules must always be based on our fundamental principles and high standards, and take off the sharp edges that globalisation can indeed exacerbate.  The Commission’s Trade for All strategy and the globalisation paper published last week map out what this leadership should look like. We must be rule makers, not rule takers. I believe there is room for more focus on the impact of technology on jobs and inequality. As much focus as there has been on trade, we hear little about the future of work, as well as the significance of maintaining the rule of law in a hyper-connected world. Here, too, the EU must be a global leader, especially as the US retracts, including when it comes to setting norms in the digital economy and digital trade.  But that is only part of the picture. The EU Member States should take much more responsibility for redistributing the macroeconomic benefits of access to third country markets more evenly at home, to re—school, redistribute and innovate as much as possible. Why do we not see a white paper from them? Indeed, let us not overlook how globalisation and interconnectedness around the world has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and creates mutual dependence, which contributes to greater stability. Europeans benefit from globalisation. Our smartphones, clothes and many different foods would not be in our homes and lives without it.

So if we want to participate in globalization, then we have to shape globalization. That is exactly what we as the European Union have been doing for a long time. Our companies benefit: cars, champagne, vegetables, fashion, we sell all kinds of products from European production all over the world, and on the other hand our citizens, our consumers, benefit from a huge range of products from all over the world. Anyone who briefly thinks about what they have bought in the last few days and weeks and where it comes from knows very well that globalization is something that, if done correctly, can have huge advantages. What we de facto need is orderly globalization. We should consider together how we can get away from some of the misdirections that we have about our concepts. We mostly call our agreements free trade agreements. But the issue of opening up markets is only a tiny part of our agreements these days.

Often, the debate on globalisation is polarised.

For me, this is the challenge of our generation: to manage globalisation so that free trade is fair trade. As you said, Commissioner, this must ensure that the benefits of trade are distributed fairly among our citizens. But in the last decade this has not happened in the EU. While our economy has grown overall, real incomes of middle-class households have largely stagnated. Commissioner, some of the messages to be sent to our citizens are contradictory. We, for example, have extra-judicial courts to enforce investors’ rights but no binding mechanism to enforce environmental standards, health and safety standards and decent work conditions. However, I do welcome this paper and the work done by Commissioner Vestager in trying to ensure that large corporations pay their fair share of tax, a crucial element for fair globalisation. At EU level, investment in universal broadband access allied to lifelong learning will be essential if EU citizens are to benefit from globalisation.

Of course, to say that globalization is the source of all evil is a mistake. This causes withdrawal into oneself, the rise of populism of all kinds and the return of protectionism which - this is the paradox - does not protect enough and is an illusion. To talk about protectionism today is really a bit lacking in reason. To take full advantage of this opportunity offered by globalization, Europe must invent a special identity for itself and, from the point of view of foreign affairs - which I deal with on a daily basis - that means promoting enhanced international cooperation. to establish an international order based on rules and high standards. The opening of markets and technological advances do not contradict the protection of human rights and the protection of well-being. This is our philosophy.

Yes, it is possible to protect European industries, but for that, you have to be bold enough to introduce a \"Buy European Act\", as all great nations do to protect their businesses. Finally, if we are to truly regulate globalization, we must tackle the root of the problem, which is tax optimization and tax evasion. To do this, we must include tax conditionality in our trade agreements to create a more just world.

Many Europeans, particularly young ones, see how being connected with people in other countries and continents can improve their lives. They are right to do so. Around a third of national income in the European Union comes from trade with the rest of the world. But, at the same time, many Europeans are also apprehensive. They see globalisation as synonymous with job losses, social injustice and low environmental health and privacy standards. Now is therefore the time to consider what the European Union can do to shape globalisation in line with our shared interests and values, to ask what we can do to protect, defend and empower European citizens, especially the most vulnerable, and to agree on how the European Union, from its institutions to Member States, regions, municipalities, social partners, wider civil society, businesses, universities and its international partners, can come together to harness globalisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 97, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Ramón Jáuregui Atondo (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "97078", "text": "- Mr President, I believe that no one questions the benefits of globalization, but to combat the malaise that is occurring in our societies I suggest three things that seem important to me.

Secondly, I believe that it is essential to protect the least qualified work, which is the one that suffers the most from social dumping, from globalized competition. Unskilled work needs legal protection - minimum wages, minimum income. This is a measure that must be incorporated into European policies.

But let's talk about the losers now. Those who feel they are losing everything that was important to them in this changed world, their jobs, their social esteem, their place in the world. That is why we need to shape globalization in such a way that it is an opportunity not just for individuals but for everyone. The situation of people who have already been disadvantaged and have lost their jobs must be actively helped, for example through targeted support, training and social care.

This is because I think it is the first time that the Commission is actually also acknowledging there are problems around globalisation. I think that is a very good thing. It is a very good start. Unfortunately, we see little action, let us say, in the paper. There are a lot of very important words, like realising concerns and pointing out the right problems. That is all very nice and very fair, but I think – as colleagues have also said – that we should move forward to action. We need concrete things. In other reflection papers there was more concrete action – we would say not enough, but there was some – but I think here, on globalisation, concrete action is missing. Let me mention some areas where I think we can move to direct action. Firstly, to end the race to the bottom between Member States when it comes to workers’ rights. Let us think about posted workers. I think it is very important that we safeguard the rights of all workers inside the European Union. Let us also review trade agreements. It is possible to do them in such a way that benefits European Union citizens as well as the citizens in our partner countries, but for that we really need to change the way in which we do trade agreements at the moment. We also need to lead the fight against climate change. We should not wait for others to follow the path or maybe also do something, but we need to be more ambitious in targeting the reduction of CO2 emissions, because we have no time to waste. If we lose our planet, there is not a second one we can go to. We also need to get serious about fighting tax avoidance and tax evasion – because I think those are key issues when it comes to social justice – by making sure that big companies which greatly profit from globalisation pay their due share and making sure that we can also afford investment, for example in education, good social services and sustainable jobs.

Instead, it would definitely cause more harm. Eastern Europeans with experience of Communism know that better than most.

It was good that Members brought many different dimensions to the discussion.  First, let me say a couple of words about the nature of the paper. This is not an action plan. This is a reflection paper, one of five reflection papers intended to promote wide discussion, not only here but also in Member States, amongst the stakeholders – national parliaments, governments and also NGOs and various organisations. We need to give direction to our policies on how to shape globalisation. My second point is that the EU itself is an example of rules—based globalisation. We are a product of globalisation. We deliberately decided to create a borderless Europe where people – students, the labour force, whoever – can travel across borders without any difficulty. We have created Erasmus, the single market – which is, by the way, a free-trade agreement – and common action towards climate policy, and we are about to create the circular economy regulatory environment. So this is what globalisation is in Europe, and we should take this elsewhere as well, shaping globalisation so that it is rules-based and based on values we believe in. Many Members rightly stated that we should not send out the message that the EU, Parliament or the Commission can address all the negative effects. In fact, many of the tools which need to be used are in the hands of the Member States. Education and social policies, for instance, are in the hands of Member States. I will give you a couple of concrete examples of what Member States can do. We have to strengthen the resilience of individuals and societies. There, for instance, the quality of education and the quality of teacher training is of the utmost importance. The better quality education we have, the better prepared our citizens are for changes. I like the word ‘resilience’ because it means that, whatever happens, we are resilient in facing challenges and we are strong enough and innovative enough to harness the negative effects of globalisation. Many Members, quite rightly, raised the issue of trade policy. This is part of globalisation. Globalisation is not only about trade, but trade is part of it. For instance, the EU—Korea trade agreement was agreed some five or six years ago, and since then our trade has increased by EUR 15 billion euros. As we know that EUR 1 billion of additional trade or exports support roughly 14 000 new jobs, increasing trade to Korea has supported some 200 000 jobs in Europe. I will put this figure in a local context. The country I know best is typically considered to have a Nordic high—cost welfare society. Regardless of high costs and a welfare-society structure, a well—known European car manufacturer established a factory in Finland. This was possible because of robotisation. I do not know which part of the world the robots’ components came from, but nevertheless robots made it possible to produce cars in a high—cost welfare society. The town in which the factory is situated is the town with the highest number of robots per capita, and it is the very same town that has the highest number of vacancies per capita. So this is another example of globalisation. Also, thanks to our trade agreement between the EU and Korea, those cars manufactured in a high—cost welfare society can be sold to Korea. That is just one example. Another example come from Sweden. You may remember that when the car manufacturer Saab went bankrupt, some five years ago, it was a big shock to the town of Trollhättan, where roughly 3 000 people lost their jobs. Since then, labour unions, together with employers’ organisations, public authorities and the private sector have worked together, and today three out of four people who lost their jobs have found a new job and the unemployment rate is lower than it was before the bankruptcy. Thanks to active policies and action at local level, they have managed to create new opportunities for citizens. My final point is that we must be a shaper of globalisation. I very much liked it when some colleagues said that we should be not a rule-taker but a rule-maker. That is why the Commission has proposed an external investment plan, because we want to influence sustainable development in our developing partner countries, for instance in African countries. The better we manage to support inclusive economic growth in Africa, the less reason there is for irregular migration and, of course, quality of life and fairness will increase in those countries. I hope that you will bring this discussion to your constituencies, promote a forward—looking discussion on globalisation and try to identify which policies are in the hands of the Member States or local authorities and which policies are in our hands here, as European legislators and decision makers, which should be taken forward in order to shape globalisation in a positive manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Președinte. –", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate was closed.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 110, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Ivo Belet (PPE)", "mepid": "28257", "text": "written. - Europe has one of the most open economies in the world, and trade with our partners has generated much wealth and jobs.

The EU must pursue plans, supported by Germany, France and Italy, to monitor and, if necessary, halt any possible outside investment in European strategic sectors.

In recent years, right-wing governments have been unable to put globalization in the interests of the people.

Now these governments and parties are trying to campaign so that they can still protect people from the harmful effects of globalization. Do we believe them? I do not think so. We need a governance in both the European Union and Hungary that can really tame globalization. It can stop jobs going abroad, dumping cheap products. We need a policy that can eliminate the worst by-product of globalization: social inequality. However, the solution is not the border lock, the wire fence, the protective duties. These can give a false security image, but in reality only make the situation worse. Will the wire fence stop cheap Chinese products or reduce our dependence on Russian gas? I do not think so.

This can be both empowering and disruptive for our labour markets but it is a sine qua non condition for success. Europe needs to focus on two priorities. First we need to equip our citizens with the skill necessary for the global workplace. Those are digital competence with higher profile. Mainstreaming training programmes for digital skills is the way to go. Already today 90% of all jobs require some level of digital skills. Second, in the age of internet of things, robotics, artificial intelligence, Europe needs to have a regulatory environment unlocking the potential of data flow, and even more, making Europe an incubator for innovation.

Lack of control, mismanagement, misguided development policies, the race to the bottom and the lack of rules associated globalisation with job losses, social injustice, squeezed living standards, rising inequalities and low environmental, health and privacy standards. The globalisation backlash has led to political disenchantment and an increase in the protectionist movements and populist politics that were the leading force behind a few elections’ outcomes, as well as the Brexit referendum.

Although recently it has become friendlier than it was suggested by the campaign announcements, it is certain that it will not be like in previous presidencies.

The Africa-Europe partnership, strengthened since our first summit in Cairo in 2000, has taken decisive steps in its exhilarating adventure. I am convinced that the next summit in November, which is being prepared, will constitute a new stage in our march towards a bright future for our peoples. The Africa-Europe couple has a beautiful history where shadows and lights have crossed paths in the past, but nowadays it is proud of its liveliness, its dynamism and its promises of a future horizon. in blue. Successive milestones in a series of contributions, from one side of the Mediterranean to the other, Egypt, Greece, Phenicia, Rome and Carthage had for centuries been weaving between our two continents, the web of an indissoluble relationship. Colonization, throughout two centuries, will have brought face to face our cultures and our civilizations so different in their spiritualities and structuring dogmas, but complementary in their humanism and their essential and imperishable inclination to freedom. The colonization of Africa by European powers was, of course, a controversial moment in our common history. Yes, there was domination, exploitation, enslavement, even slavery, that execrable insult to human dignity, the traces of which will not disappear as if by magic. Famous poets have immortalized this affliction. African and European thinkers and intellectuals have interpreted and explored this segment of our history. Politicians have made the trial of colonization and the hymn to the glory of decolonization the paradigm of their liberating doctrines. All have, rightly, fired the right lessons so that it never happens again. However, I did not come today, like a backward-looking man, to stir the knife in the wounds and even less to let myself be tempted by the illusion of a construction of a continental destiny by pouring myself out of the past past. I simply wanted, in the opening remarks of my intervention, to underline the indelible character of the scars left by this legacy of yesterday, as it is forged and inscribed in the collective memory of the African peoples. The story of our relationship, like any story, ardent and passionate, has not had only shadows. It is also - fortunately - a story of enlightenment, fruitful exchanges, reciprocal cultural and spiritual influences, enriching, invigorating and emancipating. This meeting has, over the centuries, contributed to the civilizational heritage that is yours, which is ours. Ladies and Gentlemen, our international environment is being rebuilt at a surprising and no less worrying speed. New powers are emerging, seeking their place in a world that has become multipolar. New challenges arise, for which the only hope for a lasting solution lies in collective and united action. In this restructuring of a geostrategic universe, which is also highly globalized, Europe and Africa inevitably seem doomed to strategic understanding, seized by the vital evidence of their community of destiny. Their history, their different but complementary values, their geographic proximity make each an extension of the other, inciting and engaging them constantly, with force and reason. Ladies and Gentlemen, in order to flourish and bear fruit, the partnership between the European Union and the African Union must be based on solid principles and define all fields commensurate with its multidimensional scope, its visionary ambitions and its global challenges, constantly extension. Mutual respect, equality, freedom and solidarity are the benchmarks and unalterable milestones for a solid, lasting, mutually beneficial relationship. Africa has gathered its minds to design and adopt an ambitious agenda for the next fifty years, aimed at building an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa. On examination, such an agenda cuts across some key issues, the Africa-Europe strategy, the tenth anniversary of which we are celebrating together this year. Agenda 2063 is today the banner of the African Union. It is he who guides our paths to the future and lays the foundations for our international cooperation and our strategic partnerships. Although Africa has been and remains the theater of many deadly conflicts, the main ones of which are in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, in the Lake Chad basin and in Central Africa, the elements of its rebirth are today. hui tangible. It abounds in wealth such as its mines, its fishery resources, its immense arable areas and above all the vitality of its mainly young population. Good governance articulated on a courageous and determined vision of African integration, trade incentives, the removal of customs barriers, innovative initiatives in clean agriculture and renewable energies, and technologies and services constitute an essential lever of the desired renaissance. Its economic growth rate has remained sustainable over the past ten years. Our ambition will support a merciless fight against impunity, mismanagement, corruption, waste and embezzlement of public funds. From this point of view, the priority for us relates to the implementation of the relevant instruments adopted by the competent bodies of our Union and the respect by the Member States of the commitments contained therein. The reform of the African Union decided by the the January 2017 summit is seen as a real chance for our rebirth in that it resolutely calls for taking charge of the organization on our own. As such, it is called upon to strongly support the positive trends observed. Our continent is now joining forces to roll back and eradicate the social tragedies it faces through drought, famine, armed conflicts and human rights violations. These crises and conflicts place the twin issues of peace and security at the top of our priorities. Silencing the guns by 2020 is a goal we are pursuing with determination and determination. The fight against terrorism, jihadism and radicalism is at the heart of our constant commitment to peace, security and stability to which we are devoting tireless and vigorous efforts, both in prevention and in post-conflict management and reconstruction. . We highly appreciate the multifaceted support that the European Union is giving us in this fight, in particular through the Peace Facility. Ladies and Gentlemen, all current and prospective expertises indicate with certainty that Africa is the region of the world which suffers the most from the degradation of the natural environment and climate change. The devastating effects on the fauna and flora irreversibly reduce - sometimes annihilate - the very possibility of life in large areas of the continent. The excruciatingly baffling paradox here is that Africa, the least polluting continent on the planet, is the one that suffers the most from climate change. In this regard, is it not superfluous to recall that Africa only benefits from the smallest portions of international efforts and sacrifices to thwart or, at the very least, alleviate the universal threat posed to humanity? climate changes? This question is one of the fields of our partnership, which must henceforth be better understood, better treated and better prioritized. To this requirement is intimately linked the opening of wide corridors to the African and international private sectors. It is also to be welcomed that European trade with Africa has increased in recent years by 50%, bringing the overall volume of European private investment to around 200 billion euros per year. The company is the primary creator of wealth, jobs and economic prosperity. Its crucial role in our economic and social development will now take pride of place in our policies and strategic partnerships. Our deep awareness of the imperatives of a new economic governance encourages us to situate ourselves in the perspective of a continental free trade area. This awareness makes us particularly attentive and sensitive to the ideas of investment in the private sector and the daring invention of a Marshall Plan for Africa, concepts opportunely defended by the German presidency of the G20. From this prestigious and honorable platform, I express our strong support for his efforts in this direction. African youth represent more than 60% of the population. Women make up more than half of Africa’s current population. Youth and the gender dimension are in our strategic vision cross-cutting concerns that feed into all our programs conducted alone or in partnership with other actors. The question of the emigration of whole sections of our young people in Europe poses a double challenge: to those who throw themselves blindly on the paths of the shipwreck, as to those who, without preparation, find themselves submerged by these waves of human beings. The challenge posed to us by all these phenomena has no solution, except for one: to develop Africa and to reinvent for our youth a better future on the continent. Our partnership finds a field here, still untapped, with an exceptional community of interest and mutual benefit. The diaspora, considered in our vision as the sixth region of Africa after those of North, South, East, West and Center, occupies an important place in our agenda. Its multifaceted contribution to the development of the continent draws on the intellectual and financial resources it provides. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have insisted in the preceding passages on the fields of partnership which are more or less common to us. They are the gist of the message you do me honor to listen to. However, I would be incomplete and my ardent thirst to speak to you from an open heart, without make-up, would remain unfulfilled if I did not ask the fundamental question of the relationship to be established between the universalism of our partnership and its relativism. Many questions attest, once asked, to nuances, and sometimes even to divergences, between Europe and Africa. It is not my temperament, nor the political philosophy on the basis of which the heads of state or government of Africa have elected me, to preach the conflict of civilizations, cultures, religions. My credo in this area is dialogue, the search for consensus, mutual discovery, understanding, the solidarity of civilizations, cultures and religions. I plead not for the construction of walls to protect oneself from the Other but for the construction of bridges to socialize and commune with this Other. (Applause) In building bridges, we cannot preach uniformity and the negation of differences. Our diversity is the engine of our movement, of our life, of our dynamism. Is it not unjust, dishonorable and harmful to elude, through diplomatic abuse, this fruitful diversity? Yes, Africa has views of its own on a series of issues: issues of international criminal justice and universal jurisdiction, the relationship between justice, peace and reconciliation. Obviously, the often overused slogan \"to African problems, African solutions\" cannot be used as an alibi or a pretext to legitimize deviance or other political misguidance. However, it is still very topical. I am delighted here at the remarkable vigilance of African civil societies and their mobilization in almost all areas of our cooperation. Perhaps, Honorable Members, you will find that I have overloaded the train of our partnership. I dare to hope to protect myself from my turpitude by the famous formula of Jules Verne: \"Nothing great is done that is not an exaggerated hope\". Ladies and Gentlemen, I invite you to consider that in Africa you have an open heart, an alert mind and firm, hard-working but generously extended hands. Thank you for considering this invitation and, even more, for accepting my heartfelt thanks for your kind attention. Thank you.

We had a longer-than-expected college meeting and I apologise for that. I am particularly glad that we have the opportunity to again share in this Hemicycle the work we are doing on Syria – especially today, as the UN has reconvened the talks: intra-Syrian talks in Geneva just started this morning. I spoke just a couple of hours ago with Staffan de Mistura again, the UN Special Envoy, who has this morning concluded the first renewed round of talks with the Syrian parties, for a new round aiming at entering into the substance of the political transition, including on constitutional setup. This is the process on which and in which the European Union is investing, supporting the intra-Syrian talks, the UN facilitation and the work of the Syrian opposition, the civil society, especially the women of Syria – work that we support every day with our teams, both in Geneva and in Brussels, but also in the region. So the European Union has a special role to play, to help the Syrian people end the war in their country. The European Union is not a military actor in Syria. I know some might argue that this makes us a less powerful player in the region. Even if, as you know well, I always value a lot whenever we manage or we decide to use also our hard power in some situations that require this, I strongly believe that the fact that we are not a military player in the Syrian crisis makes us stronger in the political context of trying to solve the problem and the crisis there, exactly because we have not taken part in the devastation of the country, and at the same time we have been on the side of the civilian population, all through the war, as the first humanitarian donor for Syrians both within and outside the country. Exactly for this reason, we have a stronger role to play when it comes to the political mediation and solution. First of all, let me stress one basic thing that sometimes we take for granted, but I think in these times we are living, it is definitely not something that is irrelevant: we are the ones contributing to the humanitarian work inside Syria and around Syria. We are the ones bringing aid through the UN agencies and international organisations; trying to save every single life; trying to bring every single child to school; trying to guarantee the minimum basic living conditions for Syrians. This is something I will always be proud of. Some might consider that Realpolitik goes as far as making this irrelevant. Let me tell you that the basic condition – not only of humanity from my perspective, but also for the political future of Syria – is that there are some Syrians left. I am sorry, this is very hard to say, but our work of saving lives on the ground, guaranteeing that people have humanitarian aid, medical assistance, food, water – basic, basic living conditions – is first a humanitarian duty, and second it is also a major political asset, also to be a recognised, trusted, political actor for the parties. It is precious: so precious that to me it is invaluable. Because we have not destroyed, because we help life, we can better help the Syrians rebuild the future of the country. And this is something that not only the international community, not only the region, but also and first of all, the Syrians recognise to the European Union. This is the core of the European Union’s Strategy on Syria, adopted by the Council on 3 April, with conclusions endorsing my joint communication with the Commission. This is our answer to anyone who believes – as I was saying – that we are powerless because we are not shooting. It is exactly the contrary. The entire European Union is united behind the goal of a political solution to the war and the means to achieve it. It demonstrates what we can do in practice to end this war and ensure that lives are protected, rights respected, democratic aspirations and needs are met. In the Strategy we outlined a clear set of objectives: seeking a political solution to the conflict within the UN framework; supporting the opposition – including the High Negotiation Committee – to develop their proposal for a meaningful and inclusive transition; and in parallel, as I said, working to save lives, to promote human rights, to strengthen civil society, the role of women, to promote accountability for war crimes – that is extremely important, and I will come back to that – and to support the resilience of the Syrian people. The Strategy indicates the direction of our actions. It is not a philosophical paper; it is a road map for acting together. Two days after it was endorsed, we have begun to put it into practice: hosting the major international Ministerial conference on Syria in Brussels, together with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We brought together 80 delegations from countries and international organisations from the region and the entire world, raising more than nine billion euros until 2020, including EUR 5.6 billion for 2017 alone. There was a risk of the international community being disrupted – of having a sort of donors’ fatigue when it comes to the support to Syrians, and I was glad to see that we managed to mobilise more resources than last year in London. This is important; it makes a difference to the lives of the people on the ground. But again, as I said, it makes a difference also for the UN and our support to the UN system – another political objective which is very dear in our hearts and minds in this period of time, and it strengthens the possibility for political work to be done in Geneva. More than two thirds of this amount comes from the European Union and the Member States. So, once again, we are throwing a lifeline to millions of Syrians, inside the country and in the region, building in this way the basic conditions for the future of Syria, the survival of Syrians. As you might remember, on the eve of the Brussels Conference, a terrible chemical attack hit Idlib’s province, and I do not believe this was a complete coincidence. Normally, as the international community gathers to work for peace and show unity, and determination and commitment, the enemies of peace tried to derail its efforts. But that very same day, from Brussels, from the European Union, from the UN, from so many countries and organisations, we sent two powerful messages. First, we all agreed that those responsible for these crimes must be held accountable. And last week, exactly one week ago, on Europe’s Day, 9 May, in New York, I was briefing the UN Security Council and sharing with them the fact that the European Union fully stands behind the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in its investigations: this is the right forum to document any responsibilities for the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The Brussels Conference also made a call for support to the new ‘International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism’, established by the UN General Assembly, which will assist in investigating and prosecuting war crimes cases in Syria. Accountability for us is key. Second, in Brussels we all committed to work for a political solution agreed among the Syrian parties as the only just but also the only realistic way to end the war. Accountability and the need to support a political solution and to be serious about that: these were also the main messages we heard from the representatives of the Syrian civil society – Syrian women – during the Brussels Conference. Together with the third word we heard a very powerful word from them: hudna, hudna, hudna. They were repeating it to us, and this means ‘we need a ceasefire’. We need violence to decrease and peace to reach some areas of the country. For three days, around the Brussels Conference, over 40 Syrians from all parts of Syria and from the diaspora, representatives of civil society organisations with very different backgrounds, women and men, different ages, worked to agree on a set of common messages for the Conference. Their representatives delivered their messages to the ministers in the political session. We have immediately turned into practice the Strategy’s recognition of the civil society’s crucial role, and I know this Parliament is particularly supportive of that – rightly so. These are the people who can reach across the conflict lines, talk to each other, heal the wounds of over six years of war, to make reconciliation truly possible on the ground, locally. And the expertise they hold will also be essential to post-conflict reconstruction. In fact, let me say the Syrians who came to Brussels from within and outside of Syria, different parts of the country, agreed very much with our determination to begin preparations for the day after the end of the conflict. Because too many times – too many times – the international community, and also Europe, was not prepared for winning the peace after a war had ended. It is a mistake that we cannot afford anymore; Syria and the Syrians cannot afford that mistake. Of course, reconstruction will only begin when a political transition will be under way, not before. This is in the hands of the Syrian talks in Geneva under the UN auspices that the European Union is accompanying day by day. But the European Union has already started to engage and to contribute to the post-agreement planning, in close cooperation with the United Nations and the World Bank. Also because this can be a very powerful tool, maybe one of the most powerful tools today, to support and accompany the political process, showing the peace dividend, being an incentive to the Syrian parties to find and implement an agreement. The same logic marks our Syria Strategy: we do not try to bet on the future, but to prepare for it and contribute to shaping it, together with the UN, together with the powers of the region, but most of all, with the people of Syria. Because peace can only come from the Syrian people, from a political solution agreed by the Syrian parties. This is the most complex and the most violent conflict in our times, and it is clear, I think, by now to all in the world that no regional or global power alone has the strength to solve it. We need forces to join along one line, which is a political solution agreed by the Syrian parties in Geneva under the UN auspices. All different initiatives – and we wish that all of them manage to deliver and to be implemented, including the ones taken in Astana – now have the big responsibility to converge towards Geneva, to help the Syrians build peace and find their own path towards national reconciliation. And there are no shortcuts for that. We have seen it for six years: Geneva, the UN process, the multilateral framework, these intra-Syrian talks are and must remain the only way to transition. As I said today, Staffan de Mistura has resumed the talks with a clear intention of entering into the substance of the transition, starting from the constitutional set-up of the country. The European Union stands there in Geneva, as well as the work we do in Brussels and in the region, to accompany the UN, their work, to accompany the Syrian people for a democratic, united and inclusive Syria to finally bring peace to the country and to our entire region.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 177, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Arnaud Danjean", "mepid": "96747", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Madam High Representative, our collective inability to put an end to the Syrian tragedy is not only a moral tragedy vis-à-vis the hundreds of thousands of victims, it is also a diplomatic failure that darkens considerably any prospect of stability in Europe's neighborhood. That is why no diplomatic effort should be spared to help find a solution. The strategy you are presenting to us is in many ways still terribly out of step with a reality whose horror seems to know no bounds. At least it has the merit of recalling some principles of a solution. Principles, let us remember, have already been put together for five years and which, we hope, will one day come to fruition. Of course, Europe is far from alone to blame for this failure. Others carry even more overwhelming responsibilities. First, the regime, which has been playing the worst-case policy from the start, but which still has support and a reality, not only in Moscow and Tehran. Jihadist groups, which thrive on chaos and sow terror on unprecedented scale. Irresponsible regional powers for which Syria is only a maneuvering ground for their own ambitions. And great powers that do not seem to appreciate how their so-called strategic visions are in fact small sordid very short-term calculations that fuel the crisis and have mutated it from a civil war to a lasting regional conflagration. Europe is unfortunately not yet a key player in resolving this conflict. We should undoubtedly have a more realistic approach to the balance of power, perhaps more modest ambitions, but in any case a desire at all times to exert all possible influences on those who have a share in the fate of the Syria in their hands.

We have to ensure that one of the main objectives of the EU Strategy on Syria is to facilitate a political solution, which should also include a UN monitoring and enforcement mechanism. Moreover, we have to make sure that the European Union plays the most effective and active role possible within the existing UN agreed negotiating framework. The European Union is the largest donor to the Syrian crisis and, through the last Brussels Conference, has committed itself to making a substantial post—conflict contribution to reconstruction. Madam High Representative, we thus call on you to leverage this significant financial contribution in order to play the most immediate and important role in the negotiation process and to ensure that a fair and just political transition will come about as soon as possible for the Syrian people. We cannot leave this in the hands of an illegitimate regime that has slaughtered its own citizens for so many years. We cannot allow this to continue with the support of Syria’s allies, Russia and Iran. We cannot let down the Syrian moderate opposition or the people of Syria. They are the ones to invest in and to protect if we want any kind of future for Syria – even more so now after the dreadful chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun. Civilians continue to suffer and to be targeted. Respect for the ceasefire has been violated many times, so we need to ensure that, finally, we have a ceasefire and, at the same time, that humanitarian workers will be allowed access. It is also very important to ensure that the recent memorandum on the setting-up of the de—escalation zone, signed by Russia, Turkey and Iran, will not allow further targeting of the Syrian moderate opposition.

Despite paying lip service to the fight against ISIS, Russia continues to target the majority of its efforts against other Sunni groups that seek to overthrow the Assad Alawite regime. Turkey is still driven by Erdoğan’s overriding aim of preventing the emergence of a Kurdish quasi—state on its Syrian border, regardless of the fact that the YPG forces have proved to be the most effective forces against ISIS and have received continuous support from Turkey’s NATO allies, including the Americans.  Western efforts have, with the exception of the US strike against the Shayrat airbase in April, exclusively been focused on the fight against ISIS. The Assad regime, with Iranian support, is meanwhile at its strongest point since the conflict began, consolidating its territorial gains and confident that Russia’s continuing military backing for it will give it sufficient protection. Such confidence was demonstrated by the horrendous chemical attack carried out in Idlib in April which killed 70 people. Such confidence has also resulted in other atrocious human rights abuses. Just yesterday the US State Department endorsed the findings of an Amnesty International report which claims that prisoners at the Saydnaya prison complex are being executed and buried and incinerated in mass graves.  In the Geneva UN talks, the departure of Assad is clearly the first point for moving forwards. I called in this House more than six years ago now for a no-fly zone, but all options must now be considered for the sake of defending civilians and their lives, of peace, including things such as transitional arrangements, territorial partitions and even amnesties, however unpalatable.

We started the debate 20 minutes late today, through no fault of the High Representative, but I think it would actually be normal and reasonable for you as President to inform Members. So that is just a kind request for the future. I would like to say to the High Representative that the discussion on the EU—Syria strategy is very urgent. Yesterday, the US Government found a crematorium next to a military prison to hide mass killings, reminding us of the limitless brutalities perpetrated by the Assad regime and its allies and the immense suffering of innocent people in Syria. It also painfully reminds us of our own promises when we said never again. We must focus on justice and accountability, and peace for the people in Syria. I am afraid that we are not, as the EU – as you said in the last debate that we had – where we have to be with regard to Syria. Not at all. Nobody is.  At last there is a common position among Member States – better late than never – with this Syria strategy. Indeed we must demand a much stronger role towards a political solution that is negotiated under the leadership of the UN. We must leverage our role as a major humanitarian aid donor and as an expected contributor to the immense task of reconstruction to persuade those who kill and destroy to end this dead-end street, to stop sieges, detention, starvation as a war crime, to save the people, and also to make sure that our own interest is better safeguarded. Besides the strategy, I would like to urge you again to do more to use the good contacts that you have developed in Tehran to persuade them to end the support for the Assad regime or face consequences. The same goes for those Member States, such as Italy, when there was an opportunity in the past, which have vetoed EU sanctions on Russia for their terrible support of the bombardment of innocent civilians. I believe there has to be accountability in the broadest sense and we still need more EU leadership because, in the vacuum that we leave, others take a role that will not benefit the interests of the Syrian people, nor our own.

Even though it is just a political strategy that, as I said and I agree with you, it is a lot, it is what is needed. Right away, last week, we heard about the recordings when there was a shipwreck in 2013 in the Mediterranean Sea, where 268 people died, including 60 children, who were literally left to death by the Italian and Maltese authorities, who did not pay aid. I have not heard a word of condemnation from the European authorities and institutions. And the question is, where was the European Union here? Was not. And these people were allowed to die because the European Union no longer had humanitarian aid, because it turned Frontex into patrolling, it let lives count less and it let borders count more when these people need help. Another issue has to do with bureaucracy. When it comes to relocating refugees, why does it take so long, why is it so bureaucratic? How is it possible that within the European Union there are children without papers? What is this conception of undocumented children within the European Union? So, cutting red tape is within our reach and finally, finally, Mr. President, allow me to finish, it has allowed everyone.

You pointed out that another round of the Syria peace talks begins today in Geneva. The expectations that there will be a breakthrough this time are still very low. However, there is the Astana agreement initiated by Russia, which gives cause for cautious hope, because the agreement provides for the creation of so-called de-escalation zones. The EU must now work to ensure that the UN Security Council is involved in monitoring these zones, particularly with the aim of sending a blue helmet mission there. The Astana Process can certainly be a helpful complement to the peace process. Of course, however, the upper hand must remain with the United Nations for a peaceful solution. It is good that the EU wants to promote a national reconciliation process in Syria and that it expects and demands that those responsible for war crimes and human rights violations are brought to justice. All EU member states must participate politically and financially in this. I call on the EU member states to give adequate support to the mechanism adopted by the UN in December to investigate war crimes in Syria. Reconciliation and accountability for crimes committed at war are essential for a peaceful future. I also call on Syrian civil society - both in Syria and in exile - to be involved as full actors in shaping the future of their country. Above all, the EU should strengthen those who work for human rights, equality for women and the development of democratic structures.

For me, for us, they are just counted, and their number is unacceptable in the unfortunate Syrian land, once the cradle of civilization and coexistence between religions and ethnic groups, today a hell of blood, extremism and violence. We have all learned of the tragic facts of Khan Shaykhun, deaths we mourn, violence that we condemn without reservation, calling for an independent UN investigation that ascertains responsibility because the guilty must pay. Unfortunately, however, I notice that not all the dead are mourned by the media in the same way. Just yesterday another 23 victims, including 12 women, were killed by the bombs of the international coalition on the border with Iraq. They add to the 352 officers since 2014, perhaps even more, I suspect. There are many forgotten humanitarian and Syrian disasters. In Deir ez-Zor for almost three years, as many as 120 000 trapped civilians have been under siege by Daesh, surviving only thanks to high-altitude air launches by the United Nations. Nobody remembers them. If that area were controlled by militiamen, I ask you, would there be more attention? While there is talk in Geneva, Syria is on fire and in Astana it is decided. Official UN negotiations appear to have been reduced to a mere proforma. On the contrary, in the Kazakh capital the plan of the four de-escalation zones is increasingly defined, a plan thanks to which the main global and regional powers are also discussing the positioning of their respective satellite militias, dividing their respective zones of influence. in the battered Syrian chessboard. The truth is that in this very complicated scenario it is now better for everyone to almost crystallize the conflict, rather than risk it being only one to win it. But the real question is: who is going to free Raqqa? They will be able to take on this huge and terrible task, even with the more US aid, only the brave Kurds of the YPG who for years have had to face Daesh? Will we continue to remain silent on the Turkish pressures, which continue to regard them as a terrorist organization and demonstrate their willingness to reach an armed confrontation with anything but veiled threats? Will we continue to tolerate that those who have been paying a very high price in terms of lives for years, who are fighting these militiamen ready to blow themselves up, could be attacked by a candidate country for membership?

I agree with the analysis, this makes us more credible in the transition and in the reconstruction, unfortunately it is impossible, however, to effectively implement a post-conflict plan as long as the various contenders continue to dispute the remains of a country now in ruins. Here we can make a difference, with our geopolitical and above all geoeconomic and commercial weight, towards regional and non-regional players.

It cannot honestly be said, with some exceptions, that the European Union is a selfish union. Now, obviously, it is necessary to go to the causes of the conflict, and it is evident that the European Union has to play a role in a peace in Syria that is stable and that is just.

How will we ensure the Astana deal does not provide a carte blanche for targeting the moderate opposition? What will we do to push the UN monitoring of both the agreement and humanitarian access already vetoed by Assad? I recognise that many colleagues have mentioned the de—escalation zones and that halting violence is a positive step, but if we do not want to replicate the December ceasefire, which ended in last month’s chemical attack, we need to address the points I have just mentioned. Furthermore, I would say it is critical that the lessons we learned in Iraq are implemented to avoid repeating the mistakes made there. Leaders who kill and maim have to face justice – there are no compromises about that at all. However, uprooting an entire administration will lead to yet another failed state. Those without blood on their hands should be allowed to contribute to rebuilding future Syria. Whatever shape the future governance of Syria takes, if it is not inclusive, it is set to fail.

The fact that we are not, as she also mentioned in her speech, an active military actor in this process, gives us, at this moment, some advantage in this process, in this phase of the process.

That is why I reject the Russian veto against the Security Council resolution calling on Assad's regime to cooperate with international investigators in the April chemical attack. Ladies and gentlemen, do you think that Assad would be willing to act if the US did not bomb Assad's armed forces? I am afraid that Assad would not be willing to act today. I appreciate that the EU has focused its attention on the future. Especially for humanitarian aid and also for education. There are 1.5 million Syrian children in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon who need education. So I am glad that the EU is helping to educate these children and is thinking about the future of Syria.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 240, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Julie Ward (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124963", "text": "   – Mr President, Rethink Rebuild based in Manchester is one of many grassroots Syrian civil society support groups from 17 different countries who are asking for urgent and robust action to address the situation at its root, namely through civilian protection.

First, the European Union is united on a Syria strategy with clear objectives and indicators for action, and I am glad to see that Parliament is no exception in the European unity that has at last been achieved with regard to the direction of our actions to bring the Syrian crisis to an end. Second, and still quoting our colleague, we can now use all our means of leverage – and there are many in different fields – to support, in the best possible way, the only solution we see, which is a political solution under UN auspices. And let us be very clear on what our means of leverage are. First, the humanitarian one. Humanitarian aid, I must make clear, is never linked to political considerations. Our humanitarian support goes to anyone who needs to be helped, anywhere in Syria, with no political consideration whatsoever. Some of you referred, for instance, to the World Food Programme air-dropping food aid. That is happening thanks to European Union support, so all the aid you are seeing, all the children you are seeing saved, all the aid, food and medical equipment you see being delivered, is because of European Union work. We are not an aid delivery agency but we are the ones that make it possible for the UN agencies to do the work on the ground. So our role as a credible humanitarian donor, I believe, gives us the credibility vis-à-vis the Syrian civil population that allows us to play a sound political role in support of the UN process. The second means of leverage we have is reconstruction. Some of you argue, or question whether, it is too early to reflect on reconstruction for the future of Syria. Some of you say it is too late, some of you say it is too early. The important thing is to have clear ideas of what you need to do at every stage of the story, which unfortunately is a very bad story. There is a powerful element in our starting to look at the possibilities for reconstruction. First, because it offers a positive scenario, a peace dividend, and encourages the various parties to compromise in Geneva, because they know that if they agree on a political solution, if the political transition starts, if we go towards a democratic transition with inclusive governance and reconciliation, there will be someone in the international community – starting with the European Union but not us alone – who, on the basis of that political agreement, will be ready to work on the rebirth of the country. This scenario encourages the Syrians – and they need a horizon of hope – and puts pressure on the Syrian parties talking in Geneva, because what the Syrian people want is to make peace. And if we fuel this request for peace among the Syrian population with the perspective of normal life returning to the country, and accountability and reconciliation, then this will also create a little bit more space for the political talks in Geneva to take place, entering into the substance of what is going to be the future set up of Syria. As I said, it should be a united, democratic, diverse, secular and reconciled country. United – not fragmented or split into areas of influence. The third element that Marietje Schaake mentioned was our leverage with Iran. Many of you mentioned Russia and the United States, and I will come to that in a moment. I believe that the European Union is best positioned in the world probably to talk with one of the main actors in this crisis. Now I will not elaborate here on the assessment of the role of Iran in the crisis because I think you know that very well, but if you want to make peace you have to talk to those who are making war, and we are among the few that have good, constructive conversations with Iran – in some cases trust-based, and always very frank, conversations. Do not imagine that we are not doing this. We are, on a daily basis, and this is what we have been doing with the regional initiative. Why is it so important, if it is not getting headlines? Why have we chosen the regional approach? Because it is Syrians who have to have the courage for the transition and the compromise and the solution, the political solution. And we need to build the conditions in the region for all the different actors, from Saudi Arabia to Iran, from Turkey to Egypt, and the neighbouring countries, Jordan and Lebanon, and others, to be able to live with whatever agreement the Syrian parties come to in Geneva. Otherwise we will start again and again and again. This is exactly the exercise we are engaged in, accompanying the work of the United Nations – and, believe me, if we use our leverage and we use our power and we put our leverage and our power at the service of the UN mediation, this is not giving up our role. This is serving our interests to the best; this is playing our role to the best because, for the European Union, the multilateral UN way is the way to resolve conflicts.  I have always thought that we were all on the same page on this, and that particularly at this moment it is essential for the European Union to help, support and feed into the UN multilateral efforts to achieve peace. Any agreement found will not be sustained or sustainable if it is not embedded in a multilateral, global UN framework. This is the work we are doing. To turn to Russia: first of all, some of you asked for my comments on the Astana process. I believe it is useful. I believe the agreement that was reached recently on de-escalation zones is good, but we have seen agreements of this kind before and we know very well that the point is the implementation. The point is the real de-escalation of violence on the ground. The point is real humanitarian access in all parts of Syria. That is the key. And that is why we are insisting on the need for the guarantors of the Astana process to guarantee the implementation of the agreement. They have a mechanism and they have a timetable that is also closely connected with the timetable of the talks in Geneva. We encourage the three guarantors of the Astana process to work to implement the agreement and also to create the strongest possible link between the military de-escalation efforts agreed in Astana and the political intra-Syrian talks led by the UN in Geneva. It is very clear to us, and I believe also to the UN Security Council Members – all of them – that the political, intra-Syrian negotiations should take place in Geneva under the UN leadership.  Some of you also asked me about the position of Russia, and the position of the US. Let me tell you very clearly. I met Foreign Minister Lavrov, as some of you mentioned, a few weeks ago in Moscow, and this work on Syria was the main point. We also discussed the situation in Ukraine as you can imagine. With Rex Tillerson the constant cooperation and coordination we have is producing similar approaches that you see in messaging and action. He called me on the day of Lavrov’s visit to Washington precisely to debrief me about the visit. I can tell you, sometimes we pay less attention than they do to what we are doing, and I find that quite a paradox. Last week I was in the UN Security Council, and the US Permanent Representative to the UN, Nikki Haley, referred to the European Union’s key role in the Syria crisis, mentioning especially the means of leverage we have in terms of reconstruction and reconciliation. When Rex Tillerson was in Moscow, look at the press conference Lavrov held with him: Lavrov mentioned the Brussels conference and the role of the European Union in this. Sometimes I have the feeling that we give the work we are doing less recognition than it gets from some of our interlocutors on the global scene. We should be more self-confident about what we are doing, and recognise it a little bit more. Our role is not only humanitarian, but it is based on this good humanitarian work we are doing. I shall finish by saying I believe that the region is, and will continue to be, the key. I will be in the region again at the end of this week, in Jordan for a regional forum. I see a lot of potential there to try and accompany the various Syrian parties in what are, in some cases, local processes that can open small bridges or small spaces for attempts at reconciliation. In Europe we know very well that no end of war comes easily. We have lived through wars on our territory that required not only a lot of mediation, a lot of reconciliation, a lot of transitional justice and a lot of accountability, but also a lot of reconstruction – physical reconstruction and also the reconstruction of the social fabric of trust among communities. This will be one of the most challenging efforts we will have to make, to support the possibility of different kinds of Syrians feeling at home in the Syria of the future and trusting their neighbours, whoever they are. We will move now to another debate that certainly touches on some of these issues, but I think that the European Union will also have to play the card, when the time comes, of reconstructing – or accompanying the Syrians as they try to reconstruct – the social fabric, and as they manage, we hope, to give rebirth to their country in a united manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 249, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 123(2) of the Rules of Procedure.

Forty-five people were killed and hundreds were wounded. Daesh terrorists claimed responsibility for the attack, because in their minds there is no room for the peaceful coexistence of different faiths. I will start with just one of the terrible attacks on Christians in the Middle East and mention the response that this madness provoked, which was one of the best responses I have ever seen to one of these attacks. Just a week later, on Easter Sunday in Jordan, tens of Muslim youths stood guard to protect churches and Christian believers to make sure that they could celebrate their holiest festivity in peace and respect. I believe that these young people of Muslim faith, these young Jordanians, are Daesh’s worst nightmare. They show the real face of the Middle East and they honour hundreds of years of peaceful coexistence of different religious faiths in the Middle East. You will remember well the message that His Majesty the King of Jordan delivered in this very Chamber exactly along these lines. When Pope Francis embarked on his historic visit to Egypt last month, he described Christians, Muslims and people of all faiths as fellow travellers. For thousands of years people of different religions have been fellow travellers in the Middle East, in Europe and in the rest of the word. At a time when freedom of religion or belief is coming under attack in many parts of our world, we have a duty first of all to preserve this diversity here in Europe as well. Religious or ethnic groups – Christians and others – are being forced to flee from lands they have inhabited for centuries. We can, and must, preserve the space for people of different backgrounds to be fellow travellers, sharing their land and their lives. Christianity was born in the Middle East. It belongs to the Middle East. Yet we know that entire Christian communities have been forced to leave their home countries and their region. The phenomenon is not new, but what is new is the trend that is now more worrying than ever. This is not only causing great human suffering to Christians as well as to many other minorities in the region but, if the Middle East loses its incredible diversity – that is a problem in itself – it would also lose its greatest richness. For this reason, the European Union is engaged on a daily basis to protect all minorities and every person’s human rights with concrete actions in several fields. I will mention a few of them. First, we systematically raise freedom of religion and belief at different levels of our political dialogues, including in our human rights dialogues with countries in the Middle East. Together with a number of partner countries, we have developed what we call our partnership priorities in order to promote common interests. The protection of human rights is always part of our own priorities. In the second field of action we always condemn violence against religious or belief minorities with public statements and with private demarches. Public advocacy is not always sufficient, but it reminds all these community groups that they are not alone in this struggle. In the third field of action we work to ensure that freedom of religion and belief remains prominently on the global agenda and specifically on the UN agenda, featuring a strong human rights approach. In the fourth field of action the EU Special Representative, Stavros Lambrinidis, is doing an amazing job and keeps raising these issues in all his official visits and dialogues – most recently to Egypt, just to mention one country. In May 2016, as a follow-up to the European Parliament’s resolution on the systematic mass murder of religious minorities by Daesh, we appointed Mr Figel' as the first Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief outside the European Union. In the fifth field of action we are seeking the broadest engagement of relevant regional actors and international organisations. Preserving diversity is, first and foremost, a Middle Eastern interest, so we will not stop working to protect all minorities. But we are not alone in this task and we look for cooperation with our partners. Sixth, we are providing very concrete financial support to local communities and minorities through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. The 2016 global call for proposals addressed the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and the new call on freedom of religion or belief will be launched in 2017, aiming at supporting local and international civil society organisations in promoting mutual tolerance and understanding. We are also providing support to Christians in countries where they are facing a precarious situation. In Iraq, for example, we are making sure that our projects for stabilisation also deliver on the needs of Christian communities. Last, but certainly not least, we are fighting terrorism through security cooperation, with our work to end the conflicts in our region, and by addressing the social, economic and cultural roots of radicalisation. In this work we also have a duty to get the narrative right and also to represent the best face of the Middle East: the face of diversity, the face of those Muslim young people protecting Christian churches. We must give voice, if I can quote Pope Francis in Italian: ...\"non solo alla inciviltà del conflitto, ma anche alla civiltà dell'incontro\". The narrative is important: to dismantle the narrative of those who believe that there is no space for living together either in the Middle East or elsewhere. Even in Syria – we were discussing this a few minutes ago – in the middle of the most violent conflict of our times, we hear stories of Christian and Muslim neighbours helping each other to make it through the war. The different religious groups and minorities – identities, groups – in Syria will have the major responsibility of trying to bridge the differences, the hate, and the difficulty of starting to live together again once the conflict is over. There is still room for hope. A future of diversity for the Middle East is possible, and we believe that this is work which we can do together with our partners, both globally and in the region.

Their security must of course be reinforced and the Egyptian authorities are making efforts in this direction. I believe that this issue must be placed in a larger context of persecution of Christians in the Middle East and that is why our political group has asked to have this debate, and not to speak only of the Copts. It should be noted that the proclamation of the caliphate by the group known as Daesh, or ISIS, is not only part of the war between Shiites and Sunnis, but is also directed against Christians. It is a fact that Daesh systematically targets Christians and the term genocide has been used correctly because it is precisely a desire to destroy Christian communities. As the High Representative has also said, the disappearance of Christians in the Middle East would be a tragedy that would mark the end of difference and of diverse societies. I think we totally agree and I think we absolutely have to prevent it. The European Union can act on several fronts, in particular by fighting against the instrumentalization of religion in conflicts.

I grew up as a Christian in the socialist dictatorship in an oppositional parish household. In doing so, I myself experienced with family and friends what it means when a political system encroaches on people's personal and freedoms and they even leave the country as a result. I welcome the fact that we are dealing here today with the situation of Christians in the Middle East. However, I would like to take this debate as an opportunity to call for freedom of all religions in the Middle East and in other parts of the world. I would like to address three points here. Point one: Freedom of religion is an indispensable prerequisite for democratic development in the Middle East. In view of the religious plurality in the Middle East, respect for religious freedom is indispensable for peaceful coexistence, as the High Representative has just said. I call on the EU to stand up for the rights of non-believers and those of different faiths in countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who are unfortunately trampled on there. In Egypt, too, the situation of Coptic Christians remains precarious. The wars in Syria and Iraq have led to the exodus of Christians and Yazidis in particular. These examples contrast with Tunisia, where the newly elected government has spoken out in favor of religious tolerance. For this it deserves the support of the European Union. Second, education and interfaith dialogue need to be strengthened. An important aspect of international support was made clear by Pope Francis on his last visit to Egypt. He emphasized that education and also religious education had to be strengthened in order to promote interreligious dialogue and contribute to peaceful coexistence. The EU can and should do more in this area. Third: the right to belong to any religion or to no religion, is universal and must be the benchmark for EU foreign policy.Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights establishes this universality of religious freedom.There is broad consensus on this in this House.On my initiative, in 2015 my colleague Rainer Wieland I published a call for active action against the worldwide persecution of religious minorities and for the defense of religious freedom as a human right.Members of this parliament from 28 countries supported this decision.Finally, I would like to mention the example of the award of the last Sakharov Prize.The European Parliament clearly supported two representatives of the Yazidi minorities in Iraq and Syria.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 255, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I have a long association with the Coptic Christians in Egypt through its large diaspora community living in London. The attacks of last month against two Christian churches in Egypt were the latest in a series of atrocities. These remind us not only of the continued security risk that Egypt faces from Al-Qaeda, particularly in the Sinai, but also of the wider plight that Christians as communities face across the entire Middle East. There are around 30 million Christians living in the region, the largest numbers based in Egypt, Lebanon and Syria. The Syrian civil war has tragically seen tens of thousands of Christians displaced and fleeing for their lives as Isis has deliberately targeted them both there and in neighbouring Iraq where, on a visit two years ago, I met a number of Assyrian Christian IDPs. I would like to take this opportunity to praise the efforts of the KRG in providing shelter for Christian refugees housed within its territory. Whilst I of course also welcome the support from EU Member States that has been given and offered to Christian refugees from the Middle East, I believe that it is important that we recognise that such expulsions of Christians is precisely the aim of groups like Isis, who wish to see a Middle East free of all non-Sunni Muslim religious minorities. Our efforts should therefore concentrate on establishing safe haven autonomous regions within the Middle East, such as in the Nineveh Plains in Iraq, and supporting communities to rebuild their lives and defend themselves in the places that their civilisation has been rooted for over two millennia. With some five million refugees and IDPs uprooted from their homes due to the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, it is easy for the plight of the Middle East Christians to be forgotten.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 256, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Hilde Vautmans", "mepid": "130100", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mrs Mogherini, I would like to thank you for the message of hope that you have brought in the particularly difficult debate that we must have again today. You are sending a message of hope not only to Christians, but to all religious groups that are today victims of persecution, discrimination, violence and murders. On the points you have raised, we must continue to insist on freedom of religion and, as Europe, take the lead for the respect of human rights worldwide. These are the things that we as Europe, as the European Union, must continue to do. We must focus on that. That is why I am very happy with the points you have listed. I would also like to emphasize that we must focus on punishing the perpetrators. As long as we uphold impunity, discrimination and violence will continue. We as Europe must also focus on that. It is a sign of real respect for human rights that you bring to order the perpetrators of discrimination and murders. Finally, Mrs Mogherini, you know that we as Liberals attach great importance to peace and stability in the region. I do not know how many times I have debated with you here on the Middle East, on Israel and Palestine. Well, next Thursday we will be putting an important resolution to the vote.

In Sweden today live about 120,000 people from the ethno-Christian group Assyrians / Syrians / Chaldeans originating from Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Many arrived as early as the 1970s, but a large number have arrived recently. But as the diasporas of Europe grow, the continued existence of Christians in the Middle East is seriously threatened. But the wars in the immediate area will one day end, after all, and then we must be prepared to provide support for reconstruction and the opportunity for all those who want to return to their homes to do so. But for that to be possible, all religious and ethnic minority groups must have both the right and the opportunity to live in their historic and traditional homelands in dignity, equality and security, and to enjoy their democratic, human and political rights. Mrs Mogherini has already told us about everything we do, and that is very good. But we can also be a major contributor to promoting political dialogue.

It is not just IS, Al-Qaida, Al-Nusra - with the best possible support from Saudi Arabia - who are responsible here. We can say that an increasingly fanatical, aggressive Islam also does its part. This can also be seen in organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood. Because the Sharia ultimately does not tolerate a Christian minority and certainly not the practice of religion. Nevertheless, the European Parliament and the Commission also court European branches of the Muslim Brotherhood such as the organizations ENORB or FEMYSO.

In fact, it was in many of these communities that the first approximation between the Christian religion and classical philosophical thought took place. Christians who represented around 20% a century ago are now reduced to 3 or 4% of the region's population. Especially in the past 15 years, Christians in the Middle East have been subjected to discrimination, persecution and violence that often results in exile or death. The terrorist attacks carried out against religious minorities in this part of the globe are not new, not even exclusive to the Christian religion. Muslims who profess other conceptions of Islam are, moreover, the main victims of some kind of Islamic extremism. There, as here, terrorism uses atrocious violence, scares, dehumanizes and, finally, kills. In the territories occupied by the Islamic State, the Christian community is subjected to humiliation and absolutely demeaning pressure to convert to Islam. Populations are slaughtered, women are raped and turned into sex slaves. Outside these territories, terrorist attacks are carried out that kill believers in the sacred place of worship. We all remember, as has already been mentioned, the recent terrorist attacks in Egypt, two explosions on Palm Sunday, one inside a church, another outside another Catholic place of worship, 45 dead and more than 100 wounded. The war between Sunnis and Shiites, the growing influence of Islam on political institutions and the disruption of the state resulting from the war in Iraq contributed to a scenario of radicalization that jeopardizes the integrity of religious minorities.

One of my visitors from Erbil told me that the EU needs to have an honest debate about whether the international community really wants Christians to survive in the region from which Christianity emerged. If Christians were not humans, they would have been defined long ago as an endangered species and taken under international protection, but now their numbers are decreasing with dramatic speed. We heard about ‘de-Christianisation of the Middle East’, and probably Christians will not survive another major conflict in the area. The question is whether there will be any Christians in liberated Mosul, or living in the Nineveh plains. I have two proposals to the Commission. Firstly, the EU and international organisations cannot provide aid directly to religion-based groups, so we need to change the rules, because churches can provide most direct help to people in real need. And secondly, the EU can make a difference: as a large provider of humanitarian aid, our red line should be to set as criteria for local authorities that humanitarian aid must reach all groups and minorities without discrimination, and that Christians and members of other minority religions will be guaranteed a return to their homes and equal rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 286, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "László Tőkés (PPE).", "mepid": "39726", "text": "- Madam President, in the wake of the bloody assassination of Coptic Christians on Flower Sunday, Jesuit Father Henri Boulad not only condemned radical political Islam but also, among others, the democratic West, which “co-created the concept of false Islamophobia with Islamists. to silence any criticism of Islam ”.

I believe that Latin is not included in the translations, so I stick to Italian. Having been born and raised in Rome, a few hundred meters from the Vatican, I believe that you can understand very well the importance that this debate has for me this evening and I believe that you can have full confidence in the determination, commitment and energy that I personally put into the work we talked about tonight. I would like to refer to just three points at the end of this debate. First, the European Union has and maintains human rights, all human rights, at the heart of its foreign policy. It is not the same for all international actors, at this moment in particular, but for us it is a beacon of our action in the world. Second, for us, freedom of religion and worship is a fundamental right that must be guaranteed, protected and promoted for all religions and in all areas of the world. This is true for Christians in the Middle East, this is also true for Christians elsewhere in the world, some rightly remembered the persecutions and attacks on Christian communities in other areas of the world, equally worrying, linked to different types of dynamics, but I would like also remember, as some colleagues did this evening, the need to protect all communities and all religions in our Europe as well. In this sense I would like to support those who recalled the need to prevent and fight Islamophobia, especially in Europe, quoting Pope Francis, who reminded us that Europe has the duty to rediscover its ability to integrate and always recalling, alongside the Christian roots of Europe, the fact that we have other roots and that one can always live alongside the other, in respect, in tolerance and in mutual protection. Third point: the situation of Christians in the Middle East is not just a question of human rights, it is not even just a question of tolerance, it is above all a question of preserving diversity, the diversity of a region, the diversity of a culture, the diversity of a story. From this point of view, I agree with what some colleagues said during the debate, it is a question of politics and it is a question of security, because the disappearance of Christian communities from the Middle East would involve a very change in the nature of Middle Eastern societies, with a it is very worrying both from a political and a security point of view. This is why the European Union works every day with the tools I reminded you at the beginning of our debate to protect the rights of Christians in the Middle East, as well as to protect the rights of all to profess their religion in every part of the world. . In conclusion, I would like to thank this Parliament again for the debate and also many Member States who are promoting initiatives in this sense. Some Spanish colleagues remembered the conference that will be held next week in Madrid, which is important in this sense, we spoke about it yesterday with the Spanish minister.

And the European Union, by giving legitimacy and credibility to the Syrian Islamist opposition in the unreasonable hope of obtaining the departure of Bashar al-Assad, also bears the heavy responsibility. I appeal to your consistency: the European Union cannot, without backing down, praise the development of multiculturalism and diversity for itself in the morning and promote their disappearance where they have already existed for many centuries in the afternoon.

This place has been a school example of the peaceful coexistence of the Christian and Muslim communities for centuries. Every year together they remembered St. Elijah, the patron saint of the monastery, who died a martyr's death rather than refusing his faith. All this is a thing of the past. After 15 years of church and community building work, Father Jacques Mourad was abducted by ISIS warriors, the monastery was looted, and the sacred tomb was looted. The father was in captivity in ISIS for four months, serving as a cell for a small restroom. He was abused on a daily basis by the means of the most varied psychic terror, but he did not give up his faith or smile. In the most difficult hours, he had a vision that said, “You are coming to the light!”. This light shines before him even now, after his release, as he personally carries the fame of the Syrian Christian communities in danger of life on a daily basis around the world.

This year, however, on 9 February, the Kenyan High Court declared the Government’s decision to close the camp null and void and described the repatriation of refugees as unconstitutional and discriminatory. Yet the Kenyan Government has not officially changed its proposed closure date, 31 May 2017. That is 16 days away. The Government has recognised that the voluntary repatriation process must be implemented in accordance with the tripartite agreement between Kenya, Somalia and the UNCHR. When we consider the situation in Dadaab, we must also bear in mind the existing context in the whole of Africa, especially in Somalia. Despite some positive political developments during the past year, a renewed drought is bringing the country to its knees. Famine is looming. 6.7 million people, half of the total population, are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. 683 000 people have been internally displaced because of the drought. As a result, humanitarian partners are now preparing for a possible influx of Somali refugees to neighbouring countries. We must also be aware that the EU adheres to the principle that returns must be voluntary, dignified and sustainable. Given the current context, that is a real challenge, a very huge challenge, and there may be further instability ahead for a country and a region already on the brink.  We must collectively commend the host communities of Dadaab, the people of Kenya and their Government for offering sanctuary to people fleeing violence, conflict and hunger. That is the message which I personally conveyed to the Kenyan Government and authorities when I visited Dadaab last year. The Government of Kenya is a driver of regional initiatives and has shown willingness to find a collective solution to this issue, in line with international standards and principles. That point was made in the Mogadishu Declaration of 22 February 2017, jointly endorsed by the region’s presidents, and also at the IGAD Summit, held in Nairobi on 25 March this year, on sustainable solutions for Somalian refugees.  The EU has already welcomed the Nairobi declaration. I would like to reiterate the importance of rapid implementation of the commitments underlying it. Investment in development has to be increased and better coordinated, but that is not enough. Policies need to be changed, especially for job access and for living outside the camps, as well as creating  conditions in Somalia allowing people to go home. I am glad to know that the spirit of the Nairobi declaration is reflected in the resolution of this Parliament.  Dear colleagues, another positive milestone was the London Somalia Conference on 11 May 2017, just two weeks ago. The agreement on a security pact and the new Partnership for Somalia was an important step forward. The European Union has announced an additional EUR 200 million for the period up to 2020. The EU trust fund is also providing EUR 50 million in Somalia to support the voluntary return of Somalian refugees. Of course, as the European Union we remain engaged in providing humanitarian assistance in the Dadaab camp and Somalia, in parallel with development support to foster conditions conducive to return including security and access to basic services in Somalia. The Commission itself has supported humanitarian assistance to refugees in Kenya with nearly EUR 130 million since 1996 and EUR 12.7 million this year alone. At the same time the EU has intensified programmes aimed at strengthening state building and stabilising Somalia. In addition, in response to the security threats coming from terrorists in Somalia, we are supporting various projects to counter violent extremists with an overall budget of EUR 18 million.  As I said, the EU acknowledges the generosity that Kenya and other countries in the region have shown to Somalian refugees. We hope that the Kenyan Government will continue to provide protection and asylum to refugees until they can voluntarily return home. We all need to collectively support the country doing this and to do so in a way that benefits both the refugees and the host communities in Dadaab. We also need to make every effort to help consolidate peace in Somalia. That is the only way to resolve the protracted refugee crisis in the region. I am grateful, as the Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid, that  Parliament is continuing to support the common efforts to bring about a sustainable and lasting solution to the regional refugee crisis. I welcome the resolution tabled, which seeks to further support these measures. Thank you so much for your attention to this statement. I am looking forward to our in-depth discussions that will help us to see together how to evaluate the situation in the Dadaab camp.

This situation is untenable neither for the Government of Kenya, nor for the neighboring countries and even less for all the people who live there. The closure of the camp is a sovereign decision.

Money, we are able to donate. We can do diplomatic intervention; promote, as my colleague said, a regional solution; give a role to the African Union. The truth is that the European Union is not very well placed to give lessons to Kenya, which is a country that has shown enormous generosity with refugees, despite the difficulties that the country itself has. And the truth is also that the Horn of Africa is in a very dangerous situation, derived not only from the risks of terrorism, but also from famine and drought.

It is the element that we have to find. Probably a greater involvement in the fundamental solutions towards Somalia, and a more concrete support to the Kenyan authorities so that they are able to carry out this relocation that, for the moment, looks directly like hell.

As elsewhere, refugees seem to be increasingly becoming an electoral issue. There is recurring blackmail when the camps are closed and forced returns are increasing despite the dangerous and deteriorating situation in Somalia and although 86% of Somalis refuse to do so. We talk about the fight against the root causes of migration, but this starts with solidarity, when the proposed responses are increasingly military and security. Worse, UNHCR has only raised 15% of the $ 215 million it needs to care for refugees in Kenya, as drought continues to worsen the health situation.

Some of these people have been living there for 25 years without any perspective on life outside the camp. Happily, of course, the camp has formed some good relations with the local communities and I think this is something that has to be supported, but the surrounding communities also need investment in development so that they can prosper and live beside the camp.  I think that it is very important to note the promising cooperation of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development of the region (IGAD). They recently had a summit, which was also mentioned in our resolution, and have admirably agreed to facilitate a voluntary return back home. We should in no way support any kind of forced returns to a situation which climate change is worsening, and where famine is threatening people’s lives – the Commissioner mentioned internally displaced people – and so we also need, as Europeans, to take our responsibility for resettlement of some of the people living in the camp.

The tripartite agreement between UNHCR, Somalia and Kenya offers some possibility of return due to the improvement of the political, stability and security situation in Somalia, which is undoubtedly far from perfect, but which forces people to return to their country of origin. The Kenyan authorities argue that the camp is closed due to the prevailing situation there and that terrorist organizations are recruiting new members among the people who live in the camp. This is an argument for what is expected to happen in May. Although the Kenyan court decision and the closure order were unconstitutional and discriminatory, the situation in Dadaab very aptly illustrates the complexity of the link between the refugee problem and the stability-building border management challenges. I believe that the Nairobi Global and Regional Action Plan adopted in March this year is an important declaration that refugees who choose to remain in the host country should have access to employment and services, as well as mobility. It should be emphasized that returns to Somalia, if any, must be carried out in accordance with international standards, that is, voluntarily, safely and with respect for human rights.

She asks Europe to accept its share of relocations, as are Canada and Australia. She supports voluntary returns, but recognizes that such returns are difficult in the current context of drought. She knows that Dadaab will not be able to close its doors and is therefore asking for increased aid. She also calls for more development assistance for the region and local communities, who now bear the burden of this migration, but she also calls for the Union's trust fund for Africa to be properly funded and effective.

They have been demanded to disclose the identity of other LGBTI people. This is a life of fear that nobody on this planet should be allowed to live, and nobody who protects the perpetrators should not be brought to justice. It is clear that we demand in this resolution – and I have to say the resolution we prepared is one of six groups in this Parliament, I really appreciate that there is broad support – we demand from the Russian Federation and the Chechnya regime to protect LGBTI people and also to speak out and say this is not against any religious traditions; this is something – being lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or intersex – that has existed all over the planet in all times and all epochs, in all religions, in all cultures everywhere, and exists and should not be worked against. So now we also ask the External Action Service to see that the guidelines that we have are really implemented all over this planet in order to make sure that LGBTI human rights defenders are helped by the European diplomats, and lots is done in that; we already have many good reports by that. I also appreciate that the EAS is having the building illuminated on tomorrow’s International Day Against Homophobia in the rainbow flags, and this is important to show visibility and to struggle for equal rights for everybody.

Thanks so much. There were probably many of us who found it difficult to take in the reports of threats and violence, torture and even murder, of gay men in Chechnya. Such an extreme persecution, it is simply difficult to take in. All of us who are LGBTQ people have, of course, experienced homophobia, but such an extreme form of violence that we have seen in these reports, it is fortunately unusual. But homophobia is killing, and it is killing here in Europe as well. It killed everyone in that gay club in Orlando. And we know that homotransphobia oppresses young people and adults in our society. The violence and persecution of gays in Chechnya is the ultimate consequence of what all this homophobia can result in - extreme and deadly violence. When faced with it, we must all act. That is why we demand that the European Union act, that the Member States act, that it act together with the Council of Europe, that it act together with independent experts who should have access to and must investigate exactly what has happened, and those responsible should be brought to justice. Nothing else works. What hurts so much is also that it is precisely the family and the police, where one should be safe - in one's family and in the relationship with the police - who have been exposed and involved in persecuting and harming, and even murdering, gay men . Homophobia - it's so musty, it's so patriarchal, it's such a musty attitude to the nation, to the people, to gender, to love, to women, to men and to gender identities. We have to get rid of it. Homophobia is deeply rooted, not only in Chechnya, but also in our country. We have everything to do, we have everything to gain to build more open societies - more dignified societies that stand up for everyone's human rights.

Unfortunately, the crimes in Chechnya are not an isolated campaign. It is only a common denominator representing the state of human rights in Russia as a whole. Let us recall that in March this year Russia has adopted a backwards legislation decriminalising domestic violence, and now we are witnessing this.

Intolerance is growing worldwide, we see prosecutions and even the death penalty for those who want to be “different” and yet be themselves. What has happened in Chechnya in recent days has shocked us. It is still winter in the Caucasus. Maybe literally but certainly figuratively. The persecution of at least a hundred Chechens for being gay, the torture, murder and solitary confinement in torture camps are repugnant and unacceptable and can only be condemned in the harshest terms. President Kadirov's reactions that there are no gays in his country demonstrate the coldness of society and the unwillingness of the regime. No one can feel protected when the government opens a witch hunt. And Kremlin boss Putin? Nothing new under the sun. He denies. He plainly supports the Chechen government and is himself repressive against LGBT sympathizers in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The Kremlin thus once again plays an extremely dubious role. A recent report from the Council of Europe also points to Russia's reluctance to make any effort to improve the human rights situation in Chechnya. The gruesome facts require an investigation. The perpetrators must be prosecuted and the victims compensated. But no one believes Russia will conduct a serious investigation. An independent international investigation is imperative. And so the question to the Commission is what it will do to implement our own LGBTI guidelines. It will take more than expressing concern.

This principle has become an integral part of our concept of equality, human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is obviously a European value and we believe it should be a universal value. Just to remind you, in 2013 the European Union adopted guidelines to promote and protect the enjoyment of full human rights by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons. The EU’s diplomatic efforts in this area revolve around four priorities: first, eliminating discriminatory laws and policies and ensuring decriminalisation, including the death penalty; second, promoting equality and non—discrimination at work, in healthcare and education; third, combating state or individual violence against LGBTI persons; and fourth, supporting and protecting human rights defenders. Depending on the situation, the European Union acts on the issue through quiet diplomacy, public statements and by raising LGBTI rights in the political and human rights dialogues with third countries. The European Union also provides support to civil society via the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. Today, as the authors have already said, we are here to discuss some very serious allegations of crimes against gay men in Chechnya. The persecution of gay men, leading to kidnappings, torture and killings is the latest amongst some very worrying developments in Chechnya. We have seen the Chechen authorities implicitly justifying the violence and the Russian federal authorities downplaying it, dismissing the reports as exaggerations and fake news. Unfortunately, so far the Russian authorities have taken no effective action to stop the violence and protect the victims. The European Union, with its Member States, other like-minded countries and many international human rights organisations, has condemned the brutal campaign against LGBTI individuals and called for a full investigation into these events. Just yesterday the EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in the Foreign Affairs Council to evaluate the most effective way to help the victims of the alleged abuse. High Representative Federica Mogherini also raised our serious concerns on this issue directly with Minister Lavrov when she saw him in Moscow on 24 April. She stressed the need to put an immediate stop to the crackdown against gay men in Chechnya and to investigate these horrific reports. Unfortunately, Minister Lavrov’s response – later also repeated in the press conference – was that the Russian authorities so far had no proof that the alleged persecutions had actually happened. While in Moscow, the High Representative also had the opportunity to discuss the issue with civil society representatives and journalists. It is indeed alarming that the journalists who uncovered the violence have in turn become the target of direct threats from the leadership in Chechnya and have been forced to flee Chechnya. This is, unfortunately, the situation on the ground. We have asked EU ambassadors in Moscow to do their utmost to help the men who have been a target, particularly those who currently still fear for their own safety and security. Some Member States are willing to help. Whatever they do will be done quietly and without fanfare in order to protect the victims. In any case, we will continue to call on the international authorities for an effective and thorough investigation into the reports of abductions and killing of gay men in Chechnya. This is indispensable so that anyone found guilty of complicity in such crimes is brought to justice.

The systematic witch-hunt of human beings just because of their sexual orientation goes beyond discrimination: it is persecution, it is terrifying and unacceptable, and we cannot be silent and turn our eyes.  In the EU we should stand united and act together, and I welcome that our President has immediately taken action and a firm stand against those crimes, and I support further action by the European Commission. All Member States should call for the immediate release of those that are still detained illegally and to assist the victims. The Russian Federation should openly denounce those crimes and thoroughly investigate them in respect of international law.  There must be zero-tolerance against impunity, and all perpetrators should be brought to justice. The EU should condemn any intimidation towards human rights defenders who reported the violence against LGBTI in Russia. As a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, Russia should respect that all human beings are equal and no one has the right to persecute an individual or a group just because they are different or are perceived to be different.

Not only are the people involved not guaranteed equal treatment compared to any other citizen, but we are also witnessing an emergency that violates the freedom of these people, subjecting them to violence and torture just for their sexual orientation. In Chechnya, the situation is made even more worrying by the fact that there is a real organizational and repressive apparatus, including infrastructure and personnel, aimed at the identification, capture and torture of people suspected of being homosexuals. The ultimate goal of this apparatus is the conversion of prisoners. I don't know if there is full awareness, but there is no doubt that the reaction of the international community has not been adequate.

Both Federica Mogherini and Johannes Hahn are very closely monitoring the situation, with particular focus on the reforms and political developments. In our partnership with Moldova, we have always tried to support change when it could bring tangible benefits to the people of Moldova. Let me recall that in the very first lines of our Association Agreement, the European Union and Moldova commit to some common principles. Among them are the rule of law, good governance and cooperation between neighbours.  These are not only EU values, they are European values that are part of our common heritage and are shared by all Members of the Council of Europe. The Council conclusions of 15 February 2016 already include a broad set of reforms that we believe will help Moldova meet its full potential, making both its democracy and its economy stronger. On 13 March, we published our first association implementation report, which has identified issues to be addressed as a matter of priority. On 31 March, the Association Council was the opportunity to discuss progress in reforms in all fields. We have to acknowledge that the government and the parliament have taken many legislative steps, particularly last year. The reform process has finally been restarted after political instability had brought it to a deadlock. Some efforts have been made in the banking sector and have contributed to restoring macro—financial stability and donors’ assistance. An agreement with the International Monetary Fund was reached in November 2016, thanks to which we could resume our budget support based on a thorough assessment of whether the conditions foreseen by the existing assistance programmes to Moldova had been fulfilled. It also allowed us to propose a macro—financial assistance operation for Moldova.  In the justice and energy sectors, in the fight against corruption, as well as the public administration reforms, some legislative and regulatory steps have been already taken. However, many of the country’s key problems still persist: the politicisation of state institutions, corruption, lack of independence of the judiciary, much—delayed investigations on banking fraud.  As you all know, on 5 May, the parliament adopted two draft laws at first reading that might lead to important changes in the Moldovan political system. One, as tabled by the Democratic Party, would change the electoral system from proportional to uninominal, and a second, as proposed by President Dodon, in favour of a mixed electoral system, half proportional and half uninominal. These two proposals have now been merged. A new draft was produced on the basis of President Dodon’s proposals for review by the Venice Commission. It is expected that the Venice Commission, which has just visited Moldova, will give its opinion by mid-June. Let us be very clear on this proposed reform. It is not up to the European Union to decide upon an independent country’s voting system. This should be up to the people of Moldova – and we mean all of them, not only the parties in power. Any change to the electoral system should be based on a broad consensus amongst political forces, on the broadest consensus among all political forces and within society. A new electoral law can have a significant impact on the quality of a country’s democracy, for better or worse. The Council of Europe has an important advisory role when it comes to democratic reforms, so we can only hope that Moldova will listen carefully to the opinion of the Venice Commission. On our side, our economic support is aimed at accompanying reforms that can benefit the citizens of Moldova. With the Association Agreement, we have set out together with our Moldovan friends, the goals of our partnership. Our financial support is intended precisely to favour the implementation of the Association Agreement. As far as the macro—financial assistance is concerned, the adoption of the decision does not mean its immediate implementation. Each disbursement, including the first one, is conditional on the implementation of policy measures set out in the related memorandum of understanding. Real accountability for elected officials is essential to the credibility of all democratic institutions. Moldova has so far taken some steps towards a stronger democracy. The European Union will work to help Moldova stay on the path of a democracy that truly delivers on its citizens’ needs.

I have been to Moldova again and again and have long been calling for the European Parliament to begin to discuss the realities and their roots that we are confronted with in our eastern neighborhood. Moldova is the result of a transformation process in which adaptable oligarchs like Plahotniuc followed the key words from member states of the EU or the Russian Federation, studied and at the same time further developed what can be said of parties such as B. Popolo della Libertà can learn about maintaining power. The problem also begins in EU capitals and has only ended in Chişinău so far. Incidentally, we are in the middle of a lesson for these Plahotniucs, because our discussion takes place in the context of the cancellation of the trialogue on macro-financial aid for Moldova. As if we were in Chişinău, institutional processes were simply intervened from outside. EPP and S&D are not alternatives with regard to Moldova, as both have their stakes in the Moldovan government. The European Parliament must free itself from this entanglement of interests.

It struck me that while President Dodon was also part of the government in those years, he has not yet been able to put on the table any details about the leakage of this money in Brussels.

Even in April 2017, the government adopted a new law at first reading that would allow the use of the armed forces to counter public protests when deemed necessary. Pending the opinion of the Venice commission on the future electoral law, we must once again denounce the great power in the hands of the oligarch Plahotniuc, who in fact manages to direct, some say to control, the government, the judicial system, the anti-corruption bodies and average. A country almost hostage. We, as Moldova's first and main partner, must use the tools in our power to react.

But I make my own the words of the speaker who preceded me: Moldova is a European country, it is the poorest country in Europe. Since the beginning of the 21st century, however, the Moldovan economy has grown significantly and the World Bank itself predicts that, after a slight interregnum, this growth will occur again. Moldova signed an association and free trade agreement with the European Union that opens the door to a market of five hundred million people and subsequently agreed to exempt visas for the movement of its population in the Schengen area. Three and a half million Moldovans are now able to move freely across Europe and are able to establish trade relations with the countries of the European Union in an easier way. In spite of all this, political positions have prevailed in recent times that call into question this approach to the European Union and go in the direction of favoring a connection with Russia again. This, of course, is not unrelated to the fact that the Russians put heavy pressure on the Moldovan population. In recent years and as relations with the European Union have strengthened, Russia has alarmed this population, which, despite everything, depends considerably on that country, not only in economic but also in social terms. It embargoed imports of Moldovan wine, meat, fruit and vegetables and threatened to extend the ban to other products, increased prices for energy supplies, threatened to place visa restrictions on the thousands of Moldovans working in Russia. We are, therefore, today at a decisive moment for the future of this country, which, I repeat, is the poorest in Europe, while still being a country that is part of our European civilization and, therefore, despite all the problems, despite all the mistakes made, I do not believe that the Union European Union must give up on continuing to encourage Moldova to promote the consolidation of democracy, to resolve the serious problems that have already been raised here and to carry out the reforms essential to its economic and social development.The worst that could happen to a country like this would undoubtedly be that the European Union gave up on it.I am sure that will not happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 374, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Monica Macovei (ECR).", "mepid": "96824", "text": "- Thank you, in countries with solid democracies, the mixed uninominal voting system works.

It is greatly appreciated, bearing in mind the changing political dynamics within the European Union. May I also give due recognition to Commissioner Frans Timmermans for his attitude towards this file and, in particular, for taking on the mantle of ‘Europe only where necessary’. I would like to start by thanking all of my shadow rapporteurs involved in this report who have contributed to the final text, and for allowing it to reach this particular stage with relative ease. It was adopted with a large majority in committee. I will try to summarise the key points within the report as quickly and efficiently as possible. As is always the case with this annual report, which I have taken the lead on for some years now, it aims to strengthen the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. As laid out in the Treaty of Lisbon, they are guiding principles of the European Union and should always be respected fully. 2014 saw a decrease in the number of reasoned opinions issued by national parliaments, but my report notes that this could be put down to a significant decline in the number of proposals from the Commission. It also draws attention to the fact that justifications of subsidiarity and proportionality by the Commission have, on many occasions, been deemed incomplete or non—existent by some national parliaments. As a result, I have asked the Commission in my report to improve its explanatory statements with a factually-substantiated analysis of its proposals on subsidiarity and proportionality grounds. The report refers to the Impact Assessment Board too, as it considered just 32% of impact assessments in 2015 unsatisfactory in relation to analysis of subsidiarity and proportionality. This is the same figure as the year before, which to me shows that in this area there is a need for improvement. The key change in this year’s report is that it calls for reasoned opinions to also consider proportionality and not just subsidiarity. I am passionate about that, as determining whether or not legislation is proportionate is often neglected, but it is equally important. This would require a revision of the Treaties, but in my opinion it is a necessity and a greater step towards reducing the democratic deficit. I am pleased that groups supported my recommendation for an evaluation of the number of national parliaments required for a yellow card to be triggered. I think it is a good idea for the status quo to be questioned once in a while, and for us to step back and consider whether the thresholds are appropriate. Furthermore, I have called for proportionality tests to be able to discard proposals with disproportionate burdens on competitiveness and SMEs. This is crucial for business back home, regardless of the Member State, if they are to remain competitive. There are also proposals for an extension of the time limit for national parliaments to submit opinions which could be carried out by secondary legislation and subsequently incorporated into the next treaty revision. I think it is important to take into account the fact that there are instances where national parliaments simply cannot present a reasoned opinion in the timeframe – in cases of a natural disaster, for example.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 390, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am here in this debate on behalf of my dear colleague First Vice-President Frans Timmermans. First of all, and on behalf of the Vice-President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karim, for his excellent report on the Commission’s report for 2014 on subsidiarity and proportionality.  Subsidiarity and proportionality must be at the heart of the European democratic process. They are key to our objective of being big on the big things and small on the small things. The Commission has committed itself to give real effect to the principle of subsidiarity. We want to work with the national parliaments and EU institutions to ensure that every proposal complies with that principle. Last year Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking. The Commission is pleased that all the institutions have committed to ensuring that subsidiarity must remain a key element throughout the legislative procedure.  Turning to some of the suggestions in the Karim report, the report calls on the Commission to reflect on its relations with national parliaments in general and specifically as regards subsidiarity scrutiny. The Juncker Commission pledged to forge a new partnership with national parliaments. Halfway through the Commission mandate, Members of the Commission have had more than 550 meetings with national parliaments – 550 meetings. These meetings give members of the Commission a possibility to explain what we do and why we do it. They also allow us to listen to the concerns of national parliaments and their citizens. The Commission will continue engaging with national parliaments for the rest of its mandate, for our mandate.  The report also calls on the Commission to reflect on possible changes to the subsidiarity control mechanisms, for instance through a political agreement between the institutions. The Commission is always open to discussing new ways of working together, but we must do it while respecting the existing treaties and the institutional balance which is laid down therein. I am much more in favour of pragmatic workable approaches where possible and where they respect the treaties. An example of a pragmatic approach also supported in the report is the idea that national parliaments should be able to invite the Commission to table a proposal for new or attendant legislation, the so-called ‘green card mechanism’. The Commission supports this initiative, and is pleased it has already become the practice without setting up new institutional and administrative structures. For instance, 18 parliamentary chambers in 2015 submitted an initiative on food waste to the Commission. Some of the suggestions in the initiative on Food donation, data collection and monitoring were reflected in the Circular Economy package adopted in December 2015. This example shows that national parliaments can play a constructive role and that the Commission is ready to discuss constructive suggestions from national parliaments. Let me conclude by reassuring all Members that the Commission will make sure that subsidiarity and proportionality remain at the heart of the European democratic process.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 391, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Kazimierz Michał Ujazdowski", "mepid": "23791", "text": "author of the draft opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - Mr Chairman!

Indeed, the point is that we should make the subsidiarity principle and the proportionality principle linked to it more effective than before. It is therefore necessary to adopt a recommendation, extend the eight-week deadline for national parliaments to express their opinion, consider a green and a red card, because the yellow card is in crisis, is rarely used, and even when it is applied, the Commission does not always respond to the arguments national parliaments.

We are always eager to emphasize that this cooperation is necessary, that we should deepen it, and that national parliaments should be more involved in the legislative process. These are good commitments. Unfortunately, the practice is somewhat different, and this is what my colleague Karim's report, adopted by a very large majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs, suggests. I am pleased with the information provided by the Commissioner regarding consultations by members of the college with national parliaments and the announcement of further consultations, because the results of these consultations should find expression in a real change in the relationship between what we do at Community level and what we do as a result it is implemented in the Member States, because it is the Member States who implement the law we enact.

Therefore, I would like to thank you very much for these announcements and for the speeches so far, because they go in a direction that is very much desired by my political group.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 393, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Mady Delvaux", "mepid": "124776", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D group. - Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Karim - our rapporteur on the 2014 report on subsidiarity and proportionality - not only for the quality of his report, but also for his availability and openness which made it possible to find a broad agreement between political parties. Subsidiarity and proportionality are fundamental principles of the European Union - everyone agrees. But sometimes, on certain topics, it can be difficult to define the appropriate level of action between the Union and the Member States. This is why we welcome the measures of the Better Regulation Agreement adopted in May 2015, which provides for more detailed explanations on subsidiarity and proportionality, which should improve the quality of trade. However, the two principles must be applied in a balanced way. A balance needs to be struck between the effectiveness of Union action, on the one hand, and national sensitivities, on the other. Subsidiarity must not be used as a pretext to prevent progress by the European Union; it must also respect the particularities of the Member States. It is also important to find a balance between a top-down approach and a bottom-up approach. It is not a question of calling into question the right of initiative of the European Commission, nor the prerogatives of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament as co-legislators, but it is important to involve the national parliaments, as emanation of public opinion in their Member State, in the development of common policies. In fact, national parliaments already have many possibilities to make their voices heard. At national level, by giving their point of view to their ministers, who sit on the Council of Ministers, but also by responding to public consultations opened by the European institutions or by giving their opinion on the books white papers and green papers, either individually or during interparliamentary meetings.We can go further and consider introducing a green card.Today, national parliaments have the possibility to oppose a legislative measure by means of the yellow card, which often suggests that the European Union is a threat to the Member States.The green card, on the other hand, would allow national parliaments to suggest initiatives to the Commission, which would make them committed and proactive players in the construction of Europe and the improvement of its functioning.In conclusion, this report is positive and I am delighted to be able to support it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 394, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Kosma Złotowski", "mepid": "124884", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group.- Mr Chairman!Ladies and Gentlemen!Of course, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Karim, because the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are two principles that effectively defend the European Union against the omnipotent administration of the Brussels administration.I am very pleased with what the Commissioner said that he would do everything to ensure that these rules are respected in the Union.Unfortunately, in practice, the voice of national parliaments is often ignored.This was the case, inter alia, with the yellow card, when eleven countries raised their doubts about the Posting of Workers Directive and the Commission's response to doubts as to the compliance of these proposals with the subsidiarity principle was decidedly superficial and inadequate to the scale of the reservations.Stronger inclusion of national parliaments will make what we are adopting here better, more understandable and faster implemented in individual EU countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 395, "date": "2017-05-16.json", "name": "Pavel Telička", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I must say that as a fan of better regulation I read the report with some interest. While I am not an ALDE shadow, I can fully subscribe to it. I also endorse the recommendations that my distinguished colleague, Karim, has put forward. To be honest, I do have doubts about the last one, which is to say the extension of the consultation period. It has pros and cons, and it is a question of personal preferences, but I would say that while one can envisage it, I can also see certain downsides.  What I would like to underline is that in the report – and this is a well—known fact and I will be concrete by referring to paragraphs 7 and 8 – we talk about the justification of subsidiarity and proportionality being incomplete or, indeed, non—existent. At least that is the complaint of the Member States. But there is also the well-known figure that the Impact Assessment Board considers 32% of the impact assessments reviewed in 2014 on these issues to be unsatisfactory, and our rapporteur says that these rates have not improved. Well, I must say that not only have they not improved, but down the line there has been no progress, and I think that every single impact assessment has to be thorough on this. We cannot speak of better regulation unless this figure is zero or close to zero. So this is one point I would like to underline. The second point is – and this is also mentioned in the report – that we rightly want to have greater involvement of the national parliaments. But, at the same time, I think that in 2014 only 15 chambers had utilised the potential. The rapporteur’s explanation is that this is maybe because of mandates reaching their end, but the fact is that we need also to place more emphasis and – let us say – pressure on the national parliaments. Final remark: I agree with the green card, but I would love the European Parliament also to have a green card in the future.

Subsidiarity is violated because these programs do not suffice to formulate budgetary targets, leaving the way to achieve them in the Member State concerned, but also dictate the means of achieving the targets, even in areas outside financial management, such as labor market deregulation.

Despite interpellations from national parliaments, the Commission, with the consent of this Parliament, continues to treat with indifference and contempt this principle, which was recognized as fundamental by the European Council in its Edinburgh declaration of 1992. This type of report does not present therefore no interest, except that of giving purely fictitious pledges of improvement of this principle. There is further proof that this Parliament has little interest in respecting the competences of the Member States and, therefore, of the peoples of Europe and of democracy.

In other words, they show when real progress can only be made at European level and when the country will deal with the problem on its own. This year's subsidiarity and proportionality report showed that in 2014 the Commission received 21 reasoned opinions from the parliaments of the Member States on 15 proposals, a decrease of 76% compared to the number of documents received in 2013. In previous years, we have therefore noted a much greater involvement of national parliaments in the European legislative process. However, this significantly lower number of reasoned opinions does not indicate a loss of interest in the subsidiarity principle by national parliaments, but a decrease in the total number of proposals submitted by the European Commission at the end of its mandate. In 2012 and 2013, the threshold required to initiate the so-called yellow cards were obtained every year, while in 2014 no yellow or orange card procedures were initiated.

The report does not propose any real solution to improve respect for the will of national parliaments.

It is today that it is particularly important to create solid European legislation on issues on which the European Union can make real progress and add value. In this regard, the European Commission must improve the explanatory memoranda of its legislative proposals, always presenting a detailed, comprehensive and factually sound analysis of its proposals in terms of subsidiarity and proportionality, which would assist national parliaments in considering these proposals. National parliaments, in their role as representatives of European citizens at national level, must also strengthen their important role in bridging the gap between the European institutions and the public. National parliaments can look for ways to play a more positive and proactive role in European affairs. Therefore, the idea of ​​using the 'green card' procedure, according to which national parliaments could trigger European legislative processes and thus play a constructive role in European law-making, is a good solution.

Subsidiarity and proportionality are not just some technical terms, but these terms clearly show what the scope of the EU should be, its legislation, what we are supposed to regulate by European legislation. In my constituency in the Czech Republic, I have to explain to the citizens why a certain thing is regulated by European law, why it is more appropriate for it to be regulated by European law, and not, for example, only by national law. That is why I am sorry that these very important reports are coming to Parliament's table relatively late. We are discussing the 2014 report, and it is difficult to apply the consequences that the report brings to practice. Otherwise, like my colleagues, I must say that I have seen a reduction in the reasoned opinions of the individual national parliaments. I will hope that this is due to the fact that we had less legislation in 2014 and that, therefore, the interest of national parliaments in interfering in the adoption of European law, European legislation, is not diminishing.

This presents massive opportunities for Europe and it is now up to us, the policymakers, to make the right choices and create a conducive environment so that Europe can benefit to the full extent.  FinTech is often used to refer to a specific scenario of start—ups disrupting finance with innovation. This definition is not the one used in our report because it would exclude a large number of relevant actors. Instead FinTech may be understood as finance enabled by new technologies covering the whole range of financial services, products and infrastructure. It also includes InsureTech, the use of new technologies in insurance, and RegTech, the application of new technologies for regulatory compliance. The current rise of FinTech comes after the origination of a number of different technological developments within a short time span, namely artificial intelligence, cloud computing and distributed ledger technology. These provide new opportunities for disruptions like mobile payments, open banking, crowdfunding, crypto currencies and robo advice. FinTech can lead to significant benefits such as cost reductions, efficiency gains, and more transparency. It can also be an effective tool for financial inclusion, opening up high—level services for those who could not afford them before. Furthermore, FinTech can enable cross—border financial flows and infrastructure through alternative lending and investment channels.  The FinTech revolution that we are currently experiencing is global. In recent years, global FinTech investments have soared. The bulk of these investments was made in the United States, and Asia and Israel are also gearing up in this respect. The US, China and Israel host more than half of the top ten largest FinTech companies. If Europe wants to remain competitive, rapid innovation should be the norm, not the exception. This is not only important for Europe’s financial infrastructure, but also for the real economy, with consumers and businesses benefiting from improved financial services.  Notwithstanding all the benefits, FinTech also confronts us with essential questions of a regulatory, societal nature. Consumer protection and the stability of the financial system should be key concerns in this regard. Together with the competitiveness of the European economy, they make for the core priorities of this report. The report does not intend to give technical solutions. However, it does intend to pose the right questions. That should be a first step in the process of creating a forward—looking European policy in the area of financial technologies.  The intention of this report is not to propose specific legislative actions. We must be cautious with creating new rules because much is still unclear about future developments of financial technologies. A better point of departure is investigating where current legislation causes uncertainties or barriers and identifying where additional action is necessary. Doing this purposefully requires a holistic approach, as technological developments in our digitising society call for breaking silos. FinTech actors are already breaking silos themselves. They often offer products in a diverse multi-party conjunction. I have some minutes left at the end and will use the time then. I am sure that a lot of the things that I want to say will be said by my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs.

Technological innovation on finance is advancing. In terms of expenditure, the financial sector is by far the largest IT sector of our economy. An estimated one-fifth of all IT expenditure globally takes place within the financial sector.  The Commission is looking to promote a thriving and globally competitive European financial sector as part of the Digital Single Market. Both individual consumers and firms stand to benefit from FinTech opportunities, through a greater access to financial services, more choice and a more competitive landscape. When we look to the development of the Capital Markets Union, we must look at how digitalisation can contribute to this goal. FinTech affects all financial sectors and all its components, involving companies both large and small. I would like to highlight four areas that are reflected in your report and that we will also raise in our ongoing public consultation on FinTech.  First, FinTech can be an important driver to expand access to financial services for both consumers and businesses. For providers of financial services it can facilitate access to new and broader customer bases. It can also be an important tool for financial inclusion, while we must not overlook those that are not digitally connected. It can increase efficiency and reduce operating costs – means of generation and distribution of services – and also in terms of meeting regulatory and compliance requirements. Technological innovation can enhance the single market, overcoming obstacles such as location or distance, and enhancing competition by lowering barriers to entry.  Data integrity and security are also essential to ensure market confidence. The report notes that cybersecurity should be a top priority. The WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack in recent days demonstrates why cybersecurity is so important. On this occasion the financial sector was not specifically targeted, but an innovative financial tool – in this case, Bitcoin – was used as a conduit for the requested ransom. We must recognise that, aside from offering advantages and opportunities, technological innovations may also present new tools, enabling the use of our financial system for illicit purposes.  This is why the Commission proposed to include virtual currency exchanges and custodian wallet providers as obliged entities in the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Requiring these entities to identify their customers is an important step towards tackling the anonymous use of these instruments for illicit purposes. Maintaining security is a constant objective and we must ensure that our efforts to preserve security go hand-in-hand with technological developments.  The appearance of new services and technologies may raise questions about how to apply the regulatory framework in ways which permit benefits to be reaped, while at the same time ensuring that any use risks are appropriately mitigated. Technology-enabled finance requires new skills, new expertise and, possibly, new approaches and attitudes, not only for firms but also for customers, regulators and supervisors. Only if regulators and supervisors are familiar with those new technologies and business models can they identify both the risks and opportunities they present.  When deciding on the appropriate response to the challenge of rapidly evolving digital technology we should avoid seeking to capture today’s technology in rules and regulations that may become obsolete tomorrow. A considered approach is called for and this is why we have set up a taskforce of experts drawn from different parts of the Commission who are studying the digitalisation of finance attentively.  Our approach is guided by three overarching principles, which are also reflected in your report, namely: technological neutrality – the same activity should be subject to the same regulation irrespective of the technology used, regulations should not give preference to one technology over another; proportionality – regulations should reflect the business model size, significance, complexity and, ultimately, the risk; and integrity in terms of transparency, security or the use of data. These are just some of areas I would like to highlight from your report.  In conclusion, we remain attentive to developments, identifying actions which promote and encourage innovation in financial services and ensuring that Europe remains an attractive and dynamic environment for financial services.

FinTech is having a transformative impact on how we live and work. FinTech is all about consumer benefits and empowerment. In fact, consumers are the driving force behind the rise of FinTechs, thanks to the increased accessibility, cost reductions and transparency. At the same time, for businesses, Fin Tech means the benefits of efficiency gains, better data management and tailored services for each client. Even governments are able to take advantage of alternative funding pathways to grant funding support for cultural institutions and other civil projects. In total, this is good for everyone – consumers, citizens and businesses alike. But for all this to work, consumers need confidence and trust in this digital revolution.

The rapporteur has involved people in this process from the start. I also want to say that this is one of the most important debates this Parliament will have, because this is the first time, when this report is adopted tomorrow, that any institution of the European Union has actually got a report on the table.  I am aware that the Commission is in a consultative phase right now in terms of the future regulatory environment, and I would ask them to study carefully, as the Commissioner said, what we have produced in this report. We see this as an opportunity, not just for businesses here within the European Union but – much more importantly – for customers. This is about getting the best deal possible for customers. It is about moving into new space, and also about transforming how we deliver financial services.  A key issue for our group, the European People’s Party, was the question of financial stability. We want to make sure that as we go forward we do not lose the very important steps that have been taken in the last decade or so in terms of financial stability. That is an important issue. Europe is lagging behind. The great majority of the large FinTech businesses have been established in the United States, in China and Israel – not in Europe. We are behind other parts of the world, notwithstanding the fact that in places like my own constituency of Dublin, in the Netherlands, in France and in Germany and elsewhere, and London especially, we have seen fantastic hubs being developed.  We need the right regulatory environment, and that is about the regulators working with innovators to make sure that we can do that. Sand boxing was an idea that we have produced in our report. We think that there is further merit in that. We have said many things when it comes to data security. We believe that those issues need to be resolved. We also believe it is important for the digital market economy – the digital single economy – that we make sure this transformation occurs right the way across all of the institutions here in the European Union. This is about a new opportunity for Europe, seizing the opportunity that is there for the digital single market and making sure that our businesses in the European Union, big and small, can flourish and grow within this transformative space.

It is a challenge to think about what FinTech will look like in the future since even companies operating in this field do not make their business plans for a period longer than six months because they do not know exactly what the market will look like at that time. Among the important topics we addressed was the fact that many wanted to position themselves either on the side of the banks or on the side of the intermediaries, which is not the case. We are talking about the future, we are talking about what the economy will look like in the future, we are talking about progress, about innovation, about the fact that Europe is already behind other areas of the world, such as the United States or Asia. We need to give more credit to innovation in Europe and we need to support companies that invest in research and innovation. It is also a great opportunity that FinTech gives to European citizens, the fact that we have more transparency, the fact that transfer prices and prices for banking services go down making access to these banking services much easier for a very large category. wider population comes in support of the struggle we are waging with social inequality, with the fight against poverty, with the fight against unemployment.

This premise, which would, in the end, dispense with any regulation is obviously not realistic and leads to major misunderstandings. It is not true that FINTEC necessarily produces better finance, more suitable products and much less more transparency or better regulation. That is why this is an area where public regulation is urgently needed. This report does not give us the strong, clear and concrete steps that were needed. We are pleased that some concerns, such as consumer protection, have been introduced, but it seems to me that it was necessary to introduce more elements in addition to the brakes on the activity itself, which are completely absent from the report. Privacy and security rights, supervision and data protection should have been better protected and unsolicited spam should have been banned.

It will always find the path of least resistance and be drawn by economic gravity towards locations with a critical mass. We all benefit from having access to finance, but some voices in the EU are determined to put barriers in the way of its flow. We hear the new French President and his ‘macaroons’ want to draw bankers from London and that the EU wants to stop London clearing euros. These, ladies and gentlemen, are not realistic threats. There is so much hot air from Mr Macron that he could power a Montgolfier. He was able to rise silently with vacuous grace, as he was plucked from the French establishment from among his merchant banking chums, to save them – temporarily, may I say – from Madam Le Pen’s French Revolution. The EU should recognise that even a Socialist utopia like the EU is a properly functioning financial market. London’s pre—eminence in global finance could service this EU more easily from outside the Socialist paradise. The UK has all the attributes that could make it the EU’s best friend, but instead we are told by Macron that voting for Brexit is a crime, that the UK must be made an example of, so that no country considers leaving.

The FinTech revolution has reached global proportions, and the benefits are cost reductions, efficiency gains and greater transparency. Of course, we also have potential risks in consumer protection and in the stability of the financial system. More than half of the ten largest FinTech companies are based in the USA, China and Israel. Therefore, in order to remain competitive, Europe must encourage such rapid innovation. We have to support them. We need a European framework for this. We already have laws - e.g. B. the General Data Protection Regulation, the payment services directive and MiFID, which have an impact on developments in the FinTech area.

They are revolutionizing the world of science and financial services, in particular that of banking services, of which they are modifying all facets, whether in terms of payment methods, the allocation of loans or even savings management. . This revolution from the United States, which still concentrates 80% of invested capital, represents considerable growth potential for Europe and in many cases introduces progress that is appreciated by consumers, investors, but also companies, governments, and even central banks. This is evidenced, for example, by the increased use of crowdfunding, which makes it possible to diversify access to capital, the digitization of public services, which can help better collect taxes and prevent tax evasion, or the use of technologies. blockchain, which guarantees the integrity of the transaction history. But, like any technological advance, it requires supervision and this supervision is necessary to support innovation while avoiding abuses. It already deserves to be thought out around three principles. First of all, the preservation of financial stability in the face of cyberattacks - the topicality of which does not need to be recalled - and the lack of information made available to regulators by “FinTechs” on their activities likely to limit the prevention of systemic risks. Then, the protection of consumers exposed to fraudulent sales, as in the case of online transaction scams, linked to the development of connected platforms, looting, if not the theft of personal data.

The innovations we are seeing today are already allowing us to manage our personal finances easily, transfer money across borders and buy and sell shares – all on our phones. These represent enormous technological developments compared to just a few short years ago. Financing businesses, and SMEs in particular, has proven difficult in recent times, particularly in the years since the economic downturn. Fintech innovations such as peer—to—peer lending can bring significant, new options to startups. Peer—to—peer lending can provide much—needed capital investments to our SMEs at competitive lending rates.
