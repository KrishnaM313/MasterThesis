I would like to thank the representatives of the Bulgarian Government who have taken turns in this House. We have signed many rules together. It has been a fruitful presidency, and I would also remind you of the initiative on the Western Balkans, to which the European Parliament attaches great importance.  I would also remind you of the attempts made by the Bulgarian Presidency to try to resolve the problem of the reform of the right of asylum, which remains a priority for us, and I call on Bojko Borisov, in his capacity as Head of Government, to continue, at future Council meetings, to support the initiatives of the European Parliament.

We reached 41 agreements with the European Parliament out of 105 we inherited, 45. We have closed so much more in the Council so that our Austrian colleagues can start negotiations with you as early as July, and I hope that Sebastian Kurz and his colleagues in Austria will not have such a start in the Presidency.   We have set 4 main priorities and made successes and progress on all of them. Undoubtedly, our greatest success was to achieve the theme of the European perspective of the countries of the Western Balkans. We have put this on the line because we understand their accession to the European Union as a condition for better development and for the security of the whole of Europe. There can be no peace and prosperity on the continent until all of Europe is united. I think our efforts have worked. The Summit in Sofia on 17 May helped Athens and Skopje resolve the name dispute. This is a historic moment and an achievement that we should all be proud of. You've supported us very much, too. The next big step was last week, when the Council decided when and how accession negotiations would begin for the Republic of Macedonia as well as Albania.  And of course, I leave it last, but it gave the launch, the agreement on good neighborliness between Bulgaria and Macedonia, with which we opened the topic and gave a personal example.  We are pragmatic, we have worked hard for the connectivity of the region because political declarations are important, but citizens need to see the real results in their daily lives. Corridors 4, 8, 10, digital infrastructure, railways, ports – this will allow for much greater prosperity, connectivity and, of course, the lifting of gross domestic product in the entire Balkans, not just the Western Balkans.  At the Meeting in Sofia, we agreed to provide additional means of connectivity, 11 transport projects for a digital programme in the Balkans, for energy connectivity, for young people through Erasmus+. We have seen the same enthusiasm and pragmatism in our other priorities. We defended the interests of the citizens of Europe and tried to be balancers and honest intermediaries. We proposed and organized a meeting European Union – Turkey in Varna on March 26 to sit together at a table and discuss the accumulated problems. We have restored dialogue with Turkey. Our agreement with Turkey is working, we have zero migratory pressure. This gives us reason to propose to address the problems of migration to seek such political solutions with other countries.  We have made great progress by improving the Schengen Information System, the Visa Code and the Schengen Border Code, as well as interoperability. So on the subject of migration, Europe has done a lot, the Commission has done a lot and we have also tried to make our contribution.  On the reform of Dublin, the asylum system: we invested a lot of effort. We left no stone unplaced and achieved quite a lot with your support, 4 of the 6 open files are on the final line. Thank you that the European Parliament has shown flexibility and has been a key partner. But the general decision has yet to be taken and that is why we were looking for a compromise by early dawn of the European Council. I'm proud we made it. Once again, Europe has shown that it is ready to work together and find European solutions. We are deeply convinced that with our work we have laid the foundations for a good and sustainable solution.    There are many more themes on which we have achieved results in the name of a better future for Europe. It is difficult for me to list everyone, but I would also like to mention the social pillar, the Energy Union, the Banking Union, the Digital Single Market, where we have been extremely successful, as well as the preparations for the European elections in 2019.  We have also adopted the European Union's first industrial programme for military capabilities. Many are, but what they all have in common is that we have found unity – both in the Council and with you, the representatives of the citizens. Our successes are also yours, because if we didn't work together, they would never have happened. That's what we promised at the beginning of our presidency, and that's what we did. We sought consensus between states and institutions, even when there was great controversy.  I would like to thank you once again and wish to continue in the same cooperation with our colleagues in Austria, because the foreign policy environment for Europe is dynamic and complex. This, of course, also influenced the Bulgarian Presidency.  I will highlight some of the factors that cannot be left on the European agenda. The U.S. and President Trump's decisions. At the informal dinner in Sofia, we talked about trade relations with the US and withdrawal from the Iran agreement. We had to protect our European interests, and that is mandatory.  Brexit is not only an internal but also a geopolitical problem. It is very important that the outcome of the negotiations does not jeopardise the security of Europe and its citizens. The situation in Africa remains very difficult. There is the source of migratory pressures towards Europe, which is why at the Council last week we discussed the financial opportunities for Africa and continued investment in the partnership with these countries.  Terrorism remains a serious threat, we have worked hard to improve security across the European Union, but this remains a serious problem.  Bulgaria will continue to support the European Union in combating these challenges. I believe that during our presidency we were able to capture the pulse of events and give a very good foundation to our colleagues from Austria, as we received from Estonia. Once again, I would like to congratulate Yuri and the Estonian Government on their presidency, and I really hope that we have come close to the high criterion they imposed. Bulgaria will continue to look ahead and work towards its full membership in all the policies of the European Union, Schengen and the euro area. We achieved high economic growth of 4%, unemployment fell below 6%, low external debt below 30%, 24% to date, Jean-Claude. We have a significant financial reserve and in practice it is zero budget deficit – sustainable, for years. We have shown that we are a loyal partner and we are patient. I believe in diplomacy, not the practice of vetoing it. We all know how it ends.  The motto of the Bulgarian Presidency was \"Unification makes power\" and today, after 6 months, we can say that the power of unification is the future of Europe. So thank you again. I thank the teams of both President Tajani and Jean-Claude Juncker, these tens, hundreds of technical persons at all levels, experts, the translators thank you for their cooperation, for the fact that our first presidency, at least in the general opinion, was successful and Bulgaria as a country feels a proud member of the European Union.

In fact, we would not have done that if Mrs Merkel or Mr Macron had been present. We would never have done that.  Independently of that, I would like to start by thanking Prime Minister Borisov and his entire team for a very successful presidency. On a more personal level, he personally, because he has the merit of a successful presidency; Lilyana, who was the real engineer of this presidency; and for the high quality of the public service in Bulgaria and in Brussels, the ambassador and all those working with the Prime Minister in Bulgaria, in Sofia and elsewhere. Well done, a great job. Thank you for that. (Applause) The motto of your presidency was 'United we stand strong', and this sums up the way you have approached your presidency. You did it every hour, every second, every minute, and it was a pleasure to work with the Bulgarian Presidency. I hope that this good tradition initiated by Estonia and continued by Bulgaria will prevail during the Austrian Presidency. You have built bridges, you have brought people together, and in the more specific areas you have delivered. This is true of everything that has been done in relation to economic and monetary union. This is true of modernizing telecommunications rules. This is true for everything concerning digital Europe and the work of the Bulgarian Commissioner for these affairs, in whom I have full confidence and for whom I have great friendship. The Bulgarians, on both sides, were excellent. The digital economy, led by the Bulgarian Presidency and Mariya Gabriel, has made great progress. The same applies to the governance of the Energy Union. That is why I am particularly pleased that you have been able, in difficult circumstances, it must be said, to carry out the work on seconded work. You have contributed, more than others, and in difficult circumstances for you, to make the principle of 'equal work, equal pay in the same place' the guiding principle of all the social policies of Europe.  Sie waren sehr stark in Sachen Westbalkan-Politik. Wir haben oft dar-ber gesprochen, wir waren in Sofia, wir waren in Warna, wir waren 'berall, weil das Thema Westbalkan ' ' so wie Sie es versprochen hatten 'berall im Mittelpunkt Ihres Tuns stand. Sie haben dafar gesorgt, dass die europeische Politik, die europeische Perspektive des Westbalkans in der Region besser verstanden wird. Es gab ja beim Amtsantritt dieser Kommission Entt-uschung, als wir sagten; es kàme in dieser Legislaturperiode von 2014-2019 zu keinen neuen Beitritten. Wir sind uns jetzt dar-ber einig geworden, dass groe Anstrengungen erforderlich sind, Sie haben aber wesentlich dazu beigetragen, dass das Unerkl-rliche im Westbalkan erkl-rbar wurde. Ich habe mich dafar zu bedanken, genau wie ich mich dafar zu bedanken habe, dass Sie immer bereit waren, in Sachen Au-engrenzschutz Ihren Mann zu stehen.

When we met in January and discussed what was to come, we crossed our fingers and wished the young Bulgarian Presidency all the best. Today Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his entire team are back here and can take stock. It is a fantastic record, it is a strong record that has been achieved in the last six months. Thanks to the Bulgarian leadership, Europe has made a great deal of progress. On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to express my sincere thanks for this. It has strengthened Europe. I would like to thank your team, the Minister and all my cabinet colleagues. I would like to thank Marija Gabriel, the Bulgarian Commissioner, who built bridges and helped to initiate and accompany many dossiers. That was a good community effort. When we look at the content, the first thing that comes into view is the economy, the internal market. I like the results of geo-blocking, we in the GROUP of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats like the results that we provide 30% of European content for digital content, that is, to strengthen European culture. Energy governance has already been mentioned and the Defence Union has also been strengthened under your Presidency. Europe has been strengthened in the economy. The second major issue I would like to emphasise is the issue of migration. You have demonstrated that the protection of Europe – securing borders, securing borders with determination – and humanity fit together. We have completed the resettlement under your Presidency – a package that makes it clear that Europe is still open to people who are really in need, and on the other hand, on the external border, you are showing how we can really protect Europe in a humanitarian way and properly protect it by not having illegal migrants in bulgaria. Both points good points! I think that is also a good argument to say now that Bulgaria should now also become a Schengen member. Bulgaria has demonstrated that it can secure its external borders. Bulgaria has shown that it can do its homework in internal security. The criteria have been completed. That is why the interior ministers should now finally deal fairly with this issue of Bulgarian membership in the Schengen area. (Applause) The Western Balkans have already been mentioned. The question is whether we export security to the Western Balkans or whether insecurity is imported into Europe from the Western Balkans. That is the question that is in the room, and that is why we must now turn to it. Your presidency has focused on this. I think it is important that this has been backed up by concrete projects. Ladies and gentlemen, we have had an experience over the last six months, namely that when the Heads of State or Government meet there, there is a dispute, there is a dispute, that national selfishness is practised, and on the other hand, we have seen that, when there is a strong Presidency of the Council, an enormous amount can be achieved together with the European Parliament. That is why I say that the Europe of the institutions, of the Commission, of Parliament, of the Councils of Ministers in Europe is making progress and is achieving good results for the people and that the Europe of states, of national selfishness, is unfortunately not in a position to solve the tasks of our time. I believe that this is also a recognition of this Presidency. Therefore: Thank you again, dear Boyko Borissov! Clear course for Europe – with you in the leadership of the Council, we have had a strong European advocate who does not veto, but practises partnership. I would also like to make it clear that Bulgaria has joined the ranks of the large states that are advancing Europe. A great record! Thank you very much for that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Eric Andrieu", "mepid": "113892", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of The President, Mr Prime Minister, Mr President of the Commission, on behalf of the Group of Social Democrats, I thank you and congratulate you on this six-month presidency, which has seen a great deal of progress in our institutions. I believe that the work that has been done on the Western Balkans is a considerable amount of work and you have said it and President Juncker has pointed out that on the question of Albania and Macedonia, the agreements are there. Bravo for this work of dialogue, congratulations for the method, congratulations for the energy and the way you have dynamically all these territories. It has also been said, we are not going to repeat ourselves, on digital, you have proposed it as a strategic priority and I think it is safe to say here, thanks also to your Commissioner, that things have made great progress at the Union level. Our shared history will remember that your work has contributed to the progress of this major subject in favour of the balance of the development of the territories. There are points that I would like to highlight, mainly and in particular the political agreement that was concluded in a trilogue on 20 June last under your presidency on the draft EU-wide governance regulation on energy and climate policies which should enable the eu's energy and climate targets to be achieved in Europe by 2030 with a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent. a minimum share of 32% of renewable energy in the EU's energy mix and a target of 32.5% energy savings. These issues and objectives are important, but not sufficient if we are to collectively meet the objectives of COP 21 and perhaps the power outage we suffered here at the beginning of the session is here to remind us. We must always go further in terms of energy if we are to achieve our collective objectives. It is a lot of work, and I wanted to thank you publicly for that. I would also like to congratulate myself, on environmental issues, that during your presidency, and I know that this particularly affects your Commissioner, you were able to obtain a majority in the Council to ban the three bee-killing neonicotinoids. This is a major biodiversity issue. We had failed on glyphosate, where you won on neonicotinoids, and I think the Europeans today are grateful. Again, we need to go further in biodiversity. I am concerned about two issues. First of all, with regard to the MFF , and this was not in your mandate - it is worrying not to be able to convince the Member States of the need to devote an ambitious budget to the European project in the making. We must now strongly point out the need to give the Union a strategy and a major role at the international level. Finally, I will highlight the limits of the Council on immigration on 28 and 29 June. The decision that was made there, although difficult, was a minimum decision. It is therefore a small regret towards this Presidency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Ангел Джамбазки", "mepid": "124873", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of ministers, honourable Prime Minister, it is quite obvious that the technical preparation of the Presidency of the Government has been excellent and this is visible and heard by all who are in the Chamber. Technical files, all things related to digitisation, social pillars, the fight to protect our interests with regard to posted workers, etc.  Much more important are the few political issues that have been posed and protected. There is no Bulgarian who does not understand the importance of not have borders between Ohrid and the Black Sea. This is what is thought of in the European Union. For this, the setting of this topic is an undeniable success, as for the European Union, because it signals development, signals a halt to centrifugal processes, especially after Brexit. I can't help but congratulate you on that. I congratulate you, of course, on the policy that the government is leading in terms of maintaining balance and good relations in the countries within the European Union. Don't punish Hungary, Poland, prepare for excellent relations with the UK after Brexit. They must remain our not only partners, but our closest, most heartfelt friends, partners with whom to work together in the field of defense and security. I congratulate you for defending a policy that has been personally mine and my political organisation since 2013 with regard to illegal migration. For example, strong security at the external borders, combating sewage and lubrication of sewers, preventing the application of unfair clauses in the Dublin Regulation that harm border states, because, let's remind us, our countries, specifically Bulgaria, were not colonial states, did not profit on the basis of foreign resources, foreign labour, and there is no reason for us to pay foreign bills.  For this reason, whoever wants to accept displacement is his personal will, but we cannot and should not do so, and here I encourage you to continue in this direction to protect our interest and the interest of the countries we represent.  In conclusion, after the congratulations, I would like to invite colleague Keller again to visit Pirin, now in the summer it is even nicer, to see how nice the mountain develops. I hope she was able to count the lifts in Germany. Only last year there were built about 300, in Bulgaria not one was built. Here you go, we'il have a cup of tea, i hope it'il be interesting.

I do it without unnecessary pateism, because neither Europe, letly less Bulgaria, needs it, as we do not need directed applause, because they interfere with objective analysis. That's what I usually say. Undoubtedly, our Presidency has revived the policies of the European Union forgotten in recent years. We cannot help but note the positive development of enlargement policy, and in particular the emphasis that has been placed on the Western Balkans. Today, for 4 of the countries, the map seems drawn, but we must not forget the other two – Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. I very much hope that the upcoming Presidencies will continue to actively work towards the integration of the Western Balkans. And despite progress on a number of legislative initiatives, we remain vital to our common future. The European Union remains in a difficult position, there is no significant progress on Brexit. Until last week, there was no clear solution to the refugee crisis, and it is not yet clear how we will deal with migration management and a number of other common challenges.  Bulgaria receives congratulations on the well-organized events of the presidency calendar, but receives no confirmation that it is a serious economy with an invitation to the Eurozone. Therefore, there is no official intention expressed by the Bulgarian Government. We have not received confirmation that we are a country that can be trusted with an invitation to Schengen, despite public promises to do so. Together with Romania, we continue to be part of the security and verification mechanism.  Our country can be proud of its contribution to European civilization, with the work of the holy brothers Cyril and Methodius, the rescue of its Jews, its unique modern ethnic model. There may be many examples here, but we cannot be proud of the fact that you first empowered extreme nationalism in Europe and thus introduced duality in terms of the values of the European Union. Of course GERB did it with the blessing of the European People's Party. This is what happens in other countries. There is no way to fight double standards at European level when you show duality in terms of principles in your own country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, I would like to say to the Prime Minister that it’s fair to say we still have a lot of problems in Europe which have not been resolved in the last six months. We have the eurozone issue, we have Brexit and so many other things. However, Prime Minister, I really wouldn’t blame it on you. We have inside as well as outside problems. We have a big German governmental crisis that is blocking everything and we have governments playing hardball on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). We even have the Austrians playing foul, and they have only just started their Presidency! In other areas, however, it has indeed been possible to succeed. One of them was on the Western Balkans, on which I congratulate you because I think it’s really important that countries receive a reward if, like in Albania, they make huge reforms or, like Macedonia, they agree on solving such a big problem. I hope everyone in this House will support the agreement. (Applause)  Finally, putting the Paris Agreement into EU law was a big achievement under your Presidency so I congratulate you on that. I hope that, as you leave the Presidency, you can take with you the spirit of biodiversity – many colleagues have said how important that is – because Bulgaria is also so rich in biodiversity and natural beauty. I have had the opportunity of visiting Pirin National Park: it is really fantastic and we should do everything possible to preserve it. Lastly, I also hope your Government will be a bit more forthcoming on corruption because this is a big obstacle in many Member States. I hope you were also able to experience media pluralism and pluralism of opinion here, and how enriching it actually is.

The Bulgarian Presidency has inherited two difficult tasks: one is the issue of Brexit and the other is the issue of migration. After a number of rounds of negotiations on Brexit, there are unresolved fundamental issues. Such is the territorial scope of the agreement, something about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. This preseses the looming threat that there may not be an agreement. This must be avoided. We must represent the interests of the EU27, but the only way to reach an agreement is to consider the fair interests of the British people.

I listened very carefully to every single parliamentary group. I agree with many things, and for others, of course, we will draw conclusions. I've never claimed to be perfect, I've never said we're sinless, and I don't think there's one in Europe that says it.  So, we are trying very hard to protect the environment, we have made a new anti-corruption body, with a new law, with huge powers, with huge opportunities, and I really hope that this topic will fall off our agenda.  As for the ethnic model, I have always argued that Bulgaria has a unique ethnic model and I have always argued that the role of DPS in this regard has been huge. Democracy in Europe invented political parties, or as Churchill said, and he didn't like them, but nothing better democracy invented. And it was the will of the Bulgarian people to arrange us in the way we currently manage. This is the role of the people, but a voice of the people, a voice of God.  So, let's try and make sure that everyone stands as an earring on our ear, that the ethnic model is the best that Bulgaria has achieved in this field, and it must continue. Yes, political rebukes, struggles, this is normal in politics, but the straight line is that among Bulgarian citizens of different religions we should not give any chance to sprout opposition. So, in this respect, I guarantee you that I am always on the lookout. But the other is the will of the people, the other is the will of the voters, and they have arranged us in this way. And we, in doing so, work, I hope, successfully.  Thank you to the Socialists, thank you to the Greens, thank you to the Conservatives. Brexit, my colleague, is something for which we have actually made a tremendous effort – with Michel Barnier and separately, at least now I am not prepared to tell you – 3, 4, 5 meetings, perhaps with Theresa May, with her ministers, in both London and Sofia. We have tried to resolve as much as possible a normal divorce, a normal Brexit, because indeed Britain is not any country in Europe, and I hope that common sense will actually achieve such a Brexit that protects both the rights of Britain and, at the same time, the rights of the Member States of the European Union. I hope because it is a powerful economy, and we are, here you see, we are one Europe. On the Balkans, thank you once again for helping us, this is our common success. Serbia two more chapters opened, Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, a colleague, you can also ask their prime ministers and presidents how many meetings we did, how much effort we put in. They themselves know that they are not yet ready to be offered the status that Skopje and Tirana have been granted. And I'il say why. Already the electoral code in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not clear, they themselves need to line up. The same is largely for Kosovo, there is much to be done, but the way, the talks, their participation in all the meetings... You remember how many years we were observers in the processes, they are at all meetings, they participate, I hear their problems, they know each other, they invite them to Brussels, they have their perspective, and if they do their homework, which we continue to do in Bulgaria, in Romania, of course that the necessary will be done. So, not to be long, and Sabathian Kurtz I'm sure he's excited, advice I would never give without being asked.

It is a great pleasure and honour for me to have the opportunity today to be with you in the European Parliament, with you as the elected representatives of the European people at European level.  We met high up in Schladming on Saturday at a summit in Austria to take over the European relay from Boyko Borissov. It was a solemn act, because in Austria, as a pro-European country, we consider it a great honour that we are allowed to take over the Presidency of the European Union.  It is not only a great honour for us, but above all it is also a great responsibility. And I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Bulgarian Presidency on its work over the last six months, a work which, in our view, has been very professional, and we will endeavour to continue the work for the European Union in the same vein. It is a great responsibility that we can assume here in order to make a contribution to the future of the European Union. I admit that, as a young person at the age of 31, the European Union is something of a matter of course for me. In recent years, however, I have become increasingly aware that we, as politicians, must not take the European Union for granted, but must work hard every day to develop the European Union's project of peace and success and constantly change it for the better. As the Republic of Austria, we can take over the Presidency at a very challenging time – at a time of upheaval. We are witnessing an ever-changing political landscape in the United States, which has become more unpredictable for us in Europe. We are seeing an enormous economic rise in China, but at the same time a social model that is far from ours in Europe. And with our largest neighbour on our continent, Russia, we still have ongoing tensions directly in Europe. Within the European Union, tensions have increased in recent years, and there is almost the impression that there are divisions here that need to be overcome. With Brexit, we are witnessing for the first time that after years when only states wanted to join the European Union, one country voluntarily leaves the European Union. Please do not misunderstand me, I was allowed to be Foreign Minister of the Republic of Austria for four years, and every time I travel to outside Europe, I have become increasingly aware of how grateful we can be to live in Europe. I have become increasingly aware that much of what we take for granted in Europe is not self-evident. I have become increasingly aware that the rule of law, democracy, the fundamental freedoms that seem normal to us, are anything but God-given elsewhere in the world. So it is a gift to be able to live in Europe, it is a gift to be european , even at a time full of challenges.  However, in recent years, when I was allowed to travel a lot as Foreign Minister, I have not only become aware that these freedoms, the rule of law and democracy are far from self-evident elsewhere, but I have also become increasingly aware that it is our task to fight to ensure that this remains the case in Europe. The rule of law, democracy, fundamental freedoms – this is not only the foundation for us in Europe, it is the heart of our coexistence. And we, as the Presidency, will play our part in ensuring that these fundamental freedoms in Europe remain a matter of course. In addition, however, it is important to fight to ensure that Europe maintains its competitiveness. Because prosperity in Europe, justice, the European way of life – the model of life of the European Union – depends on our fundamental rights, but it also depends on our competitiveness and our economic performance. We must therefore also work, at a time of digitisation and automation, to ensure that we remain competitive as the European Union, that we are not overtaken by other regions of the world because we are more bureaucratic or slower, but that we must do everything we can to ensure that we continue to be at the top of the world even in this changing time.  That is precisely why we, as the Presidency, want to focus on the big issues. In the spirit of subsidiarity, we firmly believe that it is necessary to focus on big issues, and that is what we want to do with you, together with the European Parliament – but of course also with the Commission. I would like to thank you very much, Mr President, for the good visit to the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament in Vienna on 19 June: it was a first good exchange in preparation for our Presidency. However, I very much hope that we will be able to continue the good cooperation that we have been able to initiate here, even during the six months, in an equally friendly and professional manner.  We certainly do not agree everywhere, but I noticed at the time that all the political groups in the European Parliament do not always agree. Perhaps, however, this is precisely what makes us in Europe a little bit: that we can afford to disagree, but at the same time we must also know that we should focus on where we agree that we also focus on the objectives, where we can reach compromises.  That is precisely the aim of our Presidency: to be a bridge builder and to focus on issues where it is possible to move our European Union forward together. We put the Presidency under the motto: Europe that protects. We want to focus on challenges that are currently being asked in our time, we want to do everything we can to ensure prosperity in Europe, and we want to do so not only within but also outside our European borders. More specifically, we want to focus on three priorities. Firstly, security and the fight against illegal migration, because the protection of the European population must be a top priority and because we need a paradigm shift in migration policy. There needs to be a greater focus on external border protection as the basis for a Europe without internal borders. In this context, I am very pleased that last week at the European Council – in my view – we managed to reverse the trend and to place an important focus on external border protection, on cooperation with third countries. This is essential, in addition to the debate on the Dublin reform and also the distribution in Europe. In particular, the discussion at German level on national measures on Austria shows us once again that there is a need for a focus on external border protection and that a Europe without internal borders can only exist in the long term if there are also functioning external borders. Secondly, we also want to focus on safeguarding our prosperity. Digitisation and also automation are changing our world, and only if we succeed in leading the way here and taking advantage of the opportunities that arise here will we, as the European Union, continue to be at the forefront of the world. We must do everything we can to ensure that, in future, the large Internet companies are not only created in the United States and China, but are also possible in Europe. As the European Union, we have the best basic conditions: the rule of law, good infrastructure, well-educated people in our European Union and, above all, an internal market of 500 million people. But we must now also create the right framework conditions to ensure high-tech-made in Europe in the future and, above all, to achieve a level playing field. In this context, I support the European Union's idea of a compensation tax for Internet giants, because such a move would contribute to greater equality of opportunity and fairer competition for European companies as well.  (Applause) Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to the issue of security and the fight against illegal migration, in addition to the issue of safeguarding our prosperity, it is of course also necessary for us as the European Union to be active in our neighbourhood. A Europe that protects does not end at the European external border. Only if we succeed in ensuring peace, security and stability in our neighbourhood will we be able to guarantee peace, security and stability in Europe in the long term. We want to help improve the relationship in our eastern neighbourhood. In addition to the response to Russian aggression, as well as sanctions for conduct contrary to international law, it is necessary to strengthen the channels of dialogue here again. Because peace on our continent will only be able to exist with and not against Russia in the long term. We also want to step up cooperation with Africa, and I am very grateful to the President of the European Parliament for being a driver here. Only if we manage to improve living conditions in Africa can we ensure that the suffering of the people there is reduced. Only if we are involved in fair trade with Africa Together, while supporting European investment there, we can ensure that there is also sustainable development and prospects for young people. Thirdly, the neighbourhood that is particularly close to our hearts as the Republic of Austria is, of course, the region of south-eastern Europe and, in particular, the Western Balkans. In our opinion, the European Union's project is only completed when the Western Balkans are also part of our united Europe. These states, ladies and gentlemen, have not only earned a European perspective, they have earned their membership of the European Union, and we must give them the best possible support on their way to the European Union. In this context, I am very pleased that it was possible to reach an agreement on the name dispute, and we are glad that Macedonia and Albania will now also be able to open accession negotiations – even if we would have liked to see this more quickly. What is needed, however, is an honest perspective for these states, and continuous progress towards the European Union. Only by ensuring that this will we be able to ensure that other countries in the world do not increase their influence in the region more and more, and only if we ensure that this can we ensure that the European Union project is eventually completed and that these states are also part of our European Union and can also benefit from our fundamental values and the development of the European Union. In addition to the national priorities that can be set during a Presidency, there are, of course, issues on the agenda that we have not chosen. I am allude to Brexit. We are all unhappy that Britain is leaving the European Union, but it is all the more important that we deal with this in an orderly manner. There can be no cherry-picking for Britain, but it is just as important that we ensure an orderly political as well as economic relationship with The United Kingdom. In this context, I am very grateful to the Chief Negotiator of the European Union for his work and we will do everything we can to support him in the best possible way and to ensure the unity of the 27 on this issue. We want to support the European Commission in the best possible way in the negotiations for the next European budget, for the multiannual financial framework, even though we are aware that the negotiations are still very difficult. I believe that we need a good mix of quality and, of course, timing, because both are crucial for the stability of the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, we are aware that we can take over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union at a challenging time. We are aware that it will also be the last full Presidency before the election to the European Parliament, and we are aware that it will be a great effort and effort for us. Nevertheless, we are looking forward to this activity. We ask you to cooperate as best as possible and support the Austrian Presidency, we are glad that we can be bridge builders on some difficult issues in the interests of Europeans, in the interests of our European Union.

Mr President, Chancellor, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I look forward to this Austrian Presidency, because the two previous Austrian presidencies were crowned with success, because all the relevant austrian political forces have also swam in the same direction and have moved coherently in the past. I have actually known Sebastian Kurz for many years, and I know that he is supported by European convictions. The same applies to the Austrian Federal Government. If you were to take a look at the government programme of the Austrian Federal Government – which many do not do, but what many are talking about – you might find that this government programme of the Austrian Federal Government has a clearly pro-European tonality. I welcomed this at the time, and I welcome it now. As in the past, we will have to work together a great deal. The Commission's offer is that we want to do this in friendship and mutual understanding. I am also convinced that we will succeed in this. The Commission will go to Vienna at the end of this week, Thursday and Friday – a beautiful city. We look forward to this visit. I would have preferred this meeting to have taken place in Tyrol, because this is the Austrian federal state that I know best, but Vienna is also okay and carries messages that need to be continued. We will have to talk about the protection of external borders, which is also a concern of the Chancellor. But this is not an invention of this time. The European Commission, which is sometimes a little more far-sighted than the Member States can be, proposed the protection of external borders as early as 2008. It is clear who was against the fact that there should be a European external border protection, there were several German speakers in the association who refused to do so. If we had done so, and if we had implemented the successor proposal of the Barroso Commission from 2013 and the proposals of the Commission I chaired in the Presidency of February, March 2015 in the Council, we would have spared ourselves many problems. (Applause) The Austrian Chancellor recently argued in an interview or in a direct interview – I cannot remember it correctly, probably also in direct conversation – that we should not increase the number of European border guards to 10 000 by 2027, but that we should do so at an acceleration rate for 2020. We will do that. The Commission will put these acceleration proposals on the table of the two legislators in September. I would like us to have 10 000 men on duty in 2020 to support the 100 000 national border guards in their difficult task. Incidentally, I believe that we should literally put in place a genuine, proper, efficient border police force. I am also in favour of swiftly addressing the technical issues, the material issues that arise in this context. I also made this statement at the European Council last Sunday. We need more aircraft, we need more ships, we need more vehicles – wheeled vehicles mean correct German. That is what we should be doing in the coming days and weeks. I would like us to adopt by July the five legislative proposals on asylum, which were also pushed forward with admirable energy by the European Parliament. I proposed this in the European Council. This was not unanimously agreed, but where we agree between the institutions of Parliament, the Council and the Commission on asylum issues, we should do so instead of giving the impression that we are just talking and not acting. We could act! (Applause) I would be glad if the two asylum issues that are still open – you know what I am allabouting – were to be pushed so far by the end of the year under the Austrian Presidency that we could come to a conclusion in the near future. So we need the Austrian negotiating skills. We also need this in terms of multiannual financial frameworks. The Commission has presented its proposals. This does not apply to the unexpected unanimous approval, but we in the Council, under the Austrian Presidency, must start working on these proposals consistently. In the past, we always had a kind of negotiations in toolboxes. There will be no other way. We must, step by step, agree on partial elements step by step that a deal will be possible before the European elections in May next year. I know that this is difficult, both here in this House and between governments, but if the Austrian Presidency does not do what we expect of it, in fact, to work quickly on these issues, we would find ourselves in a similar situation to last time, in the last multiannual financial framework. If we finish too late and are not ready to start on 1 January 2019, we will lose thousands of research places in Europe. However, we have agreed that research and innovation is an absolute priority in the European Union and for the European Union. We have agreed that we will massively expand the Erasmus programme. If we do not achieve this by 1 January 2019, we will not be able to provide positive support to tens of thousands of students and teachers with the Erasmus programme. So, dear Sebastian, there is a lot of work to be done. I know that you work a lot, that you can also empathize with the sensitivities of others. I try to do something similar, I don't always succeed – you don't always, but mostly. Positive negotiations and charm-driven solutions are on the House table. It's not just Wiener Schnitzel that belongs on the plate. But you know that I am a big fan of the Wiener Schnitzel. I was in Mongolia, in Ivory Coast, in Africa, in Asia – Wiener Schnitzel everywhere, but not only Wiener Schnitzel belongs on the plate of the house.

Austria is a strong European country, a great European country. When you are in Vienna, you feel that, if you look into the history of the country, you know that. If I may single out one point, the Austrian Constitution of 1867 has already established a multilingual parliament, as we are today. It has been stipulated that every Austrian citizen has the fundamental right to his own language, culture, traditions. At that time, as in many other regions of Europe, the foundations were laid for what we are now allowed to practice and live in Europe. For example, the fact that a student exchange was established in Austria as early as the 19th century is a beautiful facet that gives us orientation even today. And then in recent history: one of the great pioneers of European unity, Alois Mock, cut through the Iron Curtain on the border with Hungary in 1989, 20 days later Austria applied for membership of the European Union, and four months later the Berlin Wall fell – also a beautiful symbol of Austria's contribution to the unification of this continent. That is why we are looking forward to the Austrian Presidency with the message \"building bridges\", for which you stand, dear Sebastian, and for which Austria stands. From our point of view, from the point of view of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there are three areas: firstly, the tasks that you – and therefore you too – are being given by the Bulgarian Presidency. The tasks of the discussion on our currency are part of this, the euro results for the further development of the euro area, which we now had in the Council. My group supports the establishment of a European Monetary Fund, as it is always called. We need more independence from international structures. We support the establishment of an investment budget for the European Union. We have done a lot in reforms: social reforms, labour market reforms. We have done a great deal in the stability of budgets. And now Europe must invest. That is the right time. That is why our group is doing this. We would also like us to talk a little more about successes, because the 2.5% economic growth and the almost ten million jobs that have been created are a strong record that we have already made in recent years. Of course, the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council also includes Europe's second top issue: the continuation of work on migration. You have our full support when it comes to the protection of external borders. A few minutes ago, Boyko Borissov, who is on the Bulgarian-Turkish border, sat in your seat, showing that the protection of external borders is possible, that we can end illegal migration on this continent. Only then will we be able to get the citizens of Europe to be open to resettlement and to the truly wounded in the world, that we also welcome those in Europe. That is why we are fully supported in the protection of external borders. I am also pleased that you have announced that you will convene an Africa Summit, that you will also turn to this continent and that you will stick to the European solution. The third thing the Bulgarian Presidency gives you is the Western Balkans. Thank you for your clear announcements today that this region needs a clear European perspective. The second box we are seeing, of course, is the work on all the issues of this parliamentary term, and it will be an intense working month that is ahead of you. These include fair taxes – treating internet companies in the same way that our craftsmen see taxes collected – and that includes the issue that Jean-Claude Juncker raised, namely the budget. My group wants a modern budget that means less bureaucracy for the citizens. My group is also prepared to talk about saving in Europe. We need to be self-critical about the efficiency of spending – yes. But we also want a budget that means security for the citizens, for those who benefit from the European budget. And we want a budget that makes the future possible for this continent. That is why we want the discussions to be concluded before the European elections. This is a difficult task, but we should try to get it done in 2018. Together we ask you to tackle this task. And last but not least, the third box: themes of departure for this continent. Not only work, not only business as usual, but also Departure. I'm glad you're putting that in the spotlight. You are a young head of government on this continent, you stand for the future of the continent. That is why I am pleased that you are making this so clear: in trade policy – the key question about the economic successes of our continent, the buzzword of unity – on the question of the digital world, whether we can also implement our values, such as copyright, which we will be discussing this week, the ideas that Europe stands for, in the digital world. I would like to point out that in a few days' time Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will meet in Helsinki. It is also a question of whether we are only fence guests in global development, whether we are just watching what the great blocs of this world decide for us, or whether this continent stands on its own two feet and is capable of taking decisions. And, dear Sebastian, I must also mention this: if we want us to be self-confident in global areas, then we will not be able to avoid the question of whether we should set aside the principle of unanimity on foreign policy issues and come to majority decision-making in the Council. Only then can this continent really bring the power that this continent would have. In this respect, there is a lot to do for you. We wish you good luck, and you can rely on your PPE Group.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Chancellor, I would like to thank the President of the Commission for his work and for his work My Socialist Group thinks a great deal about the departure of the European project. However, we do not believe in the demolition of the European project. That is why, Chancellor, let me come straight to the question of this morning: in Germany, there have been critical discussions for weeks between two sister parties – the CSU and the CDU – about – I believe – not the relevant issues of migration policy, but on side issues, small questions compared to the big questions. The dispute was about the extent to which people registered elsewhere as asylum seekers can be rejected directly at the german-Austrian border as those who have applied for asylum. The sister parties, if you may call them that, yesterday agreed on a proposal to set up centres where, by administrative agreement, they would be sent back directly: Italy. In Austrian newspapers, and this is becoming a European problem, I can read this morning that your government is saying that if this happens, we will secure the southern border, that is, close to Italy. I want to know: is this the case? I would like to know – because this is no longer just a posse in the Bavarian state government, but a European problem: does Mrs Merkel, did Mr Seehofer consult you before this idea was born? Have you agreed to make this proposal? How do you feel about this and will you agree? Or are we now finally facing a European crisis, where the domino effect is imminent, which will destroy Schengen, which the President of the Commission has always warned about and where he invested last Sunday to prevent it? They would help us with an assessment. I have doubts as to whether all this can still be explained by rational means, after your Minister for the Interior has also said that there are about 20 people a week involved. However, let me embed my discussion in a larger question. Our two countries have been through dark stages in the last century. Europe was given to us, to the Germans earlier, to the Austrians at their own discretion later. We both benefit immensely – economically, politically, culturally. This path has been paved by great personalities, by people like Bruno Kreisky and Willy Brandt, who have taught us to open the door to the east, to unite the family who have looked to southern Europe, who have inspired the North-South dialogue, without which we would not be where we are today. Gyula Horn and Alois Mock – and this has been mentioned – have literally cut the Iron Curtain. This has enabled thousands of my compatriots to make their way to freedom – for which we are grateful. These were great Europeans whose names no one will forget. Now we see 700 gunmen, heavy equipment, helicopters approaching the Austrian-Slovenian border. That is roughly the region that, in 1867, Mr Weber, agreed to have a multilingual parliament. Were we further than we are today? My group says no to this development in Austria too!  (Applause) Armament at the borders within the European Union – yes, where do we actually live? This is not the Europe we want. This is not the Europe we support.  You also disappoint the internal Austrian debate – that seems to me to be urgently needed. I sometimes wonder, when voices are heard, whether the CSU, whether the development of the Austrian People's Party, is evidence that we are entering into the Orbanisation of Europe and also of the Christian Democratic parties. I don't know for sure. Sometimes I think we are entering into despair, into the politics of fear, into politics, to make people afraid of people. My Socialist Group will oppose this, because we stand for the policy of hope! We stand for the policy of the future of the European project!  That is why you are choosing the centre of Europe. If you come back to where we need you, we will also be counting on your vigour in this Austrian Presidency.

Mr President, Chancellor Kurz, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and for the work he has Your country took over the Presidency of the Council of the EU on 1 July this year. Many citizens of my country have high hopes for Austria, but also for you personally. Since you formed a government, you have followed up your announcements with deeds. They set important priorities in migration policy, in a performance-based tax policy, in a sensible social policy and in a performance-oriented education policy. Its greatest merit is certainly the closure of the Balkan route, which has given a decisive impetus to a reorientation in European refugee policy. On behalf of many of my compatriots, I would also like to thank you warmly for this.  The external border protection, which has been discussed for many years, is more than overdue. Active action is not accustomed in Germany. The federal government of my country has been sitting out most of the problems for years, delaying them or exacerbating them – whether through incompetence or a lack of will, let us be put aside. In Germany, it is not governed, but at best managed. They want to be bridge builders. This is very important these days, because my country's policy has driven not only a deep wedge into my country, but into the whole of the European Union. But it is not just illegal migration that poses difficulties for the EU. The euro crisis has also been simmering for years. In the nearly ten years since the onset of the financial crisis, little has improved. The south of Europe has made too little progress in reform, debt has risen, and financial markets accept this whole construct only because they are sure that the North will take on the debt. That is also why Mrs Merkel has received so much support in the EU in recent days to keep her in office. In the coming months, the EU wants to make major changes to the European Treaties.  For years, THE EU centralists like Mr Juncker, like Mr Weber, like Mr Verhofstadt, have been working on various proposals that have one thing in common: they want to turn the European Union into the United States of Europe, (interruption: no!) with an economic government, (interruption: no!) with European taxes, with more centralisation. Now we should have learned from our history that centralized systems have crucial difficulties. They are not flexible and they are not innovative. Just two weeks ago, Mrs Merkel, together with French President Macron, made major concessions towards the European transfer union and central government with the Meseberg Declaration. The establishment of a eurozone budget with its own taxes or the banking union with a transfer of deposit guarantee funds from northern to southern Europe are only examples. With such concessions, can it be surprising that Mrs Merkel must be kept in office? Mr Kurz, three weeks ago your colleague Mark Rutte was here in Strasbourg. He was right to say that there was less EU, but better. He was right to point out that the euro did not keep the promise of prosperity, but that it was only a redistribution of wealth within the EU. We want a European Union that is limited to its core competences. It is also undisputed that Angela Merkel's opening of the border led directly to Brexit. I have been working closely with my British Conservative colleagues for four years, and I can tell you how great the loss will be for our continent, how great the loss of these factual and competent voices will be. And even more countries will turn away from this EU if they continue to feel patronised, ganged, and exploited by Brussels.

Chancellor, you have talked a lot about migration, and you have said your first priority is to be tougher on illegal migration. But I have to tell you one thing, being President of the European Council is a little bit different than being Chancellor of Austria. You have not only to please who you think are your voters in Austria. What you do as a Council President is something completely different. You have to build bridges, you have to make compromises, and you have to find difficult compromises. And from time to time, I have to tell you, it will not be pleasant. There will be unpopular compromises that you have to make on a lot of things. There is Brexit, the multiannual financial framework; there is a lot you did not talk about. That is a little bit strange as reform of the eurozone is a priority in the coming months and there is naturally also migration, so I will not talk to you now about all these fights. On Brexit we are waiting for the white paper of the British Government after the Chequers meeting. I hope that the match between England and Colombia will be less violent than the meeting in Chequers, but we will see this in the coming days. On Friday, there is the eurozone reform. The Council did nothing about that. They pushed all the problems until the end of the year. My question to you is: what are going to do? What initiative are you going to take on this? And then there is the so-called migration crisis, and I say ‘so-called’ because I don’t think it is a real migration crisis which we are living through in Europe at the moment; it is a political crisis on the back of migrants. That is the reality. Look at the figures before spreading fear into the populations and public opinion. There were more than one million crossings in the Mediterranean in 2015. That fell to 360 000 – still too many – in 2016. In 2017, 170 000 and now in the first six months of the year, 45 000 crossings in the Mediterranean, which is 0.07% of entire migration flows worldwide: 68 million in all. So what are we talking about? In my opinion we are not talking about a sudden influx of people crossing the Mediterranean. We are talking about a political decision, an opportunistic decision of one minister of the interior in Italy, Mr Salvini, who created this problem that we now have on our plate. That is happening, and Mr Salvini has a very simple opinion: he says, ‘not in Italy, put them in Germany, put them in Austria put them in Hungary maybe’. And Mr Orbán, who is a friend of Mr Salvini’s, says: ‘no, not in Hungary, we will put them in Italy or in Germany or why not in Austria’ and then your friend, Mr Seehofer, has another opinion and says ‘no, not in Germany, send them back to Italy or eventually to Hungary and maybe to your country, Austria’ and you are saying – and have already – you don’t want them in Austria. You want them to stay in Italy or in Germany or to send them to Hungary. You see what the problem is, Ms Chancellor. The problem in Europe is that the only consensus that the Council and the prime ministers and you and your friends can agree today is: ‘not in my back yard’. That is the only consensus that you are capable of for the moment, and that is the scandal of Europe. Don’t talk about migrants. We are talking about a political crisis on the back of migrants, and what I am asking you is not only to be tough on migration or illegal migration. You have to be tough on illegal migration but when an asylum seeker is coming from Syria when he enters the European Union, he is illegal before he asks for asylum. What I am asking you is to play the European card, as Austria has always done. And the European card is a real European border and coast guard. Back the proposals of the Commission before the end of the year with the Council. Secondly, make an agreement on Dublin. The parliaments have a position. The Council has no position for the moment. Thirdly, create European reception centres where people can ask for asylum inside or outside Europe, I don’t care, what is important is that they are not falling into the hands of the smugglers and the criminal gangs. Finally, a legal system of economic migration, which we absolutely need. In conclusion, Chancellor, you can count on the support of all this Parliament.

We couldn’t agree more, Mr Chancellor. In an uncertain world, the first thing that most of our citizens want is protection. Let’s take a look at what they say when we ask them and I have here the report commissioned by Parliament seeking the opinion of all people in Europe.  So, what do they say? The first thing they want to be protected from is terrorist attacks. Secondly, they want their jobs to be protected. Thirdly, they want to be protected from poverty and social exclusion. Even though the survey was conducted in the immediate aftermath of the biggest wave of arrivals in Europe, being protected from uncontrolled migration only comes fourth, right before being protected from climate change. When it comes to prioritising European action, all citizens say first work on tackling poverty and social exclusion and then work on fighting terrorism.  I am saying that because your Presidency has decided to conflate security with migration and make this its top priority, as if every migrant or asylum seeker were a potential criminal or terrorist, which would then justify keeping him or her away from the EU’s territory. And you do that, when in actual terms, as Guy Verhofstadt just said, the arrivals on our shores have dramatically dropped.  Make no mistake about it though, taking into account the dire situation of so many people in the areas surrounding Europe, the asylum and migration challenge will not fade away anytime soon. It is one that does not lend itself to simplistic solutions, but one that Europe can meet while fully respecting its core values.  So why is it, Mr Chancellor, that in chorus with too many other European heads of state and government, you choose to focus public attention on an issue that does not rank highest in our citizens’ minds and whose size makes it manageable, if only Member States would show solidarity with one another?  The simpler explanation, Mr Chancellor, is that you are seeking a diversion by riding on fears that you and your friends are fanning. You probably want to draw the attention of the people away from what you want to do at home – extending the working day to 12 hours, reducing social benefits to people based on nationality, or contradicting the banter of your coalition partner by ratifying the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which is a very multinational-friendly free trade deal.  So the picture becomes clear. You want a Europe that protects, yes, but that protects those who wield economic power, not the citizens. This is evidenced by the report that we have launched which highlights how your country still allows wealthy Austrian citizens to park their money away in Liechtenstein, a country that sells passports to dubious individuals or shows little enthusiasm in fighting money laundering.  After the financial crisis, Mr Chancellor, anger and anxiety grew in our society. We could, and we should, respond by changing our economic and social policies in order for them to serve the people. Instead, you and your friends choose to double down on neo—liberal policies and diverted the anger and anxiety towards very convenient scapegoats – the migrants.  So I’m asking you, Mr Kurz, and also you, Mr Weber, is this the new normal at the European People’s Party? Over the last few months we have seen your member parties increasingly adopting the ideas and rhetoric of the far-right, such as in Austria, in Bavaria or in France. Going together to the polls, like in Italy, governing with it, such as in Austria and, to crown it all, your member in Hungary is hailed by the entire far—right international as a hero.  You claim to be doing all this to prevent the expansion of far—right parties. The reality is that by legitimising their ideas you accelerate their diffusion in society and worse, you are making them official policy. Is this still the party of the fathers of Europe, who decided to launch the European project to cure our continent forever of the plague of nationalism and hatred?  I have never been – and these are my last words, Mr President – I have never been scared of the extreme right, but when the ideas of the extreme right contaminate the parties that were at the heart of European democracy, we are all in danger.

Mr President, first of all allow me to express once again GUE/NGL's support for the fair fight of interpreters in Parliament, who are on the 29th day of their strikes. At the same time, ladies and gentlemen, we also support the struggle of Austrian workers against the orchestrated efforts of your government, Chancellor, and employers' organisations to abolish the eight-hour period, to introduce up to twelve hours of work a day, 60 hours a week.  We send our solidarity to the Austrian workers, 100,000 of whom took part in last Saturday's militant demonstrations in Vienna, defending the eight-hour period. The austrian presidency's slogan is 'Europe to protect'. Who should the European Union protect from, Chancellor? Of the poor workers whose most basic achievements are threatened by your own government, who are about to assume the presidency of the Council? From the poor workers for whom you do not want to introduce a social safety net at European Union level? Of the Community workers in Austria, whom you treat as second-class citizens? Who else does the European Union need to protect, Chancellor? From the persecuted refugees from the wars? Of the desperate, all they want is the right to a peaceful and better life? Your Austrian Government has taken the lead in the recent Council decisions on more fortress Europe, for more dead in the Mediterranean, for internment in warehouses of people inside and outside the European Union, in concentration camps for migrants and refugees, promoting illegal repulsions of migrants and refugees, promoting the externalisation of borders with border guards in war-torn and destroyed countries such as Libya, creating boarding platforms there and violating the internationally guaranteed right to asylum, which continues to trade in human souls under the European Union-Turkey Agreement.  The decision of conservatives with the participation of, I would say, far-right parties and EPP parties, like your government, i.e. decisions to close borders, is contrary to the legal and moral obligations of the Member States. At the same time, it means that some Member States take a disproportionately larger share of the responsibility that all the Member States of the Union had to share. Notorious solidarity remains an empty letter. As GUE, we join our voice with all those who argue that the danger to Europe is not refugees and migrants – it is wars and imperialist interventions, which the Union and the Member States have supported in practice, are increasing economic and social inequalities, racism and xenophobia.  What is needed are initiatives to immediately end the wars and bloodshed in the Middle East and North Africa, for real and substantial development aid and support to the countries of Africa. We again emphatically call for the abolition of the Dublin Agreement and the creation of legal and safe routes for refugees.

But I think it is unfair that everyone is blaming Ms Merkel for this. Credit is due, I think, to the man on my left, Jean-Claude Juncker, it was he that opened the doors back in 2015 to a million people crossing the Mediterranean. So I think credit really is due to Mr Juncker for this catastrophe. And as borders and walls are being constructed all over Europe, isn’t it about time that everybody here faced a couple of realities? The Schengen area is a theoretical concept that now needs to be dismantled and that the total free movement of people within the European Union, especially in an age of terrorism, is something that voters will not allow to continue. This, folks, is why Brexit happened. Nations want to be responsible for their own actions and not to pay the price of the mistakes of others – I think the Italian elections show you this. And now in an attempt to survive, Ms Merkel is going to set up detention centres in the south of Germany, exactly the same policy put in place by Donald J. Trump in America.

This culminates in a Verhofstadt that does not even have the collegial kindness to stick to its speaking time, but simply keeps talking despite the President's multiple urges. But they are unconcerned about that. We have a different view of things. Austria is a small country with only eight million inhabitants. But I think that Austria is an important country, because Austria is something of a hub, because Austria is a hub between the interests of East and West, and because Austria has always been a meeting place to bring different interests here into a common whole in such a way that all those involved had something of it. The current situation in Europe and the European Union is demonstrably not the best. The EU is failing to deliver solutions to the very large areas, but on the other hand, it is producing things with regulations, with bureaucracy and with standards, where many people lack insight. In my view, we must now provide solutions in three major areas: the first is the European Union's self-image. You know that, following the shock of the Brexit referendum, the European Commission has written a White Paper here with five different scenarios for a good future for the European Union. This starts with the internal market scenario and goes all the way to total communitarisation. In its programme, Austria has set out the number four scenario, i.e. less cooperation, but more efficient. Only this House and the institutions of the European Union are afraid to commit themselves to a scenario. One often gets the impression that one says: it goes long here, and the other says: it goes on for a long time. If we succeed in reaching a consensus on this, then we will also have a good chance of developing the European Community project in a prosperous way. The second is the European Union's view of the internal. The very idea behind this European unification was to bring peace, freedom and prosperity across this continent. In many cases, strife, strife and resentment reign today. That is the wrong way to go. We need to understand how to look for common ground and not always work to define more and more differences. However, this succeeds in responding to the rapidly growing support from the European populations to return competences to their countries, also in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which would also be a key to a successful future. The third point is the European Union to the outside world, where, in my view, it is the wrong way to go – if I look at the two great powers, the United States and Russia – to put one President in the Klamauk and only to consider the other with sanctions. It would be a good way if Austria, the European Union, tried to show respect for these great powers.

First, a European social pillar of rights, which is important, inter alia, in terms of coping with the digital revolution, labour contracts and social protection for all citizens. Second, making sure that the Community budget brings back cohesion to the European Union. Third, reform of economic and monetary union, restoring upward convergence, not divergence.

We want to regulate globalisation.

Please help to ensure that, during your Presidency, our agreements with Japan, with Singapore, with Vietnam can be coordinated by the European Parliament, so that we can not only use words, but also deeds and maintain the good global order. Secondly, people seek protection from civil war, from oppression and from freedom. But many people also want protection against unregulated migration, and our colleague from the Greens has criticised you for the exercises of your border police. I would like to say thank you.

Moreover, Angela Merkel has not reassured the CSU to the extent she had hoped, which will cause nervousness in the rest of the European Union. The European Union must now find a way to deal with mass migration not only within Schengen, but also within borders outside the EU.  The debate over Brexit and the future of THE UK's relationship with the European Union will also be at its peak. Brexit, on the one hand, is very simple, but it contains fundamental questions.

The European way of life, you say, combined with the competitiveness of the European economy, is important for all citizens of the Member States of the European Union. I fully agree with this – without rebuilding, for example, European industry, without its significant contribution to the creation of gross domestic product, it will be difficult to talk about accepting the changes that affect the European economy, including its modernisation and modernity. It also seems important to me to approach the challenges to be based on the principle of subsidiarity within the Presidency. In order to make progress, it is necessary to resolve the issues that unite, which are the most important, and to omit those that divide and which are often of a minor nature. I would also like to thank you for maintaining the priority of the future of the Western Balkans.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I would like to comment on an issue that has been raised here several times, and that concerns the issue of subsidiarity. That is one of the main concerns of the Austrian Presidency and also of the Chancellor in person. I would like to point out that we have set up a working group headed by first Vice-President Frans Timmermans. An Austrian Member of Parliament is also taking part in this work. I would like this work to be completed quickly, and then, under Austrian leadership, we will deal with the content requirements, warnings and indications from this Commission, this working group. For me, this is an important issue. The Commission has also done a great deal in this regard. This Commission proposes an average of 20 to 23 legislative proposals, initiatives per year. The previous commissions had proposed 120, 130 initiatives. Nobody really recognises that we are doing less because we do not need more Europe, but a better Europe. We withdrew 51 legislative proposals and streamlined 151. I would ask that this be noted. And I object to Mrs Trebesius constantly telling lies here. Yes! I do not know which party you belong to. I know which group you belong to, and you should not. For to say – please do not confuse me with Mr Verhofstadt, whom I hold in high esteem – that I am in favour of the United States of Europe is an untrue claim. In my entire vita, with the exception of the first 20 years, you find no indication that I am in favour of the United States of Europe, because I am against giving the impression that the European Union is on the road to nationalisation. That is not what the people of Europe want. And I don't want that either. So please put these slogans in place, because I will ask you every time you claim this to be untrue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 67, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Sebastian Kurz", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Manfred Weber and Othmar Karas said: Let's make progress together! That is precisely the aim of the Austrian Presidency. Together with you in Parliament, together with the Commission and, of course, together with the Council, we want to try to bring many of the issues that have been raised today to the ground. There is enough to do. I would ask you to understand that in five minutes' speaking time I cannot deal with every issue that has now been raised. However, I believe that many issues have been mentioned on which we, as the European Union, must make progress. A Europe that protects, of course, does not just mean maintaining internal security, order and stability. This also means giving social security, which means ensuring competitiveness, so that we remain competitive even in a changing time. And, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, this does not end at our external borders, but security and stability can only be made through engagement outside our borders. The broad debate that has taken place here also reflects the range of opinions that exist among the European population. In this respect, I think it is quite positive that there is such a lively debate in the European Parliament. However, I hope – and I believe that Mr Verhofstadt has said this – that there is also the necessary willingness to compromise when it comes to finding common solutions. Because we, as the European Union, will only make progress if we also have the greatness of working together between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and if we are prepared to reach consensus across the political groups. However, I am very optimistic because I believe that, in reality, there is much, much more in the European Union that unites us than things that could ever separate us. You have, rightly, I believe, had a very broad debate here today on a wide range of issues. However, I believe that it is important that we are all honest with each other on the subject of migration. And here I would like to mention what Mr Bullmann said. You mentioned that national measures were now being taken in Austria, and you also criticised what I have said as a project for our Presidency. I would just like to make three points, because I think it is important. Firstly, what I have said as the Presidency and what we intend to do over the next six months is exactly what the European Council unanimously decided last week. So if you blame me for wanting to work through what the European Council has decided, then you can do that. Please do not, however, make the mistake of denying that it was a unanimous decision. This shows that there is a common line here, a reversal of the trend at European level. And I think that is very positive. Secondly, the key word is national measures. If I am properly informed, then social democracy is part of the German Government. We do not yet know the german government's line, because I believe that there is only an agreement between the CDU and the CSU here and that there has not yet been a coordination with the SPD. We expect that there will soon be clarity in the German Government. If this is handled as currently announced, it is the country of Germany that is taking national measures here, and other countries, such as Austria, will of course react accordingly. The third point is very important to me: I want to make a promise today as someone who grew up with the Europe without borders inward. I promise you that, as the Austrian Presidency, we will do everything in our power to ensure, in the long term, that there is a Europe without internal borders. (Applause) I cannot promise you how quickly this will happen. Nor can I predict whether national measures will be taken first, as announced by Germany. But what I can promise you is that we will fight to ensure that, in the medium to long term, the Europe without internal borders with proper external borders is once again taken for granted. And I am also optimistic that we will succeed together if we want to. Finally, i would like to make a point which I consider to be very important. I am a friend of the debate, of the discourse, also of the political debate. But I believe that it is important that the discourse always takes place on an equal footing. In the European Union, I sometimes have the feeling that we are in a downward spiral run. I have the feeling that far too often the Council complains about the Commission, Parliament complains about the Council, and that this does not really help us, because it is more a surrender of responsibility than cooperation on the matter. And I have the feeling that there is far too much torn among the Member States that some are complaining about the others, the north over the south, the west over the east and vice versa. On the contrary, I believe in a common Europe, in a Europe of cooperation and in a Europe in which there are no first- and second-class Member States. I always remember a discussion that I experienced in Germany, where I was allowed to be a guest and then someone in the room said: well, he still cannot imagine living in a Europe where Switzerland and Great Britain are not members, but countries like Hungary and Romania do. I was, I think, the only one in the room who was negatively affected at the time, because I thought: how would Romanians or Hungarians feel in this room now? I believe that this experience is precisely the Europe we do not want. We need a Europe of cooperation, we need a Europe where we discuss on an equal footing, even if there are different nationalities and political groups, and we need a Europe that we want to move forward together. We, as the Austrian Presidency, would like to make our contribution here as we can. I hope that you, as the European Parliament, will work well together.

On too many policy areas, divergences are deepening in the EU: surely, between the north and south of the European Union on economic matters; this has been sharpened by the euro area’s operational rules. But also, rifts between the west and the east have become clear, driven by the migration crisis, a growing economic disparity and different governance philosophies.  Austria’s approach will be based on enhancing the principle of subsidiarity. I agree that by involving more national and local authorities, the divergences could be better tackled.

Let us remember, however, that security is not only border security – it should be understood very broadly, because we have different forms of security, e.g. food security, which is the basis of our existence. It is ensured by the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Austrian Presidency is discussing the reform of the CAP. The share of young farmers is decreasing in Europe. The reasons should be seen in the low level of income achieved in agriculture, which is estimated at 50% of the average income of other professional groups. In addition, farmers are burdened with greening requirements, which entails not only an administrative burden but also reduced competitiveness on the world market.  The question arises whether the CAP budget can be reduced in such a situation and what could be the consequences? It is often said that Europe needs a bigger budget – what about Chancellor Kurz as President of the Presidency? Do you not think that it is time to lift the Russian embargo in response to the sanctions that the European Union imposes on Russia over its aggression against Ukraine?

The point is that, to date, nothing has been done and in yesterday's speech I asked the Commissioner to finally tell us when the Greek authorities will be referred, as they are in breach of European Union legislation on the issue of licences for the construction of wind farms.

The European Parliament has been doing its work for a long time and can only reiterate, as it did at the Council meeting, the vital importance of solving this problem. The European Parliament's proposal is a comprehensive proposal, which also provides for a transitional period, so a great deal of availability in countries that are not in the habit of the arrival of immigrants, especially from the continent from the African continent, and our text, approved by a very large majority, can be an excellent starting point. We are pleased that, at the end of the document approved by the Council, there is a willingness to carry out the reform. I would remind you that the Treaty provides for unanimity not to be compulsory for the approval of this reform, but qualified majority voting is sufficient. So, if you want, you can achieve the goal.

This is why I appealed to the leaders that the EU must get its act together. For me, this means increasing military cooperation, preparing for worst-case scenarios in terms of trade, and – above all – looking for unity in every aspect of European cooperation, including migration and euro area reform. We managed to make progress on all these issues, but there is no hiding the fact that the road ahead of us is still long and, for sure, not easy. We started with a discussion among the leaders and NATO Secretary—General Jens Stoltenberg, with the aim of deepening the cooperation between the EU and NATO. The leaders agreed that the EU must take greater responsibility for its own security, first and foremost because it is in our own interest as Europeans. In order to bolster our common defence, the EU will enhance investment, capability development and operational readiness. Let me mention here the issue of foreign threats to our democracies. The European Council called on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and on the Commission to present, by December, concrete proposals for a coordinated EU response to this challenge – and specifically to Russian disinformation attempts – which is currently handled by a very small strategic communications team at the European External Action Service. This is particularly important in the light of the signals about Russia’s role in Brexit. As regards migration, I put forward the following three proposals: disembarkation platforms outside Europe; a dedicated budgetary tool in the next MFF to combat illegal migration; and the boosting of EU support for the Libyan Coast Guard. They were supported univocally by the leaders. We also agreed to support the Maltese authorities by sending a message to all vessels, including those of NGOs, operating in the Mediterranean. The message is clear: respect the law and do not obstruct the operations of the Libyan Coast Guard. Additionally, the leaders accepted the Franco-Italian proposal of controlled centres on EU territory. It is up to the governments to decide whether they want to create such centres. However, any obligations related to the functioning of these centres, including relocation and resettlement, will be undertaken on a voluntary basis. Last but not least, we agreed to launch the next tranche of financing for Turkey, and to transfer EUR 500 million of development money to the EU Trust Fund for Africa. The leaders confirmed their will to take our cooperation with Africa to a new level. This means not only increased public funding but also a new framework enabling private investments to grow. It is the best proof of our intentions, despite unfounded claims that Europe wants to abandon Africa. It is impossible to stop the flow of illegal migrants without close cooperation with African countries. That is why we will use all possible tools, from defence and development to visa and other cooperation, to make it happen. Moving on to the Euro Summit. Last October, in this Chamber, I said the following: ‘I will do everything in my power to take the first very concrete steps, by June. If we don’t reach agreement by June, I will say precisely why it wasn’t possible, and who is responsible.’ Today I can say that the leaders did indeed take the first decisions. This means agreement on further steps to complete the banking union and to strengthen the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). In particular, we agreed that the ESM will be providing the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund. As a consequence, our banking union will become much stronger. Some of you may say that this is too little, too late. And you would be right, in a sense. But the fact is that, after some years of standstill, we are effectively relaunching the process of deepening economic and monetary union. To make sure that the progress continues, I will organise another Euro Summit in December. The leaders also adopted conclusions advancing EU cooperation on digital matters and innovation, as well as trade. In the context of growing trade tensions, the European Council underlined the importance of preserving and deepening the rules-based multilateral system. The Commission was invited to propose a comprehensive approach to improve, together with like-minded partners, the functioning of the World Trade Organization in crucial areas. The leaders also called for the adoption of the proposal on the screening of foreign direct investments, which is crucially important for the security of our economies and our citizens. It goes without saying that the Commission has the full support of the European Council when it comes to the trade dispute with the USA. I am sure Jean-Claude Juncker will elaborate on that. A final point on Brexit. The 27 leaders shared one concern. Whilst progress has been made in a number of areas, some key aspects still need to be agreed. Since there is much work ahead, with less and less time, I was very honest in my assessment, including when I spoke to Prime Minister May last week. The sooner we get a precise UK proposal on the Irish border, the better the chance of finalising the Brexit negotiations this year. Put simply, we cannot make progress unless a solid backstop is presented by the UK and accepted by our Irish friends. We are now looking forward to the White Paper from the UK and we very much hope that it will bring the necessary clarity, realism and impetus to these negotiations.

After each European Council, the post-war, no, demand is asked: is the glass half full or half empty? I don't know. I think it could have been fuller – without saying it was half empty. We have made important decisions on border management. On the basis of the Commission's proposals, we will send 10 000 border guards of European provenance to the external borders of the European Union by 2020. This is an important decision of the European Council. It was originally thought that we would have to do this by 2027, now we say 2020. And I will make concrete proposals in this regard during the State of the Union address, because there is a need for us to hurry up. I also believe that the mandate of border guards must be extended. These border guards – ours – must also be able to intervene in third countries, but always with the agreement of the third countries concerned. With regard to migration, including the reception camps in North Africa, we should be careful not to give the impression that there is a return to neo-colonial attitudes – that is not good. We do not have to decide on Africa, but we have to decide with Africa and, above all, with North Africa. It was decided in the European Council last Thursday, Friday, that we had to agree on European rapprochement with regard to migration. I strongly believe that this must be the case. I am not sure that the agreements that have now been reached in some Member States are in full line with this, but this will have to be commented on after careful examination of the situation. I am glad that, under Donald's leadership, we have ensured that we have decided on the second tranche of aid to Turkey, which does not go to Turkey, but to those who take care of the refugees in Turkey. This was an important decision to pay two billion from the European budget, one billion from the Member States. I hope that this will be followed up, and I do not really doubt the will of the Member States to do so. As far as Africa is concerned, I am wary of all demagogic statements. Everyone is talking about Africa. Who is doing what for Africa? We have increased the African trust fund to EUR 4.1 billion. That was not the original plan, but we have now released EUR 500 million from the European Development Fund, not to stop projects that do not actually exist, but to provide money. And the Member States have pledged to raise at least EUR 500 million so that the plans related to the African Trust Fund can be implemented, particularly in Libya. Trust Fund is also called Libya. And I think we're making progress. I am somewhat disappointed – but President Donald knows this – that, with regard to the legislative proposals put forward by the Commission, on which there is agreement – five out of seven – we are unable to persuade the European Council to ask the Council, the Council of Ministers, to do so before the end of July. So where we actually agree, we don't even agree that we agree. This is ridiculous, and that is why the Austrian Presidency should tackle this in the near future. I proposed that we should manage the two outstanding areas that you know by the end of December. There is also criticism at member level that we are not making any progress, and we are not prepared to take responsibility for the seven proposals, five in July and two others in December. I say again – without being on an ego trip, I am too old for ego trips: if the Commission's proposals of February 2015 had been adopted, we would not be in the predicament we find ourselves in today, and that is why we should hurry rather than linger. Ce n'est pas traduisible dans les autres langues, c'est un jeu de mots: \"il faut se dépécher au lieu de freiner notre ardeur\". Sur tout ce qui concerne l'Union économique et monétaire, Donald Tusk a fait en sorte que nous puissions avoir une bonne décision pour ce qui concerne le dispositif de soutien du mécanisme européen de stabilité par rapport aux résolutions européennes. Il s'agit d'une bonne décision dont il convient de féliciter le Conseil européen. J'aurais voulu que nous progressions plus rapidement sur tout cela. On m'a promis – mais cela ne figure pas dans les conclusions – qu'en octobre-novembre, le Conseil européen reviendrait sur toutes les questions qui restent ouvertes pour ce qui est de l'Union économique et monétaire, notamment sur les garanties de dépéts. Je crois qu'il est essentiel, pour parfaire l'union bancaire, de nous mettre d'accord sur ce point. Il n'existe aucune zone monétaire au monde o il n'y a pas de garantie de dépét. Il faudra que nous nous dépéchions sur ce point. Nous n'avons pas discuté du budget pour la zone euro, parce que ceux qui le pr nent n'ont pas trouvé d'accord. La Commission avait proposé d'introduire dans le budget général de l'Union européenne des lignes spécifiquement dédiées a la zone euro. La déclaration de Meseberg, qui est devenue la référence centrale du devenir européen, pr ne un budget de la zone euro, sans toutefois en afficher les détails, qui n'existent d'ailleurs pas. Il faudra donc que nous continuions notre travail ce sujet. Pour ce qui est des perspectives financiéres, je redis ici ce que j'ai dit au Conseil européen, il faudra que nous adoptions avant le grand rendez-vous des Européens avec le suffrage universel, c'est-a-dire avant mai de l'année prochaine, ne serait-ce que les lignes Si nous ne le faisons pas, si nous répétons les m mes erreurs qui ont présidé la mise en place de la période financi re actuelle, nous manquerons notre devoir. Des dizaines de milliers d'étudiants européens ne pourront pas participer au programme Erasmus+, alors que nous proposons, dans les perspectives financi éres pluriannuelles, de doubler le budget affecté au programme Erasmus, pour le porter 35 milliards d'euros. Nous perdrons, par mois de retard, 5 000 emplois en mati re de recherche, donc 5 000 chercheurs européens n'auront plus les appuis financiers dont ils ont besoin. Je réit re mon appel aux états membres et au Parlement européen, afin qu'ils accél rent leurs travaux, non pas pour verser dans l'échange d'arguments faciles, mais pour résoudre la question substantialqui nous fait face. Le timing est donc, mes yeux, plus important qu'on ne le pense. Si nous n'arrivons pas bon port au moment indiqué, nous perdrons 100 000 projets en mati re d'énergie, de santé et d'inclusion sociale. Qui veut en prendre la responsabilité? Si les etats membres n'arrivent pas se mettre d'accord, la Commission qui succédera la mienne sera critiquée pour ne pas avoir su donner suite tous les projets qui sont les n'tres. Je me déplacerai aux états-Unis, avec l'élan que vous me connaissez, pour discuter avec le président des états-Unis, des questions de commerce. Le président du Conseil européen a fait en sorte qu'il y en résulte un accord, qui reste, sur l'essentiel des questions liées nos accords commerciaux. J'expliquerai au président américain, comme nous l'avons fait, le président du Conseil européen et moi-mé, lorsque nous nous sommes vus dans le cadre du G7 au Canada, qu'en fait nous pensons que le déficit est de l'autre cété de la barri. Si vous additionnez les échanges de marchandises, les échanges en mati re de services et les bénéfices réalisés par les multinationales américaines en Europe, le déficit se trouve de l'autre cété de l'Atlantique, donc il ne faut pas se laisser faire, il faut objectiver le débat et nous verrons, En ce qui concerne le Brexit, nous sommes en attente depuis plusieurs mois du livre blanc de Downing Street et nous verrons, l'analysis, ce qu'il en sera. Je veux toutefois dire ici, au sujet de l'accord du Conseil européen, que nous n'accepterons pas que la question irlandaise soit isolée au point d'étre la seule question non encore résolue la fin des négociations. All of us, we are Irish.

I would say that we had an empty glass at the last Council results. In this respect, we are already glad that something is inside. Looking at the Council's results, we have been very critical the last few times. This time it can already be said that progress has been made – and I would like to thank you for that on behalf of my group – in the area of migration policy, for example. The 10 000 Frontex officials, the clear commitment to providing the necessary money to the centres in both Africa and Europe, the reflection, Africa and Turkey, are clear progress. That is why it is positive, and we welcome these results. It has always been clear to us, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that there are two sides to the coin: a committed and determined border protection and, on the other hand, a resettlement programme, where we extend our hand to the world's most vulnerable and invite and welcome them to Europe. We believe that the two sides belong together. I can say this in a party political way: if it is allowed for The Prime Minister, Mr Tsipras, to implement the Turkey agreement in Greece – which means, in concrete terms, that refugees will be repatriated directly from Lesbos to Turkey without scrutiny – if this is possible in a left-wing country, then we can also argue in the Mediterranean that we apply the same concept in the fight against the smuggling gangs there. I would, of course, like to single out the monetary question as a second point: not as much as we would have liked, but progress, a clear commitment to further development, to the European Monetary Fund, and, above all, the most important thing, the crown jewel: the backstop, which is intended to safeguard our financial markets. The focus on investment and personal responsibility – the buzzword of deposit insurance – is a real accent. The devil is in the detail here. In other words, by December we will see whether any real progress will be made on the matter. And we have to take a step further in this regard, because there are also PPE-DE Heads of Government, liberal Heads of Government, who are very sceptical about some of these developments. So we will also have to work there in our parties so that we can convince us so that we can move forward. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would just like to add one more thing, and that is that, in all these developments, it would be wrong for us to leave out the Democratic Chamber of Europe. If we make a European Monetary Fund, if we go towards an investment budget, then there must be a place where this is democratically legitimised and can also be controlled in the future, and that is the European Parliament. I would therefore ask that this be taken into account. Thirdly, Brexit. A lot has been said. I would just like to remind and underline the two points for my group. The first point is that I believe that the people of Europe must know in March 2019 what it means to leave the European Union. If we only activate the transitional period and nothing changes, then I believe that this will cause damage, political damage. It must be clear that something will change when you leave the European Union. Secondly, it must be clear that we need to formulate what 'long-term partnership' actually means. I cannot stand before my constituents next May and tell them that britain is leaving, we have agreed a transitional period, where nothing changes at all, and I cannot give any answer at all as to what the exit actually means for the City of London, for economic contacts, for the euro, or perhaps for the issues of police cooperation. If all these questions are open when we leave, then no citizen in Europe can explain it. That is why we need clear announcements in these two areas. Namely, in March 2019, \"there must be\" or \"not doing\" a difference, there can be no cherry-picking, and there must be long-term clarity as to what exit actually means. I still have my concerns on both points as to whether this will be feasible. That is why I would like to say on my group that there will be no automatic agreement on an exit treaty. The two points will have to be clarified in the autumn. And last but not least: foreign policy. I would like to thank mr President-in-Office of the Council for sending out a clear signal on Russia. The fact that we are extending the sanctions on Russia is a clear signal. Given that America and Russia will meet in Helsinki, it is important that we establish a clear position. Violence and war cannot be a means of politics. That is why we stand by the sanctions and hope that Russia will return to a partnership path.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 131, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Udo Bullmann", "mepid": "4267", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would like to welcome President Tusk to this House. It is good to have you here, Mr Tusk. I do not exactly know about the glasses in the Council meeting – half full or half empty – I don’t care too much about the glasses but I am worried about the results.  If I ask myself why European citizens very often become more and more irritated about our institutions, one answer could be that we are permanently selling victories where no progress, or no sufficient progress, was achieved. This, I would like to say, is also one of the results of the last European Council. European and monetary union: progress. The big crisis in 2008 to 2009 – that is 10 years, my friends, 10 years we have been waiting for strengthening of our institutions. Are we waiting for the next crisis to hit European citizens? Or why is that necessary? Why cannot we speed up?  On migration: we lose lives each and every week in the Mediterranean. Each life is one life too many to lose. It is an incredible scandal that we do not get our act together and I do not question, President Tusk, your personal willingness to do something about it, but we, the leaders of three Groups in this House, the Liberals, the Greens and we, the Social Democrats, have written a letter to you: please put the Dublin reform at the top of the agenda because this is the cornerstone for everything. Until today, we did not see any political response.  I am not satisfied with the result of this Council. I think what Europe needs is progressive leadership and I could not detect progressive leadership. I could see that some members of the Council, some heads of state or government tried to add additional value to the conversation. Pedro Sánchez was jumping in and saying we have a new policy in Spain. I welcome this. Cyprus was doing something – they are ready for bilaterals – but this is not enough, we need structural solutions. We need a complete Dublin reform.  If I ask myself what the building block of the resolution, the final statement, was then, yes, I can detect a building block. The building block is that everybody has something where he can claim victory – but nothing is going to happen, and this is not enough for Europe and this is not enough for the European citizens and for the big challenges we have to face. Ich frage mich: Sie sind viel besser als andere in der Lage, die Blockaden zu analysieren, die es im Visegrád-Block gibt, wenn es zur Frage der Migration, zur Frage der Flüchtlinge kommt. Aber wann ist denn der Zeitpunkt, wo wir einladen, wo Sie einladen zur großen Debatte, zur großen europäischen Unterhaltung darüber, was wir eigentlich brauchen, um aus den Sackgassen herauszukommen? Wann kommt diese große Debatte? Wie viele Menschen sollen noch sterben, bis diese große Debatte kommt, wo wir dann fragen: Ja, was sind eure Interessen? Natürlich haben die Visegrád-Staaten Interessen. Sie wollen in Sicherheit leben – das ist Verteidigung und Sicherheit. Das wissen wir. Sie wollen Energiesicherheit haben, sie wollen auch morgen Kohäsionspolitik haben. Das sind alles relevante Themen. Aber wann kommen wir denn dazu, sie einfach mal mit den anderen Fragen zu kombinieren, wo wir dringend auf Solidarität warten: bei der Migration, bei den Flüchtlingen?! Warum gibt es kein Paket, Herr Präsident Tusk?! Warum nicht?! Ich interessiere mich nicht für halb leere Gläser oder für halb volle Gläser. Es ist ein Skandal, dass wir in Europa nicht vorankommen, und das ist es, worauf die Menschen warten, und deswegen können wir nicht zufrieden sein, und deswegen müssen wir in den nächsten Wochen und Monaten drängen.

And then I read Macron's, and he was excited. There I realized that something was wrong, that things could not have gone well; so much so that, the moment I read the document, I realized that nothing changed: because that is the truth. The glass half full or half empty, Mr Juncker, is unfortunately half full only for avoiding a resounding rupture but not for having achieved results. And I am addressing not so much the President of the Commission as the President-in-Office of the Council, because the real big problem lies there, the real problem from which we cannot get out is the Council's inability to find a solution. I have followed and fully share the position, action and role that President Tajani, on behalf of this Parliament, has taken with regard to the initiatives that have been taken, on the need to be able to intervene on the migration front by giving clear and precise answers. But at a time when bailouts under international law remain as they were, reception centres are exclusively on a voluntary basis, redistribution is a topic that cannot be talked about, it is clear that the 2020 target is a goal that is not good, because in 2020, between now and 2020, although migratory flows are also decreasing at this stage , however, in some countries there is a risk of an unacceptable situation in all respects, fuelling an anti-European climate towards these institutions that is no longer manageable. That is the truth. So the institutions have a duty to deal with this situation and the European Council, if the statements and considerations that have been made this morning are true, should give answers. In conclusion, I would like to add that I listened very carefully to Chancellor Kurz this morning; I have listened to a very positive speech for your country, because the statements about the relationship with Germany, about the possible decisions to be transposed to the border in the relationship and in the confrontation with Germany are clear: the domestic policy choices are very clear. The positions announced, on the other hand, on the general agreement on immigration are very, far too general, because we do not have the framework for a precise objective, in which we do not have the courage and the strength, from the point of view of managing this situation, to be able to say clearly that we are leaving national egoism in order to clearly manage a broader vision of this intervention.

It doesn’t happen all the time, but I agree 100% with the assessment he has made. You were not there, Mr Tusk, but while we were preparing for the European Council in this House here three weeks ago, I proposed to the President to examine whether it was not necessary for our Parliament to go to court, because there is a clear failure to act by the Council, especially on the Dublin file. I don’t say this in a wild way; it is based on facts.  If you look at the Council conclusions, what are they saying? Have you liberated additional money, 2019-2020, to start with the Border and Coast Guard? Will you do that? Additional money to the 2019-2020 money? Otherwise, we cannot accelerate the Border and Coast Guard from 2027 to 2020. Have you agreed on a new Dublin asylum system? Where is the position of the Council? We have had our position since November, and we are still waiting for the position of the Council. There is not even a word on this. We are going to work further on this – that is the only thing you can read from the conclusions. The same on these reception centres. What we have in the conclusion is that we are going to ‘examine’ it. In European language, that means it is going to take a while. Reception centres of disembarkment platforms – you are going to examine them while you all have different points of view. Some are in favour of in Europe; others say no, out of Europe; some are saying that it has to be closed, while others are saying they should be open centres. You have the experience in France where there is a centre like that in Chartres, which is working very well. These people who come to the centre in Chartres can ask for asylum, and when this asylum is agreed on they will be transferred to France. That is happening now. Why do you examine it? Why do you not decide on it?  The same on legal migration, legal economic migration. I think there is no possible solution unless we also have an agreement on legal economic migration in this package. Where is the decision of the Council? I don’t think that the deal in Germany between the CDU and the CSU now will solve the problem. On the contrary, what you risk is the reinstatement of national border controls, killing Schengen. That is what is already happening with Austria, because Austria is now considering – they have announced it in government circles today – closing the Brenner Pass because of this internal German deal, so that is what is happening today. And then you come here and say ‘no, no, no...’.  I can tell you that the problem is a political problem; it is not migration. It is exactly the same, and Mr Bullmann is 100% right when he says that that isn’t going forward either in the eurozone reform. You have a problem in the Council. I do not know what to do. You have to block them during the holidays for three or four days. You come out one day and you say ‘here we have a text’. In the past it was different. I remember once, together with Jean-Claude Juncker, at a summit in Nice – do you remember that? – we needed to reform the Treaty, and it took four days and four nights before we got an agreement, at 4.00 in the morning. But we got an agreement. And here, after one day you come out and say ‘we have a text; it is very general; we are going to examine this, maybe we are going to do that’. That is not the way. Put them together. Maybe, this holiday, put them all together on your disembarkment platform somewhere in the Mediterranean, these 27 Member States and heads of government, and make a deal. Push for it, lock them in a room; that is the only way they will understand, otherwise we will continue and continue. And the eurozone reform is exactly the same. We say we have made progress. Progress? You name the progress. I am sorry, Jean-Claude, but I am not in agreement with you on the so-called ‘backstop’. It is a fake backstop. It is a credit line, a credit line that will be given to this resolution by the ESM. I asked you, Mr Tusk, if you engaged this credit line, if the ESM engaged this credit line, will there be an approval of the Deutsche Bundestag – yes or no? In my opinion, yes. And if it is yes, it is not a backstop; it is a fake backstop. That is the reality. A backstop is automatic. A backstop is not something that has been approved in I don’t know how many parliaments or how many governments of a Member States. Don’t take it personally; my attack is not on you, it is on what you represent: the European Council. You have said a few times with a lot of courage these past few weeks, after everything that happened with Trump, that we are on our own – and I think that is right. We are on our own, but the problem is that we are in fact not capable of acting on our own – and that problem you have to solve, Mr Tusk.

We have not got anywhere on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and so many important issues.  The eurozone reform has not just been around since yesterday; we have had this crisis since before 2010. We know what to do, and it’s not going ahead because the heads of State and government are just not doing their work and are not getting ahead. Instead, at the Council the only talk was about migration, migration, migration – as if it’s the only problem that we have. I care very much about migration, but I have to say that there are other things we have to talk about.  President Tusk, when talking about migration and refugees, you did not talk about the hundreds of lives that have been lost just in the last few days, while the rescue boats are stuck in the ports because some Member States want to bring the people who actually rescue people to court. This is really an active engagement against rescue at sea. This is against any sort of international law, but it is also against any sort of humanity not to let others, who want to do the work, rescue people. This is not something you talked about. I wonder if anyone still remembers Lampedusa 2013 and how we all went and said that we were so sorry that hundreds of people had drowned. But now, again, hundreds of people are drowning and we are turning a blind eye. I do not think this is direction Europe should be going in. You also didn’t talk about the Common European Asylum System that this Parliament has been preparing, where we have managed to get political compromises together across the groups. So I really wonder why we managed to do it and you don’t manage to do it, whereas the same parties are present here and in the Council. This is what you did not talk about.  Instead, you talked about creating this disembarkation platform: camps somewhere in the Sahara. You might say that people can ask for asylum, but that’s the thing: the one word about resettlement mentioned in the conclusions is ‘voluntary’. You will not find a Member State which is going to admit those people who might get asylum there. You will just put the refugees somewhere in the camps in the Sahara and that’s the end of it. If this is being implemented, it’s basically an end to the right to ask for asylum here in the European Union, and this is not where we should go. The right to ask for asylum was invented in Europe. The aim of the Geneva Convention, just after the Second World War and as a result of the incredibly horrible experience, was to never again let anyone suffer and not find protection. That was the aim of the Geneva Convention, and I do not think we should give up on that so easily. So we have managed to find a compromise in Parliament and, even if you want to close off the borders completely, it will never work. You can never completely close off a border, but what actually you can do, with the heads of State and government, is extinguish any light of humanitarianism and any light of the human rights that the European Union has always stood for. I do not think we should not go that way. We should stand up for human rights, especially the rights of people who are not living here, and especially the rights of people who are not us, because that’s when you show how much you care about human rights.

The Council has done nothing but approve of what is happening, pretending not to know that the worst is happening. The peoples of Europe have witnessed this theatre playing into the hands of the good and the bad, where, on the one hand, there was openly xenophobic rhetoric from certain governments, such as my own, the Italian Government, and, on the other, less crude but equally ignoble and, in any case, very hypocritical rhetoric, from governments such as the one French which, having dumped the issue of migration on the shoulders of the countries of southern Europe, today want to give these countries a lesson in morals at no cost. So I am not talking about what has been decided, because nothing has been decided, but about what has not even been discussed. President Tusk says that Europe has no intention of leaving Africa: Africa has already abandoned it! I would like to know where and when we have talked about the real causes of mass migration and about which the citizens of Europe know nothing.  Who is talking here about the war in South Sudan, about the 300 000 dead and the millions displaced, about the civil wars in Somalia, Eritrea, Chad, Mali, the Central African Republic, which are a big deal for European arms dealers? Who is talking about the tens, soon hundreds of millions of Africans fleeing desertification, climate change, land and water theft by multinationals? Establishment parties and anti-establishment parties are pretending to divide: in reality they are complicit in this silence. It is better for some to hide their complicity in recent years in the hyper-liberal exploitation of Africa and its further reduction into a state of slavery, and it is better for others to earn easy votes on disinformation, hatred and fear. The important thing is that the peoples of Europe should know the facts and not consider them as solutions, what? The witch-hunt against NGOs, which are wrong to be where the European Union should be and is not there and there is less and less.

The answer to the question is very simple: the glass is half empty. It is sombre in here, and that is because you know in your hearts that something fundamentally changed at the European Council last week. It could be summed up in a word: Italy. A founder member of the European Union uncritical for decades of the process of European integration and now as a result of the last general election, an Italian Prime Minister threatening to veto the entire proceedings unless he was given something on migration. But how to satisfy the Italians and to save the ever more beleaguered Ms Merkel. That was the question. And traditionally, you would have looked for a European answer but there wasn’t one, so you came up with a very weak formula talking about regional distribution centres on a voluntary basis. The deal which everybody said would hold had fallen to pieces within the space of a few hours. I have to say what you saw was the rebirth of the nation-state, and that is the direction, that is what Brexit is, that is what Trump. That is what the Italian elections are all about, and I wonder whether the Verhofstadts of this world recognise this massive shift. And it isn’t just a one-off. it is a trend. People want to do things at a national level. Where I do sympathise with everything the speakers have said is in their criticism of the British Government, who two years on have a summit this Friday to decide exactly what our Brexit policy is. So, no, we have not exactly made life easy for you but then nor have you for us by continually saying that Mr Varadkar in Dublin can veto the entire deal. I would suggest Mr Tusk wasn’t necessarily particularly helpful either. But one area in which you do agree, I but I wonder for how long, is you talked about increasing military cooperation Mr Tusk, being discussed at that Council meeting last week and this when earlier today we heard from Mr Weber from the CDU that he wants foreign policy to be decided without veto. Just a quick look ahead to next week. Mr Trump will be at that NATO Summit next week. You appear to be hell-bent on pushing for your European army; hell-bent for a foreign policy without veto and hell-bent to be on a direct collision course with President Trump and with NATO. You can’t have a European army and NATO existing side by side and maybe your next big challenge is European citizens will need to work out who they feel best protected by: a European army or America and NATO.

This is the great step forward in Matteo Salvini's determined action against NGOs, which are often complicit in mafias and smugglers. It also calls for the end of compulsory quotas and stresses the need to strengthen external borders, which is a requirement of the Austrian Presidency. This is a defeat for the Brussels Commissioners and for the Macron-Merkel couple.

I will choose two points where it is easier to have divisions and contradictions than to agree.  The first, of course, is migration. Given the differences of opinion signalled before the summit, agreeing on a common position is a relative success, especially in this complicated geopolitical climate around Europe, because it means wanting to seek a common European response in this regard. Some things are completely uncontroversial: sealing the external borders (but of course it is not about words, but about solid budgetary instrumentation), cooperation with transit countries and countries of origin, or seeking a solution to the immigration problem where it was originally born, which is also an uncontroversial issue, provided that the money follows, hence this trust fund for Africa, so important for President Tajani. A novelty is reception centers. However, the main message that has spread widely in some countries is, of course, the abandonment of the forced relocation of refugees. I believe that relocation would not work in europe's current political climate, where it could only fuel xenophobic or anti-European movements. Many issues remain to be resolved, including the reform of the Dublin system or the so-called secondary flows.  However, I am moving to the second point, where it is also easier to have divisions and tensions than to agree, i.e. the budget. There was no strong declaration of haste on the Part of the Council, namely the will to complete and agree on the budget after 2021, but before the European elections. Moreover, I believe that the proposal put forward by Commissioner Oettinger does not quite help us to find a common solution, because there is too much difference, especially in cohesion policy, between countries that lose – they have losses of 24-25% – and those that gain.

On the one hand is the option of a Europe that exploits citizens’ fears and advises a return to national borders, or of foot-dragging on important reforms, such as that of the eurozone for which we have been waiting for 10 years. On the other hand is the option of finally putting on the table at the European Council the proposals which we know about and know should be adopted. The choice can no longer be delayed because if we delay until December, then forget it! We are just paving the way for the decline of European integration. It is easy to foresee that. The European Council has come to a point where it needs to decide on another way: to use qualified majority voting, please, whenever this is possible, and it is possible on many of the blocked proposals. I would say to the Council: you have clear positions, majority positions from the European Parliament, giving you backing. Use this. Put on the table clear proposals for a clear definition from governments. We are in need of this. There are four big proposals to be put on the table. The first is to organise a European border capable of protecting people in Europe and also of giving protection to those asking for refuge. A credible proposal for a partnership with Africa also needs to be put on the table because everybody knows that without this, there is no real solution. A proposal for agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), needs to be put on the table, providing cohesion and proper conditions for implementation of the European social pillar.

For the first time in the European Council, therefore, thanks to the action of this government, it is stated that the landing of those who are rescued as a result of search and rescue operations which, as I have always said, are morally necessary even before a legal point of view, must be based on shared and complementary actions between the Member States.

In fact, several MEPs travel on the boat. Very media. But in the meantime, since the start of the year the Civil Guard has rescued more than seven thousand and five hundred people at sea, and no MEP was accompanying them on the legs, of course. And only on the Spanish coast have more than three hundred human beings drowned at sea and obviously no mayor was waiting for them in the port. On the one hand, we turned the worst humanitarian drama of our time into a television and political spectacle and, on the other hand, closed our eyes to the thousands and thousands of drowned. Ours, seen together, is called cynicism. We have leftover speeches and selfishness and we lack responsibility and heart. It is cynical to call an immigrant crisis a crisis that is of poverty, ignorance, religious persecution, climate change, disease, forgetfulness, femicide, but not people. Europe's problem is solved in Africa. To think that it can be easily fixed with bribes, humanitarian flotillas or pats on the back is not to see the truth or not want to see it. We can close ports, we can build detention centers all over the continent or, on the contrary, eliminate external borders so that everyone can enter. In the medium term, everything's going to be useless. If we do not help Africa change Africa, despair will continue to push millions of women, men and children to sea.

Despite the efforts of some governments, such as the Spanish Government, which has put on the table a humane, Europeanist and decent treatment of migrants, the Council's conclusions are nevertheless hugely disappointing.

Wars and migrations start with a lack of resources. On the other hand, even if I support the hard line against illegal migrants, I believe that the idea of setting up \"sorting\" camps or centres in third countries is deeply immoral.

That is the essential question: to do what?  We also want a strong coastguard, but one that can break people smugglers. A coast guard that's going to rescue and bring people back, so we can stop illegal migration. They just want a coastguard that will simply bring more boats to the European Union with no maximum limit.

The redistribution of migrants has been discussed and tried to be carried out for a long time, but then by force.  Now countries will be able to decide for themselves and, of course, most countries will not accept migrants. However, it took far too long to establish this and the result is that we have a large group of migrants who now need help to return to their home countries. The fact that we are now discussing setting up camps in third countries where economic migrants and real refugees are distinguished is a step in the right direction.  As I have pointed out earlier in this House, Europe must use a solution similar to that adopted by Australia. Through these measures, we ensure law and order within Europe, we ensure prosperity, our citizens will receive and, moreover, we will save thousands of lives in the Mediterranean. In addition, in the long run when order lines are restored, countries such as Sweden can spend part of the huge budget that is currently being spent on illegal economic migrants rather than help people in need on the ground in their home countries or in neighbouring areas.

I am sure they would come out from this room wiser and more responsible.  We all talked about the glass. The glass is half full, yes, but the bottle is there, full of European ideas, initiatives and solutions. Instead of looking at the glass, look at the bottle and its contents. Finally, a bottle is there to be shared. This is definitely a question of political will. Only if the will is there can we reach solutions. We need European vision to revive it, and realism.  Yes, I agree with all of you that we need leadership – strong leadership – to reach future—proof answers. We cannot operate in crisis mode on migration anymore. Many of your interventions indeed reflect the fears, the concerns, questions and convictions of our citizens too. Here is what I see as the essence of the European Council last week.  European leaders confirmed their commitment to a comprehensive approach to migration and for me the most difficult task was Mr Tusk’s; to bring together 27 leaders. It remains to be supported now with concrete proposals and actions. They reaffirmed that no country should be managing this alone, and that we can only move forward with the joint and European approach both inside and outside Europe, and naturally at our external borders.  This is precisely the approach which has been adopted by the Commission since the very beginning, and it is this approach, and no other, that has already produced results. And of course, thanks to your support, to the support of the European Parliament. Indeed, we have managed to significantly reduce irregular arrivals into the European Union. We are not where we were three years ago, definitely. Based on these positive results, we now need to further address the structural changes where they really are.  We cannot forget the big picture and we can never lose our humanity. Over the past few days, many shipwrecks have occurred close to the Libyan coast and hundreds of people have lost their lives. I understand that you are outraged by these events. I am outraged too and that motivates me to keep going and not deviate from our values and principles. We can never turn a blind eye to the situation on the other side of the Mediterranean. The outcome of the European Council builds on what we have achieved so far, and gives us the operational and practical guidance to continue.  We are already working on their implementation because the tragic events in the Mediterranean show once again that there is no time to lose. We do not start from scratch and we do not leave anyone alone. The EU—Turkey Statement has been key to fighting smuggling in the eastern Mediterranean and reducing the irregular arrivals to Europe. We remain committed to upholding it, also by delivering the second tranche of the EUR 3 billion for the protection of refugees hosted by Turkey.  More than 600 000 lives have been saved so far, thanks also to the support of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. More than 1 300 have been evacuated from Libya to Niger. More than 15 000 have been returned voluntarily from Niger or Libya to their country of origin. The Libyan coast guard are rescuing an increasing number of migrants.  Thousands of migrants in Libya are receiving access to medical help and other services thanks to International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which, as you know, we support financially. On top of this, another EUR 500 million will be transferred to the EU Trust Fund for Africa to ensure that our many actions to address the root causes of illegal immigration will continue.  We count on Member States also to pitch in with significant financial contributions. It is clear that we have to further engage with countries in Africa. To further strengthen our external borders, we will soon present a proposal to beef up the European Border and Coast Guard Agency even more and transform it into a genuine EU border police, but an effective and firm migration policy is not and cannot be just about borders. As the President said, reform of the common European asylum system is equally essential. It is necessary, not only to ensure solidarity among Member States, but also to effectively reduce secondary movements within the European Union. We are so close that I frankly see no defensible reason for delays. The five pieces of legislation on asylum qualifications and reception conditions, on Eurodac, on resettlement and on our asylum agency should be adopted before the end of this month, and then I plead once again with Member States to move towards finding an agreement on Dublin and asylum procedures before the end of the year. It will be one of the most important legacies that we, all the European Union institutions and the European Parliament, can leave behind. The facts and reality tell us we are no longer in a migration crisis. The crisis we are confronted with is purely political. I call on everyone not to protract this political crisis any longer and to get down to business. I am looking forward to working closely with you, as I have always been doing during the last three and a half years and, of course, with the upcoming Austrian Presidency to swiftly make progress on all these aspects. The informal Justice and Home Affairs Council that will take place next week in Innsbruck will be the first opportunity. Allow me to say some words in Greek, responding to Mr Hadjigeorgiou.  Κύριε Χατζηγεωργίου, συμμερίζομαι την ανησυχία σας. Πιστέψτε με, είναι και δική μας. Η πρόκληση της μετανάστευσης στην ουσία δοκιμάζει την ίδια τη συνοχή μας και η απάντησή μας σε αυτή θα καθορίσει το κοινό μας μέλλον. Πολλοί πίστευαν ότι θα ήταν η οικονομική κρίση, η οποία θα έθετε σε αμφισβήτηση το μέλλον της Ευρώπης. Τελικά, είναι η διαχείριση της μεταναστευτικής κρίσης γιατί απευθείας και στην καρδιά αγγίζει τις αρχές και τις αξίες πάνω στις οποίες έχει χτιστεί το ευρωπαϊκό οικοδόμημα. Εμείς, η Ευρωπαϊκή Επιτροπή, από την αρχή έχουμε αναλάβει τις ευθύνες που μας αναλογούν και έχουμε καταθέσει μια ολοκληρωμένη πρόταση για την ευρωπαϊκή μεταναστευτική πολιτική. Θυμηθείτε πού ήμασταν πριν από τρία χρόνια και πού είμαστε τώρα. Ας συνεχίσουμε πάνω στις ίδιες γραμμές. Και οφείλω να τονίσω, για μία ακόμα φορά, ότι το Ευρωπαϊκό Κοινοβούλιο έχει στηρίξει αυτή την πολιτική και εργάζεται προς την κατεύθυνση της ολοκλήρωσής της. Οι κοινές αυτές προσπάθειες, όμως, δεν επαρκούν. Δεν εναπόκειται πλέον τόσο στα κράτη μέλη. Εγώ συνήθως αναφέρομαι στις κυβερνήσεις των κρατών μελών, θυμίζοντας ότι οι κυβερνήσεις έρχονται και απέρχονται, ενώ τα κράτη θα είναι εκεί. Και πρέπει πάντα να θυμούνται οι σημερινές κυβερνήσεις ότι ήταν ιστορική η απόφαση των προηγούμενων ηγεσιών να περάσουν το κατώφλι της ευρωπαϊκής οικογένειας. Εναπόκειται, λοιπόν, στις κυβερνήσεις των κρατών μελών να αναλάβουν τις δικές τους ευθύνες· να ξεκαθαρίσουν πώς αντιλαμβάνονται τον ρόλο τους και τη θέση τους μέσα στην ευρωπαϊκή οικογένεια. Η κοινή μας ευθύνη είναι μεγάλη και θα έλεγα ότι κάτω από τη σημερινή συγκυρία είναι και ιστορική. Και από την απάντησή μας στην πρόκληση της μετανάστευσης θα κριθούμε από τις μελλοντικές γενεές, γιατί αυτή θα καθορίσει τελικά την συνοχή και την ενότητά μας. The migration challenge is putting in question our principles and values, as I said before. It is, however, only by upholding them that we can move ahead stronger and united. We will all be judged by the way we respond to it.  These values are the way for responsible and effective decisions to move ahead. We need leadership and vision, but also frank and brave discussions amongst us. This Commission and this Parliament are showing the way by agreeing on a comprehensive migration policy.

I am absolutely sure that the people of Europe expect us to show determination in our actions to rebuild a sense of security and order. People want this not because they have become xenophobic and want to live in a sort of European splendid isolation with walls against the rest of the world; they want to have a political authority able to enforce the law to protect our territory and our borders.

Many in Europe and around the world claim that the European Union – or, more broadly, our traditional democracies – are unable to efficiently protect the external border. This is a favourite argument of some new political movements, not only in Europe, offering simple radical and attractive answers to the most complicated questions. They want to convince people that only strong men, anti-European, and with a tendency towards authoritarianism, are capable of stopping illegal migration, and we have to prove that they are wrong.

I have worked for almost 12 years with transport legislation, so I dare to say that I have also got to know what works in this area and what does not. The report is the result of long and intense negotiations in the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN).  The result is a balanced and fair report with enforceable and smart rules and careful consideration of the cross-border nature of international road transport. We did check the other opportunities: we counted salaries, working hours, prices of loads with specialists, and came to the conclusion that without huge bureaucratic burden, it is impossible to add the Posting of Workers Regulation to international transport and transit in a fair game. So there is a real reason why the lex specialis needs to exist. Whatever we decide tomorrow, it will shape the way in which international road transport will be performed within the EU. We either make sensible workable legislation, or create chaos if we choose that. We need to do it with understanding what we are doing, so please consider this. The posting rules are legally and practically inapplicable to drivers who work on a daily, or even hourly, basis in different Member States. Why would we knowingly make legislation that does not work? The TRAN report is the result of intense discussions with relevant stakeholders from both the employees’ and the employers’ sides. The TRAN report respects the highly mobile character of international transport, but imposes posting on cabotage and combined transport from day one to prevent unfair competition on the domestic markets. This is a significant improvement to the situation today. Only international transport and transit is excluded, and there are several good reasons for why they are excluded. But you all need to understand that this doesn’t mean that drivers from countries with lower living standards working in international transport operations are out of social and economic protection. We already have existing legislation such as Rome I: you just need to insert the enforcement in your own Member States. You also need to understand that the general posting of workers was never intended for mobile professions such as drivers, pilots, air crew, train drivers, seafarers and inland waterway workers in international transport.  The absolute majority of transport organisations and companies support TRAN’s, opinion as they all know that it can really work. The TRAN report restricts red tape and safeguards SMEs’ interests, leads to better enforcement and social protection, and respects the very special nature of a highly mobile workforce. We want to end up making legislation that will make it obligatory to apply up to 20 different national legislations a month with up to 50 different minimum wages, depending on the seniority of the driver, the truck, on the goods transported, and so on. This is what applying the posting rules to the drivers of international transport does. It is impossible to apply it in practice, and the transport companies and drivers themselves know it. We would create risk, pushing all the drivers into bogus self-employment, so let’s not do that.

Mr President, when you talk about EU transport policy, you are talking about the model of the internal market. As the European Parliament, we want the free movement of goods and people without too much administrative inconvenience. But we also want a social policy and a social policy that at least supports and helps drivers. But as Mrs Kyllönen said, we have a mobile market and the mobile market requires more flexibility.  I would like to reiterate once again that the EPP Group believes that the package proposed by the Transport Committee, in which we have combined the three dossiers (i.e. secondment, cabotage and driving and rest periods) into a balanced balance, that this is a balanced package.  But Chairman, we are not blind. We have, of course, seen the June vote as a defeat and we must move. The EMPL Committee also has a clear understanding of what is going on and what needs to be done here. In my dossier on driving and rest periods, we have adopted a number of amendments from EMPL, which I hope will be able to balance things more and lead to a positive vote tomorrow. I have reduced the reference period from four weeks to two weeks because we want the rest of the drivers to be decent and balanced.  And then, Mr. President, the parking lots. I must honestly tell you that I notice that many people do not understand what is said in my report about those parking spaces. We respect the European Court's ruling: there is normally no rest along motorways in poor parking spaces. You may only spend the rest, including the weekend rest, in good parking spaces that are equipped with all safety and sanitary measures. So it remains an exception to sleep in the parking lots and not the rule. It might be good in these times of fake news to repeat that again. I would particularly like to appeal to my colleagues in the S&amp;D Group, who have supported an earlier compromise on this point and on which I myself have supported and who now seem to be dropping out.  Mr President, a special element is the distinction between freight traffic and passenger transport. People are not containers and containers are not persons. On a number of points, we have made a distinction so that these two flows can function together properly, but also socially. Finally, Mr President, if we cannot reach an agreement tomorrow, the liberalisation of the market will continue unchanged.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for the work she has done. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the other dossiers and all the shadow rapporteurs, because they know exactly what we have done in recent weeks and months and how difficult it has been to actually reach the compromises in the end. I think that we in this House have to take a decision on how the transport sector will be organised in the next decade. And I also believe that the fate of three million female drivers and mainly drivers is at stake. The question from the outset has been, and still is, that we want a level playing field and, at the same time, should not allow social dumping to become a business model. With one of the cross-cutting achievements of this House, I would like to mention that we will have an earlier introduction of the so-called intelligent tachograph, in our view, from 2022. And we have also managed to agree across dossiers that national electronic registers will be introduced, which will be grouped together at European level by the ERRU. Because one thing is clear, I believe: that the best rules will not help if we cannot implement and control them. As I said, I would like to thank Mrs Merja Kyllönen in a special way on the posting dossier. I believe that the Posting of Workers Directive must benefit all workers, and I do not believe that we should set a precedent here with the area of mobility. Because what's next? Maybe the craft or the care? We must not do that. Therefore, let us take this with us! And when we talk about a compromise, it is precisely this so-called Danish model that is on the tray. And that, I would think, we could all decide with a clear conscience, because it prevents social dumping, is more controllable, there are fewer bureaucratic hurdles and helps companies that do their jobs honestly and pay their people properly. On driving and rest periods, my group and I largely support the Proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. There is no point in extending driving times indefinitely, which has also been prevented by the rapporteur in many areas. We can also say positively that drivers should go home every three weeks. The big problem on European motorways today is that we have models that provide three months of work away from home and allow for a month's holiday at home. In the 21st century, this cannot be the European Union's response to the citizens. That is why I believe that this is the way we should go. The inclusion of so-called light commercial vehicles is also right, because we are increasingly seeing a shift away from the large lorries towards the so-called sprinter classes, which are doing their bit without speedometers, without driving and rest periods, without any control on European motorways. That is why, if I may conclude by mentioning cabotage, we have controlled cabotage, and we have also restricted them where they have led to wild growth. There will continue to be a regulation that will ultimately prevent letterbox companies, and we have also enforced new eligibility criteria for light commercial vehicles. Finally, we must show a clear edge to all the companies whose business model is based on generating benefits through social dumping.

Fraud in the international road transport market will not be prevented by applying the same rules that have been tailored to, say, the construction industry. Not only is this im feasible in practice, but it will also cause enormous damage to the internal market and put transport services at risk. The biggest problems in transport, which relate to cabotage, driver-nomadas, letter-box companies and enforceability of the rules, were caught by the Committee on Transport. There, unlike the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, a solution has been found that ensures sufficient balance.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done.

In other words, further deregulation and liberalisation of driving and rest periods are not appropriate. We have flexible times, we have enough derogations, and that is why we could leave it at that. That is why I am glad that we, as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, have the opportunity to come forward with the proposals again. I would also like to thank the coordinator of the TRAN Committee for finding various compromises. With as far as posting is made, I believe that drivers are, of course, part of the functioning internal market and that it is essential that they are recognised as posted workers.

Let me stress that the social and market aspects of road transport are two sides of the same coin. That is why these legislative proposals have been put forward jointly, and it is why they should continue to be discussed and adopted together. If one of them fails, the interlinked social and market problems will not be solved. In other words, it is truly a ‘package’ approach. First, allow me to say few words on the posting of workers in road transport. Thank you, Ms Kyllönen, for your constant efforts to find solutions on this very sensitive and difficult topic. The sector needs rules on posting which are clear, fair and well adapted to the highly mobile nature of transport activities. In short, we really need this lex specialis. I am glad to see that the report is comprehensive on the enforcement measures of posting. I welcome your ideas on the further use of digital solutions to make compliance and controls easier. As you do, we support a tight list of requirements to ensure legal certainty. I equally welcome your amendments aimed at reinforcing the principle of co-liability for infringements of the posting rules throughout the operational chain. It is more difficult to find a balanced solution on when these posting rules should apply. For the Commission, there is no doubt that cabotage operations should be subject to posting rules from the very first day, and the proposed clarification that transit does not constitute posting is also very welcome. When it comes to the application of posting rules to international service, I want to make it clear that the Commission supports neither full exclusion nor full inclusion. As the Commission sees it, we need to distinguish between international operations that are very occasional and those where drivers spend substantial amounts of time in the host country. Let me now comment briefly on the amendments on driving and rest-time rules and on tachographs – thanking Mr de Camp who had to work on a huge number of amendments. I am glad that Parliament and the Commission seem to share the same ambition of making the social legislation fit to address the needs of workers and companies in the road transport sector. It is crucial to provide for adequate resting conditions for drivers and to ensure they can return home regularly – in the interest not only of better working conditions but also of road safety. In this context, suitable parking and resting infrastructure is essential. Therefore the Commission sees some merits in the rapporteur’s proposal on dedicated parking areas where drivers could spend rest time in a comfortable, safe and secure environment. The work of drivers, operators and enforcers will certainly be facilitated by swifter introduction of smart tachographs. Enforcement authorities would also benefit greatly from real-time access to relevant databases such as the European Register of Road Transport Undertakings (ERRU), and I therefore welcome the amendments introducing those necessary measures. However, there are three issues on which I would call for caution. First, in relation to rest-time rules applicable to passenger transport: allowing bus drivers to delay their daily rest or to take it in shorter parts could jeopardise passenger safety. In addition, such derogations would make controls more complex. Road safety should always remain as first priority. Second, in contrast to the situation with regular weekly rest, spending reduced weekly rests in a vehicle has not been identified as a problem during our public consultation and impact assessments. So we do not see a need to change the existing rules here. Third, on the extension of the scope of the social rules to include light commercial vehicles below 3.5 tonnes, the Commission has proposed the inclusion of such small vehicles within the scope of the rules on access to the profession. It is important to remain proportionate in our approach. Finally, turning to Mr Ertug’s report on access to the profession and access to the market, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on many issues addressed in his report. I believe there is a broad consensus, in particular, on stepping up the fight against letterbox companies, with reinforced criteria to determine where hauliers must be legally established; on regulating light commercial vehicles involved in international transport so that those vehicles are not used to circumvent our legislation; and also on accelerating digitalisation, using electronic tools which should become standard in this sector. We generally welcome the solutions proposed on these issues but there are two aspects on which we have some concerns. First, on cabotage, the Commission proposal aims at fighting illegal cabotage and improving the enforcibility of EU rules without changing the existing level of market access. Some amendments, however, are very restrictive and could discourage cabotage – with a negative impact on the efficiency of logistics networks and the environment. They would also make the rules much more complex and difficult to enforce. Second, on the establishment criteria, we fully support obliging hauliers to manage their activity from their Member State of establishment but we disagree with obliging them to conduct loading and unloading with a certain frequency in that same Member State. Such a new obligation could have a negative impact, particularly by increasing empty runs. To conclude, I would like to underline the point that, for this mobility package, time is of the essence – and I mean it! The sector is urgently awaiting clear, enforceable and fair EU rules. It cannot function smoothly in a patchwork of uncoordinated and inefficient national rules, so the status quo is therefore not an option. We are talking about the development of a single market. Let’s not go backwards. I know this sense of urgency is largely shared within this House, and the timetable is intended to have the new rules adopted before your elections. It is, however, possible to find a way forward and I feel that, if we stay at the table and talk and negotiate, we have a chance to move on and to give European citizens and businesses what they need in order to stay competitive and fair, to contribute to climate-change action and, of course, to continue developing their operations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 225, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Verónica Lope Fontagné", "mepid": "96765", "text": "  drafts member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – Mr President, as draftser of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I recognise that the text of the Committee on Transport and Tourism has struck a balance between the different realities existing in the European Union. It is not the same to cross the entire European Union from Spain, Portugal or Poland than to operate from France, Belgium or Germany, where the distances that carriers have to travel are much shorter.  The Directive on the movement of workers applies to cabotage from day one, so the remuneration received will be the same as that of the local worker, so it is not true that the workers are unprotected.  In addition, the obligation to return to the Member State of establishment together with greater and better controls will help to combat long-term cabotage and so-called 'mailbox undertakings', which are the real problem.  Of course it is important to defend workers – that is what we work for – but what we cannot do is use it as a pretext for protectionist purposes.

Dumping occurs when someone sells goods below the price of its manufacture. With us, in the east of Europe, work is even cheaper, because all other products are cheaper, life is cheaper. Why can't we compete also pay? This is the first question. And the second question.

Take the example of the route of one driver who passes through 5 Member States during the week and does so 3 times a month. His salary will depend on the number of hours spent in the country, region, land. This means that if he suddenly becomes stuck in Luxembourg, his salary will have to be raised accordingly.

If we choose the second path and do not follow the agreement reached in the Transport Committee, the message for all people will be clear. Today is international transport, tomorrow can be everything else, Schengen, Eurozone. There is a single market, but only for some Member States, as we decide here. I will not participate in this and will not give my voice to the creation of a new iron curtain. Let's reach out to an entire industry just because the companies in it are registered too much in the East, too far north or on the periphery of the European Union.

We have taken very good note of your comments and I would like to react to a few of them.  First, I hope I have already made it very clear that the Commission does not support the exclusion of international services from posting rules entirely. However, these rules have to be applied taking into account the highly mobile nature of the sector and need to be implemented in a proportional manner.  Any extreme proposal would be contrary to the objectives of the EU laws and principles. This is why the Commission proposed introducing a three-day threshold for cumulative presence of drivers in a month. It would allow proper protection of drivers while avoiding unnecessary administrative burdens.  Application of posting crews to international service from the first hour would, on the contrary, create red tape without real benefits for drivers. It would simply be unenforceable. Please keep in mind that thresholds already exist in the Posting Directive for other sectors which are less mobile.  Next, yes, you are right, drivers are not second-class and that is why a balanced approach to the issues on the table is essential – a balanced approach. Neither of the proposals leads to exploitation. On the contrary, they lead to fairness and enforcement that rewards those that want to play the game within the law.  Please keep in mind that we have been focusing our debate today only on the three remaining issues but there are many measures on which there is a broad consensus within this House, but also among Member States and between social partners. Like you, we have been consulting – unions, hauliers, operators, Member States and other associations. We should not forget the large number of improvements for the functioning of the transport market, for drivers’ working conditions, for better enforcement as well as for simplification through four levels of digitalisation.  I respect the very diversified views and different points of view from different stakeholders in this House. But now it is time to come together and find a way forward that will lead to the conclusion of this file. And we can only do that if we really sincerely engage and understand that we cannot stay fixed on our own position and not move.  Whatever the deal is, it must make the rules proportionate, enforceable and transparent. This will help to restore trust and to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal road transport market. What is at stake here is the fairness and the competitiveness of a vital sector of our economy, but also the credibility of our institutions. I hope we have learned from past experience. Inaction can only fuel populism and be destructive. So please bring all your wisdom to the negotiating table, so that we can find a reasonable agreement before the next European elections.  I am very much looking forward to your positive vote tomorrow and a possibility to engage as soon as possible in a trilogue and deliver on these files.

As far as transport is concerned, too, efforts must be made towards a single internal market and the freest possible mobility.

It is important to tackle illegal practices and improve the effectiveness of the implementation of the rules. I regret that many Member States are now trying to build artificial barriers to free movement and a single internal market. It's the wrong way. The transport of goods must be streamlined, the administrative burden reduced and practices clarified. The social rights of drivers must be ensured through better supervision and enhanced cooperation between Member States. Responsibility cannot be passed on to the driver, but belongs to the transport company.  Unfortunately, it has to be said that these directives have taken far too little account of the changes to transport brought about by digitalisation and automation. Automation will have a significant impact on the work of drivers, for example, and rigid regulation of working and rest periods in its current form can create quite a few obstacles to the rational organisation of work and logistics planning in the future. Further work should take a much more innovative approach. It would be important to focus on promoting digital transport ordering systems. The digitalisation of subscription systems promotes access to services throughout the internal market, increases operational transparency and facilitates supervision.  Transport produces a fifth of emissions and traffic volumes are projected to increase significantly in the future.

The recent visit of the European Parliament delegation to Colombia’s and Brazil’s regions bordering Venezuela raised the visibility of the situation of many thousands of Venezuelans fleeing their country. I saw that situation with my own eyes when I visited Colombia, in particular Cúcuta on the border between Colombia and Venezuela, three months ago. Frankly, what I saw in Cúcuta was dramatic, and heart-breaking because it could so easily have been avoided. But the crisis does not stop there. The number of Venezuelans fleeing to countries in the region is growing rapidly. They are fleeing to Brazil and Colombia, where almost a million Venezuelans have fled over the past two years, and also to Peru, which has received around 400 000 Venezuelans. Venezuelans are also fleeing to Ecuador and the Caribbean countries, including the EU Overseas Countries and Territories. According to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), since 2014 more than 2 million Venezuelans have left their country. More than 60% of them are currently in an irregular situation. All countries in the region are showing great solidarity in a challenging situation. We will stand by them to support their hospitality and to help them provide healthcare, education, housing and security for Venezuelan refugees. Unfortunately, there is still no solution in sight to the crisis in Venezuela – this is the hard reality on the ground – a crisis which is first and foremost a political crisis but one which also has serious economic and social consequences. The destabilising effects on the region cannot be ignored. Several international bodies, including the UNHCR, have already made appeals for supplementary assistance. As a consequence, the European Union – all of us – stepped up our support to Venezuelans and their host communities, in order to alleviate their most pressing needs, starting with food and health services. We mobilised our humanitarian and cooperation instruments for an amount of EUR 35 million. Over half of it is being spent to address food security, water, sanitation and hygiene within Venezuela, but there is also support for the socio-economic inclusion of migrants in neighbouring countries and, at the same time, for host communities. EUR 5 million will be allocated to humanitarian aid for health assistance, food, water and protection for the most vulnerable people, mostly inside Venezuela because the situation in Venezuela remains really dramatic. Another EUR 5 million will aim to reduce social tensions and violence and to protect people displaced by the crisis. An additional EUR 7 million can be used for other humanitarian requirements, but we intend to use part of this amount for cooperation on migration issues in other countries in the region. We Europeans feel strongly for the people of Venezuela. We feel their pain and their aspiration to put their country back on track. We are continuing to aim at a peaceful, constitutional and democratic solution to the crisis, ensuring that the rule of law and human rights are upheld. We also expect that Venezuelans will be guaranteed better living conditions so that they do not need to leave their homes. The Council of the European Union called on 28 May for fresh democratic presidential elections – elections that should be free and fair and should respect constitutional rules. Unfortunately, new additional and targeted restrictive measures were adopted last week. Our objective as the European Union is that Venezuelan citizens should have the right to express their political will through a democratic, transparent process, so they can take the future of their country into their own hands. This is the most important democratic right. We believe that regional engagement has an important role to play to facilitate and accompany a negotiated solution to the crisis. I discussed the need for such regional solutions with President Santos in Bogotá during my visit in March. As you also know, High Representative Federica Mogherini personally met with the Foreign Minister, the President of the National Assembly and representatives of the main opposition parties. We will continue, together with our partners, to monitor any development and we will calibrate future actions in the light of the evolution of the situation. This crisis is man-made, there is nothing inevitable about it. A political solution is possible, and so is a better future for all people of Venezuela. It is time for all sides, and particularly the Government of Venezuela, to engage seriously in moving towards a shared solution.

First, the deep despair of those people who left their country for the simple reason that fundamental goods, food, medicines and access to medical treatment are scarce, and it was in a state of deep despair that those people decided to leave Venezuela and leave for Brazil, always wanting to return, as soon as possible , to your country of origin. Secondly, the good response of the Brazilian authorities, which, in excellent coordination with the five United Nations agencies operating on the ground, has given an excellent response to the emergency and is now concerned with ensuring what they call the \"internalization\" of Venezuelans in Brazil, that is, their transfer to other states. I believe that the European Union must continue to be aware of this situation. Today I am talking more about the humanitarian dimension, less, perhaps, of the political issue, although on the political issue I absolutely agree with what has just been said here and which is contained in our recommendation and has been repeatedly taken on by us, but from a humanitarian point of view we must be vigilant and we must provide the greatest possible support to those countries which, at the moment, , are taking in Venezuelan refugees and migrants in terrible conditions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 291, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "28141", "text": "  Thank you very much, Congressman, you are a great knower of this area, our subject is very important, but I ask my fellow Members to take the time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 292, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, the recent report of the UN Human Rights Office described the rule of law as being virtually absent in Venezuela; this is truly shocking.

As inflation reaches 40 000 percent, the economy continues to tumble, with basic food and medical supplies in desperately short supply. Such problems are contributing to a worsening refugee crisis that is seeing ordinary Venezuelans flee to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Peru and Brazil.  I now welcome the Council decision last month to add another 11 names to the sanctions list, bringing the total to 18. This must be widened to include all those directly connected to the Maduro brutal regime in power in the near future. Beyond sanctions, however, it is difficult to see what more could be done to put pressure for fresh peaceful and democratic elections, given President Maduro’s willingness to embrace his new-found status as a global pariah.  We must also be prepared to receive citizens of EU descent coming from Venezuela, as many of them are dual nationals of countries like Portugal, Italy and Spain.

However, in order to tackle the roots of the phenomenon, it will be necessary for the European Union to step up its international mediation effort with the Venezuelan Government in order to put an end to the violation of human rights and to restore democracy, an essential prerequisite for halting the escalation of the crisis and for accessing new presidential elections respectful of the principles enshrined in the Venezuelan Constitutional Charter and internationally recognized.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 316, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "28141", "text": "  The following item is the Statements of the Council and the Commission: Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

When a new outbreak of the Ebola virus disease was declared in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on 8 May, the international community was immediately alarmed. The memories of the long struggle to contain the virus in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 are still vivid in our minds. Around 11 000 people fell victim to the disease in three African countries, and the virus also spread to the United States and to Europe. This time round, it seems the lessons have been learned. The international response was fast, determined and comprehensive. The World Health Organization (WTO) reacted quickly, ensured leadership and coordination, asked for sufficient amounts of funding and initiated a wide range of measures, from medical and psychological care, to awareness raising and prevention. Donors stepped in early, making sure that the USD 57 million Ebola strategic response plan for the DRC was fully funded. We commend the Commission for releasing EUR 3.43 million in emergency assistance for response to this crisis on behalf of the European Union. We also welcome the fact that the WHO requested the activation of the Union’s civil protection mechanism and we welcome the fact that in 2016 the European Medical Corps was established to strengthen the EU’s capacity to respond to disease outbreaks and health emergencies, both inside and outside the European Union.  Sadly, 29 people have died as a result of the Ebola virus disease in the DRC. We can be cautiously optimistic that the spread of the disease has now been halted. The last new case was confirmed almost a month ago at the beginning of June. I’m particularly relieved that the disease did not spread beyond the three DRC provinces initially affected. It was crucial that the virus could be contained in Mbandaka, a port city of around one million people. But we have to remain on our guard before declaring the end of the outbreak. No new cases must be confirmed during 42 days, twice the Ebola incubation period, counting from the day the last case was confirmed.  So let us hope that the end of July will see a positive outcome. Even so, there will be no time for complacency. Many things worked well this time, such as ring vaccination of more than 3 000 people, which was not available three years ago. But we may be able to do even better. We welcome the fact that the World Health Organization will launch a review shortly, after the end of the outbreak has, hopefully, been declared. One thing is already clear: we must invest more in strengthening resilience in the DRC to respond to future outbreaks of the virus. The country’s health system is ill prepared to cope with challenges of this scale. In that context, we highly appreciate the European Parliament’s October 2015 resolution on the long-term lessons from the previous Ebola crisis and how to strengthen health systems in developing countries to prevent future crises. We must not forget that the DRC is also facing one of the world’s most complex and long-standing humanitarian crises. Some 13.1 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance; 4.5 million Congolese have been initially displaced and 7.7 million people, or 11% of the population, are food insecure. The European Union and its Member States are at the forefront of the response to these needs, but more must be done. The Presidency will monitor developments in the DRC closely. We will put the humanitarian situation, as well as the Ebola outbreak, back on the agenda again if necessary to enable the Member States and the Commission closely to coordinate their response. Neither Africa nor Europe, nor indeed the world, can afford another Ebola epidemic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 318, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to welcome the Austrian Presidency and to thank the Minister for her comments about this demanding field of the Ebola outbreak, and for her kind words about our engagement in tackling it. From the very beginning, the European Union has mobilised its resources to assist the international response to the new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We have taken urgent action to help manage and contain the spread of the virus. Personally, as EU Ebola Coordinator, I have been monitoring the situation closely from day one, in direct contact and coordination with the new Director of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Tedros Gebreyesus (that’s a difficult Ethiopian surname!). Eight weeks later, the WHO has stated that the Ebola outbreak has been ‘largely contained’ and that it sees the situation with ‘cautious optimism’. We won this fight because this time we were ready. We had developed our ‘weapons’. EU-funded research against Ebola has continued. We co-funded vaccines and diagnostics that were quickly deployed in the field at times when Ebola was not making the headlines. Because the truth is that we learned our lessons from the Ebola outbreak in 2014 in West Africa. I saw with my own eyes in November 2014 the situation in Sierra Leone, in Guinea and in Liberia and I can compare the situation at that time with the new outbreak in Congo. We should always be prepared for the worst. We should never be complacent – I completely agree with you on that, Minister, and I assure you there is no complacency when Ebola breaks out. The recent outbreak has not turned into an enormous epidemic because of the immediate, coordinated and efficient international intervention. It was a rapid and robust response. Our team in the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) is following developments 24/7. Since the start of the outbreak, we have been working closely with the WHO, the Congolese authorities and our international partners. Our efforts focused initially on helping to get medical teams, equipment and supplies to the affected zones. In addition, we have supported the coordination of the response and the distribution of necessary information for the local communities. That is a very important activity. At the same time, all available EU emergency response instruments have been mobilised. Firstly, as the Minister already said, the Commission has provided EUR 3.5 million in humanitarian aid, primarily to the WHO, the Red Cross, the International Organization for Migration and UNICEF, and we have focused on coordination and logistical support for the Ebola response. Secondly, our assistance supports primarily life-saving intervention, including with our own European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations department humanitarian air service, ECHO Flight; infection prevention and control; water, sanitation and hygiene measures; behaviour advocacy; and, of course, safe burials. We know from the previous outbreak that burials are one of the most influential factors in the spread of the virus. We also support the surveillance of exit and entry points of Ebola-affected areas. This is another key measure to avoid the spread of the virus. Thirdly, the European Union also provides, in kind, logistical support through ECHO Flight, which regularly transports personnel, supplies and equipment from Kinshasa to the affected areas. Fourthly, our European Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) has come into play. The World Health Organization made a request for assistance, requesting emergency medical teams. Norway, through our mechanism, offered isolation transport shuttles to bring patients safely to treatment centres, medical personnel were deployed, and the Commission covers 85% of the transport costs. Fifthly, in terms of field expertise and deployments, the Commission’s regional humanitarian office in Kinshasa is fully mobilised. Extra staff have been deployed, including medical specialists and logisticians. More staff remain on standby.  Sixth is monitoring and coordination. The Emergency Response Coordination Centre is coordinating with Member States and other Commission and EU services and agencies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the humanitarian field office in Kinshasa and international partners.  The seventh aspect is satellite mapping. Copernicus is a well known, excellent and sophisticated mapping system. Copernicus Emergency Management Service has provided satellite maps of affected areas in order to support field deployments. I will continue to follow the situation on the ground closely. We will also look into lessons learned from this experience. So far, fortunately, because of our coordinated action, we have avoided the worst-case scenario. At the same time, we stand ready to provide any further assistance if needed. Our actions are a clear demonstration of EU solidarity with the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will continue to stand by the Congolese people until this Ebola outbreak is over. In conclusion, once again I have to say that there is no complacency when Ebola breaks out.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 319, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Bogdan Brunon Wenta", "mepid": "124903", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, let me start by applauding the swift reaction of international players, including the European Union, to this outbreak. This is the ninth epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the past four decades. I am glad to see there has been significant progress since the last one, in May 2017, and that the recommendations from Parliament’s last resolution on Ebola were taken into consideration. The number of potentially infected persons requiring follow-up has gradually decreased and by the end of June all of them had ceased to need mandatory monitoring. Nevertheless, because of the disease’s serious nature and the complexity of the geographical area in which it occurs, and therefore the lack of complete data, the risk to public health, both at national and regional level, remains high. For this reason the EU should continue to provide assistance through infection prevention control and support for health centres, as well as entry/exit point monitoring for the affected areas. The EU has also funded the largest research effort on the vaccine against Ebola and this is an initiative worth scaling up. From the regional perspective, it is important that the countries exposed to the possibility of an outbreak should take action on Ebola readiness and have emergency response plans in place, and that cooperation in this very important area be enhanced.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 320, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Maria Arena", "mepid": "124936", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S-D. - Madam President, since 1976, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has experienced various Ebola attacks, which have been more or less managed with peaks of contamination in the 1970s, but much less today. A total of 1,000 deaths have been reported during the various waves of contamination in 40 years. On 17 May, following the case in Mbandaka, a city of one million people, the alert was issued again, and the World Health Organization (WHO) responded directly by launching an experimental vaccination campaign on high-risk populations, as well as information and isolation campaigns. Today, WHO and the government in the DRC recognize that the epidemic is contained.  On this basis, I have asked to extend our debate this evening to the general situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While the Ebola virus, since 1976, has killed a thousand Congolese, the war in that country since 1994 has killed more than six million Congolese, displaced thousands of them who still live in camps, maimed and raped young girls.  While the DRC is capable of stopping Ebola, it clearly does not have the will or capacity to protect its populations. That is why I have called for a broader discussion on the situation in this country on the eve of an electoral process and where everything leads us to believe that the disorder is organized by the government.  I refer to the speech by Mr Mugwebe, the Sakharov Prize of this House, for whom the elections will not be credible. According to him, the Congolese people still live in modern slavery, a government of the belly and blood that has no plans or visions.  Living, working, eating and being free are rights in a country as rich as the DRC. Yet massacres, rapes, massive destruction of habitats is the daily lot of this population.  All the institutions in the DRC today are illegitimate, whether it is the provincial assembly, the national assembly, the Senate, the presidency, and that does not seem to move anyone - even here in this assembly - because they will have to hold the so-called independent elections.  So, yes, we are concerned about Ebola, but I would say that the general situation in Congo should be of greater concern to us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 321, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, last week, barely two months after it had begun, the WHO described, to our great relief, that the Congo’s latest Ebola epidemic is largely contained. The rapid eradication of this bout of Ebola is indeed remarkable. The Congolese authorities and the international health community deserve much praise for their impressive move to contain the outbreak, leaving it far from the international health disaster that was seen back in 2013 as the West Africa Ebola crisis. While I applaud the success of the response, I am also aware of concerns that Kinshasa—imposed emergency measures implemented to contain the viral epidemic might be misused to further restrict the rights and freedoms of the Congolese people, in what can already only be described as a generally very repressive political environment. Looking ahead, I therefore urge the Congolese authorities to remain responsible and transparent in their use of emergency public—health measures responding to the outbreak. It would indeed be a great shame if such a fast and remarkable crisis response were abused by the government’s use of emergency powers ahead of democratic elections.

Madam President, I think we are all going to say pretty much the same thing about the Ebola crisis. Even if it is redundant, it must be said. I believe that we must put to the fore of this Assembly for having alerted in time, in 2014, the authorities of WHO, the Commission and our Member States on the need to intervene quickly. That has been done. We have learned from that. If at the time we were slow to do so, today we reacted in time. If an event is not mentioned in the 8 p.m. news, that does not mean that we were ineffective, on the contrary. The fact that this epidemic is not the scale of that experienced in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea four years ago is the result of our effort. So let's be proud of what we've been able to accomplish and address the underlying causes. The direct causes have been addressed, the underlying causes are those of extreme poverty. I fully agree with what Mrs Arena said, I believe that the situation in Congo as she has just described it is very relevant, and we will have to have a specific discussion on this subject in another debate. Let us also thank the Commission for doing everything in its way to keeping this epidemic within bounds. Thank you to the Commissioner who is tackling these causes, and I will also ask his colleague Mr Mimica to do everything possible to address the underlying causes of this epidemic. Thus, health infrastructure needs to be improved, not only in Congo, but wherever it has not yet been the case because, we remember, at the time, in Sierra Leone, the entire health system collapsed in less than a week.

And I am glad that both international organisations and the European Union have learned lessons from previous experiences.  So far, the numbers of both infected and dead are in the dozens, and the disease is kept within one state. Last time we were in the thousands, and Europe was also in danger. I very much welcome the WHO's decision to supply the country with new experimental vaccines. The European Commission has also adopted an urgent humanitarian aid package, the European Medical Corps is ready to assist on the ground, and ECDC monitors the situation and provides updates on the situation to all interested authorities.  Of course, there is still a risk of transmission of the disease to other states, but let us trust our protection mechanisms.

Let us therefore leave aside the fact that I personally called for an urgent debate as early as the last plenary session – but, of course, if the request starts with a populist it is not even worth considering. The fact is, we lost a month. I would not underestimate this issue, as is probably being done here, because the problem is that there are more epicentres located in remote rural areas but close to the Congo River which, as you know, feeds both the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo; therefore, the risk of rapid spread of the disease is very high. Yet, according to the World Health Organization, there is a vaccine, ZEBOV, which is 100% effective and which must be used before any other in an emergency.

The fact that the disaster did not appear to have occurred, as in 2014 and 2015 in West Africa, seems to have been due to the rapid delivery of international aid and lessons learned from the epidemic of three years ago. Nevertheless, the fight against Ebola remains a challenge. The vaccine developed so far is very expensive, difficult to store and only has a preventive effect. Local conditions in the Democratic Republic of Congo make it very difficult to reach people outside major cities. In addition, the people there are suspicious of foreign organisations, some even suggest ingesling the fact that they only want to make a lot of money from the disease.

Prevention, preparedness and response, including research, are all essential elements in tackling this, and any other, outbreak. We know that Ebola might strike again in Africa. As you said, the health-care systems are, unfortunately, so weak. And this is why, under the European and developing countries clinical trials partnership, the European Union has put in place two large networks of preparedness research. Among them there are 30 African partners covering the whole region of sub-Saharan Africa. These networks are building up the capacity of our African partners to better respond to outbreaks such as Ebola or other emerging diseases. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all who worked together to contain Ebola, all who cooperated and coordinated in order to respond more effectively and more efficiently to this latest outbreak on the ground. The first responders and the volunteers, the medical personnel and the experts. But also our hard workers in the Commission services and other EU institutions and our Member States. All of them determined to help the people of DRC in this time of need. I want also to underline the good and effective cooperation we had with the World Health Organisation on the ground, but also at the institutional level. Finally, I want to repeat that we are not letting our guard down. We will continue to monitor closely the situation 24/7. Let us always remember that health emergencies have no borders. No one can face such challenges alone. Only together can we better assist affected populations and protect our citizens, EU citizens. Cooperation and coordination are preconditions for any effective response. I would like to clarify something about our efforts regarding vaccines. The Commission is funding Ebola vaccine development to the tune of over EUR 160 million. The EU has provided funding for the vaccine which is now being deployed in the DRC. A second vaccine, which is currently being assessed by WHO, has also received EU funding. So the European Union and global partners are assessing where new research funding is needed for diagnostic treatments and vaccines, as well as ways to better communicate with affected communities and stakeholders to organise the response. I would like to say this as an answer, because I strongly believe that it is better to clarify some things about our efforts in this very demanding research field.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 337, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28141", "text": "  Commissioner Stylianides, thank you very much for your commitment.

The number of victims this time is likely to close in about 30 people. Several factors influenced the rapid containation of the epidemic, such as the relatively low level of urbanisation in the region where it occurred, which limited the transmission of the virus. But it is important to stress the immediate response of the World Health Organisation in cooperation with local doctors, who, with the vaccine, have organised a very rapid action to vaccinate people exposed to the virus and to isolate people infected or suspected of being infected. As a result, we are talking today about dozens of contagions or suspected contagion. We will have to wait a few weeks for the end of the epidemic to be announced, but this action has shown how important coordinated action is to prevent the spread of the virus.

Mr President, helping people in need is the moral duty of all of us. When a Danish motorist sees a Syrian family with small children trudging along the highway, it's just humane to give them a ride. When Spanish firefighters on Greek islands rescue people from drowning, they deserve our applause. Nevertheless, danish motorists and spanish firefighters were taken to court for allegedly smuggling people.  The 2002 directive, entitled 'defining assistance for illegal entry, illegal transit and illegal residence', stipulates that each Member State must have appropriate sanctions if a European citizen helps someone to enter or move into the country irregularly in that Member State, if this is against national law. The directive also says that if a European citizen is seeking personal financial gain, that Member State must prosecute that citizen. Because that's a crime. However, and I prefer to talk about irregular and not illegal, but if a European simply gives aid to a migrant without a right of residence, this should not be criminalised against smuggling under the United Nations protocol. The directive (in short) \"description of aid\" provides for a non-binding option for an exception for humanitarian aid in Article 1(2). But that exception is apparently not well understood in all cases, otherwise those Danish motorists and those Spanish firefighters would never have been prosecuted.  The European Parliament therefore calls on the European Commission to formulate clear guidelines for the Member States on the application of this Directive so that the exception is regulated and that the provision of humanitarian aid in the future is embedded in each Member State or in law or in practice, and we make clear once and for all which forms of assistance should not be criminalised in Member States. I think it is of the utmost importance to underline this.  In Malta, the ship the Seawatch is waiting for permission to sail. The ship the Aquarius is located in Marseille in the port, because she was no longer allowed to resupply in Italy. There are currently hardly any NGO rescue ships operating in the Mediterranean. This is despite the fact that the law in Italy is very clear: humanitarian aid is not a criminal offence. Also in Austria, in Belgium, in Germany, in the United Kingdom, in Finland, in Sweden, in the Netherlands, in Luxembourg, in Portugal, in Croatia, in Ireland and this list is not complete, in those countries too, there is some way between people smuggling for financial gain, a criminal case, and people who help out of humanitarian motivation. That distinction is very important. In France, the law has recently been tightened and it is becoming more difficult for aid workers to provide assistance. Whereas in Hungary, since the vote on the new NGO law, it has actually become virtually impossible to help migrants with simple things like food and drink and a place to sleep. So, while many countries at home distinguish between aid and exploitation, they seem to have lost sight of this in rescue operations in the Mediterranean.  Last week's Council conclusions state that all ships operating in the Mediterranean must respect the laws in force and should not stand in the way of the work of the Libyan Coastguard. Of course, all ships at sea must follow the law. Why should this be emphasised? Don't these NGOs follow the law? I think so. I think they respect the law and also the law of the sea in which one principle is very clear, namely that a drowning man must be saved. Why is such an emphasis placed on the operation of the coast guard of a third country? The UN Protocol against Smuggling, which clearly states that the provision of humanitarian assistance is not a criminal offence, does it also apply in the Mediterranean? And the European directive on the definition of aid, right?  So, Mr President, it is very much desirable for the European Commission to give the Member States clarity on the interpretation of the directive.

There are not many of us here tonight, but what we say and have to discuss tonight is very important and I would like to express my thanks to all colleagues who have brought this issue to the surface. I would like to tell you that the focus of all our actions at EU level with the Member States is, and has always been, to disrupt the criminal networks that make significant profits out of the smuggling of migrants to and within Europe. Our actions have been successful so far, although we shall not reduce our efforts until we destroy their business model entirely.  Thanks to our coordinated work and also to the EU-Turkey Statement, the business of the smugglers on the Turkish coast has already significantly decreased. With the support of Europol, many migrant smuggling networks have been dismantled.  These are the kinds of results that we aiming for. We do not want in any way to prosecute citizens and organisations that provide genuine assistance to those in it. Criminalisation of genuine humanitarian assistance should be avoided and, let us be clear, EU legislation on the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence does not require Member States to do so. On the contrary, it provides for the possibility to exempt genuine humanitarian assistance from criminalisation under national law and so far, eight Member States have provided some sort of explicit exemption.  The Commission understands Parliament’s concerns about how the EU legislative framework might impact citizens providing humanitarian assistance. So we take note of your request for guidelines to be issued on this delicate matter.  The Commission has done an evaluation of the Facilitators Package that was published last year. We consider that there is not sufficient evidence about the need to revise the legislation at this point in time. However, we acknowledge the perceived risk of criminalisation of humanitarian assistance as one of the main areas in need of improvement.  That is why we have started to engage with civil society representatives and the Fundamental Rights Agency. A first dedicated meeting took place in May, in Brussels, with the relevant stakeholders and agencies. Discussions on this issue also took place with Eurojust and national prosecutors at the end of May. We are expecting feedback from the participants, and we will continue this process.  Our objective is to create and maintain an ongoing dialogue and exchange with interested stakeholders. We want to gather evidence and foster a dialogue on the implementation of the Facilitators Package precisely to avoid criminalisation of humanitarian assistance. Such an exercise does not preclude other forms of reach—out or initiatives at a later stage should the need arise. I look forward to hearing your views.

Mr President, Commissioner, let us be clear, it is not just a question of preventing humanitarian operations from being penalised or criminalised. It is also, and in my humble opinion, also a matter of ensuring that the passage of illegal migrants is not facilitated under the guise of humanitarian action, not because there would be too many, but above all because we are participating in this way in the sinister scheme of human traffickers. There are reasons to fear that a number of operators who are currently in the Mediterranean are there precisely for this reason, and I have a problem with that. Let these people do it even inadvertently, I will, but at the end of the day, we facilitate in this way a trade that I believe we have a moral duty, an obligation, to eradicate in the name of human dignity. And therefore, we really need to establish clear guidelines in all directions. What can be considered unacceptable, illegal aid, and what is clear from humanitarian action? In my view, action must be described as humanitarian, under supervision, under control and probably under the instructions of the official authorities responsible for such operations. We have recently witnessed in the Mediterranean an action almost sovereignly conceived by some captains who believe themselves not only empowered, but also allowed to act where no one has sent them, while others would also be there. This does not help Commissioner, and it does not help to give credibility to these operations.

We therefore call on you, through this resolution, to set out explicit guidelines. These should enable national authorities, in particular, to distinguish between smugglers and citizens who act in a selfless manner. Without this distinction, it will be difficult to be truly effective in the fight against the real criminals that are traffickers.  We must avoid the wrong target and the amalgamation of good-faith citizens with smugglers, especially in France, as my colleague Judith Sargentini pointed out.

They are coming because both Libya and the Mediterranean are easier and cheaper to cross than they were 10 years ago.  These people take to the sea on rubber boats and other unseaworthy vessels because they know they have a good chance of being picked up by NGO ships that are waiting close to the Libyan coast, and of being ferried to Europe. Those NGOs thus contribute actively not only to the migration crisis here in Europe, but also to the humanitarian tragedy in the Mediterranean by luring people to the sea.

What is at stake? Well, this concerns the directive that affects citizens who are helping other human beings and providing humanitarian assistance at sea – and who can end up being charged with criminal activities. I chair the Committee on Petitions and we have received a number of petitions on this. I would argue that we need to do more so that we manage migration properly in the Union, but until this becomes the case we should not punish citizens for doing what every human being should do when they meet people in distress, at risk of losing their lives at sea.

And the results are there. And, above all, we have moved towards the criminalization of the NGOs, which have been so essential. And not just in the Mediterranean. I would also like to remind the Sevillian firefighters of Proem-Aid, who were also accused of human trafficking for helping precisely refugees. And this criminalization of humanitarian aid must end. And it must end, inter alia, because, as has already been said, the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Traffic in Migrants states in a very clear way that, in order to accuse someone of trafficking, there has to be a clear and proven profit and, secondly, because one can never accuse someone who is providing humanitarian aid of trafficking. And it is true, in our Directive, in the Border Pin Package Directive, we currently have simply an indication that Member States can introduce derogations from humanitarian aid in the event of accusing someone of trafficking, and that is not enough.

Nous sommes d’accord pour dire qu’il s’agit d’un sujet délicat, mais important. Tout d’abord, il est clair que la non-assistance à des gens en danger de mort est non seulement inimaginable, mais aussi illégale en vertu du droit international. Nous sommes prêts à travailler avec vous pour empêcher la criminalisation et la mise en cause de citoyens et d’organisations qui aident ceux qui se trouvent en danger et dans le besoin. Cependant, nous poursuivrons notre lutte contre les passeurs et les trafiquants d’êtres humains, qui exploitent le désespoir des migrants. Je voudrais d’ailleurs souligner que les législations pénales nationales excluent déjà dans la plupart des cas la criminalisation de l’assistance humanitaire. Refuser l’aide à des personnes en situation d’urgence est même un crime. I would like to be very clear on that. The duty of assistance at sea to anybody in distress is already an obligation under international law. Now, as regards the situation in the Mediterranean Sea, it is essential that all those involved comply with international rules. This is our guiding principle. We should never forget that we are all working towards the same goal: saving lives at sea and putting an end to the business model used by smugglers to exploit human misery. Our objective is to replace this model by legal and secured pathways for those in need of protection. We have made good progress over the past few years in this direction, and we have to step up our efforts. As regards the situation in Hungary, the recently adopted legislative package raises concern as regards its compatibility with several aspects of the aquis. As we always do, we are examining it and, on the basis of the outcome of our assessment, we will take the necessary steps. It is very clear to us that we should not turn our backs on the values and the principles on which Europe is built. On a more general note, the Commission is aware of the challenges experienced by many civil society organisations in Europe, and is committed to supporting strong, independent and pluralistic civil society in the Member States.

Migrant smuggling has become a global crime, which requires a serious response. They don't care about any lives, and unfortunately European NGOs are assisting in this when they are still ringing migrants from Libyan waters.  Most of the migrants are economic migrants. They are transported to sea without water, food or life jackets in crowded rubber dingboats, expecting to be quickly found and \"rescued\" by NGO rescue ships from Libya's coastal waters and then transferred to Europe. It must finally be said that the practice of NGO vessels 'vailing' migrants from Libya's coastal waters and then not returning them to Libya, which is a few kilometres away, must be put to an end, as this has become a very strong pull factor.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. First of all, thank you for the opportunity here today to answer this oral question. Ladies and gentlemen, private entrepreneurship in small companies is the real economy. These are business ideas with concrete services, with concrete products, these are the local jobs. These entrepreneurs and workers pay taxes. Taxes finance social benefits. From this point of view, small and medium-sized companies are the basis of society – by the way, Amazon and Google would be nothing, they would be nothing without the real business. That is another reason why we are in favour of a modern right to protection of benefits, and we are in favour of tax justice. Today it is a question of how we define small and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission has launched a consultation on this. The old definition of 250 employees and a maximum turnover of EUR 50 million has come of age. She is from 2003, she is almost 15 years old. As a Parliament, we have taken this as an opportunity to make two proposals. Firstly, we want to adjust the definition slightly upwards. Economic growth, inflation – we have to take this into account. Adjustment upwards also means a certain flexibility. For example, if companies receive funding over project periods of several years and exceed the thresholds during this period, then preferential access to funding must remain – there should be more flexibility here. The same applies to red tape relief. Here, too, there must be longer transitional periods if farms grow out of the classical definition. The second point is that, and this is a very important concern, we would like to invite the definition to take the issue of SMEs a little further. When companies grow very fast, management does not grow in all areas. To relieve bureaucracy would make sense, in a sense, as a thank you for the jobs, especially if these companies otherwise have very reliable characteristics – for example, they are owner-managed or have a high equity ratio. Commissioner, please also consider further reductions in bureaucracy. We often have companies with 1000 employees or more that should not be expected to be the full force of the legislation, for example because they produce very few hazardous substances due to the way they are produced, emit very little CO2, sell very little online, etc. – there are many examples. If we were to take small and medium-sized enterprises further here, for example, consider a mid-cap category, then we could deregulate more effectively. Exceptions could then be made for such companies in emissions trading, waste legislation and accessibility, which could be allowed – because it is only a matter of small things – without jeopardising European environmental or social policy in any way.  In this sense, therefore, we invite the Commission to make proposals , the adjustment of the thresholds and new discharge for a mid-cap category. You are in the consultation process, please take Parliament's suggestion with you. We also combine this – and this is also a very central concern – with the desire to make small and medium-sized enterprises in the Commission more of a cross-cutting task for all Commissioners and Directorates-General, because I believe that much more can be achieved here, particularly with binding tests for small and medium-sized enterprises, in the interests of compulsory seam tests, if we had this idea in all the Commissioners' IAtes, in all the Directorates-General, that we do not allow the full force of European legislation for all companies equally.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 372, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. –Mr President, let me update Members of the European Parliament on our work on the definition of SMEs, but I just want to start by reminding you of three figures that I am sure you all know. SMEs account for 99% of European Union enterprises. They provide 90 million jobs and they generate almost four trillion in value added.  We believe that SMEs should be able to operate in an environment that really enables them to start and grow their businesses, and we have been working across the Commission to address exactly this objective: from the start-up initiative, through our work on the single market initiatives, through a strict line on enforcing late payments, for example, to the New Skills Agenda. Administrative burdens, changing legislation, finding the funds: these are just some of the worries of small and medium-sized enterprises. The smaller the enterprise is, the heavier those worries weigh on them. An important element in this discussion is of course an SME definition. As you are aware, we are currently carrying out a thorough evaluation of the SME definition to examine if it is still fit for purpose in the current business and finance environment.  How are we doing this? By carrying out a wide-ranging, in-depth analysis and evaluations. We listened to SMEs via a targeted survey – almost 6 000 SMEs replied. We listened to all those who use the definition on a daily basis, to those who provide loans to SMEs or who relieve their administrative burdens or finance their ideas with a grant or State aid. So 150 individual interviews were carried out. We listened to all associations and other stakeholders that know SMEs and protect their interests. The public consultation received nearly 1 000 contributions and over 100 position papers. It was closed just recently in May. We are now considering all the submissions and carrying out a dedicated evaluation and an impact assessment. We also, of course, listened to the Members of the European Parliament.  What is more, this really vast consultation exercise was done on top of three earlier evaluations carried out in 2006, 2009 and 2012. No major issues were revealed back then but there have been developments in the meantime, especially in two rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2016, and these rulings pointed out certain issues that the wording of the definition might apply. It is particularly important and relevant in the context of groups of linked enterprises. I can confirm that this issue forms a part of the evaluation.  The second question refers to adaptation to inflation of the nominal thresholds used in the definition. On this aspect, again I can reassure you that this is also among the items covered by this evaluation. On the third point, the so-called mid-caps, we are of course aware of the challenges they are facing – and they are really facing a lot of challenges, for example scale-ups – and again, we are also looking into this issue and we are evaluating this. All the issues flagged in your questions are being specifically addressed, in addition to the whole spectrum of aspects that form part of our evaluation. The next steps will depend on the outcome of this global assessment. So due account will be taken to ensure that the burden on SMEs is limited to the minimum and that clarity and stability for those who use the definition are the underlying objectives.

This is an opportunity to reaffirm the centrality of small and medium-sized enterprises in the European manufacturing system and the European economy.

I believe that we must continue along this path, and the current consultation, to which the Commissioner referred, is also intended to represent the will of the Commission and all the institutions, including Parliament, to work in this direction. I believe that small and medium-sized enterprises must be provided with the capacity to take advantage of the new opportunities offered by the resumption of exports to third countries, the recovery of competitive capacity after the economic crisis. We must understand that there will be no growth, not even for SMEs, without innovation and the ability to take advantage of the opportunities arising from the opening up of global markets. We know that innovation means not only targeting small and medium-sized enterprises that have a disruptive capacity and strong change, but also those that can allow incremental innovation, that gradually changes the ecosystem and makes it grow. In this sense, I think that, while it is true that 90% of the growth in the next few years worldwide will be generated outside the European Union, we really do have a task to accompany SMEs. We are familiar with the subject of credit, exports, internationalization, etc. Let me make one final comment: if it is true that we believe in SMEs, we must give them centrality and we must not confuse the plans.

If we like a centre of a town or village, it's usually because there are not only multinationals, but also because there are those smaller, local companies. That is why SMEs deserve our generous support.  In order to access funding and also to EU support programmes, the definition of SMEs is of incredible importance. That is why I want the Commission to first examine whether it is beneficial to adapt the definition rather than to decide directly that this should be done. Above all, let us not try to add more criteria to the definition. The wider the definition becomes, the more difficult it becomes for SMEs to claim the support it really deserves. I have told SMEs that the change in the definition is not necessary as far as it is concerned. So why would we change something that works well?

But it was necessary to take an even longer journey until we got this far. After the final failure of the original association agreement in 2013, years passed before negotiations finally resumed in 2015 to establish the current agreement, which the parties signed in November 2017. Looking further than the foregoing, I consider it a development of even historical importance that the Armenian nation, which escaped the grip of the Tsarist Russian and Ottoman Turks and then the Soviet empires, has finally found its way back to its rightful place, the community of European peoples, as the \"eastern bastion\" and first Christian state of a united Europe, leaving behind the eras of mass genocide and communist dictatorship. I have the great honour of being a member of the European Parliament as a member of the European Parliament, and I can also express my good wishes from this place on the occasion of the centenary of the independence of the Armenian State, which was proclaimed in 1918, albeit for a short period of time. In the midst of its regained independence and the contemporary continuation of the democratic system change that began nearly three decades ago, the European Parliament is ready to give all possible support to Armenia and to the Armenian people who have courageously protruded for democratic change, as well as to Prime Minister Nikol Pasinján and his government, who he has put at the head of the country, in order to continue the reforms and the modernisation of society at an accelerating pace under the partnership agreement adopted by the Joint Will. , combat corruption, kick-start economic development, establish a rule of law system and ensure human-civil rights, and find a peaceful solution to the nagorno-Karabath war conflict. The European Union has been facing serious crises for many years. Due to its weakening strength and divisions, it is difficult to cope with the challenges of further integration and the migration crisis. This is why its relations with its immediate neighbours, such as the Eastern Partnership, are important. All parties can win from these relations. The development of relations with the EU can benefit not only Armenia, but also the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 392, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, first of all, let me thank the rapporteur and all the colleagues that I have been working with over these years, and as he reminded us just now, years that have been very intense and not always easy, but that we can today celebrate with an agreement that, I agree, can be defined as historical. For me it was a great pleasure just a few days ago to welcome the new Foreign Minister of Armenia to Brussels, very soon after the new government took office, in what was a smooth, democratic peaceful transition for our first Partnership Council with Armenia. We could not have chosen a better moments to have this first meeting, and it was indeed a pleasure for me to conclude, in one way, a long journey and, at the same time, begin a new journey together. As you all know, last November we signed a comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with Armenia. Last April the Armenian parliament ratified the agreement unanimously, with the then government and the opposition voting together. I can say, having worked with both the previous government and now with the new one, that I believe personally that all Armenian parties understand very well that a partnership with the European Union is something vital for the country. It is not about geopolitics. It is not about spheres of influence. It is not a partnership against somebody else. It is a partnership for, first of all, our citizens: the citizens of Armenia, our own citizens in the European Union for economic growth, for job creation, for better and stronger democracies. It is a partnership that can help advance the demands raised by the Armenian people also in these latest months. The foreign minister informed me of the very ambitious reform agenda of the new government and the first concrete action it has already taken in the fight against corruption. In the partnership council meeting we also agreed on the importance of an effective and independent judicial system, also as a precondition for economic and social development. This is the right time for Armenia to work on a new criminal code and a new criminal procedural code. These are important reforms, not because the European Union asked for them, but because the people of Armenia asked for them. They have been asking for these reforms for a long time, and now I think we have the instruments, including with this agreement, to accompany and encourage a government that seems to put these reforms at the core of their action. Our new partnership provides the perfect framework to support the reforms. The European Union will invest EUR 160 million in the next four years. We are ready to support many different fields of action. Just a few examples, from the small and medium enterprises to helping improving the business environment or investing in energy efficiency, and the list could continue. We are ready to use our new external investment plan to incentivise private investment in strategic sectors for the Armenian economy. In November, in parallel with the signature of the agreements, we had our eastern partnership summit, and we agreed on 20 concrete actions to improve daily lives within our eastern partners. I have seen the strong determination of the new Armenian Government to cooperate even more and to try and deliver together on this very ambitious agenda. Our first contacts with the new government have been very productive. The atmosphere at our first meeting could not have been more positive, friendly and constructive, and the foreign minister also informed me that the government intends to hold early elections after reforming the electoral code. Your draft resolution rightly stresses the importance of helping Armenia in the electoral process, and I am convinced the European Parliament can accompany and facilitate this process with its expertise and through electoral observation. You really have a key role to play here. The new elections should build public confidence in the electoral process, particularly by addressing recommendations by the OSCE and its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. So as always, not only do I believe your vote tomorrow will be a very important moment, but also let me say also that your daily work in this particular context will be extremely important and helpful. As always, I count on the precious work of this Parliament to accompany the strong partnership and friendship we have with Armenia, in particular in this extremely important moment for the country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 393, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "David McAllister", "mepid": "124806", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, two weeks ago I had the honour of chairing an ad hoc delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs to Yerevan and, in less than 24 hours, we met the new Prime Minister, Nikol Pashinyan, several ministers, the Speaker of the Assembly, and also Members of Parliament from the ruling party and the opposition. Let me highlight my three main findings from this trip. Firstly, the political transition in Armenia took place within the constitutional framework and without casualties. This is remarkable and it was only possible due to the level—headed reaction of all parties involved. Secondly, the short-term and long-term goals of fighting corruption and reforming the electoral law are most welcome, effective implementation is key and reforms should involve the opposition. As regards the next elections, which the High Representative just mentioned, the European Union should be ready to launch an election observation mission.

It is Russia and regional powers: Turkey and Iran. Unfortunately, wars also break out near the country from time to time. We also have a lot of different flashpoints there.  I think that this situation and the very tragic history of armenians dictates that the European Union support solutions that have an impact on stabilisation and on the Armenian Republic and the region. For this purpose, of course, very different paths can lead. One possibility was the proposal to have Armenia's association with the Union discussed. Armenia, however, made a different choice by joining the Eurasian Economic Union. The question must therefore be asked of the way out of this situation. And In my opinion, the correct choice was made. This is a logical and beneficial solution, in that the European Union has negotiated an individual partnership agreement with the Republic of Armenia.

Unfortunately, during the last few years, the country has faced serious problems on its way to democracy, and the political situation there have been very complicated. The continuing transformation – indeed the political battle between pro-Western and pro—Eastern forces in the country – led to protests in April.

That is why I am warmly supporting the consent of the European Parliament. However, I must say that, in my Group, there is a concern that, according to international law, Armenia is a country that is occupying 20% of its neighbouring Azerbaijan – and this overshadows the success we are seeing now and the new efforts and we need to ensure that the European Union is doing everything it can to enhance a peaceful settlement of the conflict and the end of the occupation, rather than a military solution.

It is essential that Armenia is not put before either-or-alternatives in the development of its relations with its powerful neighbours and partners, alternatives, some of which are not, because the shares of trade with Russia and the EU differ only marginally, and the products of both sides cannot replace each other.

In the difficult geopolitical situation that Armenia finds itself in, in principle, in conflict with its neighbour Azerbaijan, and when it more or less has to maintain good relations with the Russian Federation, I am very happy – and here I commend our European diplomacy – that we did not neglect Armenia after it did not sign the Association Agreement with the European Union in 2015, but concluded an agreement that binds it to the Eurasian Economic Union , and thus more or less orients it into Russian space.  I am sympathetic to this, it is due to the difficult situation, the dispute with Azerbaijan, and it is good to develop relations with this country and to strengthen the trends of cooperation between the European Union, European countries and Armenia. So I welcome and thank you for the agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 404, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, first of all let me say how glad I am to see a united Parliament on this, in supporting this agreement we have reached with Armenia. I can tell you it was not an easy decision in 2015, neither on our side, nor on their side, to decide to open negotiations on this agreement. I believe it was the right choice to make at the time. As you said, it is proving to be even more important today because this allows us today to have exactly the right tools to accompany a very ambitious reform agenda that the government is determined to put in place. I think it was the right political choice at the time. I have to say that both on our side and on the Armenian side – sorry to use the same word twice – we managed to manage the negotiations wisely and we managed to achieve a good result. It really was a good moment for me when we managed to sign this agreement last November. And today, we have all the potential instruments we can use at full speed and with all determination. One point that was raised by some of you at the beginning was visa liberalisation dialogue. We discussed this during the Council we had a couple of weeks ago. You know that the visa facilitation and readmission agreement with Armenia being implemented is a technical precondition for taking the decision by the Council to start the visa liberalisation dialogue. We have had four meetings of the joint EU-Armenia committees, and we see that the visa facilitation and admission agreements with Armenia are being satisfactorily implemented, so the technical precondition is met. We still see the need for closer cooperation between us in the area of return and readmission, but we are on the right track, which means that it is now a political decision to be taken by the Council. This Parliament can have a role in that as well, in have your voice heard with this other institution. Having said that, I thank you very much for all the support and I will try to make good use of it, including for an electoral observation mission at the beginning of our work, when the time comes. I count on your availability to do that work together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 405, "date": "2018-07-03.json", "name": "László Tőkés", "mepid": "39726", "text": "  Artist. \"Mr. President, I would like to thank you for your support It was a very good feeling for me to be with The Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman McAllister and the members of the ad hoc delegation in Armenia and personally to see what was going on there. To tell you the truth, it didn't come to me to believe that this humble, quiet-wordEd Prime Minister Pasinján was able to dominate the streets and catalys such a radical change, a velvet revolution.  This was one of my basic feelings, and the other was that I was very afraid of Mr Pasinján – I am thinking here of the oligarchs, the geopolitical relations, the Russian influence, the members of the Republican Party left over from the old system. I was very reminded, for example, of the assassination of the former Serbian Prime Minister. I was very afraid of the Armenian Prime Minister, the situation is fragile, so we have to take a greater stand, because if he loses, then the regime change will fail.  So it is very one factor, it depends on one decisive personal factor, and I therefore thank my colleagues for all their support for Armenia and the Prime Minister.

Armenia is also a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, which shows that the country has open relations with many countries, which opens up many commercial and economic opportunities. The new agreement provides a better legal framework to revitalise political dialogue and broaden economic cooperation, as well as cooperation in areas such as energy, transport, infrastructure and the environment. This agreement should have a positive impact on Armenia in contributing to the promotion of relations with the European Union. Such prospects are particularly important for young people in Armenia, including by improving education and improving access to employment. It is also important that eu and Armenian citizens benefit from closer cooperation.
