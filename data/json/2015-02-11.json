We have just marked the first month after the brutal terrorist attacks in Paris. These attacks targeted our common values – democracy, solidarity, basic freedoms, including freedom of expression, tolerance and human dignity. The shockwave has spread far beyond European borders and there has been a firm joint response – an unprecedented expression of unity and solidarity, and the firm conviction that terrorist attacks should not be tolerated. We have no time to waste. We must work on efficient measures to protect our societies and citizens from fear – from the fear of terrorist attacks, from the fear of radicalisation, and from the fear of intolerance. The informal meeting will discuss ways to strengthen further our fight against terrorism. While Member States have the primary responsibility for combating terrorism, measures taken at EU level will have added value in many ways. The EU has a long-standing counter-terrorism strategy, with measures in various areas supporting Member States’ counter-terrorism policies. However, recent events have shown that there is scope for stepping up our actions. In the past four weeks the Council has put a lot of effort into this. All relevant ministers – justice and home affairs, foreign affairs, finance, culture and others – have worked intensely to accelerate and improve our fight against terrorism. As a result of discussions among the Ministers for Home Affairs and Justice, the Riga Joint Statement was adopted. It outlines a further comprehensive set of measures to address the current threat: namely, prevention of radicalisation, information-sharing and cooperation between competent authorities, prevention of illegal trafficking in firearms, and the reinforcement of external borders. We expect the Commission to present its communication on the EU Internal Security Strategy by mid-April 2015 so that it can be reviewed and updated by mid-2015. Also, the Finance Ministers discussed further steps to be taken to combat the financing of terrorism and, together with the Commission, adopted a joint declaration with a view to more efficient application of the rules in the anti-money laundering package. With regard to further work on external aspects of counter-terrorism, the Foreign Affairs Ministers agreed on strengthening engagement with third countries, swift implementation of counter-terrorism measures, a strategy on foreign terrorist fighters, and addressing the unresolved crises and conflicts that foster terrorism. The January debate in the European Parliament on the fight against terrorism also contributed to the common pool of ideas. The informal meeting tomorrow will focus on three major areas: firstly, citizens’ security; secondly, preventing radicalisation and safeguarding values; and, thirdly, cooperation with international partners. The security of citizens is at the heart of our concerns. The informal meeting will discuss ways and means of implementing the existing tools more effectively or improving them. It will discuss a number of issues, ranging from information sharing, identification of terrorists and detection of their movements, to police and judicial cooperation. What is needed here is joint action by all Member States, supported by the EU institutions. In this context, let me mention a crucial issue on which all the EU institutions need to proceed swiftly: the proposal on a European Passenger Name Record (PNR) scheme. This is a complex issue and there are certain reservations, but we cannot afford to remain idle. Counter-terrorism experts have converging views that we need this measure. The Presidency is ready to engage in a constructive manner with the European Parliament as soon as it is ready to start the discussion. We believe that the outstanding concerns on fundamental rights, including solid data-protection safeguards, could be successfully addressed while negotiating the text of the present PNR proposal. Member States have a broad consensus on the need for a strong European PNR scheme: that was clearly evident during yesterday’s General Affairs Council meeting. In this regard, we appreciate the efforts made by Mr Kirkhope to revive the debate in Parliament, and Mr Kirkhope has recently also organised a series of discussions on the subject. In particular, we welcome his intention to present a modified report to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) by the end of this month. Secondly, preventing radicalisation is another key element of the fight against terrorism. We need to act jointly, not only at official level but also with civil society and the private sector. Our action must be twofold: monitoring, and removing from the internet, content that promotes terrorism or violence; and also engaging in positive communication. We need to develop a positive narrative to promote our values. Vocational training, job opportunities, social integration and rehabilitation can significantly contribute to the achievement of this goal. Lastly, cooperation with our international partners should be reinforced. The Foreign Affairs Council addressed this dimension on Monday, and the outcome of their deliberations will serve as an input to the leaders’ discussion tomorrow. Actions taken over recent weeks to fight terrorism, and further measures to be taken in the future, were discussed yesterday at the General Affairs Council, as I have mentioned, and delegations have concrete expectations from the informal meeting of Heads of State or Governments that will take place tomorrow. Tomorrow’s informal meeting will also address the Economic and Monetary Union. As you know, the President of the Commission, in close cooperation with the President of the Euro Summit, the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank, will report to the June 2015 European Council on their work regarding better economic governance in the euro area. The discussion scheduled for Thursday aims to feed the debate. We are looking forward to a communication from the four Presidents that will give a broader assessment of the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union. Besides the above evaluation of the measures taken, the Presidency aims to foster a deeper reflection in the Council on the structural reforms that are key to sustainable economic growth in the Union. As the European Council has reiterated on a number of occasions, any strengthening of economic governance needs to be accompanied by further steps towards stronger legitimacy and accountability. Lastly, in the light of recent developments, the Heads of State or Government will also look at the situation on the ground at our eastern borders. Yesterday you heard an update from High Representative Mogherini on the situation on the ground and on ongoing diplomatic efforts. Later today, new talks should start in Minsk. Clearly we are at a crucial juncture. We expect a broad discussion at the summit on the latest developments. At this stage we need to maintain our unity, solidarity and consistency with regard to the full and comprehensive implementation of the Minsk Agreement by all parties. To conclude, as I have mentioned, the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government will address three major issues: the fight against terrorism, the Economic and Monetary Union and the situation in Ukraine. We expect the meeting will provide political impetus so that we can move forward swiftly. We expect clear orientation from the highest level. We are fully aware that tomorrow’s discussions will not be easy. However, we are hopeful that they will proceed and produce a positive and pragmatic result.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "De Voorzitter. -", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   For the Commission's statement, I am now giving the floor to Mr Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Eerste vicevoorzitter van de Commissie. - Dank u, Voorzitter, en dank dat u de moeite heeft gedaan om de taal te spreken van het land dat vlak naast uw woonplaats ligt.  I had the honour of presenting to you, with President Juncker, the European Commission's work programme for 2015. As we agreed, it is a program that focuses on the essentials. It focuses on a limited number of concrete actions on real priorities. A total of 23 initiatives have been politically committed to implementing this year, including the European security agenda for the period 2015-2020. In the meantime, the terrorist attacks in Paris and those foiled in Belgium have placed this issue of security and, in particular, the terrorist threat, on the front page of all the media and the focus of attention.  The formal European Council on 12 February will be an opportunity for the Union to reaffirm its determination to combat all forms of terrorism and to have a broad exchange of views on both the actions taken by the Member States, given that they are the first responsible in this area, and on the support that the European Union can provide in terms of solidarity. added value and support for mutual trust. The attacks in France sent shockwaves through Europe. In the face of the terrorist threat, we must act decisively to bring structural solutions to this major challenge for European society, which touches on our fundamental values. Acting quickly is essential, but acting in haste would be a mistake: you have to keep your cool and give yourself time for a thorough reflection. This substantive reflection must focus on the multiple aspects of a difficult and complex issue to which we must give a balanced answer, which takes into account both the need to ensure the security of citizens and the need to defend fundamental rights and freedoms.  It cannot in any way call into question our common way of life, our freedom and our shared values, because that is what terrorists want. It is up to us to better understand that living together must be more than just cohabitation, more than just coexistence. It is a question of knowing each other and respecting the life chosen by each one. Personally, I cannot envisage a Europe where some communities - such as the Jewish community currently in Britain and France - feel that they have no future in Europe. If the Jews of Europe have this impression, Europe will have no future. We must defend our values and diversity, while defending our security and unity. Our long European history has taught us that there can be no security without freedom, no freedom without security: you cannot separate the two issues. The worst poison we know in European history is anguish, fear, fear. Fear creates a situation where one looks at the other with fear, where one believes that the other wants to undermine our position: in European history, this has always led to disasters.  While security is essentially the responsibility of the Member States, Europe has an obligation to develop an element of the overall solution. There is no doubt that the more coordination and coordination between Europeans on security, the better and the less terrorists will be able to slip into the loopholes that exist, particularly in the application and use of the current cooperation tools. The truth is that the Fight against European terrorism must start with the simple implementation of the decisions already endorsed. The European Union has an important arsenal in terms of European security legislation and tools. The weak point lies in a large part in their implementation on the ground, which is often still far from being up to what has already been decided. It should be remembered that since 1 December 2014 the Commission has only had the right to launch infringement proceedings against Member States which have not fully or correctly transposed our common rules in this area. There is a lot of talk, for example, about Schengen and often it is not spoken of, because Schengen, ladies and gentlemen, is not the problem - Schengen must be part of the solution. But before we think about the improvements we could make to the Schengen border code - the Commission is ready to take stock of it, when the time comes, the first step would be to make the most of the possibilities and flexibilities that exist under the current rules, for example the possibility of reintroducing in a framed and limited way controls at internal borders over time. We would rather act quickly on the basis of the existing rules, which allow it, than get lost in a legislative process that will last for years, with an uncertain outcome. Important work has already been started by the Commission in collaboration with the competent authorities of the Member States to facilitate the maximum exploitation of these possibilities. To conclude on this point, I do not think it is wise at this stage to concentrate our efforts on changing the current legal framework of the Schengen border code.  We will also have to finally move forward on the issue of the single European Passenger Record Registry (PNR). I believe that a motion of resolution will be put before Parliament after this debate, and I really want to stress that I welcome the work of Parliament, which is trying to play an important role as a facilitator, to find a solution to this problem; the Commission remains at the disposal of Parliament and the Council to participate in the search for a solution.  We need to strengthen the European Union's intelligence and analysis capabilities, including the creation within Europol of an integrated intelligence centre on threats related to terrorism and radicalisation, as well as making better use of existing structures and further improving exchanges between Member States, EU agencies and the intelligence analysis centre of the External Action Service. These are not new rules, new measures, but a certain level of trust between the Member States and the services concerned.  Of course, we must also focus our efforts on prevention, to counter the influence of radical movements on some of our citizens. It is nevertheless essential for European societies to understand why young people who were born here, who are part of our society, are tempted by a nihilistic ideology that incites them to arm themselves to attack in a murderous way the very society from which they come. It is still a very important issue for everyone here at European level. We have instruments to do this: we must have a network of alerts, establish a close dialogue with representatives of religions, make an effort to create a space of tolerance that Europe must give for a common European future. Once again, Europe, without tolerance, will not exist: it will be fragmented, it will be a Europe of confrontation.  I believe we are all in Minsk today. We all hope that it will be possible to find a solution or rather I feel that some, perhaps, are not there, but I believe that the vast majority of us want peace in Europe, we want a peaceful solution to the problems in Ukraine. Thursday's formal European Council will also be an opportunity to discuss Ukraine. The violence we witness on a daily basis condemns them in the strongest possible terms: we urge those responsible for the recent attacks to end hostilities, which have already claimed too many innocent victims. There can be no military solution to the situation in eastern Ukraine: the solution can only be political and is in accordance with international law, independence and sovereignty of Ukraine. It lies in the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. It is this crucial issue that the German Chancellor and the President of the French Republic are discussing today with Presidents Putin and I would also like to reiterate that the Commission is providing humanitarian support to Ukraine. My colleague Christos Styliamides was there recently to express the European Union's solidarity with the Ukrainian people. This year, the Commission will provide the country with an additional EUR 15 million, bringing the total humanitarian aid provided by the European Union and Member States since the beginning of the crisis to EUR 92 million.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, representatives of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. This week, before the discussions on the European Council, we feel that the challenges are major challenges. I believe that, above all, citizens expect clarity on the course that Europe is taking to respond to these challenges. The first major issue being discussed is the fight against terrorism. The terrorist attacks in Paris brutally pulled us out of the Christmas holidays and shocked us all. I would like to begin by expressing thanks and respect for the French on the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats; With what clarity and unity they oppose this struggle and say: \"We will not let our values be destroyed by terrorists!\", deserves all respect. We have to be self-critical. The terrorists are French, they also come from other nationalities. They are, by and large, European. That is why the question is how radicalisation comes about, an issue that must concern us. We need data to create the fight against terrorism. If data today means power and influence in the world, then the state must also be able to work with data. That is why we have always been in favour of the use of passenger data, of the use of PNR data sets, in order to make progress in the fight against terrorism – with a high European data protection standard, of course. We need data exchange. I would like to refer to what Mr Guy Verhofstadt said during the last debate. I hope that the Council will finally take action in the exchange of data between the authorities. It is easy to call for new data, but it is obviously extremely difficult between states to exchange the existing data properly. That is where the Member States have to deliver. The second major issue is Ukraine. The situation is serious. We now have thousands of dead, injured, enormous destruction – we have war in Europe. First of all, I would like to point out that the Russian propaganda we are seeing there is unbelievable – that we are being told that Russian soldiers are holidaying there, even though the OSCE makes it clear that it would not work without Russian supplies. Minsk was never respected. And the people who stand up for freedom and democracy in Ukraine are being called fascists. This is unacceptable. We must stand in the way of this. I would like to express my thanks to Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel, who are now giving diplomacy another chance. If the talks fail, Europe must also be able to impose tougher sanctions. The unity of Europe must not waver on this issue. I hope that the Heads of State or Government will do the same. The third major issue I would like to raise today is the issue of the bailout mechanism in Europe, in particular the handling of the election result in Greece. Everyone today underlines respect for the Greek electorate. On the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say that respect for the electorate means that all the agreements that have been reached so far can simply be thrown over the top? In future, can a Slovak Government, perhaps newly elected, or a New-elected Finnish Government simply overturn any concessions on payments for Greece? I say: no! Existing agreements must be respected by all. Tsipras must also learn this. Tsipras has simply lied to his voters. He has made promises that he will not be able to deliver on. We want Tsipras to make that clear and clear. Even more scandalous is the coalition partner ANGL, a right-wing populist force. I was surprised that, among other things, the GUE was not prepared to discuss here in the European Parliament that politicians who openly appear anti-Jewish openly stir up resentment against Jews, that we are obviously not allowed to discuss it here, because the Communists in particular believe that a pact with these people is perfectly fine simply because they then come to power as communists. This is unacceptable. Then there is the question: has the course been voted out? Let me just point out that Antonis Samaras has remained almost stable in Greece with his Nea Dimokratia. Our political power has achieved almost the same result as in the last elections. 65% of Greeks did not vote for SYRIZA. If we did not have these electoral structures in Greece, we would have a different result today. These are just figures that I am presenting here. I would simply like to point out that in Greece, before the election, we had exports of plus 8%, a Employment growth of plus 2.6%; private consumption has increased; we had a primary surplus in the budget. Antonis Samaras has left behind a country that has returned to growth after the difficulties of suffering the greek people. And Tsipras is destroying the trust that Antonis Samaras has built up within weeks. We believe that our path as the EPP is the right way forward – because Ireland is currently a locomotive in Europe, because Spain is currently a growth engine and because Italy and France are unfortunately God's brakes on growth in the European Union. That's why the only way to grow ...

Reforms, structural reforms and budgetary discipline are the right way to get states out of the crisis. This has been demonstrated by our states, the PPE-DE-governed states. I have only one expectation of Tsipras. When Mr Kenny took office in Ireland, the whole of Europe demanded that he accept the existing programme for Ireland as binding on its own. When Passos Coelho took office in Portugal, the whole EU demanded that he accept the existing programme for Portugal as the new Head of Government. Our simple demand, when Tsipras comes into office, is that the EU then demands that existing agreements be accepted as binding on him as well. No more and no less.

Spain and Greece are the countries with the highest unemployment rates in the euro area: 25% unemployment, more than 50% youth unemployment. It is difficult to tell the people of Greece and Spain that they are doing well and drawing up the list of good countries against bad countries is no use other than dividing Europe. If there is one thing we must avoid, seventy years after the end of the Second World War and twenty years after the end of the conflict in Yugoslavia, it is the return of war to Europe. History has taught us that conflicts are the poison of our continent and everything must be done to prevent this evil. As long as there is a window of negotiation and negotiation, we must move forward. Today is an important day in Minsk and we hope that a ceasefire will be imposed and that an agreement will be seeking that is based on the principle of Ukrainian territorial integrity, but also recognises Russia's role. Recognising that Russia is a global player does not mean accepting that every rule of international law can be transgressed. We cannot allow peace to be sabotaged. If Russia does not show itself to be cooperative, it will have to take responsibility for it. We do not agree to spread weapons at our borders. We must go down the road of increasing sanctions and aim to strike at the heart of Russian interests. At this time when the risk of conflict is looming, Europe must remain united. That is why I hope, as Vice-President Timmermans said, that the informal Council will send a message of solidarity and unity to the Greek people. We are aware of the enormous suffering paid for by the Greeks. Greece's lesson is: never again austerity, never again troika, which has completely got the recipe wrong. New, more democratic and transparent forms of accompaniment to Greece must be introduced. We call on the Council on Thursday to create the conditions for a short-term loan to Athens. We are not interested in names, we are interested in the substance: ensuring the functioning of the government in the coming months and freeing up resources to repair austerity failures. This loan must be accompanied by reasonable conditions. In Athens, we must call for a sensible fiscal effort and structural reforms that will defeat corruption and finally combat tax evasion. In the medium term, our group supports a programme of reforms and reconstruction between the European institutions, including Parliament, and the Greek authorities, with an ambitious plan for positive reforms, capable of restarting growth and investment. In return, we must be willing to discuss a remodulation of interest rates and debt maturities. On one principle, however, we must be clear: the debts incurred must be repaid; then we can discuss how, but there is no solidarity without seriousness. We want to help Greece, but the Greek Government must also help itself. It's no longer time for forcing and sentences to effect. And beware of fellow road users: no one allows themselves to bloodbath the new executive, but frankly allying with the nationalist right was a very bad signal. I will conclude on terrorism. There was a risk that our societies would be overwhelmed by fear, whereas the reaction of our fellow citizens was wise. Europe does not want to be held hostage by a climate of tension, it does not give in to blackmail by those who trade freedom for a little apparent security. The fight against terrorism requires us not to let our guard down, to give convincing answers such as those made by Vice-President Timmermans and the Representative of the Council. We are in for greater European cooperation between the intelligence services. On PNR, we confirm that we are ready to play our part, provided that fundamental freedoms are not touched. The priority attention mentioned by the Council representative on deradicalisation, the fight against social exclusion and education is very important. Then there is the external dimension. I would not like the very right attention paid to Ukraine to obscure the urgency of European action in the world. We cannot outre up foreign policy to raids by fighters and drones. We must be very tough against ISIS, but we must also act on the political causes that led to its roots in Iraq and Syria, as Mrs Mogherini is trying to do. Then there is Libya, a cultural land of extremism 300 km from our coasts, a country completely in disarray. The other day, and I will end here, more than 200 people died in Lampedusa. You can't make people die during the rescue. All this happens before our eyes because Triton is a mission This mission must be strengthened by means and means.

On the terror threat, most of Thursday’s Council will, rightly, be devoted to the issue of law enforcement and aspects of our response, internal security and the Passenger Name Record (PNR) scheme. I would like to thank the Presidency for the kind comments on the Kirkhope report. However, I have to say that it is shameful that the other group leaders want to undermine the report, as Mr Kirkhope is seeking to get the right balance between our civil liberties and our security. Let us also make sure that we do not ignore the other strand of this problem, namely – as, Mr Timmermans said – the drivers of radicalisation. Why are people from all types of background, some of them highly educated, killing other, innocent, people and falsely invoking the name of God? Why? It is a question I have been asked a lot recently, but there is no one path to radicalisation. There are various drivers, such as a search for identity among some second-generation and third-generation Muslims, the radicalisation of violent criminals in prison, giving them another violent cause to fight for, or the fact of radicals from other countries being given a platform for their extreme views in some of our communities. There are many paths. There is no easy answer. There is no silver bullet, metaphorically or literally, and most of the answers are actually to be found at local rather than EU level. However, at EU level we should not be afraid to discuss these issues in an open and frank manner, exchanging best practice and seeing what works best and what does not work in our countries. If terrorism is a threat in our midst, there is also a serious threat on our doorstep. On Ukraine, the ECR Group shares the concerns about the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding right under our noses but, frankly, only Vladimir Putin can put an end to this crisis. He must literally get his tanks off Ukraine’s lawn. Today’s meeting in Minsk is perhaps the last chance for a deal. However, we must be clear. We must seek a peaceful and political solution, but if Putin’s aggression continues then we must deploy every economic weapon available to us. In 21st century Russia, money talks. That is why it is unfortunate that in the EU we are not in a stronger position. There are no shortcuts to economic growth, no easy fixes for the eurozone and no alternatives to much-needed reform. Anyone who tells you there is a simple solution is simply not telling the truth. Frankly, the European Council needs to be honest about what economic and monetary union entails. If you want to keep the weaker economies in the eurozone, taxpayers in richer eurozone countries – Germany, the Netherlands, Finland – will have to pay for fiscal transfers to poorer eurozone countries, maybe forever. But those countries benefiting from the transfers must also understand the old saying that ‘he who pays the piper gets to call the tune’. As politicians, we should be straight about this, and let people make up their own minds. The voters made up their minds in Greece and they chose Syriza. You will not be surprised to hear that I disagree with their platform, but the people of Greece voted for it and we have to recognise that. However, the time for grandstanding on both sides is over. If Greece wants to discuss its sovereign debt with creditors in a mild-mannered way, it should get a fair hearing, but if Greece wants to splash the cash, it must understand that voters in the richer eurozone countries may want to show it the exit door. So this might be an informal Council but the subjects being discussed could not be more serious – tackling terrorism, tackling Putin and tackling the eurozone crisis. Let us all hope that the leaders at the European Council will make some headway and lead us to calmer waters.

I have read the draft statement. I hope that everybody has already read it. It is very disappointing. We can do better than what is in the draft statement of the informal Council. We have to use this momentum to repeat to some extent what we did after 9/11 and that was to launch a roadmap. We established the European Arrest Warrant and we need to do the same thing.  First of all, a PNR system. We have committed to do so, to work quickly on that, but only on a legally sound system. A system that contains the necessary safeguards and I hope that we can vote for that opinion now, with a huge majority, in a few hours’ time. But I must say to the President of the Council that the Council has to do its work too, because the main files are not blocked in Parliament. The main files on fighting terrorism are blocked in the Council at present: strengthening Europol – blocked in the Council; strengthening Eurojust – blocked in the Council; the Data Protection Directive – blocked in the Council. So what I hope is that this informal meeting will unblock these so that we can go forward.  Secondly, there also needs to be an in-depth discussion about the real thing to do, which is sharing information in the European Union, making of this intelligence service a Eurintel – a European intelligence service – because all the perpetrators in the Paris attacks were known. It is a question of sharing information. Finally, too, strengthening our external Schengen borders. It would be a huge mistake now to say that Schengen is the problem. No, Schengen is not the problem. as Mr Timmermans said, we need to strengthen control of our external borders by fully and systematically using the SES system. So that is my first appeal to you. The second appeal concerns Greece. My opinion is very clear because I followed the debate here between Mr Pittella and Mr Weber a little bit. Let us not rush on this. Let us first give the new Greek Government an opportunity to come forward with a plan, with in-depth reforms, because the people of Greece were right, naturally. They want a change, because neither Pasok nor Nea Demokratia was capable of changing anything because they are the source of the patronage system and the corruption in Greece.  So I am open to hearing Mr Tsiprasʼ proposals and to seeing what he can offer as in-depth reforms, and then we can talk about their debt. Not to first talk about the debt and then the reforms. That will never happen. First the reforms, then we can talk about that.  But there is one thing we will never accept from the new Greek Government: that they want to revive the ghosts of the past by asking for reparations from another country, a Member State, of the European Union. That is not the foundation of the European Union. The foundation of the European Union is not based on revenge. We made that mistake in Versailles, more than 80 to 90 years ago.  Mr Tsipras says he has a moral obligation to do that. Well, in my opinion, Mr Tsiprasʼ moral obligation is not to revive the ghosts of the past; his moral obligation is to work on the future of Greece and the European Union, just as our moral obligation too is to help Greece and to work on this future of the European Union. But certainly not to revive the ghosts of the past.  Finally, Ukraine. OK, we are going to deal with that later, talk about who is doing the job now – Hollande, Merkel, Tusk. The most important thing is that we have a lasting deal in Minsk. That is the most important thing. But to have a lasting deal in Minsk, I think we are obliged to have, within the European Union, a united and strong position. In negotiations with Mr Putin, the only thing that counts is for Europeans to have a united and strong position and, for me, that means three things.  First of all, let us help the Ukrainians with non-lethal means: satellite imaging, intelligence, cyber defence. Let us help them. Secondly, let us also think about new economic sanctions. Finally, let us be united with the United States. Do not let us know again the shame of Kosovo where it was the Americans who had to solve our problems on European soil because we did not have the courage, nor the means, to do so. So I hope that we have a firm position in Minsk, and a united position is the only chance we have to achieve a lasting deal in that most important conflict.

I come from this former Saxe-Coburg region. However, to come to the actual issue, the preparation of the Council summit for the day after tomorrow: it is a summit which takes place in a very special situation and which has a history. History has something to do with the fact that in recent months we have been in a fierce dispute over the future of the European Union. This is also made clear by various examples. The question is: how do we respond to the terrorist attacks in Paris, Belgium and elsewhere? Is our response really the appropriate one to give? Should it really focus on PNR, pnr and the like? Are we really convinced that a PNR agreement could actually prevent terrorist attacks? Is it really the case? In response to a question on the matter, Mr Biden himself acknowledged that the United States had no concrete evidence that PNR and widespread surveillance could actually help prevent terrorism, but that it was more or less a matter of determining who did what in the aftermath. Great! I do not think that is enough. We need further reflection. You will not be surprised that I will, of course, now focus on the issue of Greece. Mr Weber, it would be nice if you could listen to me, because you also made a comment on this earlier. First of all, I have to tell you that I understand very well – I understand it in the light of my own history and the collapse and also the failure of politics – that politicians find it difficult to admit the failure of policies that form their own foundation. And that we then try to deviate and develop strategies, to make claims, to create sideshows that have nothing to do with the issues we face and with the challenges we face. It is not a question of whether there are any problems between individual countries to resolve. This is about the future of the European Union. If you were to ask this question at long last, whether the austerity policy, whether the programme of the Federal Government of Germany has been the right answer over the years, whether what the EU institutions have done, what the troika has done, whether it has led to confidence in the European Union and its future. At the same time, we are facing a deep democratic crisis. And if we are not in a position, with the summit, with the eurogroup meeting, really to provide the first answers that we have really understood what is at stake, then we will all share responsibility for the fact that more and more people are doubting whether this can work. And now to ANEL. Mr Weber, I would like to thank Mr Weber for his work. There is one Member who has been elected to the European Parliament via ANEL. He is a member of the ECR. You will not say, as Chairman of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that the ECR is an anti-Semitic group. I don't think you're going to seriously say that! That is not what you are going to do. Please, think about what you are explaining here in the future!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by talking about security, recalling a basic principle of democracy that any law, any rule we adopt which, in itself, constitutes an obstacle to freedom, must be proportionate to the purpose pursued. We consider that the widespread monitoring of the company and, in this case, the establishment of a PNR file that would target everyone and where the data would be kept ad vitam, or at least for extremely long durations, is not proportional to the purpose pursued. Guy Verhofstadt has been precise enough in his criticisms, I will not repeat them here. I share them in full, including the appeal to the Council, which is indeed a bit hypocritical when we know that it is it that it is the Council that blocks most of the initiatives that would increase the real, not theoretical, security of our fellow citizens. First, the principle of proportionality, therefore. Mr. Timmermans, I have greatly appreciated - and I fully share - a central element of your speech. When you ask yourself: \"How is it that our societies have become a breeding ground for the seeds of hatred and violence sown by a few individuals? How is it that a number of our fellow citizens, people born here, may have proved sensitive to hate speech and violence?\", I think you are asking the fundamental question. This is not a fifth column parachuted out of I do not know which state would want us to harm; it is about our fellow citizens. I hear many elements of your speech and the Council's speech on our shared values, on our common life, on Europe as a space of tolerance. I fully share your concern when you say that when it comes to a community here in Europe starting to question its future as a community, Europe has no future. You mentioned the Jewish community, and I share your concern in that regard. But what about Muslim communities, which are permanently discriminated against in most European countries? Not everywhere, because not all Member States have the same attitude on this issue. Discrimination in hiring, in the education system, in access to culture, economic discrimination... What problems do these communities face when they feel they have no future in Europe? What about the 27 million unemployed and tens of millions of working poor? What about the 125 million Europeans facing poverty and precariousness on a daily basis? What happens when all our citizens feel that this society is not acting in their favour, that this society is no longer theirs? What do I mean by the Council and the Commission? I hear about structural reforms. Reforms aimed at cutting public spending, including education spending, labour income and social security. In short, reforms which, on top of that, continue to make tax competition a dogma and are extremely chilly , as your colleague Commissioner Hill still demonstrates, when it comes to seriously tackling tax evasion and evasion. In short, a policy mix whose result is a permanent increase in exclusion and inequality. Madam Minister, what Europe needs is not a new positive narrative. Our citizens do not have to make a beautiful speech. What they want to see is action, a radical political shift that places at the heart of the European project the objective that Europe has always wanted to pursue: to be an area of prosperity shared - and shared by all, not just a minority of our fellow citizens.

In the wake of the historic Greek elections, there are big questions, not just about the future of the euro area but actually about the future of the European project itself.  There is a great game of poker taking place for the future of this currency. On the one hand we have the EU institutions. Now however much my warnings over the years may have upset people, when I said that the EU would crush and kill and destroy nation-state democracy, I think the behaviour by the key players since the Greek elections justifies everything I have said.  We heard the German Finance Minister, Mr Schäuble, saying that elections change nothing and Mr Juncker – who is not here today, which is disappointing – ought to be hanging his head in shame or perhaps he is busy getting his euros out of Greece, I have no idea. Mr Juncker said that there can be no democratic choice against the European Treaties.  So there it is, folks. It does not matter how you vote. It does not matter what government you elect, these Treaties are designed to be there forever and agreements by previous governments bind parliaments that come for years and years afterwards. What it means is that the European project is, in fact, the very antithesis of the democratic principle. I think these comments, frankly, are disgusting. I guess we are all asking the question of who will blink first.  On the other side, we have got this new, radical left-wing Greek Government. I was not quite sure what to make of them until I saw last week, ambling up Downing Street, Yanis Varoufakis. There he was with his leather bomber jacket and his blue shirt hanging out of the front of his trousers, with his shaven head, hands in pockets, looking a bit like an off-duty nightclub bouncer. I am not normally a fan of Marxist academics, but having seen this fellow, I suspect that perhaps he is the real deal.  At least, I hope he is, because what is at stake – as is clear from the comments we have had from Germany and from people in this Chamber this morning – what is at stake is clear: do the Greek elections mean anything? Yes or no? I hope the Greeks stand firm, whatever the consequences. If they do, the free world will applaud them.

I am grateful that the Council and also the Commission have now presented very specific measures.

I am grateful that the political groups have agreed on the issue of the PNR to make some progress. My second comment is that what has been discussed here on the question of economic and monetary policy, stability policy, particularly in relation to Greece, is already partly adventurous. I really have to say that. Is it not normal for a new government to be treated in the same way as all other governments so far? When the Greek Government takes office here, it has to say to the Irish, Spanish or Portuguese Governments, just as it used to, whether it says 'yes' or 'no' to the existing treaties. What is not normal about this? Is it not perfectly normal to expect someone who receives financial support and solidarity to be prepared to accept that one looks at whether what has been promised is being fulfilled? That is what we call the troika. From me, you can all call it completely different. That's what I'm sick of. But it is clear, Mr Pittella! In this respect, I do not understand at all that there must be supervision, control and agreement on whether what has been discussed is complied with. A little more clearly: Mr Pittella, I am extremely surprised that you say: never again austerity! Do you want to speak in Europe in the future to those who waste the money? That cannot be true! That cannot be the intention you are presenting here! So I expect those who get help to provide their compensation. Now I would like to know how you tell the Italian citizens.

The second objective, in my view, is not only to carry out attacks on people, but also, especially here in the European Union, in the Member States, to commit attacks on the democratic system, the rule of law and personal freedom. If we want to fight terrorism now, it is a very fine line to go down a path that does not go in that direction that terrorists want. We ourselves should not restrict our freedom, nor should we ourselves ensure that the rule of law is dismantled. It's a big, difficult challenge. If some Members now think that data must be collected without hindrance, I do not know whether that is the solution. Perhaps we have already collected enough data, perhaps we have too few officials who can evaluate this data. Perhaps we have too few police officers on the streets because security has been broken. Perhaps too few people in Europe have a viable prospect in front of them because they are unemployed because they have no education. We need to discuss all this.

I ask you, I have no doubt that today, as members of the European Union, our task is to help Ukraine at all costs and to ensure that Ukraine maintains its territorial integrity. Let us remember that this is not only a matter of Donbass, but also of Crimea, which has already been seized by Russia. I am very concerned about some of the voices that are falling here that speak almost directly: you have to get along with Russia at all costs, because it is a matter of economic interests. I would like to stress once again: there are no economic interests that would allow us, as honest people, to sell Ukraine.  These negotiations that are taking place today, in which the whole of the European Union does not really participate, but are attended by Germany and France, I think vividly that some people are reminded not so much of the 'Normandy formula' as they used to be of the 'Yalsa formula'. We must not, ladies and down today, allow us not to be jointly and severally represented. I ask, where is President Donald Tusk? Yesterday, Mrs Mogherini said that the 'Normandy formula' had already been the subject of Council conclusions. Then I ask – because I did not hear the answer yesterday – what is the legitimacy, what is the negotiating mandate of Mrs Merkel and Mr Hollande? What are they supposed to negotiate and what are the assumptions? This interests me very much because, as a Pole, I do not agree to sell the Ukrainian state in exchange for some cloudy economic interests. I would like to emphasise this with full force, because I do not think that there are any concerned fellow Members from Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, Slovakia or Hungary in this House. Please bear in mind that, as far as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania are concerned, we are talking about a war that is happening just outside our borders. We should be involved in these negotiations. What worries me is that Polish government has put this issue before.

It does not mean that we can stretch the rule of law and fit in all the measures that we like; it means governments cannot have unlimited and unchecked powers, and it seems that many people have forgotten that. ALDE is pleased that we have reached a compromise on counter-terrorism.

We need security measures but they must be tailor-made and evidence-based, not based on assumptions, ideology or gut feeling. ALDE will not side with the trigger-happy cowboys who support any repressive measure without evidence. Nor will ALDE side with those who, in a kneejerk reflex, oppose any security measure, equally without evidence.

The Ukrainian question, the fight against terrorism and the crisis of economic and monetary union are a matter for us and they commit us far beyond their respective technical plans. They ask us about our determination to give shape to the founding values of the European Union and about the concrete ability to propose credible solutions. As far as monetary union is concerned, how can we deny that the Greek question is increasingly a measure of the meaning of this Union? I believe that not only Greece but also the many difficulties that other states are struggling with as a result of the austerity policies imposed in the name of a genuine economic and monetary union show that Europe cannot solve the problem of economic governance in the terms in which it is placed. The solution will not come from technical or financial engineering reasoning. The solution can only be given economic value to our common desire to achieve the process of European unification in real difficulties. In other words, by founding, justifying and disseminating a vision of Europe that will make it possible to have a clear picture on the horizon of what is valuable and what is not, what makes sense and what does not, that can put the dignity of the person back at the centre of every decision. The fight against terrorism is a challenge that we cannot escape, and we must respond to it in a complete way, not limited to the internal security aspect alone. We must be able to respond with a broad, profound and not hasty strategy. Today, our founding values are subordinate to the economic dimension, in the belief that their role is secondary or even exhausted.

These three points of the forthcoming informal summit are seemingly different, but in fact they are closely interconnected. It is devoted to the security of the European Union, the Member States and citizens in a broad way. President Weber said that we need a clear course in this regard. Threats come from different sides, but their sources lie in an unstable situation, particularly in close proximity to the European Union. In order to counter terrorism, we need efforts that lead to closer coordination of security services. We have had information many times after the events, after the terrorist acts, that the knowledge of their perpetrators was, perhaps, poorly coordinated. Let us remember, however, that we cannot agree to too far-reaching restrictions on citizens' rights, because this alone would also mean a victory for terrorists. As we fight for our values, for freedom, let us also remember that citizens have the right to freedom from fear. Commissioner Timmermans rightly says that freedom is impossible without security. In this context, we must work on effective solutions.  The President of the Council invited the President of Ukraine to the Summit. This is very important, because there is a drama taking place in the east of Ukraine, which also affects our situation, both because of political, economic and economic issues, but also because of the great humanitarian crisis that continues there. We have some hopes for what is happening today with the Minsk meeting. But will these solutions stop this escalation? We need to think about how we can also defend ourself against the disinformation that flows from the East. We all know the media conveying a distorted picture of reality.

The Greek people were brought to the point of despair, and we need to provide a better solution for the Greek people. This solution should be based on a credible compromise.

We need reforms, but the relevant ones are tax collection, public administration and a welfare system with real universal and sustainable coverage, and most of all we need a big push for good investment projects and job creation. What really matters is the method. We should close these Troika methods. We should have a real democratic deal, involving the European institutions with the Greek population, and we also need to make sure that, overall, the Economic and Monetary Union is completed in such a way that it becomes a space not of divergence but of convergence: economic convergence, social convergence and also political convergence.

Part of the truth is that we are clearly saying that there will be no military solution to this conflict. The supply of weapons will not help to defuse the conflict, but will have the opposite effect. The truth is that our objective remains to integrate Russia into a pan-European political, economic and security structure. But it must be clear that this presupposes the resolution of the Ukraine conflict. Without substantial progress, there can therefore be no easing of sanctions. I would like to make two requests on the sanctions. On the one hand, it is not enough for sanctions to extend the list of names for any ban until we have the last company chief on this list, but there must then be more substantial things and economic things. I believe that this is part of the fact that we are not calling for weapons to be supplied. The second request, you say, is what sanctions will be lifted and when if there is substantial progress. This form of predictability is good for all concerned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 62, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς (ECR). -", "mepid": "125069", "text": "    Mr President, mr President, mr President-in-Office of the Council, mr President-in-Office of the Council, mr President-in-Office Weber that his attempt to slander the Greek people and the political parties of the current ruling majority will not pass.

First of all, the reforms implemented through the roadmap have contributed to the stability of Europe, and I guess we can be proud of them. In particular, the changes in banking supervision and regulation and in crisis management are key for the future of Europe. In my view, the fiscal crisis management system works better than we have seen from the experience of Greece. It has helped many countries to make a turnaround from serious economic crisis to growth. Let me remind our Greek colleagues that, for the time being, the cost of servicing the Greek debt, given the generous support for the credit risk, is lower than for many countries in the European Union, including some donor countries. The issue of the cost of servicing the debt is crucial for Europe and we should do our best to keep this cost down. Sound fiscal management, following the rules and good crisis management are the way forward. The last part of the roadmap concerns fiscal capacity. I am not sure if this is feasible for the time being, as there is significant divergence among those who are supposed to be using this fiscal facility and those who are financing it about how it should work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 88, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Pervenche Berès (S&amp;D). -", "mepid": "1985", "text": "   Mr President Herman van Rompuy, before becoming President of the European Council, had proposed the holding of an extraordinary European Council in February 2010 to discuss economic governance.

These issues, which seem to be able to be postponed until the next day, must in fact now be dealt with as a matter of urgency.

But there is one other thing that worries me a lot: it is what will be of the Union's foreign policy, with this government and with these visions. We are in this very serious problem of Ukraine, and the first gesture that the Greek government has is to support Russia and its way of looking at the Ukrainian problem. This is extremely worrying. It is not only the will ingness not to pay, the will to break the commitments that concern us. It is a whole way of being typical of the extreme left, which will call into question what are the values of the European Union, its values of rule of law and its values of fundamental rights.

Firstly, we need to learn the lessons of what has happened with regard to the anti-terrorism part of what will be discussed at the informal Council; and secondly we must stay united. Why should we be united on the anti-terrorism fight? First of all, as many people have said, while we are dealing with the Passenger Name Record (PNR) scheme, there is almost a disproportionate concentration on it. Parliament has moved swiftly on this, so we have shown our commitment today, and within a few minutes we will vote on PNR. Yes, it is controversial because the last terrorist outrage, before what we saw on the streets of Paris, was in 2005 in London, and we have since produced the Data Retention Directive, and we have to learn the lessons of what happened. We need legislation which is worthy of our citizens and worthy of this House, and which will stand the tests of time and the European Court of Justice. We have to learn the lessons. So Parliament will move swiftly, but that means that we must be united, and that the Council must do its job. It means that Europol and the Europol Regulation must happen. It means that the data regulation package, which underpins so much of what will happen with PNR, must also happen. You do your job, Council, and the Commission – so eloquently represented by Mr Timmermans – will be there to help us through this, through the informal Council and through our job. That means being unified because, at the end of the day, terrorism is an attack on our security and an attack on life, but if we are united we will have helped our citizens through a profoundly challenging moment in our history. We cannot do that if we do not see the institutions working together. What will that mean in terms of learning other lessons? It means that the causes of radicalisation, and all the other tools in our toolbox aside from PNR, must be our business, as we learn the lessons and cooperate. If our citizens see this, they will see first that we have learned the lessons and then that we can remain united.

I have a few comments to make in reaction to what was said. First of all, do not get me wrong: the Passenger Name Record (PNR) scheme is not the solution to all our problems. PNR is no more than a building block in a huge construction that we need in order to fight radicalisation and terrorism in Europe. Mr Lamassoure hit the nail on the head when he said that we need a European PNR scheme because the alternative will be that Member States will take individual steps, and that is not a good alternative. However, I also believe that we need to put more effort into improving the situation of data protection at European level. Here again, I believe it is better to act collectively in order to make sure that our citizens’ fundamental rights are guaranteed at European level. That is why I believe we need increased efforts on data protection reform. Moving on to the issue of Greece, so much was said about that, and I want to repeat that the Commission is open for dialogue with Greece – on the basis of respect for the Greek people – to look for common solutions. I have to tell you that I was thinking back exactly 40 years to when I was 13 years old and one of my first moments of political consciousness was that I saw the Greek people getting rid of a very ugly military regime that had trampled on their freedoms and rights. From that moment on, we saw European solidarity. It was the efforts of the Council of Europe at the time that helped the Greek people rid themselves of dictatorship. It is too easy to say that there has been no solidarity with the Greek people since then because, for me personally, those 40 years have been marked by the fact that there was a conscious decision by the Greek people for Europe and a conscious decision by Europe to stand next to Greece: to reform and to improve the situation of its citizens. That, in my view, has not changed. So even though there might be a huge debate about the merits of the programmes and the merits of what was done in the past, I would not accept a caricature narrative that the people elsewhere in Europe have not shown solidarity with Greece in the past couple of years. It is not right to say that. There has been a show of solidarity, including by other people in Europe living in conditions not much better than those of the Greeks themselves. That solidarity – if it is up to the Commission – will not change. Moving finally to the issue of fundamental values – and I do not like to put frames on political parties and call them ‘extreme left’ or ‘extreme right’ – let us look at facts and at declarations. It is not, I believe, asking too much of Ms Zimmer to look too at certain utterances by a coalition partner of one of her parties, in this case in Greece. Is it not part of the duty of a coalition partner to tell another partner that, in Europe, we do not say that Jews do not pay taxes? It is not a contribution to tolerance or respect in Europe to say such things. We in Europe, in the European Parliament, in European political parties, do not accept homophobia as an institutional element in another political party. We will oppose that in discussion with coalition partners. I do not think this is too much to ask of a political party which calls itself left-wing. It is not too much to ask if you look back at our European history. It is not too much to ask if you look at what the colonels and their regime did to the Greek people 40 years ago.

Divisions of views among the political groups reflect general divisions of views in Europe, and this is clear evidence that we need to continue our discussions to find a compromise. I have listened attentively to the debate and will ensure that the issues and points raised will be relayed to President Tusk. Meanwhile, I will use the opportunity to reply to some points raised during the debate. As we are short of time, unfortunately, I will not be able to reply to all the points. Many of you referred to the situation in Greece. The Eurogroup is meeting tonight and will address this question. I understand that the Eurogroup President will brief leaders tomorrow. It will also be the first time Prime Minister Tsipras meets his European Council counterparts. The Eurogroup then meets again on 16 February. All in all, we agree that existing agreements should be respected. At the same time, I believe we all agree that Greece is facing profound challenges. It is important to find a solution that will bring Greece back to the path of economic growth. I also believe you will all agree that a solution found for Greece will have to be accepted by all parties. I will dare to compare the EU to a marriage. You bind yourself to someone for better or for worse. You have your disagreements, but in a good marriage you survive the storm, being stronger and wiser, and so should the Union. Exclusion will not lead to a solution. We should not lose sight of our common goals: stability and unity. We have heard many critical remarks addressed to Greece this morning. However, Greece is not the only country in the EU to have a high debt level. The level of public debt in the eurozone in general is very high and it is rising. It is expected to be more than 94% this year – well over the 60% laid down in our Stability and Growth Pact. High debt levels hamper growth in the European Union. We all agree that bringing back growth is the most important challenge we face today. The right policy mix is the answer. The commitment to boosting investment is a step in the right direction. We need to accelerate the implementation of structural reforms in order to strengthen Europe’s competitiveness and growth. It is essential that our public spending should stay on a sustainable path. Today we discussed possible steps to fight against terrorism. I would like to refer once again to the informal Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) ministerial meeting in Riga on 29 January and to the General Affairs Council meeting yesterday, where Member States reiterated the need to put in place an EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) system. We, as the Presidency, are convinced that you understand how crucial PNR information is in detecting travel movements and patterns, and, in particular, monitoring and identifying foreign terrorist fighters and returnees. We believe that the growing number of Member States setting up national PNR systems is in itself a valid reason for harmonisation at EU level. If we fail to do this it might lead to incompatible national systems with very different levels of data protection. We understand that this is a difficult issue for some of you, but we are encouraged by the more positive comments made by several Members. We recognise the importance of the data protection package and the relevant instruments. We believe that, in the digital age, a single data protection regulation will strengthen data protection in Europe. The Latvian Presidency will devote significant efforts to the regulation of data protection, with the aim of achieving a general approach during the JHA Council in March. At the same time we recognise the difficulties of the remaining issues and of horizontal questions. Once a general approach is reached, we will start a trialogue with Parliament. I fully share the view expressed by Mr Weber and Mr Kamall that we need to tackle the problem of propaganda and radicalisation. To address the factors underlying radicalisation we shall seek to develop a comprehensive cross-sectoral approach involving all the policies concerned, including measures to promote a culture of inclusion and tolerance through, for instance, education, youth, social and regional policies. The issue of communication in the context of combating foreign terrorist fighters is challenging and sensitive. We all recognise that the internet plays a central role in radicalisation and in the recruitment of potential foreign terrorist fighters. Distinguished Members, as many of you mentioned, all our thoughts are today with Ukraine. We are, I hope, in a negotiations window. Today further talks are due to take place in Minsk. It is difficult to discuss this today as the situation is so fluid. Obviously the Council and all the EU institutions support the ongoing diplomatic efforts and I hope they will deliver progress for the population on the ground in Eastern Ukraine and in a wider perspective.  There is no alternative to a diplomatic solution to the crisis, based on respect for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The EU is ready to assist in these diplomatic efforts. Finally, I would like to use the opportunity provided by this morning’s debate to express our deep appreciation of the personal efforts made during the last few days by Mr Hollande and Ms Merkel in seeking a peaceful solution for Ukraine. We remain united in our efforts to withstand the aggressor. Europeans should not forget the tragic historic events of the 20th century. In this regard, our discussion tomorrow will continue in the presence of Mr Poroshenko, who has been invited by President Tusk to the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government. Honourable Members, the Council will work speedily with the other Union institutions to make sure that the EU leaders’ policy guidelines are acted upon.

In this context, \"illegality\" originates from \"violations of custodial rights\", and \"home\" is defined as the child's regular residence. As he implies, \"violation of custodial rights\" is a phenomenon of international child abduction that generally involves illegal alienation, which creates conflicts of jurisdiction of laws, multiple bodies and jurisdictions. They can come up with seemingly reasonable but also competing custody decisions with geographically restricted application. Such a result often negatively affects a child's approach and relationship with half their family and can cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, which violates numerous children's rights, and can also cause serious psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family.  The harmful consequences of such treatment for children and families have been demonstrated in several studies, and international child abduction has been marked as a form of parental alienation and child abuse.

It is its objective to ensure the immediate return of children unlawfully transferred to or wrongly held therein and to enforce effectively in the other Contracting States the rights of custody and visitation existing in a Contracting State. These are fair and relevant objectives. The Seychelles deposited the instrument of adhering to the Convention.  The EU now has powers in the field of the Convention, in accordance with Decision 1/13 of the Court of Justice of the EU.

Such situations are helped by the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Children often become a means of dealing with accounts between spouses or former partners with different citizenships. Consequently, the national courts, often outside the European Union, often grant custody rights to the parent who is a citizen of the state to which that court is competent, thanks to certain national tendencies. The Convention resolves such situations in such a way that the assignment of the child is decided by the court in the State where he or she resides, regardless of where one of the parents was brought. The EU now has exclusive external competence in this area, as confirmed by the Court of Justice. This means that Member States are no longer acting at their discretion. It is therefore necessary to adopt a Council Decision requiring Member States to accept in their own territory the accession of the Republic of Seychelles to the Convention and thus the effective entry into force of the Convention between the European Union and that State.

The biggest problem in such cases is the national nature of the legal system of states. Often, the courts of both States concerned consider the case to be within their competence and award the right to custody to a parent of their own nationality. The purpose of the Convention is to resolve such situations at international level by determining that the law of the State in which the child is resident applies and that the case falls within the jurisdiction of the court of that State.

Nothing is worse for a child than a break-up of his parents' relationship. To make matters worse, parents sometimes start a dispute over the child, which is always at the expense of the child.

Thus, when Parliament \"believes that the loss of the right to vote is tantamount to punishing nationals who have exercised their right of free movement in the European Union\" and \"in no case can the loss of the right to vote apply to European elections and asks the Commission to ensure that no Member State foresees this possibility\".

Justified steps to maintain marine fish stocks will result in a continuous and significant reduction in the amount of marine fish fish fished. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural values of these areas, unlike marine aquaculture areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

Indoctrination and promotion are based on the latest technologies of modern IT communication where it is no longer local but global. Also special is the process of going on temporary warfare and the impact of such war and prisons on the recruitment of new terrorists.

Is this an admission of impotence on the part of the European Union and a lack of independence from the United States?

Parliament's resolution urges the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to this effect, which will require the origin marking of meat in processed foods in order to create greater transparency throughout the food supply chain and to provide better information to EU consumers.

Fraud always presupposes the breach of existing rules. Better regulations can, however, at least ensure that the perpetrators can be more easily tracked down and taken into civil and, if necessary, criminal liability.

Because there are different cultures in the EU for dealing with meat, which refuse to accept the Union's efforts at harmonisation. These cultural differences cannot be regulated by a regulation or directive. On a more fundamental level, I doubt that the Union should have competence in the field of public health and food safety.

Let me express at the outset my outrage at the brutal murder of Kayla Mueller, a dedicated aid worker, by ISIS terrorists. Our thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of Kayla Mueller. Let me repeat in the strongest way possible: the European Union is committed to the fight against Daesh (ISIS) and other terrorist groups which threaten regional and global stability. We must redouble global efforts to put an end to these murders and to find a political solution to the regional conflicts. Only one word can describe the humanitarian situation in Iraq and Syria: devastation! As a result of both crises there are more than 20 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. This number includes 3.8 million refugees in neighbouring countries: this is a plus of 75% compared to a year ago. The emergence of ISIS has complicated further the dynamics of the two crises. 3.6 million people are trapped in areas controlled by this and other armed opposition groups. Access for aid workers is heavily restricted and many times becomes impossible. The continuation of our aid to those most in need is essential. Showing solidarity with Syria’s neighbours is a must. That is why two weeks ago I visited Lebanon and Jordan, together with Commissioner Hahn. These are the two countries which, along with Turkey, have undertaken a huge burden in terms of refugees, especially taking into consideration the size of their population and the fragility of their political situation. We wanted to send a message of our ongoing strong support, especially to the most vulnerable – women, children, the elderly. Let me say once again: we cannot allow a lost generation of Syrian children. These are messages I repeated previously in Turkey with Federica Mogherini and Johannes Hahn. These are the same message our High Representative conveyed during her mission to Iraq. For my part, I announced a new EUR 136 million aid package to cover urgent needs in Syria and neighbouring countries. This brings the total EU humanitarian funding up to EUR 817 million. These messages of support were very well received. When I visited Syrian refugees in Lebanon, I saw at first hand the human dimension of this tragedy. I met women with six or eight children whose husbands had disappeared in Syria. I met a 14-year-old boy supporting alone his mother and six brothers and sisters. These are the real faces of war. These people and more depend on our help, not only on words of sympathy but on tangible assistance. And this is precisely what we are delivering. They were very grateful for what our assistance has done to improve their living conditions, for example by upgrading the local water system to allow access to fresh water. But the painful truth is that the needs are not at all matched by the available resources. Our funding also contributes to the stability of these countries and the wider region. It is in our own interest to continue to support these countries. This goes beyond humanitarian assistance. We need a comprehensive response, pulling together all European Union instruments: humanitarian aid, relief, longer-term stabilisation. To that end, the Commission is taking its responsibility. It agreed a EUR 1 billion aid package for Syria and Iraq for the current year and next year as part of the joint communication which was adopted last week. This package strengthens Europe’s political credibility. It shows the EU’s leadership. It will be a testimony to the EU’s commitment during the Kuwait III pledging conference in late March. We count now on our Member States to match this amount. This package will be to a large extent about humanitarian assistance, recovery and stabilisation measures. But this alone will not put an end to the conflict. Both crises require a political solution. There is a need for measures addressing the root causes of the conflict. That is why the communication includes counter-radicalisation and counter-terrorism measures. This is why education is an important component of the allocated funding. The barbaric murder of innocent people by ISIS and the brutal attacks in Paris last month further stress the need for a narrative to prevent and counter violent extremism and to counter terrorism. Such measures have been included in the communication. Most of all, we should continue to advocate the respect of international humanitarian law and the humanitarian principles, and the protection of civilians and relief workers. These are our common universal values. They guide our work and enable humanitarian workers to save lives. We will need your support to achieve our goals.

I believe that we, as the European Union, must assume this responsibility, as a free world. I do not believe that the 60 coalition partners can do this alone.

In Syria, after Assad's violence against his own people, da'esh (Islamic State) violence followed in front of a population that was forced to leave their homes and live in refugee conditions. In Iraq, millions of people were confronted with the consequences of the war. This year alone, more than 1.8 million people have experienced the effects of da'esh intervention, but, we must admit, there are also our mistakes, of the West, in the way we have strategically approached or failed to strategically approach this region, at least from the point of view of our interests. In the face of so many tragedies, our words cannot help much, but I can help the European Commission and the international community to do three things that I think are essential: a strategy to stabilise the region where local and regional actors are vital, as my distinguished colleague from the EPP, Mr Brok, said, we must think beyond prejudice and cliché , that local and regional actors are essential in stabilisation, an urgent strategy to meet the desperate needs of the population under refugee conditions and three, a strategy for the post-conflict evolution of this area, which risks becoming a true humanitarian desert.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2987, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, the humanitarian crisis in Iraq and Syria has reached catastrophic proportions, with an estimated 200 000 documented killings in the conflict so far. Clearly the Syrian Assad regime is at the root of the problem, but most recently the existential threat to the region and its minority communities, such as the Christians, Mandaeans, Yazidis, Shia Muslims and LGBTI communities, has come from the barbarous and fanatic so-called Islamic State.  Therefore my group welcomes the most recent Jordanian and UAE escalated air force response against ISIS following the horrific murder of a captured pilot. It has been some six months now since the American President Obama gathered together around 60 countries into a military coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS. In my mind, the three main target priorities for the coalition must be to interdict and destroy IS money-raising facilities, such as oil installations, and destroy their ammunition dumps and their training camps. Of the more than 3 000 European fighters with IS, sadly over 500 come from my country, the United Kingdom. The UK is a major military power so we must do more from my country to step up the efforts and, along with all the EU states, adopt an uncompromising approach towards EU citizens who have gone abroad to join ISIS and other militant Jihadi groups. We must also coordinate intelligence gathering and sharing and ensure that the laws are in place in our Member States to prosecute those who have committed atrocities, including kidnappings, bombings, false religious conversions and ritual execution of hostages in cold blood.  I would like to take this opportunity also to thank and congratulate the Kurdish Peshmerga and salute their amazing courage and bravery, which has been so evident with the reports confirming their resilience and protection of innocent civilians such as Yazidis, following the recent attacks on them by ISIS, and helping the YPG liberate Kobani in Syria.

On top of the Assad regime’s ongoing use of violence, including the use of barrel bombs against their own Syrian citizens, Daesh (IS) has added new dimensions of unbearable horror and suffering to millions of people’s lives – people who want a future for their children, safety and freedom, just like you and I. Daesh’s barbaric violence sent two million Iraqis on the run in 2014 alone. We saw them with our own eyes as we visited northern Iraq, but most areas throughout Iraq are not even accessible to humanitarian aid organisations because they are so violent. And we see a downward spiral of despair and suffering that, in turn, helps the success of recruiters for jihadist organisations. Now minorities are being specifically targeted in a way that can only be seen as attempted ethnic cleansing. Christians, Yazidis, Kurds, Shabak and others, but most of all Iraqis, are in a very bad situation, and their ill-treatment, like that of LGBT people, must stop. For girls and women who are violently abused by militants, there is no specific psychological help. For youth, there is mostly no education. So, I ask you, when does the risk of a lost generation turn into a sombre reality? We cannot allow this to happen. The situation of refugees and internally displaced persons is already dire.

It is important that we realise that the so-called Islamic State is as much a consequence as a cause of how we came to be here. The disastrous intervention in Iraq – and I very much echo a previous speaker’s comments – created the conditions for instability and radicalisation. The politicians responsible for that disastrous, illegal intervention should hang their heads in shame. The situation in Syria was further exacerbated by those conditions and was ignited, as the resolution also highlights, by the plethora of dreadful abuses by the Assad regime, which themselves feed and fuel the conditions in which extremists can thrive. Those conditions have created a flood of refugees which is almost impossible to cope with, greater than the population of Scotland and threatening to trip the neighbouring countries into anarchy as well. The resolution also takes account of the dreadful actions of Islamic State, but in part 3, I believe, we indicate a reasonable way out.

We cannot act alone, we cannot act in isolation, we must bring together even more, we must act to fight terrorism because the threat - and this is what makes this war so complex - is not only external, but also internal.

In other times, as we know, information on the violence committed by the bloodiest regimes on the planet has always reached us in a fragmented and discontinuous way. Often those same regimes concealed the atrocities and human rights violations they committed. Today we are faced with a completely opposite reality: ISIS does not hide torture, beheadings, violence and mass rape, on the contrary, it exhibits them; it does not deny the barbarity of its terrorists, but trumpeting it before the world by imposing Sharia law and the cruelty of its illegitimate courts. Its victims are Muslims and Christians, children and women, soldiers and civilians, people of all creeds and races.  Therefore, faced with this appalling challenge launched against humanity as a whole, Europe must have its own strong common strategy and is called upon to do so immediately, in all its national and international for a, overcoming all divisions within it. We must do this because before we are popular, socialists, communists, liberal democrats, nationalists or Eurosceptics, we are all people animated by a profound, inescapable, absolute conviction: the one that, faced with the alternative between good and absolute evil, between life and death, between respect for human rights and their denial, we always choose and will choose the good, life and respect for the rights of every human being.

I have come very critical of the insufficient and misdirected support that the European Union provides in the vital fight against the common enemy. Through Iraq and Syria passes the front line against terrorism, which during our visit was brutally attacking in Paris.  The European Union must build and coordinate an effective strategy to support the eradication of the Islamic State. It must articulate the military support provided by some Member States, strengthen support for the Peshmerga who in Iraqi Kurdistan and Syria are fighting against terrorist forces. It must exercise its political influence with regional powers to prevent them from channeling funding, arms and logistical support into DAESH. The initiative of such coordination must be based on the High Representative, exercising its powers within the framework of the common security and defence policy. As much as some Member States shudder, they have to be confronted with their responsibilities. Only by facing DAESH in Iraq and Syria can we in fact preserve our security. There radicalisation is nourished on European soil. We will have more terrorist attacks in Europe and beyond against European citizens and interests.  At the humanitarian side too, we have to do more and better to support the people. In Member States that, for example, give selective visas to Christians, it is better if they invest in humanitarian support and development so that Christians, Yazidis and other minorities not only have the schools missing in refugee camps but feel they have a future in Iraq. For them, for the people and for their pre-Islamic millennial cultures, as the Goth and Assyrian priests have told us. It was also better for them to work to help free the young women and children trafficked and enslaved by the terrorists and to take in those who managed to escape and who need treatment. This urgently needs a representation of the European Union in Erbil.

Islamic State, and, of course, Iran has also been associated with the Assad regime in Syria, another catalyst for the emergence of the Islamic State. Not to mention Iran's connection to Hezbollah in Lebanon or its recent activities in Yemen. I think we must also have the courage to say that the solution to the situation in this region will be to reduce Iran's influence in the region. So it means that we cannot regard Iran as our ally in the fight against the Islamic State. We cannot accept any offers of exchange of support for concessions such as iran's nuclear program, and we should, above all, seek to reduce Iran's influence in Iraq.

Yemen occupies a strategic position along the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. Every day, hundreds of ships headed to Europe pass through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. Terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) increasingly represent a direct threat to European citizens. It is in our own interest to stand by the aspirations of the Yemeni people for a stable and accountable state, preserving the territorial integrity of the country. When we look back four years ago, Yemen initiated a remarkable transition process, with people taking to the streets calling for dignity, social justice, and their legitimate political and socio-economic rights. Ever since, the EU has stood by Yemen and its people, fully supporting its demands for democratic legitimacy, accountable and participatory public institutions, and a better life for all. Yemenis look to the EU to continue supporting their aspirations, at a moment when the promises of the ‘Arab uprisings’ are in danger of being forgotten. Today, Yemen’s transition is at grave risk. Its daring economic and fiscal difficulties and persisting security challenges are now coupled with the danger that expeditious solutions might lead the country to more turmoil and to the collapse of state authority. The intensification of terrorist attacks in Yemen, including by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), cannot be left unchecked. We condemn such terrorist attacks in the strongest terms and reiterate our firm commitment and enduring support to the efforts of the Yemeni authorities and of the international community to tackle terrorist violence, in Yemen and the broader region. Terrorists can only benefit from the weakening of state authority in Yemen. The last two weeks have proved decisive for the balance of power in Sana’a, with what some would qualify as the final takeover of state institutions by the Houthis after the seizure of the Presidential Palace. In response to what they deemed unacceptable pressure on the Executive, the President and the entire Cabinet of Prime Minister Bahah resigned on 22 January, de facto putting the whole Yemeni transition in jeopardy. We consider that the so-called constitutional declaration unilaterally issued by the Houthis last Friday has no legitimacy. We now call on all political forces, in particular the Houthis, to take clear responsibility for their actions, starting by unequivocally rejecting violence and coercion as political tools. Undermining state institutions will only result in further instability, to the detriment of all Yemenis. The attacks on officials and the restriction on the movements of President Hadi, Prime Minister Bahah and a number of other Ministers are clearly unacceptable. But current developments should not be seen in isolation. They are partly the result of initial flaws in the design of the transition – which largely kept traditional power structures untouched. Inaction and lack of resolve on the part of the Executive and traditional political parties, and enduring attempts to undermine the transition process by spoilers, chiefly led by ex-President Saleh, have also been key factors in leading Yemen to the current impasse. There is no other way out of the current crisis than genuine dialogue and an inclusive political process, and we hope that the announcement of the resumption of broad consultations between Yemeni parties under the auspices of the UN on Monday will bear fruit. Any long-term solution should address the underlying causes of instability, which are deeply rooted in local historical and socio-economic power-structure. The real test case will be whether Yemeni parties are ready to work together constructively to foster a compromise, safeguarding the transition’s objectives. We also call on all regional actors to contribute positively to this process.  It is critical for the international community to retain its unity, in order to safeguard the foundations of the Yemeni transition and restore stability, while preserving Yemen’s territorial integrity. It is our belief that the framework provided by the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative, the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference (NDC) and the Peace and National Partnership Agreement should remain the reference points for the Yemeni transition. We therefore urge all actors to work constructively towards a swift finalisation of a new constitution. This constitution should meet the legitimate aspirations of the Yemeni people, reflect the NDC outcomes, and preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Yemen, to which the EU is strongly attached. While undergoing dramatic developments in its political transition and facing security threats, Yemen also urgently needs to tackle its economic situation. The government of Prime Minister Bahah had presented a solid programme in this regard, and a number of courageous steps had been taken to conclude an agreement with the IMF – in particular as regards lowering the fiscal burden represented by fuel subsidies. Decisive actions are needed to improve fiscal sustainability and fight corruption in the public administration, in support of those most in need.  The severe humanitarian crisis may further deepen if political stability is not restored. Almost 16 million Yemenis (more than 60% of the total population) are currently in need of humanitarian aid, including 10.6 million suffering food insecurity and 13.4 million without access to safe water and sanitation. Widespread consumption of and addiction to qat – a mildly narcotic leaf – has a disastrous impact on water use, labour productivity, health and the crowding-out of food crops. EU humanitarian assistance in 2014 reached EUR 124 million (including also EUR 33 million from the Commission). And the EU is committed to continue its support for the Yemeni people. It is essential that all parties safeguard humanitarian principles and ensure humanitarian access on the ground. Ladies and gentlemen, the EU stands by the Yemeni people at this critical juncture and reaffirms its commitment to continue supporting Yemen in its transition.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3050, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, I was a member of the European Parliament delegation that visited Sana'a in May 2012: it was a period of optimism about the political transition. The solution, which was negotiated after ten months of protests and resulted in the departure of former President Saleh - with impunity - and the coming to power of President Hadi, then the national dialogue and finally a transitional government, led us to believe that stability was guaranteed in Yemen.  Some even said that the negotiated Yemeni-style transition could serve as a model for other Arab countries. In recent weeks, there has been no need for optimism in Sana'a, because it is the opposite of the result expected two or three years ago. What we are seeing is that the model has not paid off, and some even say that the transition has completely failed in Yemen, because the violence developed by the armed wing of the Houthis shows us that now everything is turned upside down: there is no longer any legitimate authority in Sana'a and we are confused by this terrible spiral of violence.  The obvious solution: everything has to go through a political approach, a constitutional referendum, the holding of elections and a genuine political dialogue that is inclusive: this has always been the European point of view.

First, we must make the right diplomatic responses now to do all we can to avoid the country sliding down even further.

It is a key contributor to Yemen's instability and must therefore also be identified as a central cause of the conflict. Several people died in protests in Yemen in 2011 and 2012, when former President Salih handed over power to Vice President Hadi. In return, Salih received extensive immunity from prosecution for crimes he was responsible for during his reign. Although Hadi ordered the establishment of a commission of inquiry into human rights violations committed during the uprisings, it was never established. One consequence of absolute impunity was that Salih and his supporters were able to continue to exert considerable influence, thus hindering the transition process.

The Union is founded on values including respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy and the rule of law. These are the common values of the Member States, and they are an essential element of the European Union’s identity. Member States have to ensure that their internal orders fully respect the rule of law and other fundamental values. The Commission, Parliament and the Council play an important role in safeguarding these essential principles. We recognise that the European Parliament plays an important role in making sure that the Commission and the Council carry out their duties. As you may recall, in June 2013 the Council stated that respecting the rule of law is a prerequisite for the protection of fundamental rights and called on the Commission to take forward the debate in line with the Treaties on the possible need for and shape of a collaborative and systematic method to tackle these issues. The same month, this Parliament called on the EU institutions to develop the necessary EU tools to fulfil the Treaty obligations on fundamental values. The Commission contributed to this debate by means of a communication in March 2014. These initiatives complemented the already-existing tools: the infringement procedure applicable in the case of a breach of EU law, and the ‘atomic bomb’ option provided by Article 7 of the Lisbon Treaty, which allows for the suspension of voting rights in the event of a serious and persistent breach of EU values. The Council discussed on several occasions how to better safeguard the rule of law in the Union. In December last year the Council adopted conclusions establishing an annual political dialogue among Member States to promote and safeguard the rule of law within the EU. The dialogue will respect certain principles such as objectivity, non-discrimination and equal treatment. It will also respect the principle of conferred competences, and it will have to ensure an inclusive approach. This exercise will have to be based on mutual trust. The Presidency will play a central role in making sure that these principles are respected throughout the debate. Right now the Council is working towards organising its first political debate on the rule of law in the course of this year. I am convinced that this dialogue will help us to ensure that the rule of law will continue to be a commonly-shared fundamental value underpinning this Union. I thank you for your attention and am looking forward to a really good debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3078, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  First Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the clearest way to show what the rule of law means to us in everyday life is to recall what has happened when there is no rule of law. When President Eisenhower marked the first Law Day with these words in 1958, World War II had been over for barely a dozen years. The memories were raw, the images and the fear etched into minds. It has now been 70 years. We commemorated the liberation of the terror camps in this very Hemicycle when we last met in January. President Schulz and I were at Terezin only two weeks ago. Seventy years, yet the alarming backdrop to this anniversary – not just the headlines but also the trends, the patterns that we see – this backdrop has come as a harsh, sobering call for vigilance. This is why I welcome this timely debate. This House’s vigilance on fundamental rights is of utmost importance. We cannot let our societies imperceptibly slip back. We cannot allow illiberal logics to take hold. There is no such thing as ‘illiberal democracy’. Our Union is built on a break from the past, on the principle that societies should be free and open, sheltered from arbitrariness and force. This great leap: that is what Europe stands for. All too often we take all of this for granted. So I cannot repeat it often enough. There can be no Europe without full respect for our common values. Compromising on common values is compromising on the very fabric of European cooperation and therefore weakening it and bringing it to a standstill. The Commission is dedicated to advancing fundamental rights and the rule of law. I have been entrusted by President Juncker with a duty of special significance – and of huge significance to me personally: that of steering and coordinating this work. It is everyday work: mainstreaming fundamental rights is a reflex throughout the policy cycle, from inception to implementation. Together with Commissioners Jourová and Avramopoulos we form a fundamental rights project team, and I will invite other Commissioners to join if necessary. Our aim is to pursue with a 360-degree approach to ensure that fundamental rights are effectively enforced and protected in Member States, based on information gathered on the ground. I am well aware that this House has on different occasions called for an effective and binding instrument supplementary to Article 7. We can clearly all agree on the aim behind these calls, ensuring our common values are fully respected and enforced. The key issue for discussion is that of the best means to achieve this objective. To me, all institutions have important, complementary roles to play. Last December the Council and the Member States agreed to establish an annual dialogue to that effect, and I believe that our debate today serves very much the same purpose. The Commission has its own role, and in line with the Treaties, in recent years it has taken firm action by exerting political pressure, but also by successfully involving the Court of Justice when the rule of law was threatened, for instance on the unlawful retirement of judges or on measures affecting the independence of supervisory authorities. Our approach to infringements pays special attention to rule-of-law-related cases, where implementation of EU legislation raises problems of compatibility with certain aspects of the rule of law. This includes, for example, the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal, or cases where enforcement bodies have insufficient powers or independence. Since December what we call the ‘ex-Third Pillar’ measures in police and judicial cooperation can also be subject to infringement procedures, and here, too, the Commission is ready to take action. I will personally see to it that the Commission acts in a non-ideological manner and assesses each case fairly and objectively, based on the facts of the case and on the law. The Commission will act impartially and treats all Member States equally.  Our purpose is not to sanction individual Member States per se, but rather to address issues through targeted intervention to restore the correct application of EU law. Article 7 provides for potentially far-reaching sanctions. It is not limited in scope to areas covered by EU law, but rather designed to address clear risks of a serious breach. However, past experience has shown that this instrument, which can be triggered by the Commission, the European Parliament or one third of Member States, is not always suited to swift and effective intervention. In particular, there are situations which do not fall under the scope of EU law and cannot be said to meet the threshold of Article 7, but which do raise concern regarding the respect of the rule of law in particular Member States. For this reason, last March the Commission established the EU Rule of Law Framework, which sets out how the Commission will react in this sort of case. It can enter into a political dialogue with the Member State concerned when there is an emerging systematic threat to the rule of law, to prevent it escalating further. When such a rule-of-law crisis emerges in a Member State, the framework also allows the Commission to react swiftly, following an objective assessment of the situation and with full respect to the principle of equal treatment of Member States. The objective is to find a solution with the Member State concerned and to avoid having to trigger the mechanisms of Article 7. Parliament will have an important political role in supporting the Commission’s efforts to convince the Member State concerned to put an end to the rule-of-law crisis. Parliament would be regularly informed of the progress made at each stage of the process. We are keeping a close eye on all issues arising in Member States relating to the rule of law, and I will not hesitate to use the framework if required by the situation in a particular Member State. Let me also use this occasion to address a related issue. Many of you may also wonder about the state of play concerning EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, following the opinion of the Court of last December. Accession to the ECHR remains a top priority for the Commission and for me personally. I strongly believe that it would lead to a further strengthening of fundamental values. However, the opinion of the Court has raised a number of significant challenges, and some of them are not easy to meet – which is why I believe we need a reflection period, giving us time for consultations with stakeholders on the best way forward. Though Parliament has welcomed the EU Rule Of Law Framework and the annual debate in the Council, I am aware that there are renewed calls to establish new additional mechanisms for the permanent and regular monitoring that the Member States comply with the EU fundamental rights. My conviction and policy has always been that, if current tools do not deliver, we will have to improve them. I am always ready to reflect on how to enhance respect for our values. However, before embarking on a long discussion on possible new instruments, we must be clear on the problem at stake. Can we say to our citizens that we need yet another monitoring mechanism to fight against radicalisation and extremism, or do we just need to better use the existing and recently-established tools? Experience has shown that there is not so much a need for new reporting or monitoring mechanisms, but rather for the improvement of the European Union’s capacity to act and intervene in certain types of crisis situations relating to the rule of law. That is why, in our view, the framework is well targeted on the key issue at stake, and much already exists in terms of reporting mechanisms and information sources on compliance with fundamental values and the rule of law in Member States. Numerous actors, including Union institutions and agencies – particularly the Fundamental Rights Agency (which, I must say, carries out excellent work) but also the Council of Europe and its Venice Commission, as well as many NGOs – all perform regular monitoring activities and make important assessments. Efforts to make this information more accessible and easier to use must certainly be encouraged. This is why I intend the Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights – this is something I announced in Parliament at my hearing – to take place in the autumn, in October or perhaps at the beginning of November. I want all relevant stakeholders – including, of course, Parliament – to take part. I would like to announce here today that I plan for the theme of this year’s Colloquium to be about tolerance, namely how to prevent and combat anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, anti-Christian, and anti-minority hatred in our societies, which are some of the biggest challenges we face today. I hope that you will engage actively in this important event. I want it to be a visible and meaningful debate. Together, by speaking up and speaking jointly, we can send a powerful political message. I think that would also mean more to our citizens than a protracted institutional debate about mechanisms because, at the end of the day, this is about societies and what binds us together: how we can combat fear – numbing fear, paralysing fear, fear of the other. That is when our common values really have a meaning – what we owe to these values, to our own history, to the future for our children and grandchildren. This is the debate and the actions that citizens expect of us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3079, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Daniel Buda", "mepid": "125012", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Jacques Chevalier defined the rule of law as the type of political regime in which the power of the state is framed and limited by law. The rule of law has been and will be a major concern of any modern society, which is why values such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, tolerance, security and more must be the common denominator in a united Europe, an open and secure Europe, which is permanently serving our citizens and businesses. These values have been and will be inalienable and imprescriptible. A strengthened Europe with strengthened Member States is a safety belt for everyone, regardless of their nationality, just as an independent and effective justice can stimulate business, investment and job creation. The existence of any slippage from these values is likely to create insecurity, which can affect our daily lives. Therefore, the existence of effective mechanisms to penalise any violations of individual fundamental rights and freedoms is absolutely necessary. All the more so because these values, which enshrine the rule of law, can be easily volatile and even democracies seen as consolidated. The European Union as a whole and Romania in particular have demonstrated that they have the capacity to create mechanisms and institutions capable of guaranteeing the security of the rule of law. The current monitoring system allows identification and intervention where infringements of European Union law are found at the level of each Member State. However, further collaboration between the European Parliament, the Member States, the Commission and the Council is needed to strengthen strategies in the field of justice, both at country level and at European Union level, as a guarantee of the functioning of the rule of law. ).", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3080, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Tibor Szanyi (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124703", "text": "  Blue card question. – Thank you very much for the opportunity, Honourable Member, Mr Buda.

Respect for European values is a legal obligation for all EU Member States, not only when they implement EU law, but always. Often, however, these values are disregarded, sometimes systematically. The lack of independence of the judiciary, the media, insufficient rights for parliamentary opposition, incitement against or exclusion of minorities are just a few examples. As Europeans, we must not stand by and watch only when fundamental values are so disregarded. On several occasions, therefore, the European Parliament has called for an independent committee of experts to monitor fundamental rights in all EU countries, which can act free of political influence. Neither the Council nor the Commission has been able to present convincing approaches. The recently decided annual lunches of the Member States on rule of law issues are certainly a good start, but they are not enough and, above all, are not a politically neutral and regular review of all Member States. The framework for the protection of the rule of law presented by the Commission also seems to be on paper. The European Parliament should be regularly informed of measures taken. This has not happened so far, either because nothing has taken place or because Parliament is not being informed. To sum up, after all the debates on fundamental rights in recent years, the Council and the Commission are now approaching the problem with triple steps. Okay, but it is not enough. We need the willingness of all Member States and the Commission to openly identify systematic violations of fundamental rights and, if necessary, to impose sanctions.

Too often I think, though, this Parliament tries to quantify in a scientific way values which simply cannot be quantified. It has been my long experience in life that scoreboards, monitoring indicators and benchmarks often do little to reflect or alleviate the realities of any situation. I believe that instead of developing binding instruments to punish Member States and providing tools for political point-scoring, we should instead ask ourselves, ‘are such mechanisms the most appropriate vehicles for honest, frank and open discussions, and hopefully, therefore, solutions?’ What we need to do is to develop debate and action across the EU on how we can improve fundamental rights and the rule of law within our countries and how we can better, therefore, the lives of our citizens. This Parliament and the Commission should look at how it can help remove barriers to the job market, increase access for those with disabilities, eradicate discrimination against LGBTI persons, assist with social mobility, help create more jobs for young people and remove burdensome red tape from the economy and our businesses, so that Europe’s economy and opportunities for citizens can grow.

I think that is exactly what we need because the fundamental rights and the fundamental values that this Union is based on are laid down in Article 2 of the Treaties. It is the most important article. It is the highest article in the hierarchy and yet the enforcement of that article is the weakest of all the articles in the Treaty. I remember the debates about the eurozone. We said at the time that we did not need binding instruments in the eurozone, we have a gentleman’s agreement and all the Member States will simply have to live up to their commitments. Well, we have seen what that led to. I think it is about time that this European Union, which is developing into a political union, equips itself with the instruments to enforce those values that it is so proud of. We should not only be talking – not only words, no matter if they are in five or six languages – but we should have action in all the languages.  We do need binding instruments, not just conventions, not just silent diplomacy, colloquia – we need binding instruments. That is why my group, the ALDE Group, has proposed the Democratic Governance Pact. We have offered it to the Commissioner and we have debated it since. It can be adopted on the basis of existing treaties and would be similar to the Stability and Growth Pact. It would have similar mechanisms to ensure the enforcement of the values that are all dear to us. For example, we have devised one instrument – and I will show it to you, it looks like a bingo card, it is actually a scoreboard. We have scored all 28 Member States against a set of indicators, like freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, equal treatment, freedom of religion, etc. We have been nice and we have not put the names of the Member States here. I can only tell you that the ones with only green scores are Denmark and Sweden but the rest we will keep anonymous.

There would be no more debates about single Member States here, or indeed monitoring mechanisms for Bulgaria and Romania as we have them, or only the candidate Member States. No, all Member States should be scrutinised. We will scrutinise not just their budget. We will not talk only about debt and budget deficits but will also talk about the enforcement of our shared values and make the European Union a community of values.

To date, there is no mechanism for effectively assessing and guaranteeing the protection and promotion of common European values, enshrined in European and national legislation. Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union has remained a dead letter and the alternative mechanism proposed to us by the Commission in its recent communication on the rule of law is by no means ambitious in preventing violations of the fundamental rights of the European Union. It is necessary to provide for effective and appropriate monitoring and intervention methods and the application of sanctions when violations of these rights occur.

It must therefore be made quite clear that this fundamental rule of law and rights and the quality of democracy is declining in Europe because there are no mechanisms to ensure the effective implementation and assurance of these principles in the various Member States. It is the so-called 'Copenhagen dilemma': there are rigours in controlling access to the club, but from there is no control over maintaining the quality of democratic standards, protecting minorities and banning discrimination and persecution of these minorities in the European Union. The principles set out in the 2014 Commission Communication are not sufficient for us, nor in the dialogue between member states through the Council.

And the Council, composed of representatives of the Member States, has always been reluctant to take intoes an examination of specific cases. We must fight more and more for the trust of citizens, and the only way to be worthy of this trust is to speak openly and honestly about the problems.  When we talk about democracy and the rule of law, we must honestly look at those Member States where there are serious doubts about the rule of law. If we start a dialogue on fundamental rights, it is not only the positions of the Member States that need to be heard by the Council and the Commission, but also, for example, the complaints of indigenous national minorities that need to be taken seriously by EU bodies. Simply because Europe can only truly belong to citizens if it does not sweep the needs of any social group under the carpet. I'm not going to go into details. We know that Greece, France, Slovakia and Romania are the driving forces in the area of the rights of national minorities, indigenous national minorities.  I believe that dialogue on the rule of law can be most effective if the Council and the Commission try to improve the overall picture by encouraging the exchange of best practices in the Member States.

I welcome the Council's decision to establish a political dialogue to protect fundamental values and the rule of law, as well as the Commission's procedure to counter systemic violations of fundamental values and the rule of law. Both initiatives are a step in the right direction. The European Union is not just a common internal market, it is based on common values. And the European Union must make a firm commitment to respect ingesly to European fundamental values. This is a question of one's own credibility. Only those who keep their own house in order can also be credible to third parties. That is why there must be no discounts on this issue among us Europeans. Since we are committed to a European community of values, I do not think that the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a state applies either. Our countries are now so closely linked that national policy is inevitably also part of European domestic policy. However, even if the measures taken by the Council and the Commission are a step in the right direction, I have to say that they are only a first step. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a real intra-European mechanism of fundamental rights. A discussion in the Council – about once a year, and then probably behind closed doors – is simply not enough. The Council and the Commission should take a close look at Parliament's proposal. It is a question of establishing a Copenhagen mechanism, that is, a mechanism that regularly reviews compliance with fundamental rights and the rule of law in all Member States, through independent experts and on the basis of objective data and recognised indicators.

There are several reasons for this, and here we have talked a lot about the necessary procedures and institutions necessary to properly sanction such infringements.  However, I would like to draw attention to another thing: until there are mechanisms that warn in time, which are ringing the alarm bells in the European institutions, that there is a problem in the individual Member States and that they are independent of political decision-making, there is no expectation of an effective response from the European institutions.

I am not speaking here about the League of Nations and those days when countries like Czechoslovakia had to implement rights for minorities which none of the other countries which suggested this implementation did themselves.  I can say the same about all those countries which joined the European Union later on, via the Copenhagen criteria, which have implemented things like national minorities’ rights which still do not exist, maybe, in many other countries.  By stating this, I would like to say that we have to stick not only to fundamental rights but also to other principles which rule the European Union such as the Montesquieu principle of division of roles, of division of powers, and also the principle that it is the courts which can decide and not some political institutions. In this discussion, I see that somebody is willing to create a political institution which will sometimes take the role of the courts, but I find creating a new institution at this moment counterproductive.  Moreover, let us remember that even in this Chamber in the European Union we have people who are influenced by certain types of NGOs which are getting money, or by parties which are getting money, from countries outside the European Union which do not care about fundamental rights or democracy or anything else, but which complain and create discord among us here.

This is a questionable limitation which can lead to truly contradictory discrimination in the case of fundamental rights. The infringement procedure also concerns only breaches of specific provisions of the Treaties, leaving behind many conduct which also violates or threatens the principles of the rule of law. Even more difficult to use are the cumbersome procedures provided for in Article 7 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union for cases of obvious risk of serious or serious and persistent violation of these principles. The Commission's idea of opening the dialogue on fundamental rights in the European Union and activating a kind of early warning mechanism in all cases of systemic violation of fundamental rights and values, irrespective of specific violations of the Treaties or elements of connection with Union law, is therefore to be welcomed. The Commission's attempt to define the concept of the rule of law better by listing certain essential principles closely linked to the protection of fundamental rights is also to be welcomed.

First of all, the principle. The principle is this: throughout our history we have learned that democracy alone is not a guarantee for human rights and the rule of law. That is why we have a tripod – democracy, rule of law, human rights. One cannot take away the value of the other. When I express my reservations or my rejection of something that was once described as ‘illiberal democracy’, I just want to say that you cannot use the argument of a democratic majority – even if it is a two-thirds majority – to weaken the rules based on the rule of law or human rights. You cannot use two-thirds or even more of a political majority through democratic votes to weaken human rights in a Member State.  This is one of the fundamental principles upon which this Union is built, and this applies to every single Member State. You cannot say that this is interference in our internal affairs. Nobody forced any Member State to sign and ratify the Lisbon Treaty. Nobody forced any Member State to sign and ratify the Charter. But if you do, and you ratify it, it is national law, so it is by your own national law that you will be held accountable, not any other rule. So the principle will have to remain that, if we look at the situation in our Member States, we will have to look at all three in balance: democracy, rule of law and human rights. You cannot separate the three. Secondly, I think that Ms in ’t Veld’s reasoning is seriously flawed on two levels. The first level of flawed reasoning is this: because the rule of law, human rights, etc. are at least as important as economic cooperation in Europe, let us use the way we look at economic cooperation as a model for how we look at human rights. That is flawed. You cannot create a mechanism which is applicable in economies, such as budget deficit or the level of state debt expressed in percentages, and apply it to issues of human rights and the rule of law. That does not work. It would be a tremendous loss of energy and loss of focus on the real issues if we were to embark on such a mechanism. The second reason why I think this is flawed reasoning is that this Commission has been in its term of office for three months. The mechanism introduced by the Council was in December. We are still in the beginnings of trying to make the system we have work. Give it a chance. I think it is unfair already to say ‘well, whatever you have, I do not believe in it; I want my own new toy, which is a new mechanism which compares to the growth and stability pact’. I think it is flawed on those two levels. I would like to say to those of you – especially to two Greek Members of the European Parliament (and I will be addressing you in English because I do not speak Greek) – as I said before, to be an ESM mechanism is the sovereign decision of the state concerned, and the responsibility then resides with that state to make sure it is applied in accordance with EU law. I would have welcomed it if those who raised the issue of human rights in this context had also distanced themselves from expressions such as ‘we all know that Jews do not pay taxes’ or homophobic expressions that we have also heard in that context. That is also the rule of law. Please be clear about that.

But we all have a responsibility if these things happen in our Member State – in the Union – to speak out against it. There is nothing that will prohibit you from speaking (interjection from Mr Marias) Thank you, Sir. As far as it concerns you, I am happy to hear that. But I did hear from the Independent Greeks utterances to that effect, Sir, and you will not be able to dispute that, I am afraid. In general terms, if we really want to improve the situation of the rule of law, we all need to speak out within the responsibilities we have, and if there is a call for an independent mechanism, in that sense the Commission is an independent mechanism and we will look at the situation in Member States, take Member States to task if it is on issues such as freedom of the press, the independence of the judiciary, the position of NGOs or any other issue related to the rule of law.

As I said at the outset, the EU is not only based on respect for fundamental rights, it is also founded on the rule of law.  All Member States must ensure that their domestic order respects this key principle. The political dialogue established in December 2014, by means of the General Affairs Council conclusions on ensuring respect for the rule of law, reaffirms the commitment of Member States to safeguarding this essential element of our democracies. I am therefore convinced that the new dialogue will help us to ensure that the rule of law will continue to be a commonly shared objective of this Union.  The First Vice-President has mentioned EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. On 18 December 2014 the ECJ opinion put the EU in the spotlight. We look forward to the proposal from the Commission on the way forward. The Council remains firm in its commitment and its opinion that accession is an obligation and not an option.  It is remarkable that we have heard the call to create a new European mechanism for human rights monitoring here in Strasbourg, the city hosting a dozen various monitoring mechanisms. I agree with the First Vice-President that we should carefully assess the potential provided by the mechanisms which already exist. The tools are there. We simply need to learn how to use them.  The Council believes that political dialogue has potential if used in compliance with the principles outlined in last December’s conclusions. This is where the added value lies as opposed to yet another monitoring mechanism. I am sure that the Colloquy announced by Mr Timmermans will produce new ideas and recommendations.

As long as there are no objective criteria or common solutions, there is a possibility of applying double standards, inside and outside the EU. Double standards are appreciable in EU approaches when looking at the protection of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. The Commission is too lenient on some Member States and hasty judgments on certain issues. This is not right, it undermines the credibility of the European Union. The other important element is that there are some Member States which do not fulfil the conditions which they assumed at the time of entry. This may be because there is a lack of consistent subsequent monitoring of the fulfilment of the commitments entered into when entering the EU. We also need to look more vigorously at this process.

An example of this is the EC report of February 2014 on the state of the fight against corruption in the European Union. I believe that the publication of such reports would show the overall picture in the Union, thus avoiding the focus on certain countries. Another example is the proposal for a pan-European rule of law mechanism to monitor respect for the rule of law and to make recommendations to Member States. In December 2014, this mechanism was replaced by a once-a-year dialogue based on the principle of objectivity, non-discrimination and equal treatment of all Member States.

However, the new framework explicitly states that there are cases which do not fall within the scope of EU law and cannot therefore be regarded as a breach of the obligations under the EU Treaties, but which raise concerns as they pose a systemic threat to the rule of law. This ingly, the EU has the power to act in areas that are otherwise the full competence of the Member States - with a view to safeguarding the rule of law.

Unfortunately, we learned this morning that there were two other boats which sailed from Libyan shores with around 300 migrants, and that only a few have survived. I also wish to express our solidarity with the Italian authorities, which saved 106 people in the middle of the night under extreme weather conditions. However, I do not think this tragic loss of life should hide the efforts made by Member States, Frontex and the Union. Probably we should do more and better. For this reason I thank Parliament for the opportunity today to discuss the way forward for two key Union players: the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and Frontex. In the resolution adopted by Parliament on 17 December 2014, it rightly calls for a review of our migration policy and sets out the elements that should be part of an EU holistic approach. As the Justice and Home Affairs Council noted last October, the challenge linked to increasing migratory flows and the shifting routes of access to the EU – also as a consequence of measures taken at national level – needs to be addressed with common actions. This is even more important as these migratory flows do not only affect countries on the front line but Europe as a whole, also due to the large secondary movements taking place. In this context, agencies like EASO and Frontex have a key role to play. On the initiative of the Presidency, increased migratory pressure was recently discussed at the informal JHA ministerial meeting in Riga. So let me share with you some ideas for making full use of the capabilities of Frontex and EASO. Starting with EASO, in June 2014 the European Council made it clear that in the coming years the focus should be on consolidating the Common European Asylum System. With that focus in mind, the Council shares the wish of this assembly that EASO needs to play a reinforced role in supporting practical cooperation, in particular by promoting the uniform application of the asylum acquis through practical and technical support. Action on migration and asylum within the EU must be complemented with an external dimension. In its resolution, Parliament rightly points out that external action should be part of an overall strategy in coordination with third countries. Given the volatile situation in the EU’s neighbourhood, the EU must set up cooperation with third countries. EASO can provide support to strengthen asylum and reception capacity, especially in Middle Eastern and North African countries. It also facilitates resettlement and support for the implementation of regional protection and development programmes. In doing so, EASO should work in close cooperation with UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration. Furthermore, given the high migratory and asylum influx, there will be a continued need for practical support to Member States subject to particular pressure. This will require EASO to provide the necessary operational support, for instance by coordinating Asylum Support Teams. By providing such support, EASO puts intra-EU solidarity into practice. Finally, EASO should develop further as a centre of expertise in the field of asylum. By strengthening EASO’s information and analysis support, the EU and its Member States will be better placed to address future migratory inflow. In particular, EASO has to further develop the mechanism for early warning, preparedness and crisis management: a new task assigned to it by the Dublin III Regulation. With this expertise, EASO can also develop innovative solidarity tools for coping with situations of particular pressure. An example is the pilot project on supported processing of asylum applications. This pilot enhances mutual trust among Member State authorities, which is essential for considering future steps in the EU asylum policy. Now turning to Frontex, since its establishment in 2005 the agency has made a major contribution to the management of external borders. It has gradually increased its operational support to Member States and has taken a leading role in providing risk analysis. Its model of joint operations has also been successfully used by Member States, and its training activities have contributed to building a common border-guard culture across Europe. Those achievements have led the co-legislators to agree to widen and reinforce the mandate of the agency and its capacities by amending the Frontex Regulation in 2011 and by investing the agency with the role of central hub of the new European Border Surveillance System, Eurosur. I would also like to recall its potential role in the framework of the new Schengen evaluation mechanism. What more can be done by Frontex, in particular to support Member States in the Mediterranean? Member States remain responsible for the control and surveillance of their external borders, and Frontex only has a coordinating role in terms of EU operational cooperation. Thus we should in the first place ask the Member States concerned what their specific needs are and what is the real added value of the agency’s operational support that can be achieved. Frontex could then provide its support by organising more targeted joint operations, connecting national priorities and EU objectives, strengthening the spirit of operational solidarity, assisting with specialised capacities and contributing to building national capacities. In the current situation, it appears imperative that Frontex increase its reactivity towards the rapid evolution in migration flows, making full use of the Eurosur system, including the provisions of inter-agency cooperation. Because the roots of migration are far away from the EU’s borders, it is absolutely necessary to enhance cooperation with countries of origin and transit. In that regard, Frontex has the possibility of deploying its own Immigration Liaison Officers, who could become an information hub in key third countries. Frontex could also help third countries to manage their borders in a more secure way, in accordance with international law standards, by providing technical assistance and promoting regional cooperation on borders. In the context of the long-term development of Frontex, the European Council in its June 2014 conclusions indicated that ‘the possibility of setting up a European system of border guards to enhance the control and surveillance capabilities at our external borders should be studied’. The relevant working party within the Council has discussed the study carried out for the Commission on the feasibility of a European system of border guards. It now awaits the external evaluation commissioned by the Frontex Management Board as well as possible further action by the Commission. Both EASO and Frontex have managed to build up organisations capable of delivering results. EASO’s support improves the quality of national asylum systems. This brings us closer to the ideal of a Common European Asylum System in which applications for international protection are treated in the same manner irrespective of where in the EU they are lodged. By delivering operational support to Member States, Frontex strengthens the management of the EU’s external borders. In the light of these achievements, the Council commends EASO and Frontex for the results obtained over the past years and encourages them to continue supporting practical cooperation in the EU in the years to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3133, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  First Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, when I heard this morning that the representative of UNHCR in Lampedusa said that possibly more than three hundred people had died in the last couple of days trying to save their lives by crossing the Mediterranean I thought, do we still have words to express what we feel when these things happen? Are our senses becoming numb, are we becoming involuntarily indifferent to what is happening?  My reaction to that is we can never let that happen. We can never become indifferent to that level of human suffering and we will always be under an obligation to try to find a solution even though a solution will have to be comprehensive and will not only be controlling our borders in a more efficient way. It will always have to entail taking away the reasons why people feel they need to flee, knowing all too well that they risk dying on a boat somewhere between Africa or the Arab world and Europe. The price that people are prepared to pay is so high that I think we need to refocus on our obligation also to take away the reason why people feel the need to flee. At the same time I think it is necessary that we discuss the way forward for the European External Borders Agency FRONTEX and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). We are confronted with a twofold challenge. Internally the common European asylum system must be implemented in a coherent and effective way by all participating Member States and associated countries. Externally we are confronted with the highest migratory pressures at the EU external borders since the 1990s and all EU Member States are affected. The time is gone that we could just leave that problem in the hands of a few Member States and ignore it. EASO and FRONTEX will have a prominent role in the implementation of the EU agenda on migration which is currently developed as announced in the Commission Work Programme for 2015. Since they were established both agencies have faced the increasing challenge of supporting Member States, especially those with high migratory pressures, while having limited resources at their disposal.  The Commission is very grateful for the support provided by the European Parliament and the Council in the development of both agencies and for ensuring they have the necessary funding. The management of migratory flows to the EU, including the protection of refugees, requires close collaboration both at policy level where the EU institutions operate, and in terms of practical cooperation, implementation and support from EASO and FRONTEX. The establishment of close and well-functioning practical cooperation and the continuous exchange of best practices is of utmost importance to build mutual trust between Member States and between the Member States and the EU. Here the agencies are playing a key role. Let me now say a few words about each agency in particular. Concerning EASO, the consolidation and implementation of the common European asylum system has the highest priority for the Commission in the coming years. EASO will continue to play an important role in this endeavour. It will help improve the quality of asylum decision-making and harmonise practices across the EU, by monitoring the quality of asylum decisions and ensuring that Member States are able to access up-to-date country of origin information to assist them in their assessments.  EASO further needs to contribute to enhancing the capacity of national asylum systems with training and exchanges of best practices between the Member States. With an unstable geopolitical environment and evolving threats, EASO is playing and will play an important role in crisis management; for example, it played a useful part in the Taskforce Mediterranean. Our objectives cannot be successfully met without further engaging third countries and better combining our external policy instruments. In that context, EASO’s external activities are part of a broad range of EU external relations instruments. On FRONTEX, firstly I should stress it has only a supporting function in coordinating operational cooperation between the Member States, especially in support of the requesting Member States facing the highest migratory pressure. FRONTEX devotes its resources to the hotspots and shifts those resources around as pressure shifts from one section of the external border to another. This fire brigade role is important for emergency support but it cannot be the only function of the agency. FRONTEX needs also to provide structural support to all Member States to help them better control all external borders of the EU. Examples are training of border guards and developing tools such as Eurosur which contribute to saving lives at sea.  Since the last revision of the FRONTEX mandate in 2011, great progress has been made regarding fully respecting fundamental rights during FRONTEX coordinated joint operations. A code of conduct has been established. All offices participating in joint operations are obliged to have the appropriate training concerning the rights of apprehended persons and their access to asylum. Furthermore, where there is proof of the violation of fundamental rights the executive director of the agency can suspend or terminate the ongoing joint operation. In line with the respective mandates of the agencies, the cooperation between Europol and FRONTEX is ongoing and will be further enhanced in the near future, especially regarding the common fight against the use of ghost ships to smuggle persons into the EU. Here, I think, a number of very, very cynical criminals prey on people in desperate situations and they need to be tackled. The agency launched an external evaluation in 2014 which covers all of these points. It is expected to be ready by the summer of this year. A study on the feasibility of a system of European border guards has also been carried out for the Commission by an external contractor. We have made the study public.  Based on the findings of these two studies the Commission intends to initiate a debate on how to further strengthen the agency which will have an important role to play in the coming years. I look forward to hearing your views.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3134, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I warmly welcome the Presidency of the Council and I am very pleased that the Vice-President of the European Commission – you, Mr Timmermans – is with us because we did not really want the issue at the moment. We did not want to be in a situation where hundreds of people – whose numbers we can no longer even verify precisely, do not know exactly – have drowned in the Mediterranean and who are showing us the limits we have reached. I would therefore like to ask the following questions in particular: Frontex and EASO urgently need support in the development of their structures, both in terms of personnel and technology, as well as in the speed of the supply of expert staff from the Member States. I would like to ask the Commission very warmly to take this wish into account in the context of the next budget negotiations, because otherwise these agencies will really reach the limit of what they are able to do. I would also like to thank both agencies very much for their active and intensive work. Secondly, the question for me is whether we do not need something like community military action on the high seas again in order to save people on the one hand, but also to reduce the traffickers on the other, and also, urgently, other forms of cooperation with third countries. For if ISIS now dominates parts of Libyan ports and forces people onto boats with which they are definitely unable to arrive, but have to drown miserably, then this is an untenable state of affairs that Frontex and EASO can no longer change; we need other instruments, which ultimately lie in the dimension of foreign policy. We must also step up the fight against traffickers as a matter of urgency, thereby strengthening Europol's instruments in order to combat this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3135, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Claude Moraes", "mepid": "4519", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. –  Madam President, last Monday I think the number that was cited by Frontex, the agency, was 106 lives saved. Of course, every day the European Asylum Support Office does its dedicated work. I was involved in the trialogues and negotiations for the Asylum Support Office and many colleagues here were involved in Frontex, a serious committee trying to work with these serious people and serious agencies. Over 14 years since these agencies were created, the estimate (and it is only an estimate) is that over 22 000 lives have been lost. In the last few months, it is not lost lives, it is a more brutal form of trafficking – these ghost ships, a much more calculated and cynical way of killing people when they cannot get their money. So let us be very clear: there are some people in this Chamber who will want to talk about a more existential threat to immigration, and they will want to talk about immigration in their own national spheres. But let us be very clear – of all the lives that have been lost, when we are talking about Frontex and the agencies, we in Parliament have been doing very meticulous work, and I have seen that work. There are good people in these agencies, and I have met them. So let us be very clear about the Council. I was in Riga recently, and I heard one Member State saying that (I have just written it down because I wrote it at the time) resourcing further Council cooperation in the Mediterranean will act as a push factor. Now the issue is that saving lives in the Mediterranean is a resource-rich issue which goes far beyond Frontex and the Asylum Support Office. The Asylum Support Office is an intelligence-led, information-rich office. Frontex is an agency which spots people who are dying and who are potentially going to die in a fairly small-scale operation. Our assets are small and limited: I have seen that. So for the Council, it has to do its job and it has to do it collectively, and we need the Council to do its job and the Commission to help us do it.

We have talked about it here for many months. In the 1990s, I myself was the UK Minister for Immigration and Asylum and I recognise the sensitivities attached to the whole issue. Of course we do not want to repeat ourselves, but it really is, despite good intentions, enormously challenging now. The same concerns are in place. The situation faced by the European Union as a whole is a very serious one regarding immigration and asylum. Of course the European Asylum Support Office and the Frontex Agency have a large and important role to play in the challenges we face to manage migration into the EU and to secure our external border.  These are two agencies whose work I support, but my overall concerns remain the same as ever. More must be done to assist Member States who receive large numbers of migrants. Too many migrants slip through the net unprocessed. They remain in Europe, vulnerable to exploitation, and are undocumented. The terrible news of the further 300 fatalities underlines why more must be done to save the lives of those who tragically go to sea seeking a new life, and much more must be done to catch, detain and prosecute the actual perpetrators of the human trafficking itself. More must also be done to assist Member States in the integration and resettlement of asylum seekers, and more must be done by the Commission to ensure that those countries where migrants first arrive can properly deal with them, as soon as they arrive, in the right conditions. I am saddened that sometimes, particularly with children, they remain very vulnerable in the process that takes place.  The Commission needs to offer a clear strategy and a clear way forward so this Parliament and European citizens can again regain confidence that the European asylum system is working fairly and efficiently and that it benefits both those who genuinely seek asylum and all the citizens of the EU itself.

The facts speak for themselves now. The end of Mare Nostrum is once again producing humanitarian disasters, and the Frontex mission, which had been described as a solution, I am referring to Triton, turns out to be what it is: a false replacement and a radical failure. That is why I do not believe, in the present circumstances, that Frontex should receive any additional resources. Despite regulations that are too vague and not enforced, its task is only to patrol the borders and not to search for and rescue fugitives from wars and chaos that also extend on our own responsibility. Frontex even warns the Italian Government that the aid it coordinates is prohibited beyond 30 miles from the coast. The shipwrecks of these days have all taken place on the high seas, near the Libyan coast, where Mare Nostrum was operating. The truth is that Mare Nostrum, despite the statements of the European and Italian authorities, has never been replaced. We should now ask for two things as a Parliament. Firstly, that Frontex should not stand in the way when it is called upon to rescue over 30 miles. Secondly, that Europe should decide to support financially the restoration of missions such as Mare Nostrum. Both the UN High Commissioner and the Council of Europe have stated that Triton is not up to the job. What are we waiting for to say the same thing?

Who knows, maybe even more. But instead of finally seeking a solution, the interior ministers keep downplaying the same thing: more money for Frontex, more border surveillance, more fortress Europe. But that is the wrong answer to the crisis we are in. We do not need more foreclosure, we do not need more surveillance. What we need instead is a European response to the maritime rescue crisis that we have. We need a European Mare Nostrum. Triton does not help us; this is a defensive program. We need a European maritime rescue programme! Vice-President, where is that? Criminal smugglers must, of course, be put to work. We must fight them, but not the refugees. And if we are only fighting people smugglers on our own, we will bring refugees into a vicious circle. Because if we shut ourselves off, if we fight the smugglers, then refugees will have to take more, more dangerous routes. We can only change this by finally creating legal, safe access routes for refugees. We must open up the ferries to the refugees so that they no longer have to go on small inflatable boats.

Let us go through some figures, everybody. Let us just expose what we are talking about. An EU budget of EUR 84 million, 82 500 kilometres of land and sea borders to patrol and it works out at EUR 2.8 a day per kilometre and a detection rate of one in ten.  Look at the US, and I heard the comment about fortress Europe and such, but just look at the US. Funded to the tune of USD 13 billion with less than half the kilometres of borders to actually patrol and manage but it has invested in infrastructure and resources. It has fences, it has electronic and satellite surveillance and it has 20 000 agents patrolling. That level of investment delivers a detection rate of 61 % and starts to deal with the problem. Therefore, anyone reading those figures, understanding those figures, would recognise that FRONTEX is a complete and utter irrelevance. You do not have to be an economic migrant to actually want to come here and create a problem. You can be somebody quite legitimately getting hold of genuine papers but from somebody who is producing and supplying them unlawfully or illegally.  Where does that leave us? It leaves us with two very clear problems. EU policy has subverted the ability and the very will of Member States to control their borders and secondly, this state of affairs is a product quite clearly of the failings of EU policy on freedom of movement and labour and persons. I am going to leave you with some messages. The traffickers – yes, they can continue to line their pockets with vast amounts of cash. We are going to see more tragedies like we saw today.

Evidently in the farthest place that can be useful to check the starting points of immigration arriving in Italy. EUR 600 million spent over ten years. EUR 5 million spent each year on the rent of this mammoth headquarters and staff. Out of 80 million euros of total budget in 2013, 30 million are needed to maintain the structure. So, of course, we are paying with public money for a bandwagon that has zero practical results when it comes to immigration.  Last year, 3 000 people died in the Mediterranean Sea, dying on the conscience of those who are calling on these people to leave. The only recipe is not Frontex, Triton, Mare Nostrum, Goofy, Pluto or Donald Duck, but it is to prevent these people from leaving helping them try not to escape hunger and war. A war that, however, this Europe likes, given that there is someone who is playing the war against Putin.

First of all, agreements are needed with the main transit states in order to prevent the entry and transit of illegal immigrants already in those states. The control of smuggling requires rigorous controls. We must also make this clear to Turkey.

In view of the dramas taking place in the Mediterranean, one of the priorities of action should be to urgently develop a new frontex strategy, including the establishment of a new, more effective framework for cooperation between member states' border services and Frontex.  I would like to address the Latvian Presidency – today it has become clear that there is an urgent need for greater, solidarity-based involvement of all the Member States of the Union and, above all, of those which are not burdened with migratory pressure in the Mediterranean, in frontex's operational activities. At the moment, participation in terms of sharing equipment and people is insufficient. So instead of focusing on the debate on the Common Border Guard, maybe we should focus more on an integrated approach to joint rescue operations.  It should also be borne in mind that Member States are parties to the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the Rescue Convention (SAR) and, in fulfilling their international obligations, cannot expect Frontex to do everything itself. Therefore, it seems that if the Latvian Presidency had taken action to increase the participation of Member States in Frontex's coordination and operational activities in the supply of equipment and people, it would have been a huge success.

The fact that it is located in Warsaw is an advantage rather than a defect, about which one of his colleagues said. Initially, we need to be very clear about the concepts, because we are talking about all sorts of immigration (as a rule, these are forced situations): it is political, economic immigration, because of religious persecution, for humanitarian reasons or because of the persecution of minorities of various kinds. And asylum policy – in asylum policy it is important that we start to do it in a de facto integrated way, that is, Frontex should have greater powers over the Member States, because Frontex is not an army of border guards. I think that in asylum policy we should pay attention to one more rather important humanitarian aspect. We have states, we have millions of people mingling in different places as a result of wars. I wanted to appeal: let us prepare a programme in asylum policy, particularly for young people, for a limited period of time.

The causes of migration have not been and continue to be discussed in this House, but about how we can continue to bring refugees to Europe. So you have to make a decision. Frontex has done a great job in the past. Frontex was proud of the Hera, Poseidon and Hermes operations, which succeeded in reducing migration by 60-90%. Now we have Mare Nostrum – the result: 131% increase in migration. But now there is no money left for Mare Nostrum. What happens? Obviously, no one has told the refugees of poverty that there is no money left and that there is no more rescue. They continue to sit down in the ships. They are still being taken to sea by people smugglers in the hope that someone will come to save them. If you say A, you have to say B.

The problem of immigration is a European problem. So Europe is there, Europe must be more involved, and I believe that the Commission and the Council have taken note, after everything that is happening and what has happened. We have three important points which are: security, legality and humanitarian data. It is not acceptable that women, children and people who want to come to Europe to find refuge can still die, because they are not just illegals. As far as security is concerned, we must also combat what is a new terror alert. As far as legality is concerned, there are criminal organisations, think of the scandal that happened in Italy where gangs ran the immigrant business. And then, I repeat the humanitarian fact. Commissioner, given that we have talked about budgets, funds, resources and resources, including human resources, and that the head of Frontex has said that the means are there, that the resources are there and that they do not need other means, then what is the truth?

Frontex needs to expand its ambition and range of action, to begin with, in Operation Triton, because it does not live up to the ambition deployed by Mare Nostrum, and triton would need to be a 'Mare Nostrum plus' but, above all, of a European dimension, to demand from the Member States an intelligent conjugation with asylum policy and immigration policy , which has to open doors to regular immigration, especially through the solidarity clause, by establishing the financing clauses for this management of external borders. That's why it's impossible to rely only on Frontex as the only tool. It must be put in connection with the need to combat mafias, illicit human trafficking, and also with cooperation at source with those States whose desperation is the source of this European perception of immigration as a problem, as a challenge, even as a threat, and not as an opportunity, as must be understood in the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3201, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Marcus Pretzell (ECR). -", "mepid": "124830", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen!

In my opinion, Frontex is one of the important agencies, if not the most important. Migratory pressures are increasing and this puts the Agency in a position where its effective functioning is threatened and thus the security of the European Union is also threatened. Faced with migratory flows from the south, Member States are putting constant pressure on the European Union, so more and more tasks are being shifted to Frontex. In my opinion, it's the right thing to do. But at the same time, these states must be prepared to cooperate and help as much as possible. Let us therefore consider how to improve, streamline and, first and foremost, make Frontex's cooperation with individual Member States more transparent.  Furthermore, there is the question of Frontex's capacities, both financial and personnel, which we need to adapt to current needs as soon as possible. Here I am clear that there are two things that must not be spared and will not be spared. The first is saving lives and the second is the protection of the EU's external borders and thus the security of European citizens.

In this sense, the European Asylum Support Office has a key coordinating role to play, particularly in the area of refugee resettlement programmes and the implementation of humanitarian visas.

Suffice it to say that it costs EUR 3 million per month, while operation Mare Nostrum was having an impact on the Italian Government's coffers of EUR 9.3 million per month. That is why resources and means must necessarily be integrated through the participation, in my view absolutely obligatory and not optional, of the Member States, through the application of the principle of solidarity, which must be the discriminating element of Europe. But we also need to change the principle of the Dublin Regulation – as has been said on several sides – which obliges refugees to seek asylum only in the state of first port. Action must also be taken on border nations, so that they exercise every possible control in advance in order to contain the departures of migrants.

First, the causes of this phenomenon should be established and work should be done in the direction that the causes are eliminated, and on the other hand the mechanisms we have at our disposal should be used to the maximum.

So it's hard times and Europe has to find a way to respond to it. I am committed to addressing crisis areas and addressing this diplomatically and trying to reduce crisis hot spots. In this way, we will also reduce the flow of refugees. This is not easy, of course it is easy to talk, however at the same time we have mechanisms available these days. And this morning when we talked about terrorism and yesterday when we talked about traffic violations, we kept saying that we should use the intelligence mechanisms that states have and that states need to communicate better with each other. We go back to that all the time.

It is not only Italy and the southern states that are under the greatest pressure to provide the greatest funds.  Since I come from Croatia, I am very sensitive to the issue of refugees and displaced persons. Since only 25 years ago there were 550,000 refugees in Croatia itself, within a small country of 4.5 million. And there were also another 150,000 who had to go abroad. And I'm really sensitive to this phenomenon. However, the fact is that we need to find the means, that we need to help to get Frontex to its fullness of benefits.

Last night's 400 deaths demonstrate, with brutal realism, how bankrupt its management and management of Operation Triton is. These massacres are triggering outrage from so many representatives of international communities.

It has become a debate about what is arguably one of the biggest challenges European societies have faced, and will face, for perhaps a generation. Migration is an issue with daunting complexity – all sides of the migration issue – and therefore I would warn against politicians who have very simple, one-dimensional solutions to such a daunting challenge. Frontex is not going to solve this; the Office is not going to solve this; just building ever-stronger borders is not going to solve this; putting an end to free movement is not going to solve this. If I were a father with children in Homs or in Damascus and I wanted my children to survive a terrible war and therefore I would try and flee to Europe, do you think that, for one second, I would ask myself, ‘Is there free movement in Europe or is there not?’ No! I would look for a way to save my children, and I think that is completely justified. We would kill the fundamental values we share as Europeans if we would deny people the right – if they have to flee – to flee to a safe haven. But that is not the only dimension of this issue. The other dimension is that this is also an economic activity exploited by very dangerous criminals. So you cannot have the naive answer of saying: just let everybody in. Just imagine what would happen to our inner cities if we were to have a completely open-door policy in terms of migration. Just look what would happen to the fabric of our societies if we were to do that. So there is no room for being naive. This is not a conspiracy of big corporations in a capitalist world to create migration flows. Come on, let us not try and sell people this sort of nonsense. This is a consequence of the world as it is today, with many facets. That is why the Commission will present a holistic approach to the migration issue, because at the same time Europe is struggling with illegal immigration, it is struggling with the need for solidarity between European nations in tackling the issue of illegal migration and asylum seekers. But at the same time, Europe will need migration for our economy, for our sciences, for the structure of our societies. Europe is in a demographic place where we will have fewer people in Europe without immigration over a longer period of time, and our economy will ask for people to come for a while and work here and then go back or not, etc. So we need to have a clever policy that addresses all these issues, and that is why the Commission will come up with a holistic migration policy. It is part of our working programme. It is one of our absolute priorities. As part of that, we will have to look at the way forward with Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office. These two organisations are part of the solution, but not the only part. Frontex needs to be strengthened. I do not think at this stage that the finances are the most acute problem but, if they are, on a year-to-year basis the Commission has always made sure that we had enough financing for Frontex. I do think that; but if you were to ask me what I am going to do to ensure more solidarity between Member States, this, to a large extent, is a matter for discussion between the Member States. This is not a competence of the Commission or even of the European Union. You know, if you have seen the reports of the informal Councils, that there is a long and deep debate about this issue. Member States by now understand that it is no longer possible to simply say that we should let the countries that are closest to the problem solve it by themselves, because Germany alone had more than 200 000 refugees last year. So we all share that problem, and there will only be a collective solution to that problem based on a discussion where the responsibility lies, and that is with the Member States.  My final remark is this. I think that this august Parliament has a huge responsibility in taking back the message to the Member States that there is no simple solution to this very complex problem but that there is one thing that is assured: there is no national solution to this problem. There is only a European solution to this problem. Those of you who reject European integration: that is fine, that is up to you; but sometimes you give me the impression of being a hammer, and hammers only see nails. This issue is not an issue where you can say that putting an end to free movement will help us to solve the challenge we face with people migrating to Europe. They will continue migrating even without freedom of movement, and it will not make our task easier to solve this problem for European citizens. (inaudible comment from a Member) I indeed forgot to answer a question, which was completely misdirected at me. If you want to know whether the border between Hungary and Serbia is patrolled correctly, you should address the Hungarian authorities about this. You cannot ask the Commission to do that. That is the responsibility of the Hungarian authorities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3226, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Zanda Kalniņa-Lukaševica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, thank you for inviting the Presidency to take part in your deliberations, and also thank you for the fruitful discussions we had today. Once more it has become clear how important it is to talk to each other, and the more we cooperate the more successful we will be in face of the serious challenges that lie ahead. I share the view that the tragic loss of life in the Mediterranean is closely linked to the problem of human smuggling and organised crime. The communication on the work of the Task Force for the Mediterranean includes a list of measures to fight these phenomena. We should all continue this work. The Union has numerous tools that should be more intensively applied and, where necessary, adapted to new realities. For example, Frontex could make use of the common application tools offered by the European Border Surveillance System (Eurosur) to enable selected monitoring of designated pre-frontier areas at the external borders, which have been identified through risk analysis and information as being potential departure or transit areas for illegal immigration or cross-border crime. There is also potential for more intensive inter-agency cooperation – for example, ensuring that Europol is made aware swiftly of all information useful in the fight against smugglers that is gathered at the EU borders by Member States’ surveillance services. Cooperation is also working well under the recently concluded service-level agreement between Frontex and the European Maritime Safety Agency. I would also like to mention the actions included in the Operational Action Plan on illegal immigration of the EU policy cycle, which aim to combat criminal groups organising the smuggling of immigrants. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) can cooperate with Frontex in relation to reinforced management of the EU’s external borders. EASO could coordinate the screening of immigrants in mixed flows by identifying those in need of international protection and those who have special needs, including vulnerable persons; and by providing information, EASO could contribute to catering for their needs upon disembarkation. Furthermore, enhanced inter-agency cooperation between EASO, Frontex and Europol could be important in the fight against smuggling and in the identification of facilitators. EASO could also, for instance, contribute by gathering information on facilitation during the asylum decision process. We might also ask what EASO can do in relation to unaccompanied minors. EASO already takes action to support Member States in the implementation of the common European asylum system in relation to children, including unaccompanied minors. These actions take into account the general work on child protection and the protection of the rights of children carried out inter alia by the Commission and the Fundamental Rights Agency. Concrete EASO deliverables so far include the publication of a report on age assessment and the organisation of a meeting of experts on family tracing. In the coming years, EASO should continue to provide support and develop practical cooperation tools on issues relating to children and unaccompanied minors. Further to remarks made in the discussion, I have a few points. First, on budget resources: EASO and Frontex operate within the new multiannual financial framework, including within the bounds of the new Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal Security Fund. For the period 2014-2020 this financial framework provides the basis for EU financial support on asylum, migration and borders, including allocations to EU agencies. As a consequence, any choice to have EASO and Frontex intensify their existing tasks or taking up new tasks will require either the allocation of additional means to these agencies within the financial framework or prioritisation in the agencies’ work plans. Both in the Council and in the European Parliament, the executive directors of EASO and Frontex have highlighted the need to match expectations with funds. Secondly, at the moment external evaluations of both EASO and Frontex are being conducted. When ready, the evaluations should provide important input for discussion on the role and tasks of these agencies in the coming years. Honourable Members, several remarks have been made about the efficiency of the European asylum system. In this regard, I must note that the new legislative instruments of the common European asylum system will come into force this summer. This means that we will first have to assess the impact of these instruments. Only then, in the light of the results of that assessment, could the issue of mutual recognition be discussed. We will have to see if sufficient mutual trust exists among Member States to introduce a mutually recognised EU protection status. EASO could provide important input for that discussion. As co-legislators we will be called on to agree how EASO and Frontex should further contribute to successful EU migration and asylum policies. Today’s debate provides important input for mapping the way forward. In doing so, it is our common responsibility to match means and expectations and to continue giving both agencies our full support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3227, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. -", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.

Frontex therefore facilitates the entry of illegal immigrants into the territory of the Union. The second reason is the hypocrisy of the Union. Indeed, it has facilitated the movement of people, encouraged millions of unfortunate people to attempt the crossing, so often fatal.

In particular, the countries constituting the southern and eastern EU borders have to deal to a large extent with the refugee problem.

Each and every one of us has a story to tell about his or her own experience. As we all agree, access for patients to medicines that efficiently treat illness is an important issue that must be addressed both at national and EU level. It involves several aspects, namely: availability – meaning that new medicines are developed or existing products are adapted; also accessibility – bringing the products to patients who need them. It is also about affordability – ensuring that patients, healthcare providers and governments can afford the products; and lastly, ensuring quality so that the medicinal products work as intended and are efficient and safe. In terms of availability of medicines, a lot of emphasis has been put on research and development, especially of innovative medicines. EU pharmaceutical legislation aims at safeguarding public health whilst ensuring timely access of medicines to the market for the benefit of patients. Over the years, several mechanisms were built into the legislation to facilitate innovation and timely access of patients to innovative medicines. They include a centralised procedure for the authorisation of medicines, support to SMEs (through fee reduction or deferment and administrative assistance), and regulatory data protection incentives. Additional incentives were introduced by specific legislation in order to promote research and development of paediatrics and orphan medicinal products. These include 10-year market exclusivity for orphan medicines. The recently-adopted Regulation on Clinical Trials (agreed by the Council and the European Parliament in December 2013 and to be applicable as of May 2016) is expected to foster more clinical research in Europe. It will also promote the development of better medicines by facilitating the authorisation of clinical trials conducted at the same time in several Member States. A concrete example of a European mechanism to support research into innovative medicines is the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a joint undertaking between the EU and the pharmaceutical industry association EFPIA. It is Europe’s largest public-private initiative aiming to speed up the development of better and safer medicines for patients. This initiative will continue to be co-financed from the Horizon 2020 programme. Secondly, to tackle the accessibility of medicines – that is, making authorised products available to patients in need – European legislation already provides for mechanisms allowing marketing authorisation of medicinal products on the basis of less comprehensive data in a variety of special circumstances where there is sufficient justification. Such mechanisms include conditional marketing authorisation and authorisation under exceptional circumstances. It also includes accelerated scientific review, compassionate use programmes, or adaptive licensing. Despite the fact that the existing system provides innovative, safe and efficient medicines for patients, some challenges still remain, as patients are demanding faster availability of promising new therapies at affordable prices. In order to maximise the potential of existing EU regulatory tools, the Council invited the Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, to discuss how to make even better use of these tools. Thirdly, the problem of the affordability of medicines for European patients and Member States’ health system budgets has been addressed by the Council on several occasions in recent months. At the EPSCO Council meeting in June 2014, where the Council adopted conclusions on the economic crisis and health care, the Council recognised the need for cooperation among Member States through, inter alia, sharing information on strategies to effectively manage pharmaceutical and medical device expenditure while ensuring equitable access to effective medicines within sustainable national health care systems. Work should also continue on issues related to affordable pricing, the use of generic medicines, orphan medicines, medical devices and small markets. At the same Council meeting, a specific problem of the high price for the hepatitis C medicine Sovaldi from the US company Gilead was raised, at the initiative of the French Government. This resulted in exchanges of information between Member States with the objective of pushing down prices. The problem was further discussed by health ministers at their informal meeting in Milan in September 2014. Ministers agreed that, while the pricing of medicinal products is the exclusive competence of Member States, more systematic and structured exchange of information would be beneficial to ensure greater transparency. They also stressed the need for greater use of HTA (Health Technology Assessment) to ensure the efficiency of new medicines. Recently, at its December 2014 meeting, the Council adopted conclusions on innovation for the benefit of patients, in which it invited Member States and the Commission to deepen work in several areas, namely to explore opportunities for exchange of information between competent bodies in relation to the ‘life cycle approach’ for innovative medicinal products. The Council also invited them: to implement the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Strategy adopted recently by the HTA Network; to increase effective sharing of information on prices and expenditures on medicinal products – such a measure should contribute to greater transparency, while respecting the competence of Member States for financing their health systems, including reimbursement of medicinal products; and to increase transparency from all relevant actors – including industry – that could contribute to increased availability and accessibility of innovative products. The Presidency will work on the implementation of the Council conclusions in the coming months. The Council also notes with satisfaction the recent creation of the Expert Group on Safe and Timely Access to Medicines for Patients under the auspices of the Pharmaceutical Committee of the Commission, which recently started work. It is clear that we will have to continue our discussions about how we can ensure the best possible quality of medical treatment to our citizens – old and young, rich and poor – all of our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3239, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am here today on behalf of Vice-President Jyrki Katainen. In September of last year, here in Parliament, the Commission made a declaration on access to lifesaving medicines. On that occasion the Commission expressed its concern regarding the accessibility of medicines for patients and stressed its commitment to support Member States in addressing this key challenge. Since then we have, of course, had a change of Commission. I can assure you, however, that the new Commission maintains this position and continues to uphold the principle that medicines are a special case, that is to say they are not goods like any others. In December 2014, Health Ministers adopted a conclusion on innovation for the benefit of patients, calling for action to foster better access to medicines. The Commission comprehensively supports the Member States in this endeavour. Just two weeks ago, a new Commission Expert Group on Safe and Timely Access to Medicine for Patients (STAMP) met for the first time. This expert group will examine ways to use existing regulatory tools under EU pharmaceutical legislation more effectively with the aim of fostering innovation and further facilitating safe and timely access, in order to end the unavailability of innovative medicines for patients with unmet medical needs. The Commission services for health are coordinating this work together with other relevant Commission services and the European Medicines Agency. In addition, the use of the joint procurement mechanism, developed by the Commission at the Council’s request to counteract cross-border health threats, has been further explored. This mechanism enables Member States to purchase medicines together so as to help secure access to medicines at better conditions and prices. To start with, Member States will be purchasing together pandemic flu vaccines, and they can use the mechanism to purchase a range of other medicines. Furthermore, a strategy on EU cooperation on health technology assessment was adopted in October of last year. By reducing fragmentation in the evaluation of technologies and by avoiding duplication, health technology assessment promises to speed up access to innovative treatments. The Commission also extends support to Member States to mitigate some of the negative effects on patient access that are associated with the common practice of benchmarking national prices to those in other countries. The Commission’s public health programme supports research and information tools that aim to provide a better understanding of how pharmaceutical pricing may be applied so as to minimise negative effects on both patient access and health budgets. The first results are expected by the end of this year. In this context, the Commission services will continue to support the exchange of information among all interested Member States and other relevant EU and national public and private stakeholders, including patients, with the core objective of improving patient access to medicines. Next week Member State public health delegates will meet in Brussels at senior level for further discussion of innovation for the benefit of patients, in the light of the December Council conclusions. Finally, the Commission recognises and appreciates the activities undertaken by Parliament in this area, such as the recently established Interest Group on Access to Healthcare. Indeed, the Commission fully supports and welcomes Parliament’s commitment to this issue. I am confident that combined action by the Commission, Parliament, the Member States and health stakeholders will collectively make an important and significant contribution to improving access to healthcare for patients across the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3240, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Jens Gieseke", "mepid": "124807", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, representatives of the Commission, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work he has said. Our European health systems face major challenges. The economic crisis has meant that smaller budgets have to deal with ever greater tasks. We have to think of our ageing population, but also, of course, of chronic diseases, such as hepatitis C. I come from Germany. In Germany alone, 500 000 people are infected. In Europe, almost nine million people suffer from this disease. Difficult economic conditions of a health system must not lead us to be unable to help these patients. However, I do not believe that planned economic demands – such as European price fixing or even patent expropriation – will solve our problems. In such a planned economic system, there would be no incentive for entrepreneurs to innovate. In such a system, life-saving medicine against hepatitis would never have been developed. In such a system, there would be no medicines to discuss today. Today's debate is not about the price of a single pill. It is completely indisputable that this price is very high in individual cases and almost priceless for the health insurance companies and, unfortunately, also for patients. But there is a fundamental question: how do we promote innovation in medicine and then at the same time ensure the widest possible care for patients? We need transparency in negotiations with companies at Member State level. The way to cheaper prices for patients and health insurance companies is not planned economy, but fair competition. At Member State level, this fair competition must be organised transparently and without discrimination in such a way that as many patients as possible have access to medicines. I believe that such fair competition can benefit both businesses and patients.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3241, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Matthias Groote", "mepid": "34728", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the This is not about a planned economy or about politicians setting any prices. However, if up to EUR 200 000 has to be paid for a therapy – for pills – then this will knock the bottom of the barrel. I am very pleased that 'doctors of the world' have today lodged an appeal with the European Patent Office so that we can get generic medicines in the future. That's where the journey goes. This is because huge groups of people are excluded from access to reasonable care. It still has one component, namely in the field of development. Europe and some Member States in Europe are the price index for other countries in the world. If we want the spiral of costs to continue to be driven up there, then we must sit back and say: this is all regulated by the market. Yes, he regulates that. We see in which direction. That is why it will be important for us to consider: how can we manage to reduce prices? Of course, we cannot define it, but – it has already been mentioned – that this should be addressed through HDA and other procedures. The EMA, the European Medicines Agency, will play a very important role in this. My question to the Commission is this: what does the Commission, but also the Council, intend to do to ensure that we provide the EMA with more resources for this? Is there anything there? Is there also money planned for future measures? Because that's the only thing that's going to happen. However, we will save money at the end of the day, because we have 28 different health systems, if we cooperate more closely there, which has also been discussed with the Council – I will say it very diplomatically, because I actually liked what you said. We need a little more momentum here, and we would cut a great deal of red tape in the Member States and ensure that access is improved. Because everyone has only one health, and health is a human right and must not be further commercialised until no one can afford it any more.

We do not simply conjure money into the Commission to enable Member States to work harder in their health systems to get access to medicine. That money has to come from the Member States: it does not go round and round and multiply magically. Access to medicines is an economic issue. The pricing and reimbursement of medicines within the EU is a Member State competence under Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This Parliament is not the appropriate forum for this discussion. Each Member State has its own unique healthcare system with varying degrees of state funding for reimbursement. It is the responsibility of the individual Member States to use their bargaining power to keep these costs as low as possible. This is to enable their own health services to work better. Nobody is pretending that that is easy, but each Member State must prioritise funding on the basis of its own national plans, and sometimes tough decisions have to be made. There is no evidence anywhere to suggest that transferring this competence to the EU would produce any improvement at all. Probably exactly the opposite would happen.

States have tried to counter this trend with measures to control prescriptions and with measures relating to pricing and reimbursement. There is, however, less transparency in cost-making and reimbursement measures and there are huge delays in decision-making deadlines, not only for innovative medicines but also for generic medicines. At the same time, we are witnessing very serious cases such as hepatitis C, for which many patients are deprived of life-saving medicines. There seems to be an inornated greed of pharmaceutical companies, which set exorbitant prices for their innovative drugs, making a real bleed in health systems. These situations have nothing to do with achieving a fair return on investments and risks taken during research and development processes, often co-financed by public funds. Greater collaboration at European level is needed to gain greater negotiating power vis-à-vis industry and to ensure that patients have rapid access to medicines. It's human lives we're dealing with.  In this regard, how can we understand that a legislative proposal such as the amendment of the Transparency Directive, which regulates the rules for the pricing of pharmaceutical products for human use, of which I am rapporteur and which aims at shortening the decision-making deadlines on the cost of reimbursement of innovative and generic medicines, is blocked in the Council?

And why? Because, for example, in the Spanish State a twelve-week treatment with this medicine costs 25 000 euros. The Government of the People's Party does not subsidize Sovaldi to all patients who need it. There is a spending ceiling for the drug. They have put a price on people's lives, although with the 47 million euros of Bárcenas, of the People's Party in Switzerland, 783 treatments could have been paid. Or, for example, with the $40 billion that is no longer paid for tax evasion each year, 666,000 treatments could be paid. And it is true that our governments are inhumane and decide who lives and who dies, and dies who has no money to pay for this treatment when it is not funded by Social Security. But it should be noted higher: if a Sovaldi treatment of this drug has this absolutely exorbitant price it is because patents protect the benefits of pharmaceuticals.

Mr President, in September we had the same debate in the plenary session at the initiative of the environmentalists. What for? Because of this hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi. You are talking about 24,000 euros in Spain; in France, it is worth 46,000 euros. When you consider that more than 25,000 people are affected, that is more than a billion a year. If we continue like this, we will completely break the social security system of all our European countries. When I asked this question, the Barroso Commission replied: \"The Commission can't do anything\". So I have some proposals for you. You said, \"We are giving money to the pharmaceutical industry under the IMI program.\" We gave $1.6 billion to the pharmaceutical companies. All right, we need to encourage research and development, but we also need to ensure the availability of these drugs. That means giving public money, but there is no patent. Laboratories make money by selling their drugs, but that monopoly no longer exists. I make a second proposal to the Commission: you know about the compulsory licensing process that each Member State can use. I ask the Commission to accompany the Member States so that in case of emergency - and there is an urgent need, in view of all the figures given - we can help States to remove this patent and open it up at the generic level. The last proposal is that a resolution must be adopted. A resolution was called for at the level of all political groups. Access to medicines is a demand of European citizens.

However, in low- and middle-income countries, the price of drugs can reach up to 80 times the international reference price. In these countries there is very little availability of medicines in the public sector, while there is a great deal of availability in the private sector, where prices are much higher, thus making medicines inaccessible to huge slices of the population. We therefore have a problem with access to medicines, but above all we have a problem of over-medicine. I am referring to the excessive concentration of industrial drug production, which is all in the hands of very few pharmaceutical companies. More than 90% of the drugs produced worldwide are produced in rich countries. More than 70% of drugs are produced in only five countries worldwide. More than 45% of drugs are produced by only ten pharmaceutical companies, ten multinational drug companies. These multinationals therefore have enormous power in their hands: the power to decide the price of medicines; the power to lay down rules for intellectual property rights; the power to decide on investment allocates of scientific research; the power to encourage so-called incremental innovations, i.e. to encourage only small improvements in existing products. This perverse logic continues to introduce uneaso innovative medicines on to the market compared to those already on the market, and this requires considerable investment only from the point of view of marketing. The result is that drugs are becoming more and more expensive but less and less innovative and therefore have little impact on patients' health. I am talking about Cetuximab which, at a cost of EUR 80 000 per lung cancer patient, produces an average survival increase of only one and a half months. I am talking about Erlotinib which, at a cost of EUR 15 000 per patient with pancreatic cancer, produces an average increase in survival of only ten days. We propose that the market for generic medicines and biosimilar medicines, which are as effective as the originals but cost much less and are therefore much more sustainable by the health systems of all the Member States, should be finally released. In addition, we propose the establishment of a large public and European pharmaceutical company, which can deal with research in all those sectors that are snubbed by private pharmaceutical companies because they are considered unattrated commercially, as in the case of antimicrobial resistance or in the case of the development of vaccines against tragic pandemics such as the Ebola virus.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3249, "date": "2015-02-11.json", "name": "Janusz Korwin-Mikke (NI). -", "mepid": "124879", "text": "   Mr President, the nannies ruling the European Union are treating Europeans like small children.

The issue of access to medicine is not only related to one innovative drug with an unusual high price but also to innovative medicines with reasonable prices, due to bureaucratic reimbursement procedures, lack of implementation of European laws such as the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive, or even due to the blocking of other important European laws such as the Transparency Directive. Also, to finance the cost of new high-priced medicines, generic and biosimilar medicines, uptake must be used to create headroom for the healthcare budget. A major problem is that making the best use of such developments in the area of healthcare is particularly expensive and difficult, especially for some of the Member States that are relatively small or low-income countries. European patients, and especially European cancer patients, rely on innovation to access new and better treatments. For many European patients, innovative treatments are the only hope to fight their disease. EU policy-makers should make sure that regulatory decisions on the value of innovative therapies are based on what matters the most to patients, namely long-term quality survival, and also to ensure access to innovative treatments following a cost-benefit analysis performed at centralised level by the EMA.

It is difficult to talk about this problem, I will say more: It seems to me that this is mission impossible if we are talking about 26 health systems in Europe. Each of these systems is regulated by national legislation – and what, the price of the drug is to be one and the same everywhere and still low for this? I think it's hard to talk about. Nevertheless, around 25-30% of patients in some European countries do not have access to any medicines because they do not buy them from a pharmacy for a simple reason – a financial barrier. The outlay in Europe varies, so there are countries like this – perhaps some colleagues don't know about it, which is why I'm talking about it.  What is the problem today? The problem is that if we are talking about access to medicines, especially in terms of innovation and generics, especially in terms of price, and we are not talking about harmonisation of health systems, then we are not talking about anything for good. My question is quite difficult, because we have already heard different opinions here: is the Council or the Commission at all capable of taking on the challenge of Obamacare? Could health systems be harmonised across Europe? If this is possible, then we can talk about the availability of medicines, because the cost of treatment with medical preparations is only 15-17% of the total cost of healthcare.

Today we are talking about a very important asset, namely people's health and access to medicines, which we naturally want to have for all the people of Europe alike. This is a wishful thinking and an ideal. But we always strive in the direction of ideals. Matthias Groote is absolutely right: it is in a way a human right to have access to medicine. It is now the case that health policy is very different in the various Member States, as has already been said. The systems cannot simply be unify. It is also the case that competence lies with the Member States. I think that's okay for her to do that. However, we must consider, if we have free mobility for the people of Europe, if we now also have health tourism in Europe: how can we ensure that as many people as possible actually have access to similarly supplied medicines, including innovative medicines? I think there are a number of things that are quite good as an approach. The Council has said that there is an accelerated scientific review – Minister, you said that – in the case of innovative medicines. You have also said that you want to have a better exchange for the life cycle of innovative instruments. I find this good. The Commission has said that it has just set up a new group of experts and has proposed making a joint purchase of the Member States. It is up to the Member States to decide whether this is possible. I know that this – I come from Germany – can be difficult even between the federal states. We used to have bird flu. The federal states have been arguing about how much stock is needed. Everyone had a different stock, and in the end they spent a lot of money for nothing. That would certainly have been better with a vote. I think the road is complicated. But I could imagine that this might be a viable way forward. What I think is very important and what is not being debated here, but what I think is important for health care in the future in the face of demographic change, is to seek savings potential. I used to be a health politician in Germany. There are many ways to save money. Many things are still inhospital, for example, which can also go on an outpatient basis. There is a great deal to be improved. And I would also like to see a group of experts on exchanges between the Member States.

At a time of ageing population and the prevalence of many civilisational and chronic diseases, the pharmaceutical sector and its regulations are becoming of great importance for the health of European citizens, for whom access to innovative, safe, effective and cost-effective medicines is a priority. According to many estimates based on demographic data, both the amount of spending on medicines and the amount of medicines taken by patients in the coming years will increase. We should pay particular attention to the activities of pharmacological concerns and their conduct on the markets in the Countries of the European Union. Often the same drug with the same composition is offered at different prices depending on the pharmaceutical market in the Member State concerned – and this is normal, but unfortunately this situation results, for example, in the wholesale purchase of a medicine in one country and its sale in another, resulting in the withdrawal of treatment options for patients with this medicine on the local market and the real threat to the health and life of patients. This is the situation we have recently in Poland. Such practices should undoubtedly be eliminated. Attention must be paid to drug authorisation systems and to co-financing by Member States, as they are sometimes incomprehensible and questionable.  We should do everything we can to ensure that patients have equal access to innovative procedures and medicines that effectively save lives and health. Better access, including pricing, combined with an adequate level of education and prevention for the prevention and spread of diseases will reduce the number of cases and will certainly improve the health and life of society.  I also agree here with those who have said that the dreams that the Commissioner spoke about are rather difficult to come true.

As you know, however, the lack of such economic sustainability is now reflected in the same possibility of treatment due to the prohibitive cost of certain medicines, such as Sofosbuvir for hepatitis, which costs as much as EUR 50 000. The policy must direct its choices towards processes that can positively affect the effectiveness of research and the cost-effectiveness of health treatment. I am thinking of the innovativeness of research processes, such as the remote patient monitoring system or even the development of molecular drugs called biological or intelligent. I also hope that we will encourage the development of centres of excellence in research with greater subsidies from the Member States, in order to promote greater cost-effectiveness of the drug and an ever-increasing sharing of information and knowledge, going beyond the logic of the research monopoly.

I therefore join the request for the Commission to examine the causes of these price excesses and to propose a correction. I consider it important that we open a debate on the models used to set the prices of medicines.

If we talk about the cost of health care, on the one hand, for some diseases such as hepatitis we have too expensive and unavailable medicine, and on the other hand society costs extremely much all hospitalizations that without cure this man will experience, all diagnostics and therapy and all absences from work. Not to mention that human life has no price. The European Union is built on the equality of its citizens. But in terms of access to medicines, this equality does not exist. The shift could have been made the Transparency Directive, but it was stuck at an impasse.  The idea that the European Medicines Agency fixes the relative value of new medicines as a starting point for national governments' negotiations with pharmaceutical companies is something they can support. Especially if the variable part of the price is tied to GDP because the negotiating position of small and poorer countries is worse at first. The agency is already deciding whether the new medicine is safe and effective. I am absolutely in it to extend her competencies to prices as well.  It makes no sense for the European Union, which united to determine the safety of the drug, to break down into 28 member states when its price is set.

We talk about people, we talk about health, we talk about knowledge, we talk about transparency. Today we are faced with unfair situations, where European citizens are restricted from accessing the medicines they need for their survival. A few weeks ago, this Member asked the Commission precisely on this subject, which is of great concern in Catalonia, in the whole of the Spanish State and in the rest of the Union. And precisely one of the questions was whether the Commission intends to promote or establish a common position between member states so that no union patient is discriminated against on the ground that they belong to one state or another, or that their access to public health is limited by their level of income. Because there is the key: either we empower, as Mr Maragall said, Europe, or we weaken our citizens to the extreme and harm our researchers along the way. And as we say this from full conviction, we must be aware that we must find a balance that in turn guarantees pharmaceutical laboratories the continuity of research and non-abusive protection of their patents and universal access to treatment prescribed in health care. Without affordable medicines, we don't cure. If we don't heal, we fail. But without an economic return to laboratories, there are no new medicines, and no new medicines, no affordable medicines.

For decades we have been asking research to provide us with the tools to fight cancer. Today we are able to defeat many cancers and we can chronicise different types of cancer, but too many patients throughout Europe do not have access to the new drugs that guarantee these results. The approach to drug pricing and reimbursement is too fragmented. Each Member State must negotiate a price with the pharmaceutical companies and decide whether and how to reimburse the new drug, which leads to differences that are unacceptable to European patients. We think that it often goes up to ten years, if not more, before an EMA-authorised drug is made available, and in addition the price of new medicines varies greatly between countries and not always in relation to the cost of living. That's not right. The situation must not be changed. The price of a new medicine must be based on a balanced assessment between the real costs of production and development of the drug and the impact on the health of the patient and society. The EMA must be able to include a cost-benefit analysis and for this reason the Commission must include the work of the Health Technology Assessment Agency.

As it has been managed to date, this system seems to have guaranteed only the interests of a few and their bank account, to the detriment of poor citizens who cannot even access generic medicines.

There is a widespread view that more transparency on pricing decisions by Member States for reimbursement proposals, as well as the pricing of medicinal products by the industry, would contribute to lowering prices. While pricing for proposals of reimbursement is an exclusive competence of the Member States, the only way forward is a voluntary exchange of information on Member States’ pricing and reimbursement models, and involvement of the industry. This was one of the objectives of the Council conclusions on innovation for the benefit of patients, adopted on 1 December 2014. Such information-sharing between the Member States’ competent authorities could take place in the network of competent authorities on pricing and reimbursement established in 2008.

I would like to stress that in Bulgaria there is a problem not only with access to innovative medicines, but in general with access to medicines and medical preparations.

In Bulgaria, a simple remedy for influenza and cold produced in Bulgaria cannot be sold 2 times more expensive than the same is sold in Serbia, Turkey or Greece. In Europe, there is a drug mafia that is bening at the expense of the people and at the expense of the high public spending on the purchase of medicines.

In my opinion, this is already a very big problem in many EU Member States, which I would like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to. There are three factors that need to be looked at in relation to access to medicines: affordability, accessibility and, finally, innovation. In most cases, health care expenditure is covered by public funding, which is accompanied by private funding. Public spending on medicines in the EU increased by an average of 76% between 2000 and 2009, which has now fallen considerably due to austerity measures to tackle the economic crisis. The necessary level of expenditure should, of course, be considered. Accessibility varies from one Member State to another, but it can be seen that more and more medicines are being excluded from State aid, groups are excluded from insured persons or there is a shortage of medicines. In Hungary, these problems are also manifested by elderly people begging on the streets with their prescriptions in their hands in order to get the medicines they need. In conclusion, I would like to note that, in my opinion, the current pharmaceutical innovation model is unsustainable. Pharmaceutical companies spend 23% of their turnover on marketing in the EU and only 17% on R&amp;D.
