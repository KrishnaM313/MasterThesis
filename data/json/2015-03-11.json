It will be dedicated to three major topics: the Energy Union, the economy and external relations. They all require adequate attention at the highest political level.  Let me start with the Energy Union. Successful establishment of the European Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy is among the most important priorities of the Latvian Presidency. I am very satisfied to see that the energy union enjoys broad support among the Members of the European Parliament, which was reflected, among other things, by the discussion of 25 February 2015 in Parliament’s plenary in Brussels. We followed the debate very attentively and took note of the views expressed.  It is very important to keep the political momentum and to proceed without delay in making the energy union a reality. Over the last months there have been several fruitful and constructive discussions on the energy union at various levels. The first was the Riga Conference of 6 February 2015 and I am very proud that it is in Riga where we started ‘moving away from 28 different national policies to the good European one’, as it was stated by Vice—President Šefčovič. The Council started immediately to work on all the five dimensions of the Energy Union. Let me briefly mention some preliminary views expressed in the Council to give Members an insight. The views expressed in the Council so far will be handed over to the President of the European Council thus contributing to the debate of the European Council.  First, on energy security, solidarity and trust, there were broadly—shared views among Ministers that reducing energy dependency and vulnerability, especially concerning gas supplies, is a priority. There was also general support for bolstering supply diversification strategies of sources, suppliers and routes and reinforcing strategic energy partnerships.  Second, on a fully—integrated European energy market, the Council underlined the necessity for strong and coordinated action to accomplish key infrastructure projects and to increase, reinforce and coordinate cross-border interconnections, as well as underlined the need to fully implement the legislation. Third, on energy efficiency, the Council underscored its importance in support of energy security, competitiveness, decarbonisation and innovation, as well as bringing direct benefits to consumers through lower energy bills.  Fourth, on decarbonising the economy, the views in Council were in favour of using the potential of renewable energy sources more cost-efficiently and sustainably.  Concerning the fifth dimension – research, innovation and competitiveness – the discussions in the Council touched upon funding for research and innovation through Horizon 2020 that should be targeted effectively. Let me be clear that overall there is a common view in the Council that all five dimensions are equally important and interconnected, and they should be mutually reinforcing. The Council expects from the European Council clear political guidelines for further work. The major focus of the March European Council will be on enhancing energy security, reaping the benefits of the internal energy market and pursuing climate diplomacy. Traditionally, the Spring European Council is the economic rendez—vous. The European Council will conclude the first phase of the 2015 European Semester. This reformed and streamlined process requires from the European Council a clear steer to Member States for the preparation of their national reform and stability or convergence programmes. And that is what the European Council will do. The European Semester will also constitute an occasion to have a more general look at the Union’s economic situation. In this context, I welcome the adoption by the Council yesterday of the general approach on the European Fund for Strategic Investments. I reiterate our full readiness to cooperate constructively with you to adopt the legislative act by June, so that the European Fund for Strategic Investments can be fully deployed from mid-2015.  On the economy, the European Council will also discuss the state of play in the negotiations with the United States on TTIP. This is a very timely and important debate which could give further impulse to the process of negotiations. Its economic and geopolitical importance was once again reiterated by the President of the European Council, Mr Tusk, when speaking to President Obama two days ago. I will turn to the European Semester in a more detailed manner during the joint debate in a while. The third topic of this European Council will be external relations. Following the informal meeting of Heads of State and Government on 12 February and following a very fruitful exchange of views at Gymnich Foreign Ministers’ informal meeting, the European Council will discuss the recent developments on the implementation of the latest Minsk Agreement, the situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia. Based on the assessment of the situation, the Council is expected to agree on further steps. This European Council will also give a steer to the preparation of the Eastern Partnership Summit. The Summit will take place in Riga on 21 and 22 May this year. We all want it to be a success. We all see at what cost comes the striving of some of the Eastern Partnership countries to build closer relationships with the European Union. It is paramount that the European Union shows adequate commitment.  The European Council will provide guidance in particular on the objectives of the Summit and on the way forward concerning some issues. Meaningful deliverables and clear vision for the development of the Eastern Partnership in coming years both in the multilateral field and in relations with each individual country are equally important. The Riga Summit should send a strong political message reaffirming the strategic importance and our commitment to the Eastern Partnership Summit. This will also include implementation of the Association Agreements with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. The Riga Summit should demonstrate the Union’s intention to strengthen, in a differentiated way, relations with each of its six partners based on the level of ambition and the goals to which they aspire in their relations with the European Union. More incentives for the most advanced partners and development of individual bilateral relations with other partners should be considered.  Particular efforts shall be devoted to advance cooperation in such areas as state building, people to people contacts, as well as economics. At the Riga Summit we should achieve progress in the mobility area, as well as use the current window of opportunity to deepen EU relations with Belarus. The Riga Summit should emphasise that the Eastern Partnership has achieved concrete results and it is advancing. Finally, the European Council will have an exchange of views about Libya. We have seen some positive developments as regards the reconciliation talks in Rabat under the good offices of the UN Special Envoy, Bernardino Leon. The Council will continue closely monitoring the situation in order to respond adequately, when appropriate. The situation in Libya will also be discussed in the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council. The situation there is escalating and this has consequences not only for the region, but also for our own security.  We are concerned about the destabilising effect Libya has on the region, as well as illegal migration and terrorist threats that cannot be tackled without addressing the internal situation in the country. The European Council will revert to these issues in more detail in October in the context of a broader discussion on the Southern Neighbourhood. To better manage migration flows it is important to continue to implement the comprehensive approach adopted by the Council on 10 October 2014. The Presidency will continue to closely monitor the situation and will address this issue at the upcoming Justice and Home Affairs Council this week and in June. I thank you very much for your attention and look forward to a very fruitful debate this morning.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Commission - Mr President, Madam President of the Council, Mr First Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to inform you that the Commission is at work, that it is working with speed and that it is trying to work effectively.  We have submitted to your review and nuanced approval the investment plan, which is important. We have adopted new rules of transparency that we wanted you to draw inspiration from: there is work and effort to be made.  We have published a Green Paper on the Union of Capital Markets, which is an essential union. We presented our first ideas on the energy union, we made decisions on surveillance in the european semester - sometimes disputed, I am not unaware - but reading the decisions in detail, you will see that they read like a poem, they speak for themselves, and so they should be read in full.  We have started the debate on the European migration programme. We have put forward the timetable: in the work programme that was presented, this issue of the migration program was planned to be addressed in July, but in light of recent tragic events, Vice-President Timmermans decided to advance the presentation of the program in May. Finally, we have begun the review of our neighbourhood policies.  I will tell you, if I may, a word about the union of energy. The aim, which should bring us together around this concept of the energy union, is the need to guarantee the energy supply of the European Union. It's about making sure that we stay or become competitive when it comes to energy. It is a matter of not losing sight of our commitments on climate policy.  In fact, in terms of security of supply, our situation is not optimal. We import 53% of the energy we consume and the cost of this import is 400 billion euros a year: we spend more than one billion euros a day by importing energy that we would be better off saving. Our electricity prices are 40% higher than those in the U.S., which, in terms of relative and comparative competitiveness, takes away all the means we would need to be able to operate equally with the United States.  We need to bring the 28 energy markets together in one energy union. It is about taking concrete steps so that we can establish a more integrated, interconnected and secure market. All of this is feasible if we have a strong will to achieve these goals. We saw this a week ago, at a mini-summit in Madrid bringing together President Hollande, the Prime Ministers of Spain and Portugal and the President of the Commission, aiming to open up, from the point of view of energy supply, the Iberian peninsula, which is a real island in this area. At the 2002 European Council in Barcelona, which I was attending as Prime Minister, we agreed on a 10% interconnectivity target. We are a long way from that, but with the decisions taken in Madrid, we are getting closer to that goal. I am impressed by the fact that the three governments involved have set up a working group to monitor the implementation of these decisions. If we had done it in 2002, we would not have to do it now; it is not a question of pouring into the literature, but of acting in a concrete way. That is what we did in Madrid a week ago, and that is what we need to do to put an end to this irrational element in our energy landscape, which is to see 28 energy regulators evolve in parallel, and very often against each other. This waste should be put to an end.  I would like to stress, once again, the need to meet our climate commitments. The Paris summit is approaching by leaps and bounds and we must be prepared to ensure that the targets we have set for ourselves - a 40% reduction - are shared by as many other partners as possible.  This year, the European semester is unique in that again, we have accelerated the procedures. Instead of presenting country-by-country reports in May and June, we have advanced their presentation in February, in order to allow Parliament, the Council and also the social partners, since social dialogue is particularly important, to examine these reports in detail.  I note with satisfaction that the Council of Finance Ministers yesterday unanimously adopted our proposals for the European Investment Fund- which is rare in Europe. Strategic. A year ago, in March 2014, who would have thought that we would be able to ensure that Europe could build on an investment plan that will cover EUR 315 billion?  I also note with satisfaction that Spain, Germany, Italy and France have announced bilateral contributions to the financing of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, which should be congratulated on the countries in question, after inviting all others to do the same. For once, let all other countries imitate France and Germany! Instead of complaining about the overflowing influence of these two countries, other governments should emulate them.  With regard to this fund for strategic investments and this investment plan, I would like to once again call on Parliament to act with consequence and speed. I am well aware of the debates taking place in this House, I am well aware of the attitudes of each other, and I would like to say here, as I have done elsewhere, that the Commission, that is, Europe, without making an equation between the two, needs a solid funding guarantee. We cannot, without the $16 billion, assure investors and everyone else that the investment plan will have a happy future. Therefore, I must strongly stress the absolute need to make a guarantee fund available to the Fund for Strategic Investments, which will cover EUR 16 billion. I do not want to interfere today in the debate, between those who have a natural and understandable penchant for research policies, the volume of which will not be undermined by the Commission's proposal, and those who, in terms of interconnectivity, have ambitions that carry far, and which the fund does not initiate either. However, I would like Parliament to know that we will have to find at all costs a mechanism to put in place a solid guarantee that is not subject to the vagaries of the annual budgetary procedure.  It is very likely, Mr President, that the European Council will have an exchange of views tomorrow on the free trade negotiations that we have had and that we will have with a number of countries. I do not go into the details of this debate, I would just like to say that, at the European Council, I will urge the Heads of State and Government to tell us very clearly. I observe that when we are gathered in the European Council, everyone is in favour of an agreement with the United States, and when everyone is back home, I see, from reading the statements in the national press, that the enthusiasm is waning. There are a few hundred kilometres of distance between Brussels and the different capitals, but it seems that this journey is not only a source of good inspiration but also of a weakening of ambitions; therefore, I would like us to clear this up. On the substance, I have told you everything, but on form, which is only the substance that appears on the surface, I would like governments to clearly state what they want. I would not want Frans Timmermans, who is in charge of the transatlantic partnership in particular, since he is in charge of everything the Commission does and does not do, to find a sudden death on the altar of an agreement which, later on, it would turn out that no one wanted. Therefore, we will ask the Prime Ministers not to be accountable, but to clarify their short- and long-term intentions. The First Vice-President, with his overflowing authority, will inform you, Mr President, of the aspects that concern our neighbourhood policies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Mr Timmermans, I would like to thank Mr Timmermans for his work They are not included in the list of speakers.

Mr President, our neighbourhood has changed a great deal in the last ten years. From eastern Ukraine to Libya, the least we can say is that it has become much more unstable. It confronts us with significant challenges that affect the core of many of our interests, including the security of energy supplies and the management of migration flows. Moreover, not all our partners have the same ambitions and aspirations for their relations with the European Union. We face a major geopolitical challenge.  We must take these factors into account when we address the next Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga. It is a question of confirming the specific dimension of this partnership within our neighbourhood policy, but also of reaffirming that this partnership is not directed against anyone. It is an expression of the convergence of interests and values in respect of the right of each partner to freely choose the level of its ambitions in its relations with the European Union.  Every European country has the sovereign right to determine its destiny without submission to other states. The debate in the European Council will no doubt focus on the crisis in Ukraine. This will include taking stock of the implementation of the latest Minsk agreement and developing a strategy that encourages all stakeholders to respect scrupulously what has been agreed. Sanctions against Russia will continue to be part of our strategy. We know that the most difficult elements of the agreement should not be put in place until December, when the existing sanctions come to an end in July and September. The Commission will contribute fully to the implementation of these agreements.  We have resumed trilateral discussions on gas. I hope that the next meeting, by the end of March, will address the issue of Ukraine's gas supply until spring 2016. A few words about Libya. We support the diplomatic efforts of the UN Special Representative, Bernardino Leon, and call for the formation of a government of national unity in Libya.  The Commission strongly believes in the virtues of dialogue. This requires determination and patience, but we must do everything we can to keep the channels of discussion open and not to be drawn into a dangerous spiral of confrontation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. I would like to start with the Energy Union, which will be one of the Council's priorities. I am grateful for the commission's ambition to put its first ideas on the table. Europe must become more independent in its energy supply. This is one of the core tasks we have to master. The commission's approach to competition is, of course, the right approach in the field of energy. We need partnerships with other energy producers. For us, the USA is a partner with whom we want to talk more about energy exchange in the future. TTIP is an opportunity to talk to the Americans about energy issues. I fully support the position of our President of the Commission that we need clarity from the Member States on how they stand on TTIP, especially from the management level. We want TTIP to succeed! Secondly, with the case of energy, I would like to say that the implementation of the decisions that have been mentioned so far should actually be the first task that the Council is taking on. It would be exciting if the Commission were to present an audit report on what the Council has promised and what has not been delivered so far. The very example of strengthening the interconnectors between France and Spain is an issue that has been on the table for a long time and, unfortunately, has not been addressed by God. That is why the Council should first take a self-critical approach to these issues. I would like to raise one last point on the energy issue, namely the link with climate protection and climate issues. The European Union is leading the way on this issue globally. We support the European Union in Paris as the leader in climate protection. However, I would also like to say on the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that, despite all the leadership, and all the way forward, we must also look in between to see whether others follow us in the process. We must not lose sight of our competitiveness. The President of the Commission highlighted energy costs in his speech. That is why: yes to ambition, yes to the courage of Europe to go ahead, to go its own way, but these objectives must remain global and realistic. The second point I would like to raise is the concerns about the economic situation in the European Union and, above all, the situation in Greece. The EPP wants the euro area to hold together, the EPP wants Greece to be and remain a strong and stable partner in Europe, in the European Union. The aid that has been confirmed, the extension of the programme by the euro countries, confirms that we Europeans want this. I would like to point out that there has never been such a large majority in the German Bundestag for a programme as in this programme extension. In other words, the parliaments in the euro area, including the Member States, want partnership with Greece. However, we need a Greek partner who works seriously with us. And when we hear that in Brussels the Greek government agrees to extend the programme and then in Greece, in Athens, it is said that there is no longer any programme when the Greek Government in Brussels agrees that it is prepared to continue to accept monitoring in the form of the institution with the new name, and in Greece it is said that there is no more monitoring. , then this is not a serious approach. I hope that the Greek Government will immediately feel that it is a government and will stop being a campaigner. This would be extremely important for further development in this context. Patience, I have to say, is certainly not infinite, and Athens has a great responsibility here. In this overall context, I would like to say what we want to emphasise when deciding on France as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: we must not give the impression that there are different procedures for large and small Member States in the European Union. These are the issues that are on the agenda. Finally, I would like to say that, in Minsk, we share the hope that we can secure peace in Ukraine. The focus for us is to maintain unity and, secondly, to look at Ukraine's economic problems. Europe is doing a lot there, but we know that this is not enough. We must do more to help Ukraine economically now.

The British French is making major reforms, taking courageous and anti-current positions, and it is paradoxical that instead of praising it, it is being criticised. Economy: Investment fund, the Council did well yesterday. Parliament is doing its job with its two rapporteurs, Mr Bullmann and Mr Fernandes. We are not a place to ratify, but we do not want to overturn the proposal either; we want to strengthen it, and parliament's position will therefore be an absolutely constructive position because we want the operation to succeed. It was those who proposed it, we in the Socialist and Democratic Group, who want to defend this great gamble that the Commission and Parliament are making for investment. And we applaud those governments that are contributing – as President Juncker mentioned – Italy, France, Spain and Germany, and we encourage others to bet on this plan. On Greece, we are continuing to work towards an agreement, despite the contradictory positions of the Greek Government. On the energy union, I endorse the things that have been said by President Juncker and Mrs Kalnièa-Lukashevica. Energy union is a very important objective. We must decarbonise Europe and aim for targets to reduce domestic emissions by at least 40 % by 2030, and we can do even more, taking into account certain difficult situations in some regions that affect the industrial sector, to which some positive responses must be given. We must and can reduce energy bills and our dependence on external energy imports. Finally, foreign policy. It is all very well, and rightly so, Minsk, verification, but the centrality today is Libya and on Libya we must strongly support the action that High Representative Mogherini is taking: the meetings, the attempt to find a point of recomposition through the diplomatic route. The talks in Morocco and Algeria are doing well, but we must do so quickly before the country is left to anarchy and disarray.

I am listening to this discussion and, as far as the Energy Union issue is concerned, one thing is clear, I ask you: it is obvious to the data that we have heard – 53% of the energy we import, it is 40% more expensive than in the United States – that the demand for decarbonisation and the policy towards it, in the direction of renewable energy only in principle, is to put out the fire with petrol, because it will lead to the collapse of the European economy and in terms of prices , which european citizens are paying for electricity today, I assure you that they will not fall, but will increase significantly, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of jobs that we will lose in European industry.  That is why we should have a sensible policy, and the sensible policy in this case is the policy of respecting technological neutrality, of using those energy sources that the Member States have today. And that is where spending, including EU funds, should go in order to leave european countries the opportunity to self-establish themselves, to decide sovereignly to what extent they will be developing. Of course, given the need to develop new technologies, but these technologies are already there, including in terms of burning coal, and at the same time moving towards climate protection, but in a sensible and safe way for the European economy. This is my great call for such action within the Energy Union in the years to come. The Union should be as energy-sovereign as possible, it is obvious, but let us remember that this also means increasing the production of our native energy. And that's the basic point – using the sources you have as much as possible.  And the second point I want to raise is the issue of Ukraine. I regret invariably that the European Union was not directly represented in Minsk. Nevertheless, an agreement was reached. And now an extremely important issue remained, namely the aim of all our efforts to comply with this agreement. Because it cannot be said that the agreement is only partially respected. That cannot be enough for us. No further than the previous night Ukrainian positions were bombed twelve times and not with light weapons, but with heavy weapons of 152 mm caliber, which should not have been there for a long time, and 9 Ukrainian soldiers were wounded.  I call on the Council to have a unanimous policy in this area, unity of the European Union and solidarity. We need to respond to Ukraine's needs, we need the help that Ukraine will expect, which we should decide on together, while showing the strength of the European Union and the disagreement with Russia's imperial policy, which means attacking sovereign and independent countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I would like to make three points on this third European Council of the year.  Firstly on Russia: I think that what you have to try to do in the Council is have unity on the issue of Russia; on the issue of Ukraine. What I see is a mess in the Council, with Mr Orban making an energy deal with Putin outside the Energy Union, and at the same time a Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs going along with Mr Lavrov and saying that the sanctions are useless and not necessary. That is not the way to handle the European Union and to have a common foreign policy.  I think we need a two—track approach to Russia. On the one hand, like I said in the last debate with Mr Tusk, we need a proactive approach instead of waiting for the next step that Mr Putin will take. What is our strategy for the future? It has to be a strategy where maybe we strengthen sanctions – I think it shall be necessary in the future, unfortunately. But at the same time we also have to come up with a positive package for Russia and for the Russian population, where we make a clear distinction between the Putin regime on the one hand and Russia and the Russian population on the other. This is not a war against Russia; this is not a war against the Russian population, so why not decide on visa liberalisation for young people, for researchers, for businessmen of small and medium—sized companies inside Russia?  That is my first bit. The second is on the Spring Council. First of all, I want to say to Mr Rabbitte that he is right, as regards the semester, that there is the impression that there are two types of countries in the Union – the small countries who have to apply the rules of the Stability Pact and the bigger countries who do not. That is a mistake because we are in fact repeating the mistakes of 2003 and 2004.  That said – and I want to mention this especially for the representation of the Council – it is a Spring Council, it is about creating the most competitive knowledge—based economy in the world – that is the buzzword we always use in the Spring Council. There is one thing you can do in this Council, which is you can take a step in the direction of the digital single market and the telecoms market. You can, in fact, annul and eliminate the bad decision taken a few days ago by the EU ambassadors on roaming charges. That you can do. That should be a huge step in the right direction. India has today a fully digital single market with no roaming charges; with net neutrality. The Americans now have no roaming charges inside their country, they abolished it and at the same time net neutrality has been the key, the rule in use.  Why can we not do that in Europe? I find it a shame that it is at the level of EU ambassadors that a decision is taken to wait until 2018 for the digital single market, because that is the reality. I ask of you one thing. This third European Council will be a big success if, in a few days’ time in this Council, you decide to reverse the decision of the EU ambassadors, you decide not to give in to the interests of a few big telecoms companies in Europe and you decide finally to get rid of the roaming charges and to bring about net neutrality in Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which The debate on the summit so far, which is taking place, has referred to a number of points. I would like to refer essentially to the issue of the Energy Union, as we will also be discussing the European Semester afterwards. I would simply like to make it a little more fundamental, Mr Juncker, because I also had the impression that neither the Council nor the Commission were even further addressing the issues behind the debate on the Energy Union. It is really a question of the fundamental question of whether access to energy supply for people should not be the priority, instead of looking at the issue of price stability and supply stability solely from the point of view of large companies. After all, this also raises the question of democratic control over the availability of energy. I regret that we are not continuing to debate these fundamental issues. Because if we continue to be stuck in this grid as before, nothing will change and questions such as energy poverty – why people suffer from the fact that they do not have enough energy here in the European Union to heat, to wash, to cook – will remain virtually completely hidden and cannot be solved by fine sayings. Mr Juncker, you rightly referred to 53% imports, you also said at another point that it is important to you that the EU should become the number one eu in terms of renewable energy. I believe, however, that what is now being presented in the Council is not aimed in this direction, that it is not aimed at the fact that we can really make a change. It is not ambitious enough to say that we do not want to lose sight of the climate targets. I would like to draw attention to a wider context. Last week, the Chancellor was in the Commission and said that she would be strongly committed to signing TTIP later this year. I would like to draw attention to the fact that there is indeed a link between TTIP and the Energy Union, not least fracking. Neither the Council nor the Commission has talked about fracking today and that fracking is one of the reasons why pressure is being exerted for TTIP to be speeded up. I would like to point out once again that we do not think fracking is appropriate to actually promote energy change and also to say that we are setting ourselves up on a different basis. In Saal in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, test drilling was discontinued in the summer of last year. To this day, we have no information as to what the reasons for the cancellation of the test funding were. I think there are enough reasons why fracking should be prevented and TTIP removing the barriers to the introduction of fracking. That is my request to you to include this in the recitals.

Guy Verhofstadt said: This is the third summit this year. I would add that it is another summit which, even though Jean-Claude Juncker has spoken calmly, will be famous for that at some point! – which is taking place again at a time when the European Union is under enormous pressure from centrifugal forces in different directions. Greece is not the most prominent issue on this summit agenda. But everyone here knows that it is not only in Greece that people come home that people talk differently than in Brussels. In Germany, too, I note that people who have commented on Greece in Brussels speak differently at home and, in these discussions, very lightly jeopardise the unity of the European Union. In my opinion, however, there are also increasing centrifugal forces in the debate about the European Union's attitude towards Russia's new and aggressive policy. We have talked about this many times, but it is really clear to me that this debate is also about whether or not we, as Europeans, actually stand up for what we normally associate with European ideas, whether we stand up for the fact that citizens on this continent can choose freedom and democracy outside the European Union. It is a question of whether or not we allow ourselves to be blackmailed by a policy of aggression and lies that currently dominates Moscow. I would like to say it again at this point: especially after this terrible murder of Boris Nemtsov, there can be no question of us making any changes to this idea of sanctions. These sanctions are necessary, not as an educational measure against Putin – I am not deluding myself at all – but these are sanctions, these are changes that are an expression of our self-image of the European Union. The Energy Union is the field brought into play by Donald Tusk in this dispute. Unfortunately, as Gabriele Zimmer and others rightly mentioned in the debates, including in Brussels, it is the case that, with yesterday's ideas once again dominating this Energy Union, we are in danger of putting this project on the wall. Instead of really relying on innovation, on renewable energies, on efficiency and on defining a project for the future for the European Union, we are extending the policy of interests of industries that are not sustainable. This whole debate on nuclear power and new subsidies is probably the best example of this. On Ukraine, we need to do much more, we have to act as a force in Ukraine that really stands for change. A real, well-coordinated task force to help Ukrainians get out of the crisis – that is what we need! And let me warn: I do not believe that former ministers or former commissioners or current members of the Bundestag are in fact the ones who should do a \"building Ukraine\" consultancy with Ukrainian oligarchs and also publicly funded. These must be people who have real experience in transformation processes in Eastern Europe. These must not be people who want to earn something, but they must be people who really work with the Ukrainians, with civil society, which knows how to change the country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Nigel Farage", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, I have been wondering why David Cameron has been slashing our armed forces, will not commit to 2% and is happy for us not to be able to defend our islands.

When I raised this last year with the Deputy Prime Minister, Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, he said it was a ‘dangerous fantasy’ to even talk about an EU army. I hope every Liberal Democrat voter has heard Mr Verhofstadt today, the leader of the European Liberals, crying out for militarisation at an EU level.

Mrs Zimmer, to your suggestion that the comments made by the Commission and the President of the Commission on the issue of industry are in the interests of the people – I do not think you are ticking right, sorry! People are interested in cheap prices. You yourself said that if energy prices rise and people can no longer pay for their energy and are sitting in the cold because we have too much energy, then that is a problem! Then we have to think about why energy prices are cheaper in America. You can't devalue that simply by saying that everything they do is wrong. They use their energy sources, e.B. also through fracking. Just saying no doesn't help at all. Taking care of the interests of industry and energy prices also has something to do with people. Because if prices go up too much and jobs are gone, people don't have jobs. And they don't find that interesting at all. So that too is unrealistic! There is a huge opportunity to bring European energy policy together in the networks.

We have the group of those who conclude a trade agreement with us, an association agreement, and already within that group very different partners. We have the Armenian partners entering the Eurasian Economic Union, and we have Azerbaijan, which is looking for a very different form of partnership. The fact that we usually fail according to the motto 'one size fits all' shows here too that we need to be more differentiated than we have done so far.

Secondly, we assume that the Council will, of course, regard the Minsk agreement and compliance and implementation as a particular priority. It is an EU initiative, even if it has been carried out by two Heads of State, so to speak. In the end, it is important for us that this peaceful process proceeds.

The European Council should primarily promote concrete measures to remove the isolation of Member States and promote measures to effectively address problems in energy supply.

We need this strategy, we need energy security, we also need the future shape of energy, it should have both its external dimension but also its own EU energy market.

That plan is a holistic plan, joint plan, and you can't cherry-pick it out. In the previous Council conclusions, attention was paid to the energy union, but there was no mention of energy efficiency, for example, when it is actually one of the backs of that plan, because in energy efficiency all these challenges come together. If we want to meet our climate targets, we can do so by focusing 40% on energy efficiency. And it is also for this reason that in the investment plan that we are working on in Parliament, I, as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, call for a great deal of attention to energy efficiency. Today, only 5% of the initiatives put forward by the Member States are focused on energy efficiency. That's what I want to turn around.

Allow me to make some remarks on what has been discussed this morning. First, there seems to be general agreement between all of us on the need for Energy Union. We do need a real Energy Union. I would strongly agree with the view that we also need to avoid the risk of energy poverty. However, I dare to disagree that the initiatives put forward by the Commission and the Council will not achieve this goal. I believe they will achieve the goal. I believe that if implemented efficiently and effectively, the Energy Union will promote growth and jobs. I am aware that discussion on closer convergence of our energy policies is a challenging one, and while keeping the energy mix a national competence, I am convinced that we can achieve the maximum from the 28 Member States being together. It has considerable strength and its potential should be used to the full extent. As regards energy efficiency, I am happy to confirm that the European Council will look into this issue. Moreover, during the Latvian Presidency, at the informal ministerial meeting, there will be a discussion on heating and cooling.  Developments in the Eastern Neighbourhood are one of the factors also making the creation of this Union more important and urgent. To me, the Energy Union is about enhancing our independence in the energy field. It is about greater solidarity in cases of a potential supply shortage, about a stronger and better interconnected internal market which encourages more competition and thus a better price for consumers. The Energy Union is about strong energy diplomacy. As for Ukraine – so many of you discussed this question – we look forward to the in-depth discussion in the European Council giving comprehensive guidelines for further EU actions aimed at a sustainable political solution with respect to Ukraine’s independence. We should also not forget that other Eastern Partnership countries need our support. I fully share Mr Fleckenstein’s view that there may not be one-size-fits-all solutions. I also agree with Mr Pittella that the situation in Libya requires our closest attention. This is why the European Council will discuss it. It is clear that there will be very crucial debates. The European Council will discuss the situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia, the Energy Union – all the topics that are so crucial for the future of the European Union and that are so crucial in taking account of our responsibility in an international context.  It is clear that Ukraine needs our support in every way that we can deliver it. It is clear that Libya also needs our support and that our citizens await concrete decisions, whether on the Energy Union, economics, external relations or our responsibility. I am sure that the European Council will take very important decisions and that it will take note of the discussions we have had here today.

In my view, one of the main means of implementation of decarbonisation is the effective functioning of the EU ETS. The EU ETS prices in CO2 emissions, thus helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively and making industry interested. It is also to be welcomed that the new compensation mechanisms under the EU ETS, the proper use of innovation and modernisation funds, the NER400 instrument can significantly help the development of the energy sector, taking into account the priorities of the Energy Union.

Without a return to sustainable growth, we will not deal with the burden of debt, we will not reduce unemployment, we will not be able to finance important social needs, and above all we will not restore our compatriots' faith in the meaning of a united Europe. We will not restore hope for a better future.  We are all tired of the long-term crisis. Production in the European Union only reached pre-crisis levels last year, in 2008. So we can talk about the lost 6 years. There are different opinions on the causes of this prolonged stagnation. We often hear, also in this House, that the main reason for the economic collapse is budget austerity, that it is they that have led to mass unemployment and a fall in income. We do not share these views. Budget savings were a necessary response to the excessive increase in pre-crisis expenditure, expenditure that led to uncontrolled debt growth. The fundamental cause of the current difficulties has been the irresponsible fiscal policies of governments and the equally irresponsible lending policies of banks in some countries. This could have been avoided, after all, there was no obligation to become indebted.  In 2014, however, there were signs of economic recovery. After a two-year period of decline, gross domestic product in the European Union has increased by 1.6% and is projected by the European Commission to accelerate to 2.1% next year. These figures confirm that difficult fiscal consolidation and structural reforms undertaken in many Member States are producing the desired results. Countries covered by adjustment programmes, such as Ireland and Portugal, have been able to restore their financial credibility and Ireland is the fastest growing economy in the Union. However, the fundamentals of economic growth are still fragile. Further action is urgently needed to strengthen macro-economic stabilisation, job creation, accelerate investment and improve the competitiveness of European economies. Proposals for such measures are contained in a European Commission document entitled 'Annual Growth Analysis'. The Commission proposes an integrated approach to growth based on 3 pillars. These include the Investment Support Programme by the European Fund for Strategic Investments, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation and the necessary structural reforms. The investment pillar is not only aimed at creating a fund with an investment potential of more than EUR 300 billion, but is also intended to be an instrument for building trust among private investors. Growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, on the other hand, aims to strengthen public finances and regain the ability of indebted countries to raise funds on the market. It is also intended to protect public investment, especially in areas such as infrastructure, education and healthcare. Finally, structural reforms aim at modernising European economies: to improve competitiveness through labour market reform, to remove barriers to product and service markets and to create favourable conditions for business, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, not everyone agrees with these proposals. There are ideas to get out of the crisis by continuing to become indebted. In this context, it is proposed to loosen the EU's fiscal rules and halt structural reforms.  Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking We do not agree with these ideas. We consider them frivolous and irresponsible. Their implementation would deepen the crisis and jeopardise the integrity of the euro area. It also raises the obvious question of where the money would come from to finance further debts. We therefore support the Commission's position that these three lines of action should be among the economic policy priorities of the Member States for the coming years as part of the next cycle of country-specific recommendations being prepared. At the same time, we stress that full involvement of the Member States in the implementation of these priorities is necessary. It must not be the case that when it comes to difficult decisions, to difficult reforms, individual governments shift responsibility to Brussels. We expect the national authorities, governments and parliaments of the Member States to fully equate with and be responsible for implementing the reforms. The European Union cannot be treated like a bad policeman. We are all responsible for Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 77, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Ildikó Gáll-Pelcz", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   Artist. – As a rapporter, I would first of all like to thank the shadow auditors for their work and all those who have helped with their amendments to get this form in the report on the internal market within the European Semester. It is almost customary for the European Semesters to be very tight, and that is what we are working on.  As far as the content of the report on internal market governance is concerned, a few comments: My first and most important point is that, in our opinion, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection believes that it is very important to have a single pillar, a dedicated pillar, in this regard, dealing with single market governance and the internal market part.  The second very important issue is that we wanted to address areas that have added value in the internal market, serve economic growth and focus on job creation. These areas are not invented by us, but the IMCO Commission has studies, these are the latest studies that focus on these key areas. And these are the key areas that we have added to our report.  Overall, we believe that our results so far, which have been in the process of transposing legislation in the internal market, are exaggerated in terms of quantity. And we do not care about how member states transpose these legislation qualitatively. We also believe that the quality of implementation needs to be more focused. We can also imagine sectoral key indicators in this regard, which would show much better the progress we have made. The crisis has clearly highlighted the need to renew the Economic Model of the European Union. This is in order to increase our competitiveness. We have our opportunities, but we haven't used the opportunities yet. For this reason, the European Union must take strong supportive steps to increase cross-border trade, and also to keep up with the changing world and to invest more in digital technology, the digital industry, which is also part of the Juncker Plan.  We believe that repositioning the internal market would in any way contribute to making progress in the area of economic growth and employment, and also to achieving the EU's 2020 strategic goals. This dedicated pillar that I am talking about would clearly deal with the real economy. With the real economy that we need most to stimulate. It is essential that we also set priorities in this regard. We have already had interpretations of the internal market, but the foot of this has not reached the real economy, in order to achieve real results and effective steps, I believe that these should be done, further steps should be taken in this regard.  The governance issue is linked to the same: There is a need to focus more on governance and strong political support to make this happen in the internal market. In other words, the mechanisms that we have put in place really need to be operated, if necessary, then strengthened. I would like to mention a very great sadness, which I find difficult to digest, unfortunately the part on governance in the internal market has not been included in the Annual Growth Survey. I know that I have received the Commission's reply in this regard, but precisely because it is our common goal, I find it difficult to accept it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 78, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Sergio Gutiérrez Prieto", "mepid": "103488", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Mr President, Commissioners, from the Committee on Employment we have tried to make a consensus report that is useful. Useful for underpinning an economic recovery that is still fragile, but above all, a recovery that the vast majority of citizens and businesses do not yet feel. But above all, a constructive and proactive report. Constructive, in order to strengthen this dual objective which we have — and which we share the vast majority of this Parliament - which is to improve the policies designed in the European Union — and implemented by the Member States — to create jobs and reduce inequalities. Create jobs, Commissioners. Create jobs urgently. Create decent employment quickly. Because it is true that we must end this social drama that twenty-five million European citizens live on that demand us not to be complacent, to do everything we have to do to attract investment, to strengthen our industry and to change our productive models, in order to guarantee them their right to access decent work in the European Union. And for this, Commissioners, we propose a number of things for you. First, your investments. We support them in their investment plan, but we remind them that it is a complement. A required add-in, which must also run quickly. They cannot replace previously scheduled investments. They should, in particular, target those regions with the greatest macroeconomic imbalances and higher unemployment rates. And develop into projects that give value, an added value. We ask you, yes, for fiscal responsibility, Mr Rosati, which is one that is compatible with economic growth and employment, which is one that can make use of the greatest flexibility within the Stability and Growth Pact, because the fiscal multiplier effects in the European Union are still too high to be compatible with job creation. But above all, we also ask you to incorporate fiscal responsibility and social responsibility into your Community language. That we cannot turn structural reforms into a mantra where everything is fit. That we have to get more concrete. That the structural reforms we promote in the European Union must first be compatible with economic growth and job creation, because some have had the same pro-cyclical effects as excessive fiscal consolidation. But they have to be compatible with a social model, which is the differential fact of the European Union. Because some structural reforms that have been promoted so far, in the words of the Commission itself, what they have done is, for example, to exclude from basic public services many citizens, for example in the exercise of their right to universal health or quality education. And, above all, broad-spectrum. That it is not only from labour reforms that the competitiveness of the European Union lives. That, in addition to labour reforms that are compatible with non-fragmentation of labour markets and non-wage devaluation, there are also other much-needed reforms, which we look forward to you promoting within the European Semester; energy reforms, internal market reforms, administrative reforms, prosecutors who can make, as I say, a lower workload in the European Union. And a constructive report, Commissioners, to end inequality. I use your own data. 50% of the employment created today in the European Union does not serve to take workers out of labour poverty. Therefore, what we are asking of you is that, in the European Union, the Commission promotes, within its competences — as it did in the past, with wage devaluation — the creation of a framework of sufficient wages, worthy, that allow something as basic as people to live with dignity of their work. You also say that you are concerned about the alarming reduction in the gross disposable income of families and I tell you that this is mainly because we have broken social spending in a very significant way. That we need strong social indicators to assess this impact, in order to avoid, precisely, the increase in inequality due to an excessive increase in the reduction of public spending, mainly in basic social rights. And finally, you're worried about the difference between rents. Between ten per cent higher and ten per cent lower in the European Union, which in some countries has increased sevenfold in recent years. And for that, I tell you that we have to ensure sufficient and dignified automatic stabilisers at the national level, especially in pensions and unemployment benefits, and much more work tax regimes fair and equitable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 79, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Zanda", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Kalniņa-Lukaševica, President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, Vice-President Dombrovskis, Commissioners, rapporteurs and honourable Members, it is a great pleasure for the Latvian Presidency to have this opportunity to discuss with you today the European Semester, which has become, in less than five years, a core process for economic policy coordination in Europe. The economic situation does not look as bleak as it did some time ago, and recent data give cause for moderate optimism, but I believe we all acknowledge that Europe is not yet where it wants to be. The economic recovery is fragile, the legacy of debt weighs heavily on most Member States and the employment situation remains difficult. The European Semester was created in 2010 for Europe to exit the crisis through better coordination of our economic action. This coordination has not always been easy and it still is not. The economies of Member States differ and so do their policy priorities. But with the Semester we have a common framework in which to discuss these policies, and their impact on Europe as a whole, and to agree on the way forward. We are now looking more carefully at the implementation of the policy recommendations issued under the European Semester. Parliament is right to highlight in the resolution that more should be done in that context. The Commission is working closely with each Member State to pursue implementation. The Council is also doing its part, taking a collective look, at ministerial and at expert level, at how the commonly agreed policies are being implemented, exchanging best practices and generating peer pressure. Rebalancing and restructuring our economies cannot be done overnight. That is why we need to stay the course, and I am convinced that our joint efforts will pay off. Turning now more specifically to this year’s Semester and the 2015 Annual Growth Survey: as you may know, the Latvian Presidency has engaged the Council in broad discussions on the Annual Growth Survey. Obviously, the ministers of finance and employment have contributed but we have also debated the Annual Growth Survey in the Competitiveness, Energy and Environment Councils. The Transport Council will address the issue this Friday. This is further proof of the Semester being embedded into our way of conducting economic policy, and more broadly all policies that contribute to growth and jobs. As far as finance ministers are concerned, yesterday in the Ecofin Council, Vice-President Dombrovskis presented the country reports on the economic policies of Member States, prepared as part of the European Semester. The Council had a first exchange of views on them. It will discuss the in-depth reviews in May and the country-specific recommendations for all Member States in June. The Latvian Presidency also decided to link the Council debates on the European Semester to broader sectoral policy initiatives. Taking the example of energy, the Annual Growth Survey was examined by the energy ministers in the same context as the new Energy Union and energy infrastructure proposals. Looking at things from the energy policy perspective, the European Semester is a tool for implementing, for example, the internal energy market. At the same time, the Energy Union is necessary to generate more growth in Europe. What, then, are the results of the Council’s work on the Annual Growth Survey? First, I am pleased to say that the Council fully agrees with the overall approach of the Annual Growth Survey. By this I mean the integrated approach based on three mutually—supportive pillars: investment, structural reforms and fiscal responsibility. Each of these is a necessary ingredient for reaching our growth and jobs objectives. On investment, as you may know, the Council is taking forward the investment plan for Europe diligently. Yesterday, only two months after the Commission presented its proposal, the Ecofin Council adopted a general approach on the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) proposal.  For the Presidency it is important to deliver concrete results that can benefit citizens. The Presidency is now ready to negotiate with Parliament and we will do our utmost to find an agreement by this summer, as called for by the European Council. I know this House shares with us the sense of urgency and I hope it will be able to progress swiftly. We look forward to the first trilogue. The great potential of EFSI is obvious. But it is just as obvious that we need to pursue in parallel the other strands of the investment plan. I refer in particular to improving the investment climate and, more generally, the business environment in Europe. One of the most effective ways to do this is to reduce the regulatory burden at both European and national level. But we also have to ensure the necessary regulatory certainty for economic operators. Moreover, we should not look at the EFSI in isolation. EUR 315 billion is a lot of money, but if we can harness synergies between the EFSI and other EU programmes, structural funds and national funding, we will do even better. Lastly, talking about investment, I want to highlight the need for special efforts to facilitate small and medium-sized enterprises’ access to finance, both at the stage of start—ups and also at the critical growth phase. The Council looks forward to the initiatives that the Commission will be taking on the Capital Markets Union. Looking now at the second pillar, structural reforms, these remain as necessary as ever. We must acknowledge that a lot has been done in many Member States, and also that most of the reforms require a long—term perspective. A national education system, for example, cannot be overhauled within a year. Council debates on the Annual Growth Survey are, in fact, a great vehicle for exchanging experiences between Member States on what works on the ground. They also contribute to our collective knowledge on how to prepare reforms in an inclusive way, engaging the relevant stakeholders. The pursuit of the European single market is strongly related to structural reforms at national level. Here the discussions within the Council point to the need to adopt a pragmatic, sector-oriented approach. To be effective, Europe should focus on the sectors with highest potential, in particular the digital economy, energy, transport, telecommunications and services. Under services, retail, business, construction and tourism services are among those that we want to look at as a priority. What emerges from these Council debates is the emphasis on implementation and enforcement of existing single market legislation. Your draft resolution on single market governance shows that our views converge on many issues. Looking now at the last, though not the least, pillar of the Annual Growth Survey, fiscal responsibility, we first have to recognise the significant progress made, since the crisis, in getting our public finances in order. The euro area as a whole now has a neutral fiscal stance and this is no small achievement, considering where we started from. Unfortunately, we cannot rest on our laurels. Public debt, in particular, is an issue that warrants our full attention if we are to safeguard the recovery and also to prepare ourselves to confront any crisis. Hence, the Council insists that all Member States stay on course with fiscal consolidation – but not with any kind of consolidation. It should be differentiated, depending on the fiscal situation of each Member State, and overall it should be growth friendly. In practice this means, for example, giving priority to tax reforms that can generate growth and securing public spending in growth areas such as education and research. Before finishing, I would like to say a few words on ‘digital Europe’. As you may know, it is one of the three priorities of the Latvian Presidency. I see it is also well covered in your resolution. We have used the Council discussions on the Annual Growth Survey to look too at the potential of the digital economy for the EU growth and jobs agenda. It is clear that Europe needs a digital transformation to re-establish its status as a leading player in the global digital economy. Digitisation should cut across all policy fields, from industrial to environmental policies. To digitise Europe, Member States need to reinforce their efforts at national level, but there are also a number of initiatives that we need to pursue at European level. In this regard, the Council also looks forward to the Commission presenting a comprehensive and ambitious Digital Single Market Strategy later this spring.

The European Semester is our key tool for fostering convergence in Europe’s economic and social policy and making sure that everyone plays their role to bring back jobs. The European Semester will work only if we build a shared understanding of the key economic and social policy challenges. This is why your reports and today’s debates are so important. As highlighted in Parliament’s reports, in spite of an ongoing recovery, the economic situation remains fragile and requires urgent action. We agree that structural, fiscal and monetary policies have to be combined to tackle the current challenges effectively, and that social considerations must enter more explicitly into the formulation of economic policies. I am pleased to see Parliament’s support for the Commission’s economic policy priorities: investment, structural reform and fiscal responsibility. Firstly, we need a coordinated boost to investment. Your support for the investment plan is highly welcome. The Council agreed yesterday on a general approach on the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), and we strongly hope that it will be possible to finalise a legislative act by June so that the EFSI can be fully deployed from mid—2015. The fact that several Member States intend to contribute via their national promotional banks is also very good news. Secondly, we need structural reforms. They are needed for competitiveness, for investment, for a better adjustment capacity and, ultimately, to create quality jobs and sustain our social market economies. Labour markets and social systems face heavy fallout from the crisis. Unemployment is still unacceptably high, especially among young people and the long—term unemployed. Inequality and poverty have risen. We must create new jobs without adding to labour market segmentation. Commissioner Thyssen will elaborate on this. Product and services market reforms are also needed in order to stimulate competition and innovation and to reduce prices for customers and costs for businesses. Ambitious reforms are a task not only for Member States but also for the European level. The Commission has, in recent weeks, delivered strategies on the capital markets union and the energy union, and the digital single market will follow soon. The Commission will also put forward a fresh internal market strategy by the end of the year, and Commissioner Bieńkowska will address this in a moment. Thirdly, we need to pursue fiscal responsibility. Without downplaying the achievements so far, most Member States still need to work on their debt sustainability. At the same time, Member States with more fiscal room for manoeuvre have an opportunity to increase their investments. These priorities are translated into country—specific analysis and conclusions in the economic governance package adopted by the Commission at the end of February. The package took into account the Commission’s communication on the best use of flexibility within the Stability and Growth Pact. To make this three—pillar strategy work we must make better use of our system of economic governance. Our common challenge is to stimulate implementation of our policy recommendations in the Member States. To do this we believe that it is important to increase transparency and dialogue, as well as ownership of, and commitment to, the implementation of reforms. As a first step this year, we published the Commission’s country analyses much earlier in the semester cycle. These reports present a clear view on the economic situation and on policy implementation. We now have three months of additional time for discussions and feedback on the analyses before the Commission issues its recommendations in May. My fellow members of the Commission and I, with other Commission representatives, will travel to a number of Member States for discussions with parliamentarians, social partners and governments. Europe needs to re—embark on a path of real economic convergence in terms of growth and jobs and to address social concerns. To get there, Member States must deliver on structural, fiscal and social policies and the EU must strengthen key common policies in fields such as energy, the digital single market and taxation. I look forward to a constructive and fruitful debate with you today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Marianne Thyssen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the three rapporteurs and to remind you that, for the first time since 2007, the economies of all the EU Member States are expected to grow again in 2015. But the pace of recovery is slow and the social consequences of the crisis are severe. This challenging backdrop requires an ambitious policy agenda. The 2015 Annual Growth Survey and the aligned economic policy agenda marked a new start, one that is based on investment, structural reform and fiscal responsibility, our famous triangle. The proposed EUR 315 billion investment package channelled through the European Fund for Strategic Investment aims to address the problem of weak demand and to stimulate investment in the real economy, where jobs are created. A key aspect of this investment package is to remove barriers for investment, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and I am very pleased that my colleague Elzbieta Bieńkowsa is with us today to discuss the European Semester, since a strong single market and product market reform are also necessary to improve the environment for investment. One of the core messages of the 2015 Annual Growth Survey is that reforms supporting the sound functioning of labour markets work. So do reforms improving the effectiveness of social protection systems. These reforms must continue. In both the Commission’s investment initiative and the Annual Growth Survey, employment and social concerns feature as cross—cutting priorities. Together they reflect the Commission’s intention to place greater focus on jobs and growth and the social impact of fiscal and macroeconomic policies. This is a recognition that prolonged employment and social problems act as a drag on growth and social inclusion. This Commission believes that this agenda and its strong focus on social fairness and on the social dimension of reforms will help to build a solid foundation for sustained growth and greater social and economic convergence. The Commission’s publication on 26 February 2015 of a surveillance package, comprising 27 country reports, a euro area report and an accompanying communication, is a second step within the renewed European Semester. You can clearly see the increased consideration that the Commission is giving to employment and social concerns in the country reports. These reports, as you know, form the analytical basis for the country—specific recommendations. Let me also draw your attention to another novelty. The Commission has published the country—specific analysis in a single document for each country, three months in advance. This streamlined and reinforced approach aims to simplify the process, at the same time as increasing joint ownership of it. In practice the Commission has now made an effort to extend the exchanges of views between institutions and stakeholders at national and European level to allow for constructive dialogue with Member States’ parliaments, social partners and civil society. For example, I found the discussion I had with Ministers of Social Affairs and Employment last Monday in the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) very enriching. Last week the Commission also committed, at a high—level event we organised to promote social dialogue, to ensuring a stronger role for the social partners in the European Semester. This is, of course, also the time for the Parliament to intervene and that is why I find this debate extremely useful today. I am keen to listen to Members and follow the debate now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 82, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, the Single Market is a core part of the European Semester, which is of course a joint exercise between the Commission and the Member States. I can compare the Single Market to a launch pad to get Europe out of the crisis; it will allow us to unlock the investment potential in Europe and, hopefully, create opportunities for our consumers and investors. But, if we are to make the most of it, we need to remove the remaining barriers and bottlenecks. I want to thank very much Ms Gáll-Pelcz, Mr Rosati and Mr Gutiérrez Prieto for their report. It is timely; it covers the most important issues and most urgent tasks. On the Single Market our first priority should be to make existing Single Market rules work to their full potential. We need better implementation – as Ms Gáll-Pelcz said – effective monitoring and stronger enforcement. The Commission has already set up a Single Market governance strategy to promote that. This includes implementation objectives for all legislation – in particular there will be a zero tolerance approach to the Service Directive. There will also be further development of online governance tools, such as Your Europe, SOLVIT and the online Single Market Scoreboard. We also duly stated the conclusions of the parliamentary Cost of Non—Europe report. The European Parliament expressed regrets that the Annual Single Market Integration report was not published this year and there was no sign or Single Market topic in the Annual Growth Survey. Let me be very clear: we are not reducing our efforts. On the contrary, we want to improve the quality and the impact of the reporting; we want to integrate all possible instruments and we are, of course, looking now at how to do this and working very intensively on this. For example, we are looking at streamlining the reports. We are looking at putting more focus on economic indicators because I deeply believe streamlining Single Market governance will help our wider efforts on the Single Market. This year, as was also mentioned, we will launch two major initiatives centred on the Single Market. The first one: the Digital Single Market package, which will be released on 6 May 2015, and then for the end of this year we are planning the Internal Market Strategy. All the proposed actions will be based solid economic grounds and impact assessments. There will be an objective assessment of what works and what does not. I can assure you that we will take the time to ask the right questions and to answer them properly. Let me put a few of them. Is harmonisation in the area of goods as efficient as it should be? Can we improve or even extend the application of the mutual recognition principle in goods and services? How do we address the link between goods and services? How do we tackle the remaining barriers in goods and services? How do we get rid of discrimination over access to goods, services and online content cross—border? How can we get rid of the obstacles to cross—border e—commerce? How do we reduce the administrative burden on our companies to the minimum? These are only some of the questions we need to answer. And we need to do it in partnership with you and the Member States. That is why this debate today is so useful.

Mr President, Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the European semester is the hasty response to the shock of the sovereign debt crisis, particularly in Greece. Crisis resulting from the scandalous absence of eurozone government for ten years.  When states agree to give themselves the same currency, they must ensure that all of their territories are an optimal economic zone. Without convergence of fiscal and social legislation, without coordination of economic policies, without a real government, it is futile to pretend to escape instability and drama.  To give substance to this governance and coordination, I make three recommendations: First, the allocation of a share of unpaid invoices by the European Union into the accounts of the Member States to assess their possible excessive deficit. It is a question of credibility, a prerequisite for trust. We talked about it at length yesterday about the 2016 budget. Secondly, the standardisation of the presentation of states' contributions to the European Union budget in their public accounts. It is a question of consistency and legibility. Finally, the harmonization of the presentation of public accounts and the diligences of their sincerity. The aggregation of all these public accounts would express Europe's true budget and would no doubt facilitate cooperation between governments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 84, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Γιώργος Γραμματικάκης", "mepid": "125112", "text": "   Rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Mr President, once again the debate on the European Semester revolves around the crisis. Of course, there was no shortage of efforts and ideas, and we have heard enough today. But the reality, I'm afraid, is painful. As popular wisdom says, our passions have not become lessons. So in the European Union inequality and unemployment are galloping, along with anti-European forces.  So we have no choice, I fear, no more time, no choice. We need to change policy immediately, put a stop to the blind obsession with austerity. This, Mr President, will only be done with real investments in sustainable, green growth, such as renewable energy sources, the circular economy and efficient resource management.

These designs should support a market economy model, with strong social concerns, thus ensuring sustainable growth, in order to transmit to the next generation better job opportunities, rather than a heavy legacy, by responsible for debts they have not committed.  That is why we have been committed from the outset to uphold three fundamental pillars: investment, structural reforms and fiscal responsibility.  On employment and social affairs issues, it should not be forgotten that it is only by promoting reproductive investment that we will be stimulating sustainable job creation that enables real investment in human capital, professional mobility, research and innovation, which are essential to expanding the economic potential of the European Union, thereby bringing prosperity to the peoples of Europe. It is essential that we continue to invest in measures to combat youth unemployment, without forgetting long-term unemployment. Young people will be the driver of the leverage of our economy, and Europe, all of us, owes them that.  Urgent measures are needed to enable the balance of professional life with family life, also encouraging training and lifelong learning, as well as dual education. Particular attention must be paid to the outermost regions, to the less developed regions, so that we have real social and territorial cohesion. Member States also have to do their part by eliminating unnecessary administrative burdens and bureaucracy that discourages entrepreneurship, self-employed people, the start-up of micro-enterprises, SMEs, which will be the catalysts for economic growth, innovation, employment and social integration. We must also mobilise all the means to continue in this european prosperity action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Alfred Sant", "mepid": "124781", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I start by congratulating Mr Rosati, our rapporteur on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for his fine work. I thank our shadow rapporteurs for their valuable inputs. The analysis and conclusions on the annual growth survey are well in line with the parameters of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). However, I must register some unease at aspects of our proceedings. As of now we lack a real understanding as to why the economic performance of national economies has remained so dull, indeed so stagnant. Similarly, we cannot grasp the real reason why the investment gap in the eurozone has remained so significant. True, we see glimmers of growth now and we wish for the best. Rightly, much emphasis is being placed on the flexibility that is presently being read into SGP rules. Over—rigid application of these rules has been counterproductive. Let us hope that flexibility will be applied equally and fairly to all economies and not just the bigger ones. So let me repeat that structural reforms are necessary but, as I said elsewhere, they should not mean an erosion of the European social model. Where structural reforms refer to elimination of monopolies, freer access to the provision of services, curtailment and digitalisation of government bureaucracy, incentivising those who produce, streamlining public procurement practices and the encouragement of public-private partnerships, such reforms should be given full support. Yet, it seems to me that we still do not have a viable approach to tackle regional and national divergences within the eurozone, and they have been increasing. I am uneasy because, having a 19—economy system, working to the model of a quasi—balance in all national budgets is not axiomatically the optimal way to run a currency area. Yes, we have jargon-laden discourse to correct for so-called macroeconomic imbalances, but there is a vagueness about how to implement corrective action on this basis. There still is no valid reply to the question: are country—specific recommendations designed to satisfy eurozone or national priorities? Therefore, I am not too surprised that so many CSRs are ignored by national parliaments and governments. In the absence of a central treasury to regulate transfers between centre and periphery, much of the exercise that we are carrying out now could be compared to that of a circus performer on a high rope, juggling with 19 balls.

The ECR's vision for the European Semester is that the Semester is advisory. For us, maintaining the independence of the Member States is the basis of all policy, and we refuse to hand over budgetary powers from the Member States to the EU any more than has already happened.

One of the central words in this debate is ‘austerity’, but this word austerity is at the same time part of a blame game. We tried to use the word austerity just to get rid of our own shortcomings in economic policy. Quite recently there was an article by Ricardo Hausmann about Greece. You can find it in the Project Syndicate, and it is a good read for all those who think that austerity is the main problem here. Ricardo Hausmann is also known for The Atlas of Economic Complexity, and I think that we, as politicians, are very bad at looking at the complexities. We have a complex with complexities and we do not actually like to go into the details. Hausmann’s Atlas of Economic Complexity shows where the problems are. If you take, for instance, Greece then you see that the balance between export and import is not a very good one, and due to globalisation Greece, Portugal and some other countries are gliding down in international competition. They are gliding down as regards possibilities to get into the market, and that is actually the real problem. Therefore, we need a European investment policy.

This is totally unacceptable because, in this time of crisis, this economic governance prevents countries from intervening with redistributive policies to help those most in need and to prevent the collapse of aggregate consumption. Economic governance and the European Semester are a way of tassing countries to the neoliberal agendas of the European Union at the service of major economic interests.

However, we do not share the substance of the presentation, inter alia, because there is an un critic endorsement of the trio's shaker 'structural reforms, fiscal consolidation and investment', which we believe has failed in recent years as a method of getting Europe out of the serious crisis it is in. Moreover, some of the best data we have right now in some Member States in relation to GDP and having avoided the third recession are simply due to the action of the European Central Bank and also to the fall in the price of oil; in any case, not the shaker that is presented to us in the Annual Growth Study as the only way out. I have to say that structural reforms in most Member States have been socially very damaging and have been a key factor in the problem of devaluation. Competitiveness gains are being highly questioned; for example, in my country right now we are once again in deficit in the trade balance, so the strategy I had designed has not worked. On the other hand, fiscal consolidation, in some cases, has gone too fast and made things worse, and here, of course, we are going to discuss a lot with the rapporteur, Mrs Beres, in the report on the assessment of economic governance, on how all this is adjusted. Because flexibility always applies ex post when it is already inevitable and ex ante is not allowed to give Member States space and scope to deal with a recession situation. And finally, the investment. The Juncker Plan is obviously not a serious plan to encourage investment. We have the European Central Bank doing quantitative easing and a European Investment Bank that has to make an investment plan. And the two plans don't talk to each other.

Of course, we support this plan, but it will only bear fruit if confidence returns. Today, however, we still have SMEs closing their doors, employees who find themselves unemployed, young people leaving Europe for lack of work and, of course, economic insecurity that does not allow companies to invest.  It is time for Europe to regain investor confidence. There is no growth without confidence. And there is no confidence without fiscal consolidation and deleveraging.  I could see the example of Spain, where I visited last week. I have seen that the reforms already undertaken have resulted in lower unemployment and job creation.

Today, Europe has become the sick of the world, with anemic growth and historical economic and social inequalities, both within and among its Member States.  In contrast to its predecessor, it must be acknowledged that Jean-Claude Juncker's current European Commission is beginning to show signs of recognising the problem and wanting to advance ways of asolution. They're positive signs, but they're not enough. The change of agenda cannot be just symbolic. The Commission will have to be much more competent in the management of economic governance in the framework of the European Semester. The Commission must put itself at the helm of this economic governance, the recovery agenda, the convergence agenda. The trends of recent years must be urgently reversed.  2015 is, in this sense, a critical year. Citizens must feel this change in their confidence. The components of the agenda are there in the Commission's proposal, but what matters is how they are implemented.  The Group of European Socialists would have liked to have gone further in its recommendations. However, on each of the issues, the position we will be voting on is clear. It is important to recognise the centrality of investment, and the Juncker Fund is a positive step forward. But it will have to contribute not only to relaunching growth, but also to correcting regional employment inequalities. The selection of beneficiary projects should ensure a positive impact on the most devastated regions. With regard to structural reforms, Parliament recommends an urgent review of their content and a careful assessment, not only of their impact on competitiveness, effectively, but also on social and employment. As far as economic governance is in place, fiscal policies must contribute to the recovery. Countries with room for manoeuvre should use it, and countries in the process of adjusting must be able to use the flexibility provided for in the Stability Pact.

It is crucially important that Member States take ownership of the country—specific recommendations.

The amount of work invested in this process by the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council is clear evidence of this.  Given that the debate is overrunning, I will make only a couple of very short remarks. Concerning the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), prepared by Mr Rosati, I am glad that it supports the three—pillar approach of the Annual Growth Survey and the streamlining of the European Semester. As concerns the report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO), the Council shares the view of the need to further deepen the single market. More than 20 years after its creation, the single market is still far from complete. More work should be invested towards achieving this goal.  In response to the remarks made by the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), Mr Prieto, I would like to say that the Council does recognise the importance of the social dimension of the European Semester. Only two days ago, the EPSCO Council discussed, among other things, such issues as reducing the tax wage on labour, ensuring an adequate level of social protection, and the need to strengthen efforts to fight poverty, social exclusion and inequality. The conclusions adopted by the EPSCO Council provide an important political orientation to our further work. Let me also mention that the lessons—learned exercises that we have conducted, on the Council side, on previous European Semesters recommend further stepping—up of the involvement of political level representatives, including national parliaments, in the European Semester at the national level. I welcome the work you have done in intensifying the interparliamentary dialogue which facilitates the work of national parliaments in this regard. The European Semester is an evolving tool. We have to keep improving its effectiveness as well as its accountability aspect, while also acknowledging that these go further and that they go together. We look forward to continuing the debate with Parliament on how to improve this Semester and the following ones. The Presidency will put all its energy in ensuring an effective European Semester for 2015. The recommendations that will emerge this summer should reflect our common goals and the main challenges of each country. Most importantly, they should be ‘owned’ by the Member States, who will be responsible for putting them into effect.  I would like to use this opportunity to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for the hard work. I believe that the discussion is not over. It shall continue at various levels, for example on 13 March the Transport Council will discuss their contribution to the Synthesis Report.

Of course, we did not agree on everything, but I appreciated their readiness to find reasonable compromises. Now, on the debate, I would like to refer briefly to three points. The first is the recurring theme of austerity. Many colleagues complained that austerity is creating ruin in their countries’ social models. Well, let me remind you once again that austerity measures were simply a necessary reaction, a necessary adjustment to the excessive spending in the period before the crisis. All those countries which had irresponsible budget policies had, of course, to make some cuts, and that is nothing to complain about. Those countries which were prudent in their budgetary policies have not had to resort to austerity. The second point I would like to refer to is the social cost involved in these structural reforms. I very much share the view that there have been social costs involved with fiscal consolidation and reforms. Nevertheless, we have to remember that if wages were growing at a pace much higher than productivity before the crisis, then there is a need for those wages to come down. So we should not be surprised that, in some countries, wages and incomes have had to come down, simply in order to stay in line with productivity. Lastly, as to the point about bureaucrats in Brussels who allegedly imposed restrictions on our countries: this is simply not true. All the Member States agreed on the fiscal rules, and the bureaucrats in Brussels are merely responsible for enforcing them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 141, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Ildikó Gáll-Pelcz", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   Artist. - Mr President, I would like to thank you for your support. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your support. Those who were present at the debate are obviously of the same opinion, which I am expressing, that it was very useful and gave us the opportunity to discuss the proposals contained in the report. At the same time, this debate has highlighted the need for further coordination efforts, for example specifically in the area of internal market integration. We have so much legislation in this area, and they are so convoluted that it is difficult to transpose. This transposition is not only a matter of quantity, but also of quality. Therefore, let us not be reluctant to use indicators that are capable of showing quality transposition. On the other hand, the issue of control and governance. It is very important that if we pass legislation, take measures, then everyone should be equal and not equal and equal. You can't be too big not to be subject to the rules. We cannot apply double standards. As far as the key areas are concerned, I have listed a number of these in my report, but I would like to focus on one: this is a question of the digital internal market, which I believe is the most important task ahead of us. However, believe me, fellow Members, that the generations that grew up in front of computers do not understand why we are talking about the digital internal market when this internal market is so fragmented and we are not taking action to do so. Madam Secretary, I don't understand you either. I do not understand how the Bureau may not feel that the abolition of roaming charges is important for us to build this digital internal market.

I will recall some data from the European Commission itself: the annual growth rate in the European Union as a whole last year was slightly higher than 0%; in 2014, long-term unemployment rose in the European Union by 4 points. 75% of youth unemployment is now long-term unemployment. One in four households in Europe lives at risk of social exclusion. The question is whether we can be conformists with this data. If there is anyone who believes that with this data we do not have to do more and faster to, precisely, turn around a social reality that becomes unbearable for many European citizens. I agree with the change in the european Commission's line of economic and social policy, but we need it to be more ambitious and fairer. We say yes, that we agree with investment, but that they must go to the regions, to the places where there are the most macroeconomic imbalances and where the highest unemployment rate occurs.  That there has to be fiscal responsibility, but, Mr Rosati, fiscal responsibility - he has told us so to the International Monetary Fund, until the OECD - cannot be excessive austerity. It has to be compatible with economic growth and job creation. That fiscal responsibility must be applied using the greater margins of flexibility established by the Stability and Growth Pact so as not to drown in recession. We need fiscal responsibility but above all, I remember, social responsibility. Social responsibility because structural reforms cannot become a mantra in which everything enters. Social responsibility to end the wage devaluation that has pushed millions of workers today to live below the poverty line because their wages do not allow them to live with dignity. 50% of the employment created today, according to the European Commission, is not employment that can take these workers out of active poverty or labour poverty.

On the other hand, the report of the Committee on Economic Affairs takes the opposite of this analysis, referring to the \"success\" of the troika's programmes in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, while calling on other states to show the same ambition in modernising their economies...

Weaknesses in financial markets, over-indebtedness or structural deficits are identified. The Commission is desperately calling for change at national level and for responsibility to be taken. Unfortunately, the Commission's praise for the ECB's current balance sheet expansion follows by buying huge quantities of partly dubious securities. The OECD's latest growth report notes a marked decline in the will to reform in the EU. As a result, after the height of the crisis, many governments have shown a high willingness to reform, which then, as a result of the ECB's discharge, has clearly diminished. In addition to expropriating savers, the ECB is above all slowing down the speed of reform and the will to reform in Europe and postponing problems into the future! The Commission's hope that the Member States will tackle fundamental problems in parallel with ECB activity is therefore highly doubtful. The Juncker package is also likely to mask problems in the short term and strengthen the unwillingness to reform.

I abstained from voting on this codification for several reasons. First of all, the positive developments and reforms already implemented by Montenegro on its way to deeper European integration should be commended. In my opinion, Montenegro is on very good track to become a full member of the EU in the near future. On the other hand, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement itself with Montenegro contains several problematic provisions that I cannot identify with. Among them is the call and support for Montenegro's integration into NATO.

Montenegro will need strong political will to bring about a change in this situation. We are making progress in implementing this important standard for the functioning of a democratic state, but it cannot yet be said that the problem has been averted.

Mr Gáll-Pelcz's report offers a very interesting perspective in the context of our reflection today on the European Semester procedure for the coordination of economic policies. The measures resulting from the objective of completing the internal market are in fact decisive, both those of economic and social policy, in order to ensure the implementation of effective instruments for growth and employment.  I would like to highlight in particular some significant aspects that have led me to strongly support my colleague's report. The emphasis on completing the digital single market seems to me to be particularly important and essential for stimulating growth, creating quality jobs, keeping the European economy globally competitive and bringing benefits to both businesses and consumers. In this context, it will be crucial to ensure a good deal of investment in broadband networks, with a view to achieving the objectives and priorities in the key sector of the digital market.  The completion of the digital single market – many studies confirm this – could produce additional GDP growth of 0.4% (i.e. €520 billion) until 2020, with employment increasing by around 0.1%, equivalent to creating more than 223,000 jobs by 2020.

These are the measures that have led to lower wages, lay-offs, cuts in public investment opposed to economic growth and therefore responsible for increasing the unemployment rate. The report recommends, for example, continued fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, flexicurity, the alignment of wages with productivity and the increase in the retirement age, the promotion of mobility as a means of reducing unemployment in some countries.

The semester is supposed to ensure that countries really take into account the objectives they have set each other at EU level, which is important because their economies are strongly linked. It is good to also include the unification and deepening of the single market in the European Semester, with a particular focus on the Single Energy Market and the Digital Single Market. The Single Market is a tool for boosting economic growth and creating quality jobs in the EU, but more than 20 years after its official establishment it is still not complete. The completion of the Digital Single Market could generate an additional 0.4% GDP growth (EUR 520 billion compared to 2014) by 2020 and an increase in employment of around 0.1% (more than 223 000 new jobs by 2020). The creation of a single energy market, however, would bring greater security to the EU in the area of energy supply and greater independence from Russia.

What protection of children on the internet is it about when it is controlled by monopolistic groups, while the EU and governments ensure their profitability?

On the Internet, children can quickly access material about sexual exploitation or be exposed to it or be subjected to bullying and grooming for sexual purposes. Exposure is exacerbated by increasing accessibility to mobile technology and the Internet. The reporting rate of these acts is very low and therefore the available data on the number of offences committed do not reflect the true scale of this problem, as in the case of 'invisible children' who are victims of trafficking and therefore do not have a legal identity. Unfortunately, less than half of the EU countries have fully implemented directive 2011/93/EC on combating child sexual abuse and child pornography, so implementation needs to be accelerated as much as possible.

I believe, as do you, that we all shared a sense of not only sadness, but also indignation, when we learned on the evening of 27 February of the murder of Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. He was killed just two days before leading a demonstration against the war in Ukraine and the effects of the economic crisis in Russia. On Sunday last week, tens of thousands of citizens in Moscow, but also in other cities, turned these marches into a tribute to a man who served his country as a deputy prime minister in the 1990s and who since then had relentlessly tried to bring his country forward. All 28 European Union Ambassadors, together with our European Union Head of delegation, were united in attending his funeral on Tuesday, joining an impressive crowd. Let me share here the words expressed by President Schulz on Russia’s refusal to let one of you, Ms Kalniete, into Russia to attend his funeral. The same also happened to other representatives of European Union Member States. This goes against the spirit of our visa facilitation agreement and follows similar incidents that have happened already. I remember when Ms Harms and Mr Landsbergis received a similar refusal to enter the country. They joined the words of the President of the European Parliament in saying that this is simply not acceptable. We shall remember Boris as a strong advocate for a modern, democratic and open Russia – a Russia open to the world. He defended values which we all share: respect for human dignity; commitments to democracy and to accountability; belief in civil society as a force. He was opposed to war in Ukraine, and he was gathering evidence on the involvement of Russian troops. Yesterday, here in Strasbourg in this Parliament, I met with Mikhail Kasyanov, who shared his political commitment. For me, it was a way to honour his memory and to express, once again, our sadness at the loss that his family, friends and his colleagues have suffered, and for the gap he leaves in political life in Russia.  But it also gave me a chance to discuss the state of democracy in Russia. Russian citizens deserve no less than a democratic and open Russia. Strengthening political freedoms and supporting the consolidation of democracy are, moreover, objectives set out in the first article of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Russia. We support Russian organisations who are working on improving the legal framework in Russia. In our human rights consultations, we have called on Russia – time and again – to establish a level playing field for political parties by allowing opposition parties to play a role and by ensuring diversity of the media. Looking at the state of democracy in Russia today, we see that freedom of expression is under increased pressure. Opposition parties struggle to exist and to have access to mainstream media. Some have been repeatedly denied registration. The last Duma elections in 2011 were described as ‘slanted in favour of the ruling party’ by OSCE/ODIHR. Remember that the Russian population opposed those practices by taking to the streets, leading to the well—known Bolotnaya Square trials. Individual leaders who emerged from those events are constantly harassed, while others left Russia out of fear for their freedom or for their lives.  This recent assassination brings back to our minds the memories of many others: Natalia Estemirova, Anna Politkovskaya, Stanislav Markelov, Anastasia Baburova, Sergei Magnitsky and Alexander Litvinenko. Journalists, lawyers, intelligence officers, human rights defenders – they had little in common until they became victims of those who portray so—called ‘enemies of the state’ as legitimate targets.  We all know that the conflict in Ukraine has intensified the public discourse against the too—famous Fifth Column. Let us not forget those who face trial in Russia through unfair procedures because of the Ukrainian conflict, such as Nadia Savchenko and Oleg Sentsov, who was arrested in Crimea. The Russian authorities have not only the duty to conduct a full and transparent investigation into the murder of Boris Nemtsov, but they also have to put an end to the climate of suspicion, hatred and intolerance for diversity of opinion.

Most recently, Boris Nemtsov. Shot on a bridge near the Kremlin wall, in a zone (i don't think anyone doubts about it) closely watched by the Russian special services, if only for the protection of the Russian authorities and their headquarters.  Is there democracy in Russia at all? Are there no fair elections in a country where (no doubt) there are fair elections; in a country where the judiciary, despite constitutional provisions, despite a number of constitutional guarantees also as to the observance of citizens' rights, is in principle entirely dependent on power; in a country where there is such extensive propaganda that it is difficult to find anywhere any reliable information about what is happening inside and outside this country, where independent media and NGOs are choked, where fear in any way opposes power; in a country where people who are real opposition must today be called by us not ordinary politicians, as is the case in democratic countries, but simply heroes (because if only looking at the examples that I have mentioned, in fact, every day when they say how power works in Russia, they have to reckon with death) – can we even talk about democracy in such a country? It seems to me that today's Russia has nothing to do with democracy. This proves just how drastically the Russian Constitution is violated on a daily basis. This is demonstrated by the fact that Russia, after all, is a member of the Council of Europe and has signed all the related commitments, and as it observes in internal affairs, we all see.  But it is not only a problem of Russia's actions in the internal sphere, it is also a problem of Russia's actions in the external sphere. It is the first European state to militarily invade another sovereign, independent European state, taking away part of its territory. Today, Vladimir Putin is pleased to say that he gave a secret order a year ago to seize Crimea, and yet a year ago he and Russian politicians said that they had nothing to do with it at all. The \"green men\", however, turned out to be the Russian army. Today, the direct participation of Russia and Russian soldiers in what is happening in Donetsk, in a war in which ukrainians, including civilians, are killed. In a year's time, will we hear that, however, these were Russian soldiers who were officially sent there by the Russian President? Finally, the last point I would like to raise, namely the tragedy in Smolensk five years ago, where a plane crashed with the Polish President on board and people who are extremely important in the sphere of Polish social and political life.

Mikhail Kasyanov was here – also a dear friend – and he was quite clear: we in this Parliament should not look into the mirror and say that we have made mistakes or that the enlargement of NATO was a mistake because it provoked Putin. No, that is nonsense. NATO has brought shelter to the countries in Eastern Europe which are now members of the organisation. Also, Putin knows that ‘it stops’ over there. So the enlargement of NATO did not incite Putin’s policy, which is a long—term policy of crippling the neighbouring countries and of restoring the influence, at least, of the former Soviet Union.

He was killed not only by the gunmen: he was killed, as has been said, by an atmosphere of hatred; he was killed by this propaganda war launched by Putin against the West, against democracy and against all of us. We can see how Russia, Putin’s Russia, is shifting towards the darkest times, similar to the 1930s – it is not a coincidence that the murder of Nemtsov has been mentioned already as a parallel with the murder of Sergei Kirov, which was the start of Stalinist dark times in the Soviet Union. We can see too that this new, emerging neo-Stalinism in Russia is characterised by the very skilful use of new media. In the information war, it is one of the strongest tools for the massive brainwashing of young people in Russia and also all over the world. This is a very dangerous trend. I am sorry to say that Putin’s regime is encouraged by our own reluctance – that of us, the West, democratic public opinion – to recognise the full scale of the threat emerging from these current developments. The European Union should apply relevant counter—measures against this global brainwashing machinery created by Russia because we can see that it is expanding. Now they plan to raise the budget by 40% to be able to communicate not only in English but also in French and German, all over Europe and all over the world.

He called the conflict in Ukraine a painful fratricidal war and a pointless confrontation with Europe's neighbours. He was working on a report on President Putin's role in Ukraine. This morning we did indeed hear former Prime Minister of Russia, Mikhail Kasyanov, in the AFET committee. He, too, came to the conclusion: \"This was a political assassination.\" There is no criticism of President Putin's role in Ukraine. The murder of Boris Nemtsov is a warning to all other political dissidents in Russia.  Let's take a look at the murder investigation: chechens' involvement raises questions. That would link Nemtsov's murder to his public support for Charlie Hebdo. Chechnya's strongman, Kadyrov, defended the prime suspect in the murder on Monday, portraying him as a \"true Russian patriot\" and a \"devout Muslim\" shocked by the caricatures at Charlie Hebdo. Nemtsov regularly accused Kadyrov of intimidating journalists and in November called for an investigation into the involvement of Chechen fighters in eastern Ukraine. But no, as Kasyanov also confirmed this morning, he has spoken out against Muslims or against Islam. On the contrary, he was always an advocate of tolerance. The main suspect in this Russia is out of suspicion. For years, Putin's regime has created a climate of distrust and hatred of dissidents. He calls the opposition the \"fifth column.\" Meanwhile, the ultimate fear of the opposition becomes reality: the assassins have been arrested, but the principals remain at large. I certainly call on the Russian opposition not to be weakened. For our part - and I quote Mikhael Kasyanov again - we must clearly demonstrate to Putin that we will continue to defend and protect our values and stick to our democratic principles!

Of course, what we demand from the Russian authorities is the swift and timely revelation of all the facts they know, but we have the suspicion that this may not extend to telling the whole story. After all, the official report on the murder of Sergei Kirov is still that a lone murderer was responsible. There have been other cases, like the murders of Anna Politkovskaya and numerous others, which raise the question as to how far the Kremlin is actually willing to go in preventing atrocities happening to opposition politicians. If standing in elections as an opposition candidate puts your life at risk, and if standing up for values and criticising the policies of your government puts your life or your freedom at risk, then this calls into question the degree of democracy in the country concerned. If Russia is a democracy then it should respond to acts of terror like this in the way that democracies do.

I would start from here, because I think there is a unifying line in this Hemicycle – I always try to look for such lines – and this is the need for our strong, constant commitment to engage with Russian society. I think we need to do that when it comes to people—to—people contacts, and we need to do it when it comes to young people in Russia. I also had the chance to discuss this yesterday with our Russian friend. There is a risk of losing entire parts, major parts, of Russian society – especially the young generations – to the idea that Europe is not an enemy. Europe is a space for cooperation and democracy, for the Russian people too. I think this is something we have to build, especially in these difficult times.  To those of you who called for an overall strategy towards Russia from the European Union, let me welcome very much these words. Let me welcome very much this plea which some of you have raised in this Chamber and which reflects some of the national parliaments’ thinking. I was happy to discuss that with Members of the House of Lords in London recently. You might be aware of their recent report on the crisis Ukraine, but also on relations of the European Union with Russia. I think there is a need to collectively think on how we engage – as some of you have mentioned – on our positive tools to engage with the Russian population. We do not have to be afraid of this discussion, just as Boris was not afraid of thinking of difficult things in the difficult conditions he was operating in politically. We also have to ask ourselves the difficult questions and one of these difficult questions today is: how do we effectively, in the best possible way, support dynamics in Russian society, or at least prevent them from being completely removed from public debate?  I will come back to ask for your support when engaging in this difficult exercise, because we have to be clear. Some of you have mentioned very clearly that we have, on the one hand, a strong and sound policy that also includes sanctions. On the other hand, maybe we have to say it more clearly and more boldly: what do we do with the Russian people and with Russia as a big state that is not only its leadership? This part of our work will need courageous, consistent and maybe thinking a little bit ‘out of the box’ in the coming months. However, we should not necessarily be trapped by the rhetoric that we use – it is not only rhetoric, it is also action and we need that – but we need to complement that with our positive actions towards the Russian population. Some of you also mentioned very openly the need to keep channels of dialogue open. If we do not do that, it is clear that we will hear more and more about that.  I will close with one point that was mentioned by many: the need to increase our strategic communication to counter propaganda. We have started this work. It is obviously not and it will never be about counter—propaganda, because it is not in our DNA or in our political understanding. This is not something we can do or will be interested in doing. However, it is a matter of supporting media freedom and freedom of expression. It is also a matter of providing accurate information to large sections of the Russian—speaking population in Russia and in our own countries. We have started to work on that. We will discuss that too in the European Council, in the Foreign Affairs Council in the coming months. This is an area in which the European Union has an added value: working to support those who are doing an excellent job when it comes to transparent and full information, and to support a greater explanation of European values and principles in all parts of the European continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2563, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Dita Charanzová (ALDE)", "mepid": "124708", "text": "  in writing. – Boris Nemtsov’s death is a tragedy.

Parliament once again expresses its support for the democratic forces in Russia in favour of an open society and a reformist agenda. Parliament rightly insists once again on calling on the Council to define a unified policy towards Russia, stressing the priority of human rights and the need for concrete gestures to put an end to the repression of freedom of expression, assembly and association. We said this recently in the urgent resolution on human rights in the Navalny case: the Commission and the European External Action Service draw up a more ambitious programme of support for Russian civil society in Russia and identify new opportunities for starting a dialogue to promote the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  It is precisely at this stage in the programming of the Union's financial instruments that every effort is made to increase financial assistance to Russian civil society through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, as well as funding for civil society organisations and local authorities, as well as to include the EU-Russia Civil Society Forum in the partnership instrument in order to ensure sustainable and credible long-term support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2566, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Indrek Tarand (Verts/ALE)", "mepid": "97136", "text": "  in writing. – It is difficult to believe, that the assassination of the leader of the opposition Boris Nemtsov, right after he promoted a rally condemning the war in Ukraine, and just before he was due to publish a report containing evidence of Russian involvement in the war, is coincidental.

Madam President, Madam Vice-President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. We have been in a position of foreign and security policy for about twelve months – it is precisely the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea – that we did not have before. This is a completely new situation – in the east of our continent, in North Africa, in Syria and Iraq – a development that requires us to have a new debate on our priorities. That is why we also support the Idea of the High Representative for a European Security Strategy and would like to participate in it. The European Parliament sees four new priorities for the common foreign policy: our first priority is to maintain and strengthen the European peace order. This is necessary after Russia has broken international law. We need to find out how this international law is being re-applied in Europe. We must make this clear: it is not just about Ukraine, it is about security as a whole. That is why sanctions must be maintained until the Minsk agreement is respected and implemented and Ukraine cannot regain effective control of its own borders. We also have to review the Neighbourhood Policy as a whole, as envisaged, in order to make it more operational and also to set political priorities. Secondly, we see that the stabilisation of our southern neighbourhood is also very important. I think the idea is right that this does not have to be one, because it needs different methods, has different objectives, but we need to get the regional players on board. When we see that this means, in particular, that the Islamic states also have to assume their own responsibilities here in order to put their region in order, and we can help with this, that seems to me to be an important task, as King Abdullah said very convincingly yesterday in this House. Thirdly, we must strengthen the international order: the issue of climate protection, the reform of the UN Security Council, compliance with the Non-Proliferation Pact – for example, the Iran negotiations, which are an important part of such a strategy. But other actors, such as China and Russia, must also take responsibility to bring about a stable and secure global order. Fourthly, we also need to change our internal ways of working and structures. I believe that we can achieve greater coherence between the different policy areas, actors and levels – the development of the External Action Service is a big step, but there is still a need for improvement. However, I think it is good that the High Representative is taking her role as Vice-President of the Commission seriously and that we now have the opportunity, by clustering, to make good use of the hybrid situation of the different responsibilities of the European Union's external relations and to move closer to our goal. But that also means that we have to respect the agreements here. These are not only the information structures, but also, for example, the composition of the staff – one third, two thirds, even in the higher positions, including ambassadors, which seems to have not been respected in recent years. But I think it is also important to move forward with a strengthening of our common security and defence policy. The proposal to set up a European army is a good visionary objective. However, we must now ensure, for example in view of the summit, that we make use of the possibilities provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon and finally initiate permanent structural cooperation. The issues relating to the strengthening of the EEAS, issues relating to procurement and research, seem to me to be important points in order to improve our possibilities. The Member States of the European Union spend three times as much money as Russia on defence and have more soldiers than the United States of America, but with far less operational results. Our taxpayers are entitled to have more results for less money through the creation of European synergy effects. That is why we ask you, High Representative, to present this at the summit in June and to come up with concrete proposals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2569, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, first of all let me take the opportunity to pay tribute to the long-standing support of this Parliament for a strong European Union in the world. I also want to commend the vision and the perseverance of the rapporteur Elmar Brok. I know he has called for many years for the European Union to develop a more proactive, forward-looking approach to its foreign policy – in other words to develop a more strategic view of its role in the world, and let me say that I could not agree more with this kind of approach. Today’s debate is for me mainly a good opportunity to listen to good ideas, to learn from your insight. In the spirit of your report I also take it as a chance to look above and beyond the immediate crises that garner our attention and frustrations as well. Indeed, the breadth, depth and complexity of the challenges we face is such that we cannot afford other than to do many things, and rather fast, at the same time. First, obviously, we must tackle decisively and with all our instruments together the immediate and urgent crises we face on our doorsteps, from Ukraine to Libya. I would say that we have the opportunity every month to discuss – not just in plenary but also in the Commission, in the committee – many of those, and we will have a debate on Libya further on in the afternoon.  This crisis requires a sort of 24/7 attention. We have just had an informal foreign affairs meeting in Riga last Friday and Saturday, which I debriefed the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) on, and we are going to have a Foreign Affairs Council on Monday on, in particular, the crisis in Ukraine and the situation in Libya. This was also the core of my talks on Monday with the UN Secretary-General in New York, and the content of my briefing to the UN Security Council, also on Monday. I guess most of your interventions will also come back to the crisis issue so I might be relatively briefer on that and pay a little bit more attention at this stage to the rest of it because, secondly, while we do everything possible to solve the tragic situations in our Neighbourhood, we must also work to strengthen our partnerships with other regions and key players which, distant as they may seem, are also essential to build the rules—based global order that is advocated by your report. This is essential to manage the emergencies of today, to prevent the crises of tomorrow, and to shape the order of the future, as we cannot really say we have a world order today. I can mention TTIP and its crucial economic and geopolitical importance; or Latin America and the Caribbean which we will discuss in April at the Foreign Affairs Council as a strategic item ahead of the summit CELAC will hold in June; Asia, rightly highlighted by your report, or indeed Africa, where we must build a new relationship based on the logic of a true partnership among equals. We will have a full discussion on Africa next Monday with the Foreign Ministers.  Our relations with international and regional organisations, be it the UN, the League of Arab States, the African Union, ASEAN, or CELAC, are of paramount importance in this regard and, as recommended in your report, they take a significant amount of my energy.  In this context, I also want to mention two international negotiations that will shape the contours of the future in a decisive way and where we are engaging diplomatically, but also politically, at all levels with our partners: climate change and post-2015.  We have a special responsibility and a special role to play as Europeans, and we will discuss mainly the issue of post-2015 with the Development Ministers tomorrow but, as you might know, I decided to work on a diplomatic action plan at the beginning of last January to make sure that we get to the Climate Conference in Paris in December with not only good and concrete results, but also a clear leadership role for the European Union. This is what the world expects from us, and our citizens, too. Third, while we do all that, which means tackling the crises, developing partnerships and negotiating the agreements that should underpin a better world, we must also think further to develop the kind of strategic ammunition that will enable the European Union to be more effective and influential in the future. We cannot hide behind the routines of the past. The biggest risk in these risky times is, I think, not to take any risk, because the European Union can and must do more and better than that, better than developing partnerships, negotiating agreements, managing crises and hopefully solving them. This is necessary but it is not sufficient and it would certainly be enough already for a 24/7 commitment. But in these times of turbulence and often unprecedented changes – as you rightly said – we need to develop a new, broader and more ambitious approach. We need to start thinking in a really strategic way. As part of this strategic work, I should of course mention the work I have launched on the future of the European Security Strategy – or rather the European Security and Foreign Policy Strategy, as we might possibly find we need to do – but also the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the preparation of the June European Council on Defence which we will have the chance to debate in May on the basis of the Danjean report.  Our duties do not, of course, end here and, as your report rightly underlines, the European Union must be a credible actor if it is to succeed in any of these challenges. So we must make the European Union, including its policies and tools, faster, flexible and more effective. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the many ideas included in this report. I have to say that I agree with most of them and I am actually already implementing many of them, including three very important ones to me.  First of all, playing my role as Vice—President to the full to improve the coherence and consistency of our internal and external policies: not just the group of external Commissioners that meets regularly every month – and more than once a month sometimes – but also the work we are doing together with other Commissioners and Vice—Presidents on energy, counter—terrorism and security, and migration, just to mention a few. Migration will be tackled at the next Foreign Affairs Council, together with Commissioner Avramopoulos, as we need to cross the lines between the internal and external instruments we have. Second, the work to increase coordination between the European Union and the European Union Member States, looking for synergies and common action – I think the work we have undertaken on Bosnia and Herzegovina is a perfect example of that – and ensuring that initiatives of the European Union Member States are developed into a broader and more effective European Union framework, as was the case for the Minsk Agreement and the negotiations that were conducted in the Normandy Format. Third, to make the Foreign Affairs Council more strategic and operational in its working methods. Here let me, maybe, try to make a suggestion also about the working methods of this Parliament; maybe we could find ways of having a more strategic and focused way of working in plenary for our sessions too.  This work is big, your report is very comprehensive and time is short, but I will try to address some elements that are key to me. First, the European Security Strategy. Eleven years ago Javier Solana did some excellent work which is still very inspiring, still referring to an endeavour that was putting the European Union in the condition of being the most prosperous and secure which, I am afraid, is definitely not the case anymore. Everything has changed and we have changed very much as well. It is important to take stock of the dramatic changes in the landscape surrounding us, changes affecting both our more immediate proximity and the world at large and, in fact, in Europe as well. This is why, as I announced in Parliament some time ago, I have launched a process of strategic reflection to guide European Union foreign security policy. The new strategy will give us a sense of direction and the ability to set priorities and to make choices. It should also help us determine how best to mobilise all our instruments and develop partnerships to serve our common goals. My intention is go through successive steps. As a first step, I intend to identify the changes which have occurred and the challenges and opportunities they present the European Union with. At the same time, I intend to assess the performance of the European Union policies – CFSP and CSDP as well as external EU policies – against this challenging backdrop. Is the European Union up to the task? This is the big question we have to answer. The next step should be the strategy itself: a common vision identifying the ground for common actions. A common European interest identifying our role in the world should also help develop a narrative to communicate our foreign policy to a wider audience and make it a collective, common tool. This is why, although it is a task that I am honoured to take on myself as a responsibility, I see it as a collective effort.  European policy and even more than that, European foreign policy, is first of all about effective teamwork. Sometimes I am accused of being naïve on that, but I really do think working together is the key to successful diplomatic and political work when it comes to foreign security policy. I am reaching out, even in these weeks and days, not only to governments, but also to think tanks, NGOs, the foreign policy community at large, and certainly to parliaments: national parliaments, as well as the European Parliament. Such an engagement with the European Parliament is for me a real added value and I am certain it will continue throughout the process. Anyway, today we are expected to discuss not just the Strategic Review, because we will have opportunities to do so in the months that will come, but the report which Parliament has prepared on the basis of the report adopted by the Council. I took the liberty of introducing the discussion with some remarks on our strategic approach to foreign policy to underline the convergence of views between what I am personally trying to do and the course of action which is advocated in Parliamentʼs report in this specific respect. The Neighbourhood is the first and more immediate test of this ambition. If Europe does not succeed in addressing the difficult crises and challenges it faces in the immediate proximity of its borders, it cannot be the credible international actor which Parliamentʼs report rightly calls for the European Union to be. Thinking and acting more strategically in our neighbourhood is an imperative. We have launched the review of the European neighbourhood policy (ENP). It was about one decade ago that the European Union adopted our neighbourhood policy. It was meant to bring stability and prosperity all around us and, I can say, 10 years afterwards, that reality has severely tested this noble aspiration.  In all fairness, there are a few qualified success stories in our Neighbourhood. I could cite Georgia and Moldova to the east, Tunisia and Morocco to the south or the way in which Lebanon and Jordan, whose strategic importance is rightly emphasised in the report, are coping with the daunting challenge of accommodating millions of refugees, and I would like here to thank his Majesty the King of Jordan for the excellent words he addressed to this Chamber yesterday.  To be sure, a reviewed ENP would not alone solve the crises; not for sure in Ukraine, in Libya or in Syria. But it might equip countries like Moldova, Georgia, Tunisia, Morocco, and perhaps Jordan and Lebanon, with state structures and resources to resist external and internal pressures more effectively, and also provide us Europeans with the truly equal political partnership we need to work effectively in our region, to make common interests, as we have common challenges, emerge and to develop partnerships that are able to make us more effective in the region. We need to reflect on what has gone right and wrong in the ENP and we should not shy away from the challenge of revisiting the scope of the neighbourhood itself, so as to take into proper account, for example, the link with Africa, as suggested by the report itself.  We also need to look further into differentiation which Parliamentʼs report identifies as a key ingredient for future policies. We are conducting a deep and wide consultation and we need to strengthen local ownership of the policy by our partners and make sure that their views on the policy become central too. We need to be more strategic on all our policies, all of them. We need to broaden our understanding of development. 2015 is a crucial year for us – it is the European Year for Development. It is also the year where we negotiate the post-2015 Development Agenda and the Millennium Development Goals have shown us that setting goals for ourselves helps us in advancing, but we have also seen some of the limits. We did not sufficiently take into account the interconnections between development, human rights, and peace and security.  The European Union is uniquely placed to make a contribution to a more comprehensive, effective, development policy. We need to connect the dots to make the difference: by focusing on all dimensions of development, by working with all partners around the globe, including the new players, and by addressing shortcomings in our own societies for the sake of equality, but also for our own credibility.  Another policy where we need more strategic thinking is, for sure, our policy on defence. We have to finally build a common European political will that will make it possible for us to use all the tools we already have in the Treaty, as the rapporteur just mentioned. I know I can count not only on my personal efforts and conviction but also on the commitment, in this respect, of all of you. I know how this Parliament is strongly committed to developing such a policy. We will devote a specific debate to this issue in May, but let me say that the European Council on defence in June is first of all very important: it is on defence; secondly, it should be more than a stocktaking exercise. To be credible, our words must be matched with deeds and the narrative is clear. If defence, as the European Council has established, matters now even more than ever, and the European Union has to act as a provider of security, it needs to be backed with proper capabilities and a stronger defence industry. And here, let me recall the words of Mr Brok about the role of the European Defence Agency and I am personally committed to increasing its role. Parliamentʼs report rightly reminds us that the full potential of the Treaty has still to be fully used: for example, the provisions on permanent structured corporation. Let me assure you about my personal commitment to building a political space for a European defence to be developed. And here we will need to work together to make sure that the Member States, public opinion, and national parliaments will be on board in this exercise.  The next debate we have on the agenda will allow us to discuss another important element on which we will need to be more strategic – our human rights policy, which I consider to be essential – as well as others which I will refer to very quickly but which we can come back to in the debate on this, be it energy, counterterrorism or migration. These are fields where we need to work not only inside the Commission in a cross—sectorial way, but also among these different institutions – the Commission, the Council and Parliament – in a more coordinated way. I know I have been too long, so let me stop here. I just would like to finish with two general remarks, or rather reminders. First, the old dividing lines between foreign and domestic policies are, I think, a thing of the past. The European Unionʼs best answer to the new reality we are facing is to cross the lines between foreign and domestic policies. We will only be able to project our power, be it soft or hard, outside if we are strong inside. A strong CFSP needs a powerful European Union in the first place and this is a task that concerns all of us. Second, let us not be confused or naive. If our Member States want to master their fate in today’s fast changing and difficult world they can only do it by thinking and acting together. We can persist in the illusory satisfaction of multiple national strategies that might sound very good on paper but lead, as we have painfully learned in our history, to unavoidable deception. Or, we can be truthful to ourselves and to each other and invest in our collective power as the only reasonable path to a future where our views and aspirations matter.  The old narrative about a clash between national and European interests is simply wrong, is simply out of time. Strong policy does not call for Member States to give up their foreign policies; on the contrary each country would serve better its national interest by maximising our common action with their strength and expertise. Strong European Union, what I have not hesitated to call in this very same Chamber a superpower, is simply the only alternative to the mistakes of the past or the fortress of the future. Some have forgotten the tragic and repeated mistakes of our European history and let me say: I have not. Others resort to the politics of fear and the illusion that we can lock ourselves into a fortress Europe: I do not. If we do not tackle the problems of the world, the problems of the world will come to us.  Common foreign and security policy is not just about diplomacy or security. It is above all, as you know very well in this House, about political will. We face tough choices and Europe needs to be pragmatic and ambitious at once: we need high ambitions; we need common sense and collective action. I know I can count on you to overcome the temptation of the old way of thinking because in the next few years our choices will matter more than we can already imagine today.

My task is more complicated because I have to tackle the budget side of foreign policy and, as you know, that is not always easy.

I think we always knew that for foreign policy in the European Parliament we should ring Elmar Brok, who has been a long-standing chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) and a guarantor of continuity in our strategic foreign policy thinking. Therefore, I thank him for a very good report which suggests the main aspects we should work towards – namely the credibility of our international action, the comprehensive character of using all aspects of our work, including political, security, defence, economic, trade, development, humanitarian leverage, and especially trying to have the flexibility on a budgetary level to use the global actor role for the European Union that we are all working for.

Mr Brok’s report starts correctly with a thorough analysis of the current strategic environment, noting that our neighbourhood – both east and south – is in turmoil, while the EU has become inward—looking. Defence, where the latest developments indicate a change of security paradigm in Europe, is another field of attention. Through the illegal annexation of Crimea, Russia gets a new Kaliningrad—type of outpost, this time on the Black Sea. The author considers that the EU could and should do more with respect to defence – exemplifying with territorial defence relations with NATO, the fight against cyber-attacks and the response to new phenomena, such as the hybrid war employed by Russia against Ukraine. Under the new circumstances created by the illegal annexation of Crimea and the subsequent destabilisation of Ukraine, relations with Russia, including in the energy sector, require a revisitation. With respect to the southern neighbourhood, the report is asking for a thorough revision of the policy instruments and methods employed by the EU, unequivocally condemning ISIS, what it represents, its ruthless, inhuman tactics and illegal dealings generating important financial resources. The usual references to other countries and regions of interest to the EU, the backbone of the previous reports, are now placed in the larger perspective of the global world order. In that context, Mr Brok underlines the importance of strengthening Transatlantic relations, particularly through the signing of the TTIP, the strategic answer of the West to all challenges in the current world order, allowing for the continuation of Western centrality to the current international system. In conclusion, this report is a new, substantive and therefore valuable approach by the Parliament to the High Representative/Vice-President’s external activity on behalf of the EU.

My Group, the ECR, is particularly delighted by the strong wording shown in solidarity with Ukraine. The emerging threats now seen in the European neighbourhood region increase the importance of diversifying our Member States’ energy supplies away from the exclusive sourcing from Russian gas in particular.

The Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union is already fifteen years old and perhaps this is already sufficient reason in itself to initiate strategic reflections on this policy. However, there are also two very substanent reasons for this. The first is the difficulties faced by the European Union in implementing foreign and security policy, which is very clearly indicated in this report, which of course destroys in many respects the credibility of the European Union and the achievement of those objectives that it could. The most important difficulties mentioned in this report, which I repeat here and welcome that they were mentioned because it is important to face the problem in order to solve it, is the lack of uniqueness and coordination of certain policies of the European Union, in particular the foreign and internal policies of the European Union and the policies of the European Union and its Member States. Another equally important reason for the new strategic reflection of the European Union's foreign and security policy has been particularly exacerbated by the environmental situation of the European Union, unprecedentedly, as the report says, from the very beginning of European integration. That is why the European Union is unable to achieve its objectives and have that impact on creating peace and stability in the world, especially in its immediate surroundings, which it can, given its strength.  That is why I call on the High Representative, together with the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, to embark on a rethinking of the European Union's new strategic policy in the foreign and security area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2580, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Sabine Lösing", "mepid": "96854", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I repeat here the words of Pope Francis: we are in the middle of the Third World War, but in a war in instalments. There are economies that, in order to survive, must wage war. So they produce and sell weapons. Now Mr Juncker wants to show teeth and calls for a willingness to protect the so-called European values with a European army. I do not want to debate here whether such an army would be realistic at all. But the question is what European values are meant here. In my view, it is about fighting and implementing neoliberal policies. However, this does not improve the lives of people in countries such as.B southern or eastern neighbourhoods. For the southern neighbours, this meant that the trade deficit soared to more than twenty-fold between 2006 and 2010. The resulting impoverishment was also a trigger for the Arab uprisings of 2011. Heavy industry in the eastern regions of Ukraine is likely to perish, and the people there will not all benefit from the free trade area. These, too, are reasons for conflict, certainly not the only ones. But the report lacks any criticism of one's own policies. Poverty is and remains one of the main causes of conflict in the world.

I think it is a very strong text, and of course, he was also very generous as a negotiating partner and I welcome very much that approach, which should be exemplary to all other negotiations within this House. I believe personally that this text could serve in the future as an anchor in our debate. This could be a point to which we can return to work out future agreements in our discussions, be it about the European foreign and security policy, be it about defence or be it about neighbourhood policy. This can serve as a basic text to which we can return in order to find the minimum common ground on which we can work out the necessary broad consensus, without which a European common and foreign policy might not work.

The coherence of the European Union's foreign and security policy is crucial, given the increase in tensions in the immediate neighbourhood of the European Union, both in the south and in the east. The current conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a serious challenge to the unity of the European Union, which has been pretty well managed so far, but this line must continue to be held. Also, conflicts in the European Union's southern neighbourhood require us to be united and strong. We must try to intervene more courageously in the offer and search for solutions to these conflicts. The European Union has a good experience of mediating serbia and Kosovo, and this power and experience must also be used in other regions in search of solutions. However, a consular function should also be added to the European External Action Service, at least in the event of major crises, so that citizens of European Union countries can also receive assistance from the Network of European Union Representations around the world. However, the biggest challenge of the European Union's external security policy is how to deal with a situation where the soft power of the European Union has collided with Russian weapons. Standing up for democratic freedoms and protecting human rights are levers that have a positive impact on both countries that have problems with it and Europe itself. Above all, it is in Europe's interest for our immediate neighbourhood to calm down and democratise, and to do so, the European Union must continue with a clear enlargement policy and a neighbourhood policy. If the European Union is successful in its immediate neighbourhood, it can be expected to succeed further afield.

In the case of the Ukrainian war, the European Union experienced the traumatic experience of Russian cyberwar and malware with the Greek code name \"Urvoros\", the mythical snake that eats its tail, paralyzing Ukraine's armed forces and services, facilitating the work of the Russian armed forces. An integral part of modern strategy is cyber deterrence.  The second issue I want to raise is the war on terror that threatens us from everywhere.

Our governments cannot continue to cheapple taxpayers' money and compromise the security of our societies in the face of cross-border threats, which no Member State can face alone, such as terrorism. As Mr Brok's report points out, it is now impossible to separate internal security from external security. Strategic and coordinated investment in the necessary capabilities is required. We have the instruments but we lack strategic guidance and ambition. Just look at almost Somalia on our doorstep in Libya, by omission of Europe after the fall of Gaddafi. If the Union wants to defend its citizens and their interests and assert itself as a global security provider, then it must tidy up the house and implement the foreign policy and the common security and defence policy, strategically linking the whole spectrum of internal and external policies.

It must deal, before waving at the European army, to establish a permanent headquarters and to strengthen the industrial and technological defence base that it has been destroying with austerity policies.

As a result, swift and effective efforts are needed to protect European values and interests, restore and preserve peace and stability. This is particularly the case in the light of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which has been going on for more than a year, which is taking place in the neighbourhood of the European Union.

First of all, as in the report, many of you came back on the issue of lack of coordination. On the European Union level and internal-external policies among different European Union institutions: some of you might remember that at the beginning of October I started my hearing in the Committee on Foreign Affairs by saying that I would be satisfied if at the end of my five years in office I could hear that services were working with me as the European Union, instead of as the Commission, the Council, the EAS and so on. I think that is still very much a challenge. I cannot pretend that I have changed that after four months in office. It will need much more time, much more effort, but I can tell you that, when it comes to a stronger coordination between the work we do in the Council, the work we do in the Commission, the work we do with the European Parliament, we are making very relevant steps. I would not call it a revolution but it is something that is close to it in cultural terms. Think of the work we have done on the internal—external coordination. I think that it will be the first time that foreign ministers are going to discuss migration – that will be on Monday – with Commissioner Avramopoulos. If you see the innovation that the report calls for – this Commissioners’ Group on External Action – you see the core group that was established as something already ambitious. It has five Commissioners as a starting point, but at the last meeting on 4 March (last week) and the previous one, and the previous previous one we had ten Commissioners around the table. This included vice-presidents: Vice—President Georgieva when we discussed the budget, on how we prioritise inside the Commission and the proposal on how we use the budget on Heading 4; and Vice-President Šefčovič when we discussed energy or climate. If I could list all the different elements we have started to work on together on the Commission side in these four months, which is not an enormous amount of time, I can mention climate, energy, research, economic cooperation and development, culture – that was mentioned by Silvia Costa – security and counter-terrorism – here again we have been putting together all the different aspects and the tools available – migration, trade, and obviously development, humanitarian aid and our enlargement policies. Obviously this is a start. Obviously we still have a lot of difficulties and obviously we will still be fighting against a lot of difficulties but I think if I see these first four months in the light of the next four and a half years I can say I am encouraged by the steps that we have been able to take. When it comes to another difficulty that some of you have mentioned – some people in this room have said that Member States do not and cannot share a common policy. Well, you will be surprised to see how much Member States are sharing when it comes to deciding together. I always give this example: take the doorstep statements that the ministers make when they go to the Foreign Affairs Council and you will see all shades of different positions but the important thing to me is that we go through a process, not only in the meetings themselves but actually an everyday process, so that when it comes to take decisions we are all united. All the 28. Obviously I know very well we still have a long way to go. In October, I said in front of the Foreign Affairs Committee that my challenge is to shape a common foreign and security policy, one that is felt to be owned by everyone in Europe, because I know we are not there yet. I know that very well. What I see is that crises around us, starting from the crisis in Ukraine, are telling us, are telling our Member States, are telling the governments, are telling the national parliaments, are telling your fellow parliamentarians in your respective Member States that, yes, we do have an added value when we manage to decide and to act together as Europeans. If we did not have a European common reaction on the Ukrainian crisis, think of that. Think of where we would be here today. Even the Member States that are traditionally, historically more reluctant to see the added value of the common foreign and security policy at European level, I think after this past year have realised very well that a European common foreign and security policy is an added value also for their own national interests. Obviously we have to make this emerge more and more. It is not only but it is also a matter of narrative and visibility, as someone has mentioned. It is a matter of making the common interest and the common added value emerge. This will take time. This will take respect and I am fully ready to go through this process, taking the time and taking the respect we will need to have everybody on board. Everybody! I would not exclude anyone from the exercise because I see in everyday work that there is a need for that and there is also the willingness for that. Then obviously we all have internal national debates, we all have internal national electoral constraints and I understand that sometimes this reflects also in the debates in this room, which is natural. The real substance of the process is that we know, all of us, that without common real foreign policy each of our Member States will not have the means to respond to the challenges we have in front of us. Many of you mentioned, and this comes up also when we talk about security and defence, a sentence that was used by President Juncker in an interview a couple of days ago, which is something I think he has said in front of this Parliament in July. I was still a minister at the time, but that was something that I think he has always said throughout his whole life. What I think – and what I have also discussed not only with him but with many others – is something that I know this Parliament shares: that finally we have to use the tools that we have when it comes to common defence policy. Use the treaties, use the articles of the treaties that we are currently not using because we still need to build the political will that will allow us to use our full potential. I think that here we have a space to develop and to use in the coming years. This will be difficult in some national endeavours for sure but, again, crises around us tell us very clearly that the provisions that are there in the Lisbon Treaty are not there by chance. They are there because we need to use them, in strong cooperation with NATO, and not only with NATO but with other international organisations, starting with the UN and regional organisations. Many of you mentioned a series of issues that it would probably be too long to go into but I will just underline a couple of them. Starting from the Balkans, I will take this opportunity to correct myself. I always refer to fYROM. It happens sometimes, especially when you deal 24/7 with crises and jetlag, that you make a mistake, and I apologise for that because I always stick to the formal, official recognised name and I discussed that with the Greek authorities as well. Starting from the Balkans, where we now tend not think of it as a foreign policy dimension because it is part of our family somehow, this is the success story we can tell. Exactly 20 years after Srebrenica, look how much the investment in peace and European integration and regional integration can bring in terms of good results to the region. I share the view that somebody expressed: we also need to be self-confident and highlight the positive results of our policies. I will underline Latin America. Some of you asked for a relaunch of relations. I am fully committed to that. I started working with CELAC in view of the first summit in June. I have been to the CELAC summit in January and I will be visiting Latin America again before June. This is an area where a little bit of our serious, committed cooperation can develop a huge potential for both. We have to do the same in Africa and in Asia. There is not a single place in the word where we can afford not to invest politically. We have the time, the energy and the resources to do so. Another two elements I would like to underline. Yes, on cyber security. Many of you mentioned the need to give more attention to cyber security in our strategies and in our work, something we are already doing, in cooperation with NATO as well, and on strategic communication. We had that discussion just before we took this issue onto the agenda on Russia. Working on strategic communication, not only on Russian but on Arabic, is key to our policy. This might sound a small element but to me it is a very important element as a sign of strategic thinking and acting, in view of the cultural outreach that we need so much and of which His Majesty the King of Jordan was reminding us yesterday. If we want to build partnerships and cooperation and tools of partnership and cooperation we have to start from this very natural basis, which is also the mutual cultural respect that is at the basis of a partnership among equals.

Mr President, High Representative, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work and for the work she has Thank you very much for your two statements. I believe that the further focus on strategic challenges, which Mr Millin Mon has raised, with the Americas, the intensification of China policy and a greater focus on India – which has so far failed – and the context of all policies, is also very important. As well as migration. We can no longer separate internal and external security. How a comprehensive approach can be taken, how these can be put together, is of great importance. We will not be able to allay our concerns about migration in our countries, with the serious consequences they have for political developments, as well as the false fears of it and concerns about internal security, if we do not succeed in tackling the causes. The people of Africa must have a chance for the future, civil wars must be prevented. If this is not resolved, we will not end the floods of refugees, we should see that. And this in a region of the world that is seen as a paradise of wealth. However, let me make one final point – and you have already pointed this out in your opening remarks – namely the definition of interests. What interests can be enforced by one of our nation states alone in the fight against terror and for peace, in terms of our peace-building role in the world and the question of our trade, as well as the consequences of migration and climate change? Many of our Member States are still pretending to be able to do so at home. They conduct a purely national discourse, and act in this way to the outside world, in their travel activities. If we do not understand that we need to develop common interests and realise that sometimes we have to give up a little bit of our nationals in order to reach common positions, we are no longer in a position to regain sovereignty for our peoples. Sovereignty exists only if you have the strength to stand up for it. Not a single European country has the real capacity to deal with such crises on its own. That is why, under the Treaty of Lisbon, the Member States are called upon to be loyal to the promotion of common external security. There is a contract article that indicates this.

This vision is clearly subservient to NATO and the transatlantic alliance and runs counter to the interests of the nation-states of Europe. An equally worrying dimension for the independence of European nations is that of a stated desire to create a concretely indefinite but ideologically marked world order. The means to achieve this fatal stage for peoples and their freedoms are partly described through the dream of a single market for cybersecurity products.

Similarly, European external action must be implemented according to a comprehensive strategy, the main pillars of which, in addition to the protection of human rights, should be investment in education, which is part of the EU's humanitarian policy. In the context of future foreign policy challenges, there is also a reform of migration policy in order to prevent as far as possible the tragedies of illegal immigrants trying to enter the Union and to strengthen integration policies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament's report on human rights is an important tool for assessing the policies implemented by the European Union. I would like to highlight the important work done by the Special Representative right away. With this report we have chosen a thematic approach instead of a geographical one and we think it is very useful, because it identifies some guidelines on which to engage the European Parliament, the European Commission itself and individual Commissioners in their policies.  Ladies and gentlemen, in 1872 a small classic of legal liberalism appeared in Vienna, The Struggle for Law, by Rudolf von Jhering, which was republished as an antibody in the years of fascism in my country by Benedetto Croce. Today it is certainly fairer to talk about the fight for rights, which ranges from the defence of social and civil rights, to the protests of young people in Hong Kong and which can be summed up in the words of Hannah Arendt, the 'right to have rights'. But to prevent all this from being just a slogan, we must remember that phrase in its entirety: \"The right to have rights, or the right of every individual to belong to humanity, should be guaranteed by humanity itself\". It is quite clear that in this way the construction of rights becomes demanding and requires a policy of humanity, the opposite of the policy of disgust that some people have spoken about with regard to discrimination against homosexuals, but which we find in too many cases of rejection of the other. In the time we are living, rights are described as a luxury incompatible with the economic crisis, with the reduction in financial resources and also with the need for internal stability in some countries – I am thinking of the countries in our neighbourhood. But I ask myself: at a time when the promise of rights is not being fulfilled or removed, what are we taking leave of absence from? When you restrict rights to work, health, education and civil rights, you have an impact on the premises of a democracy. It is therefore not rights that are insatiable: so is the economy's claim to determine which rights are compatible with it. So reflection on rights brings us to the heart of a cultural debate that goes beyond contingency and reveals how references to the economic crisis and the new geopolitics have only made a much deeper transformation and conflict more evident, which concern the very way in which we must look at the evolution of our societies. , of the same global society.  With this report we want to send out a simple message that rights do not invade democracy but require us to reflect on how political discretion should be exercised. , from poverty, discrimination and violence against women, which erase the very dignity of the person. So there is a lot to be done and, ultimately, I think that Europe's task is to keep up the challenge, showing the coherence needed to really overcome this challenge on human rights everywhere.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2629, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   VPC/HR. – Signor Presidente, onorevoli parlamentari, vorrei iniziare ringraziando il relatore e tutti quelli che hanno lavorato con lui per la relazione eccellente ed estremamente utile per accompagnare l'inizio del mio lavoro sul campo dei diritti umani e affermando che condivido non solo l'analisi ma anche l'invito. Il nostro compito, quello dell'Unione europea, è quello di tenere alta la sfida e al tempo stesso trovare i modi concreti per fare dei piccoli grandi passi avanti in ognuna delle situazioni in cui i diritti umani sono o violati o messi in discussione. Mr President, I will continue in English to say that it is a great honour for me to participate in the discussion on the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy. As your report rightly recalls, the Charter of Fundamental Rights affirms that we must place the individual and human dignity at the centre of EU activities.  Protection of human rights is, and will remain, the over-arching priority of our external action. It is not just one of the priorities, but the over-arching priority, and must remain the solid foundation underpinning all our relations with third countries. This House embodies this commitment. Parliament has constantly promoted human rights in its everyday political work with very concrete actions. It has visited countries in which these rights are threatened. Your urgency debates and the highly symbolic value of the Sakharov prize, these actions are key components of parliamentary diplomacy and are needed as a fundamental element of our overall European policy on democracy and human rights. Human rights in the world remain a challenge, but I share the view that we have moved forward on a number of important areas; in particular since the adoption of the 2012 human rights package and through our first EU action plan on human rights for the phase 2012-2015. The plan has allowed the European Union to fulfil a number of important objectives. All European actors have been engaged and committed to working on human rights and it has become a fully-owned process. We have given ourselves the tools to start applying and mainstreaming human rights into our external policies. We have announced our visibility and accountability in this area, thanks to the human rights dialogues that we have engaged in with our strategic partners in the course of these past years.  Your support in implementing this action plan has been crucial. Now I believe it is time to move forward and in particular to structure our common work based on a well-defined set of priorities. Since I have assumed my duties, I have engaged in moving the human rights agenda forward, starting with the definition of a new action plan and I want this action plan to be based, not just on a list of actions, but on political priorities. In this framework, I think one of our priorities should be to support democratic transitions around us. Our diplomatic efforts and your parliamentary work should go hand in hand in a mutually supportive way. In this respect, I am pleased to see in your report that you appreciate our efforts to report regularly to this House, in the many formats that we have agreed. We are also engaging more in reaching out to civil society organisations as key partners in order to consult on key EU human rights and policy developments. Holding consultations with civil society before and after human rights dialogues, on all important policy developments and after the meetings of the Council working party on human rights, has become systematic practice. Our annual NGO human rights forum in December last year, attended by more than 200 civil society participants from around the world, has been a key opportunity to discuss and review European policies in the area of freedom of expression. I am delighted to see that you share the deep appreciation I have for the action of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, and a former colleague of yours, Stavros Lambrinidis. Stavros – I am not saying this as he is sitting next to me – is invaluable in helping us to promote our human rights priorities across the world, engaging with key partners, enhancing cooperation with regional mechanisms, and advancing the universality of human rights. It is with great pleasure that I can officially announce here to you today that I decided to extend his mandate and that the Council endorsed this decision. (Applause) Coming back to our joint work of setting priorities for our human rights action, allow me some substantial remarks. On a general point, let me say I fully share your approach. It is high time we put all our efforts into improving EU internal and external coherence. If we want to strengthen the credibility of the Union as a global actor we all need to seriously consider the human rights impacts that our policy has outside our borders, as well as our efforts in the external domain, which must be complementary to the work that Vice—President Timmermans is doing to ensure compliance of EU policies with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We need to be consistent on human rights outside and inside our borders – I would say inside our borders first of all to have real credibility when we act outside. I would now like to focus on our priorities: when reading Parliament’s report I recognise many issues which I also would like to prioritise in the new Action Plan. Let me give you a few examples. Besides addressing the need to increase the internal-external coherence of our policies, I would first like to announce our support to civil society – political, technical and financial support as well as redoubling our efforts to fight its ever shrinking space in so many countries.  Secondly, I think that we need to address the massive human rights violations and abuses that take place in conflicts and crisis around us. We must improve our capacity to prevent these violations and increase the effectiveness of the international mechanism to tackle impunity.  Thirdly, promoting human rights is not an abstract exercise. We have concrete tools we can use at European Union level, but we must improve their effectiveness. Let me say a few words on this. It is my intention that our dialogues on human rights not remain an isolated opportunity for the discussion of human rights issues. In my view they should rather feed into all bilateral contacts with partner countries, and that is also how the work that Stavros is doing coordinates very much with the level of commitment I have with all our partners and interlocutors in the world.  Fourthly, I want to step up our promotion of the rights of children, LGBTI and women, as well as the freedom of expression, freedom of religion and belief, which would include guidelines increasing awareness of our human rights which would be directed, above all, at EU staff and also at Member States’ diplomats. I appreciate in this context the efforts you want to make to ensure that your delegations, which have very close contacts with so many countries around the world, also focus more on promoting these values. I think that in this respect we can coordinate our efforts along similar lines. Fifthly, in the context of promoting the indivisibility and universality of human rights we will continue promoting and defending economic, social, cultural rights not least through our unequalled—in—scope development aid. In this context, too, I believe that the European Union can become a leader in implementing the UN guiding principles on business and human rights as recommended by Mr Howitt in his parliamentary report on corporate, social responsibility.  With regard to religious minorities – a major concern for all of us – I have already started to engage together with our partners to fight against violence committed in the name of religion and take action to address the root causes, – be they social, economic but also political – of radicalisation in our societies and in the Middle East but also in other places of the world, like Pakistan and Afghanistan. But, let me stress also, in our societies and here, again, we have to work more on the internal-external dimension of our policies. I am convinced that promoting freedom of religion, freedom of expression must be a key component of the fight against terrorism and a visible part of it. There can be no security, no stability without human rights and I think we have to remind not only ourselves but also our partners every single day. Over the last few months we have condemned in the strongest possible terms the massive abuses of human rights perpetrated by Daesh and sow alliances to counter these terrorists.  Furthermore, the European Union and its Member States are spearheading the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and we are strongly engaged in Iraq. The EU humanitarian policy in this year will focus aid on hard-to-reach areas where there are unmet needs and particularly vulnerable groups. In Syria, in areas of reduced violence, we are exploring targeted programmes for minorities in order to ensure the safety of all ethnic and religious communities; facilitate an inclusive transition, meet special needs and support the reintegration of vulnerable groups in society. We also support efforts by actors working on the ground to ensure that human rights abuses and violations are being documented for future accountability.  I am very grateful for the many and valuable suggestions and recommendations that I found in your report and I count on your support in finding ways of implementing them together. I look forward to our debate for even more suggestions and ideas in this respect.

As the author of the opinion on the report currently under consideration for the Committee on Women's Rights, let me therefore draw your attention to what I consider to be the most important on the subject of violence. I consider it most important that states work to build an atmosphere of trust, so that when a woman is a victim of violence, she encounters reluctance, underinteering and unprofessionality after surviving trauma. So that no one would even think to start talking to the victim that nothing actually happened. Member States must take careful care to train health professionals, police officers, prosecutors and judges so that they can help victims of violence quickly and professionally.

We are at the end of several months of reflection, of negotiations between Parliament's political groups, and I would like to say that, in my view, I am pleased to see that the text we are going to vote on tomorrow rightly reflects the concern that the PPE Group has towards the protection and promotion of human rights and democracy. I insist on this double component: it is also about human rights, and about democracy. There are two different things, but for us they are linked and from here I think we should also start putting this report in context. I believe that Mr Panzeri's report, in the form we have come to, underlines very well the Union's attitude towards human rights and towards democracy. I think we need to be proud of the way we see democracy and human rights, respectively. I say this even after the stormy debate that we had earlier when, unfortunately, one of our colleagues said here in plenary that, from the point of view of democracy, Russia would be better than the Union. I think the report shows very well why a country like Russia is no better than the Union in terms of democracy and, obviously, in terms of human rights. I mean, if the Union promotes human rights and democracy outside its exterior, it must obviously respect these rights within, but this report does not concern the human rights situation within the Union and within the Member States. I say this because I have had various discussions with colleagues in the LIBE Committee who, as a matter of fact, have said that this issue is being dealt with in that committee. The European Union should not suggest to the Member States what decisions to take, for example, on the legalisation of abortions or same-sex marriage.

Some monsters that we thought we had defeated forever are being reborn: bigotry, bigotry, racism. And human rights are in danger. It's not a phrase. It's a finding. And so this House this afternoon must affirm without nuance its commitment to human rights and to the rule of law, to its defence, and to the primacy of the values of democracy and dignity for all human beings in the world. The fight against terrorism and the economic crisis are helping human rights to reced in some parts of the world. And we have to commit ourselves, therefore, to the rule of law to defend everyone, beyond our priority, which is undoubtedly the safety of all. Commitment of this House and coherence of the European Union. We cannot, as in some cases, condemn with one hand and sign agreements with the other. We cannot continue to maintain the double side — which we sometimes maintain — in terms of the defence of human rights. And to teach lessons to the rest of the world, we have to set an example first. Example. And that is why the chapter on business, business and human rights seems to me to be a fundamental chapter and a fundamental task that we have to carry out: the defence of human rights. And that our European companies in third countries care about this respect for human rights. It is the European Union's responsibility as a power of powers.

The EU has more and more tools to implement human rights policies. But sometimes the political will still has to be linked to that toolbox. In some regions, such as South America, we are seeing progress. In other regions, the human rights situation is deteriorating. Russia, already discussed at length today, is unfortunately one of those regions. The country has become a strategic challenge.  In this context, I would like to take a look at the reference in the resolution to the worrying situation in Crimea. The Tatars are a small but proud people. Part of their past is shrouded in mist. The other part is a story of deportations and discrimination. Crimea is their homeland. Relations between the Crimean Tatars and ethnic Russians were always peaceful. But unfortunately, that tolerance is gone. International organisations confirm that Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians are systematically discriminated against. Basic civil rights, such as health care and a job, are denied to them if they stick to their Ukrainian passport. The UN Special Human Rights Envoy is no longer allowed to enter Crimea.

They come to Parliament, tell us, enlighten us, and then return to their respective places and see that they are in danger because they have exposed themselves.

It's something we accept but don't comply with. It seems a lie, but we are not talking about the fact that there are 15% of the world's population who do not have access to a toilet; we are talking about 1 billion people who are exposed to open defecation. There is a child who dies every two and a half minutes from diarrhea that is perfectly preventable. There's no shortage of resources. He's unwilling. We can prevent cholera, typhus, hepatitis, polio, worms... Outdoor defecation contributes to decreased physical and cognitive development, and in addition to threatening people's health and development contributes to sexual violence.

This report contains some positive points, but the European Union is not free from reproaches in this regard and is increasingly ill-placed to give lessons. Economic and social rights and corporate social responsibility are largely important. But why not support an international, legally binding mechanism to end the impunity of multinationals, which has been postponed to the UN because of the vote of the Member States? Why not denounce the disastrous effect of structural adjustment plans on rights, particularly economic and social rights? How do we understand the \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" clauses when we advocate, without nuance, cooperation with third countries, especially on migration, and we encourage, in particular, the Khartoum process with the dictators of the Horn of Africa?

Finally, I would also like to mention, in paragraph 77, the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, as an opportunity for reconciliation, between two communities, with their past in order to build their future peacefully.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2678, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, honourable Members, I will be brief. The debate has been rich with comments and suggestions of which we have taken due note. I can assure you that we are going to draw very much on this in this crucial stage of our preparation of our human rights and democracy policies for the next five years. I would just mention one of the many points many of you have raised, because this is not something I included in my opening remarks and I have a strong personal feeling about it, which is the reference to the role of women in society and in leadership and also the issue of violence against women. Two sides of the same coin somehow. This would probably take hours to debate in full but just let me share in what some of you have said about the fact that the role of women and the fight against violence is not only an issue of changing legislation, it is very much an issue of changing culture, starting with the education not only of girls but mainly of boys in our own families and in our own schools. It is an issue not only in our external policies but also very much in our internal policies. I just wanted to share the fact that I have chosen to dedicate our work on 8 March to Afghan women and in particular to the women in Afghanistan that have chosen or are trying to experience leadership roles, be it in politics, be it in institutions, be it in the police or in the judicial system or in journalism and media. I think we need to support them very much. We have launched a programme for having them in the European institutions for a certain amount of time, so that we can keep this channel open and encourage them on their difficult path. Let me also share with you the fact that on 9 March, just last Monday – and I had the pleasure of being in New York on the 8 March – I met the UN Women Executive Director and we discussed our common policies towards empowering women in society, and also countering violence against women, and I had the pleasure of attending – together with our special representative – the opening session of the CSW related to Beijing+20. I would just underline here again the valuable contributions we have made, the excellent work that was done, and two commitments I can take in specific terms. One, is making sure that we coordinate the internal and external work on human rights in all our policies; secondly, that we try to mainstream this across all sectors of our engagement, particularly when we work with third parties around the world, and the commitment to work together in our different institutions: Council, Commission, but very much with the European Parliament. I would like to thank you all very much for the contributions to the debate – the shadow rapporteurs, the rapporteur Antonio Panzeri, for the excellent report that will very much constitute the basis for our future work in these critical times, and also Stavros Lambrinidis.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank everyone for this debate.

This debate is important: it signals real attention and also a different sensitivity that I respect, and some of them I do not agree with. I just wanted to point out that the preamble to the Charter of Fundamental Rights states that the European Union places the person at the centre of its action and, speaking in person, no abstraction has been mentioned. On the contrary, that word was intended to move away precisely from the abstractions handed down in the term as a subject and individual and intended to give prominence to material life, to the concrete conditions of existence, to the inviolability of the dignity of each and every one. That is why I want to say very strongly that I refer to the sender the phrases I have heard from Mr Chauprade and Mr Bay: I find shameful some of the statements used towards the LGBT community, which in fact only indicate the level of political incivility in which we want to drag such a fundamental issue as that of rights. Their opposition to the report does not surprise me, because it is opposed to tolerance and respect for people.

Unfortunately, there are still countries where the rights of minorities, especially autochtononic ones, are violated. The European Parliament and the Commission should therefore call on all EU Member States to ratify without delay the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It should also be recalled that the European Parliament adopted a resolution of the July 2013 European Parliament on the european union. resolution on linguistic diversity.

Because the threats we are facing from Libya in these weeks are, more so than in all the past months and years, threats not only to the southern countries of our European Union but threats and challenges for the whole of the European Union itself.  Since we discussed the situation in Libya in this Chamber last January this has been, I would say, together with the Ukrainian crisis, the top priority of my personal work. Work that has been difficult, that is still very difficult, made up of creating the network of international and regional support for the efforts to support and to have political dialogue, under the auspices of the UN, in the dialogue that is currently ongoing in Rabat under the work of the UN Secretary—Generalʼs Special Envoy, Bernardino León.  I started to work on this international and regional framework a few weeks ago when in Washington. The European Union has promoted a meeting between the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, myself for the European Union, Secretary Kerry and Mr Shoukry, the Foreign Minister of Egypt, to try to build a framework that could keep all relevant actors – there are many others involved as well on a bilateral basis, but the main political actors, main relevant actors – together in full support of the internal dialogue in Libya.  That dialogue has restarted since January. It has restarted now in Rabat. I was in a session at one of these dialogues before, exactly four months ago today, in Tripoli. I was in the same Hotel Corinthia that was then attacked by terrorists at the end of January, together with not only Bernardino León but also Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in one of the last sessions of the dialogue before we restarted a couple of days ago.  I can say that the fact that the dialogue has restarted is something on which we would probably not have bet just a few months ago. This is the result of sometimes silent but constant and difficult diplomatic work we have done together with the UN, in an incredible way, in these months. The European Union supports this dialogue not only politically but also financially. There are other tracks of dialogue going on. They do not always make the news headlines but I think it is fair for this Chamber to know and recognise the work that is done on parallel levels. There is currently a dialogue going on in Algeria between political parties.  On Monday – so just a few days ago – there was a meeting in Brussels of more than 40 businessmen from all different parts of Libya which produced a joint statement asking for the political dialogue to bring the result of a national unity government so that they can be put in the situation of restarting the reconstruction of their country and the improvement of the economic and social situation of all the Libyan people, united together.  We will host in the European Union institutions in Brussels in the coming days a dialogue between municipalities and mayors so that grass-roots local level dialogue can accompany the political dialogue that is taking place hopefully in Rabat again in these days. I have talked to Bernardino León today about the state of play of this political dialogue. We were discussing that too with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday in New York and this morning again with the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States. I will have a conversation later today with the Egyptian Foreign Minister. This is all to say that we need to make sure that all actors are pushing in the same direction.  I forgot to say, but that was not out of any political intention, that this was also a subject of my meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister a few days ago in Riga.  We have to make sure that all relevant international, regional and local actors – local level, national level – push in the same direction. We have to make sure that the dialogue continues and we have to make sure that the dialogue brings the result of a national unity government.  Terrorism, confronting the threat of Daesh, uncontrolled migration, regional instability – these are only some of the challenges we have in front of us in Libya and the unity government in Libya is vital to addressing all these issues and many more. Libya is a rich country full of financial natural resources which if put together, if provided with authorities, can perform very well. What we need to do is ensure that there is a restart, a reset somehow, that allows a government to be in place that can work in all the territory and with all the people of Libya.  It will be vital to addressing these challenges, it will be vital first of all to giving all Libyans the security and the living conditions that the country can offer and that they deserve after so many difficult years.  As I have said, these are not only Libyan problems. They concern all of us. The international community must contribute in all possible ways and as a matter of urgency to solve these problems. Here, continued strong cooperation between the UN and the EU is crucial as well as is, as I have said, our cooperation with the countries neighbouring Libya and with the League of Arab States.  We need a unified and effective state authority all over Libya and I think that a national unity government is possible and desperately needed for the country and for the sake of the country. The European Union is ready, with all its willingness and its support, to help this process. We are doing that already. When we have, and I hope it will be soon, a positive outcome from the dialogue we are ready to give support in all possible ways, in coordination with the UN and with the neighbouring countries.  This includes through missions and operations that are being explored at present. We started to discuss this with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Riga a couple of days ago. Libya will be one of the main issues on our agenda on Monday at the Foreign Affairs Council, to make sure that the European Union is ready to support any kind of outcome of the dialogue that is currently taking place. We will also work with the ministers on Monday on migration and when talking about Libya it is impossible not to mention this issue. It is impossible first of all because the numbers of people crossing the Mediterranean through Libya – not from Libya, not Libyans, these are people coming from the Horn of Africa, from Syria, escaping from terrible situations in their own countries – are increasing compared to the same months last year and will probably do so even more when spring and summer come.  This is not just an issue of people crossing the Mediterranean, it is also an issue that affects greatly the countries neighbouring Libya: Tunisia, Chad, Algeria, Niger, Sudan and Egypt continue to receive migrants and asylum seekers from Libya. The EU is supporting organisations like the IOM which are trying to carry out voluntary repatriation.  A few days ago, through one of the EU funded programmes, the IOM facilitated the voluntary return of 400 Senegalese from Libya and these are 400 people that will not try to cross the Mediterranean, risking their lives, feeding terrorist networks probably with financial revenues that are, through criminal organisations, most probably also supporting criminal activities. These are most probably 400 people saved. In the same way we are working with the UNHCR and according to them there are around 400 000 internally displaced persons in Libya. This is almost 10% of the country’s population. They are moving along tribal lines, seeking safety in rural areas and the tendency is to remain in Libya, trying to seek refuge in those parts of the country that are not yet touched by the conflict.  For these reasons, on 4 March, exactly one week ago, jointly with Vice—President Timmermans and Commissioner Avramopoulos inside the Commission we have steered the process that will lead to the adoption of a new EU agenda for migration. It was scheduled to come later in the summer, if not later still. I personally asked for this to be advanced to May because we cannot really wait for more months before acting and acting together and efficiently. It will be built on four main objectives – an effective asylum policy, well managed regular migration, the fight against irregular migration and protection of our common external borders. In this framework I have decided, as I told you, to put migration on the agenda of the next Foreign Affairs Council on Monday where Foreign Ministers will have, for the first time, a discussion to complement the ongoing work of the Justice and Home Affairs Council that is taking place at the same time.  Together with Commissioner Avramopoulos, I have written to the Ministers to share some ideas already now on how we could step up our concrete action in the external dimension of our effort on migration in order to avoid tragedies at sea but also at land borders, securing protection for those in need and fighting the criminal networks controlling the trafficking and smuggling. We have also started to exchange views with the UNHCR and with High Commissioner Guterres on the most effective measures and policies to face these challenges together. It has to be a joint effort starting from the very helpful and useful experience that the UNHCR has developed over the years. I proposed to the ministers that we discuss along three strands. Firstly, enhanced cooperation with third countries of origin and transit on the West African migratory route, the East African one and the so-called silk route in order to build capacities to fight smuggling and trafficking networks and protect stranded migrants in distress. Secondly, step up refugee protection both in countries of origin and in neighbouring countries where asylum seekers and refugees have settled, using resettlement and humanitarian admission schemes and regional development and protection programmes in order to assist partner countries to become robust providers of effective protection in accordance with international law, as well as to provide safe alternatives to dangerous journeys. Thirdly, to engage with our partners in third countries of origin on the potential of regular, well-managed migration. We should consider better targeted mobility partnerships as an instrument for economic and social development, accompanied by reflection on the role of remittances in development and on the mutual recognition of educational and professional qualifications.  Because we know very well that when people have regulated and safe ways this works better not only for themselves – we are talking about people first of all, we just finished a debate on human rights, let us remember that – but we are also talking about the development of their countries of origin and also of our own societies in the European Union. Now these are things we need to do both in the short and in the long term when it comes to external action on our commitment to better management of migration, but we all know – and here I go back to Libya, our starting point –we all know that Libya is the immediate key element for facing the dramatic situation of people dying at sea and also to face the security and stability challenge we have very close to our borders.  We all know, and I can guarantee you that all Member States and all Commissioners know – here I am playing my dual role – that Libya is the number one issue we need to face in these weeks if we want to be sure that the European Union can have a stable and secure future and that our region can have a stable and secure future. The impact of this continued situation in Libya on not only our sea and our European Union but also on neighbouring countries that are struggling themselves with difficult transitions could be really explosive. I am looking forward to listening to your views in this respect. I will be happy to report also to the ministers. Let me send from here a strong message in view of what is happening in these days in Rabat. All parties need to be fully aware of the fact that all possible support will come from the European Union, including on a security level, but we need to have them taking the first step and to unite to save the country.

The power vacuum is fuelling the escalation of violence and sectarianism, making Libya almost Somalia at europe's doorland. Political agreement between Libyans is indispensable, and the European Union must mobilize diplomacy, targeted sanctions and other means to support the efforts of United Nations representative Bernardino León to establish a government of national unity, as Ms. Mogherini said. A runaway Libya, delivering people, oil facilities, humanity's historical heritage to the atrocities of criminal gangs such as DAESH or Ansar al-Sharia, poses a direct threat to the European Union. And the scale of the problem cannot be measured by the number of people fleeing conflict and arriving in Europe on the coasts of Libya. The problem of migration influx is not being combated with Fortress Europe, as Ms Mogherini said, but with avenues facilitating legal migration, UNHCR involvement in screening, protection and support for refugees, and more balanced sharing of refugee reception by European Member States. But it is true that terrorism today has a bridge in Libya with easy and fast access to the European continent, and there are environmental and cultural disasters of biblical proportions on the horizon, threatening the entire Mediterranean. Member States must therefore ask for and be ready to contribute substantially to an international mission led by the Security Council to stabilise Libya, help purge it of terrorists. The Security Council must reform and strengthen the mandate of the UNSMIL mission it has on the ground, taking responsibility for helping to empower the country institutionally for governance and national and regional security. And the horizon has to be long-term and the plan has to involve us, the European Union, and the regional partners.

Mr President, at our January meeting, the presence of IS in Libya was only just known. The following month we were confronted with the shocking images of the beheading of 21 Egyptian Copts. Since then, IS has strengthened its position and paraded brand new all-terrain vehicles in Mediterranean coastal cities. An adviser to the UN special envoy to Libya, a compatriot of mine, says in a Dutch newspaper that 'Libya has the potential to grow into a crisis many times greater than Syria. From a European perspective, Libya is more important than Syria. Most of the problems with illegal migrants and some problems with Islamist extremism can be traced back to the chaos in Libya.' A consideration that gives to think!  The efforts of the UN envoy, Bernardino Leon, offer the only hope. But unfortunately, the country is a hotbed of militias.

Therefore, I support your especially ambition to create a government of national unity because obviously this is the only solution so that these criminals who ravage and kill people, innocent people and innocent victims can became violent and create great problems in all the countries in which they perform.

I think it is important for us to understand that the European Union does have a critical role to play on the world stage and it is good to see that, under her leadership, we are getting better and better at this.  A number of my colleagues have touched on the difficulties that we are facing in Libya and the dangers that we expose ourselves to in this. We need to make sure that we do actually work towards finding a resolution. I know that a lot of good points have been covered and I just want to say three things that we need to be looking at. The first is that, with the breakdown of the state government in Libya, there are ordinary civilian people who are actually suffering; there is a shortage of food, shortage of medicines, etc., so we need to help them on that front. We also need to work on the idea of non-interference from other states, and we need to work for reconciliation and for a national unity government.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to reply in Italian. I have to say that I agree with what one of you said: using the term 'unstable situation' for Libya is an understatement. Just as it is an understatement to refer to a failed state: we are simply not dealing with a state. And that is the main problem we face. In addition, there is the crux of the complexity of the problems that are intertwined on the Libyan stage, they really do, probably, as many of you have said and as I said at the beginning, one of the crises if not the most potentially dangerous and dramatic crisis that we have around us. There are many problems and levels of problems and complexities that are intertwined: on the one hand, those relating to security, not only of Libyan territory, where we see not only a greater presence of terrorist organisations and groups, but also a real use of Daesh franchising on organizations or groups or militias that previously exist, but also a link with other crises, those to the south, for example with Boko Haram, which has been mentioned, but also with the crisis in Syria and Iraq and the return or arrival on Libyan territory of foreign fighters from other scenarios of conflict, with potentially devastating consequences for neighbouring countries: think of Tunisia, one of the countries that we call , quite rightly, a success story of democratic transitions in the region, which must be subjected to terrifying pressure at its borders, both in terms of security and immigration. So problems in terms of security, in terms of immigration and trafficking in human beings, in terms of controlling both the energy and financial resources of a potentially rich country, which would not need, as it did not need in the past, to count on international support, but clearly under these conditions the population extremely affected by a very dramatic humanitarian situation – and here too the European Union is doing a great deal and is ready to do more – and the further level of consequences for neighbouring countries, From Tunisia, but also Egypt, Algeria and the European Union itself, as well as the neighbouring countries to the south – think of the whole of the south Saharan area – consequences not only in terms of security and immigration but also consequences in terms of regional political dynamics , because we know very well that one of the main problems we face is not only the total collapse of Libya, not only a potential division of the country, but also the risk of a proxy war over Libya and Libya, by other regional powers or, so to speak, the enlarged region. That is why it is very clear to all Libyans – and I hope it is clear to all of us – that there is no military option to deal with what is happening in Libya and anyone who can be tempted by the 'There is a crisis, let us intervene' approach would not come to terms with the complexity I have just mentioned, with very large territory and with a very complex social structure, as well as with the absence of state structures. Such a complex problem is not answered with the illusion of magical answers: there is no magic wand for this crisis, just as there is unfortunately no magic wand for many crises, but for this one even less than others: there is no military option – the Libyans know this very well and I believe that we should know very well too. This does not mean that the European Union is not interested or that it does not also have the main responsibility for preparing concrete actions, which have been asked of me – I am sorry that the member who made the request to me today is no longer here at the moment; I hope that my words can be reported to you, but you obviously did not listen to what I said at the beginning: well, the European Union is doing concrete actions, indeed I have to say that we are among the main supporters, not only supporters but builders of the concrete actions that are on the ground today for Libya: for example, dialogue. In relation to the political process under way in Rabat, it is true that there are setbacks, but in such a difficult process we cannot give in to setbacks: we must insist on the need to move forward. The dialogue in Tripoli, the dialogue in Morocco, the dialogue between Tobruk and Tripoli and Misurata – and I can confirm to Mr Bonanno that I was in Tripoli exactly four months ago and some of those parliamentarians from Tobruk I met them in Tripoli engaged in dialogue, just as there were parliamentary women on the other side too: it is a dimension that some people asked to strengthen that I think is useful. On the other hand, it was the women of Misurata who encouraged their men to sit at the table of dialogue, because they were tired of a conflict that is depriving them of resources and human lives. Dialogue with the Libyans, therefore, dialogue with the UN – two or three days ago with Ban Ki-moon we talked about the situation in Libya – dialogue with the Arab League and with the regional players: I recalled that we discussed this with the Secretary-General of the League last time this morning and we will talk to the Egyptian Foreign Minister as soon as we finish this long plenary session. But building European actions also means working on options that can be ready at the right time, right actions to be carried out at the right time. Getting things wrong in this crisis can be fatal, as I believe has been demonstrated in recent months and years very clearly. This means preparing, for example, not only border control, but also preparing for the rational and human rights-respecting management of migratory flows and asylum seekers, together with the UNHCR; it also means starting to prepare measures for the protection of the country's basic infrastructure, starting with the buildings of a future government but also the communication and road link infrastructure to airports; it means working on measures to monitor a ceasefire when it is in place. Libyans are well aware that the European Union is working constantly these days and weeks, not only on the channel of dialogue, but also on the concrete instruments that we will make available to a future government of national unity to ensure that that government of national unity – and not external military intervention – has the means to meet the security challenges , the reconstruction of the country and the management of the migratory flows that Libya will have to face. The other challenge, which some have mentioned, is not only to put these options into practice, not only to implement them so that they are ready to use at the right time, but also to achieve them in the unity between our 28 Member States that any decision in this regard requires and will require.  So, of course, this is not an easy process, but I believe that the seriousness and drama of the situation puts us – and all our 28 Member States – in front of us with a responsibility and an urgency from which we can hardly escape. This means being ready together, at 28, to take these decisions if and when they are necessary and also to develop together, at 28, greater solidarity in reception. This is one of the issues that we have begun to address, as I said, with the Commission, which the Interior Ministers are currently addressing in the Council and which the Foreign Ministers will address on the issues for which they are responsible next Monday. I was asked what we are actually doing about the Khartoum process: the Khartoum process was only initiated at the end of November by the Italian Presidency in Rome – I was present at that meeting – and it is a process that can give us many instruments: three months is not enough to ask for an account of what has been done today, but what is on the table is basically greater cooperation with the countries of the Khartoum process. , not only in the management of borders, but also in the rational and respectful management of human rights – I repeat – of migratory flows and joint work to develop the capacities of these countries to face what is a challenge first and foremost for them. I think I have answered most of the questions that have been raised. I will end with a comment: at the moment, we are rightly focusing on the urgent need to meet a challenge in terms of security and human rights and the risk of implosion in a large and important country close to the European Union. We would be mistaken if, among the concrete actions that we are preparing these days, we did not also include the strength of any element of European Union support for any of our partners, namely institution building. Here we are faced with the absence of a successful process of setting up the institutions; this is what has been lacking in recent years and this must be the european Union's first strong engagement point in a partnership with the Libyan authorities in the future.  The key point will be this: Libya is not weak economically; Libya has enormous capabilities: what the European Union can do, over and above its commitments to security and the management of migratory flows, over and above the commitment to border control, over and above the commitment to a constructive and non-destructive regional dynamic, is support for institution building. We will never, in the long term, overcome libya's challenge if we do not work on building democratic institutions, responsible for the whole of Libyan territory and responsible for managing the lives of all Libyans, in regardless of whether they are from Tobruk, Tripoli, Misurata or elsewhere.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2719, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The debate is over.

With the fall of Colonel Khadafi in 2011, Libya seemed to be reborn from the ashes. For the first time, free elections were held and the people would be able to express themselves freely. But this was without counting on the legacy left by the country's tribal organization, wanted and established by Khadafi, since his coup d'état of September 1969.  Today, the country is mired in total government instability. Tripoli in the north and Tobrouck in the east are vying for power. If Tripoli is under the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, Tobrouck is a moderate city. Beyond the clash between religious and secularists, Libya is torn between the new elites who recognize themselves in the power of Tobrouck and the elders who swear by a power emanating from Tripoli.  Libya's geographical location is unique. Tripoli is much closer to Rome than Cairo. A question then arises: don't jihadists take advantage of these nut shells to install bridgeheads on the island of Lampedusa?

We are all saddened by the recent attack in Bamako on 7 March which cost the lives of several people, including a Belgian security officer in the EU Delegation. There is a real risk that increased terrorist activity will derail the political process which is currently at a turning point. All should join efforts to make sure that this will not happen. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) in particular should be given the appropriate means to accomplish its mandate. The EU condemns the continuous attacks against the UN forces, such as recently in Kidal on 8 March. As you know, the EU contributed to reaching a peace agreement in Algiers on 1 March. It acted as co-mediator together with the United Nations, the African Union, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Economic Community of West African States and five neighbouring countries.  The European Union Special Representative was personally involved in the talks. It required substantial efforts to reach a compromise between the parties, respecting the unity and integrity of Mali.  The Accord foresees further devolution of economic competencies and resources to local authorities and the creation of local police forces. Regions should be better represented in the central institutions. The Malian army will be reformed to integrate ex-rebels in its ranks and will then be progressively redeployed over all the territory under UN MINUSMA supervision.  The immediate challenge for us is to obtain endorsement of the agreement by the Coordination. The Eureopan External Action Service is currently taking part in a joint mission on the ground to support this process and to convince the different stakeholders that there is no other credible alternative.  It is now important for the Government to demonstrate its commitment to the agreement by taking swiftly some of the actions it has undertaken to deliver. The EU will play its role in making sure progress is indeed achieved. Beyond this immediate action of the mediation, resources will have to be mobilised to accompany the process through reconciliation and a re-foundation of Mali. Our 11th European Development Fund National Indicative Programme has just been signed on 6 March in Brussels and would contribute significantly to this endeavour, but implementation will depend partly on the speed with which the government meets its obligations.  Other tools within the comprehensive approach and in synergy with Member States and other international actors could also be mobilised as well. But of course, security remains a pre-condition for any humanitarian or development action. The UN mission – MINUSMA – as already mentioned, has a crucial role to play. The EU should support it in its efforts and make sure it is given proper means to accomplish its mandate. To this end, the EU will have to assess how the EU Training Mission and European Union CSDP Mission in Sahel Mali, can work with MINUSMA on the disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration and security sector reform processes of security forces, both civilian and military, as foreseen in the agreement.  These EU missions are already providing advice and training contributing to the reform of the security sector. In the longer run, efforts have to be pursued in the regional context through the implementation of the EU Sahel Strategy for security which was adopted in 2011. The adoption still this week of a Sahel Regional Action Plan will indicate additional actions to support the strategy in the years ahead.

Continuous violence in the northern part of Mali has become a brake on the development of the entire country, but also a threat to the security of development of the wider Sahel region.  This recent act of violence in Mali, including the death of European Union nationals, is unfortunately just one of many examples of violence and human rights violations. All parties to the conflict have committed serious human rights violations, including violations of the right to life, enforced disappearances, torture, sexual violence, arrests.  Recently in Brussels we met a delegation from Mali who told us that there is no peace without development or development without peace, and that is why I join the call of the High Representative and Commissioner Mimica to all parties to the conflict to start a constructive dialogue and to sign a peace agreement in Algeria as soon as possible and to embark on a path of reconciliation, reconstruction and development.  A peace agreement is a fundamental precondition, but long-term stability and growth can only be achieved through reconciliation and eradication of extreme poverty. The people of Mali really need EU solidarity to ensure a dignified life through sustainable development.

The political solution to ending the armed conflict in Mali must be based on an inclusive plan, representative of the diversity of society, so that it is sustainable and restores peace to the country. Mali's security is essential for the pacification of the entire Sahel and for the eradication of the terrorist threat in the region, where it finds fertile ground for the violent insuprising and proliferation of organized crime that gives it financial support, such as arms and drug trafficking.

I am very glad to address the European Parliament on the relations between the European Union and the League of Arab States (LAS) including cooperation in countering terrorism. Since the upheavals started in 2011, the Arab world has gone through a wave of political changes, some of which have resulted in democratic processes, and a number of which have, for the time being at least, led to outright conflict. Still others have seen revolution overturned and some have seen no change. This has transformed the geopolitical landscape.  Today, on its south-eastern and southern flanks, the EU is facing an arc of conflicts and crises – from Iraq, Syria and an unresolved Middle East conflict, to Libya and the Sahel, with spillover effects throughout the region. Co—operation with our partners in the Arab world is essential if we are to address the regional challenges and threats which they and we face. Security threats, of course, include jihadist terrorism and transnational crime.  There are humanitarian challenges, including the catastrophe of millions of refugees and displaced persons on our doorstep, and social and economic development challenges need to be addressed – especially the lack of employment and opportunities for youth.  We are ready to assist with the effort in meeting these challenges both bilaterally and at a regional level. In this demanding context, the League of Arab States is a vital partner for the EU. It has legitimacy as the only pan-regional organisation bringing together all Arab countries. If its crisis management capabilities are properly reinforced – and with the political willingness of its Member States – it will contribute to tackling the challenges that were just mentioned.  It reinforces Arab co-ownership therefore facilitating the implementation of EU policies in the region. I firmly believe that there is untapped potential in our relationship with the League, which is in our interest to reinforce.  So it is clear ‘why’ we engage.  Now let me give an overview of ‘how’ we engage. The EU and the League of Arab States have indeed strengthened our relationship recently. Less than two months ago, the Secretary—General of the League of Arab States, Dr Nabil Elaraby, visited Brussels and we co-signed a memorandum of understanding on co-operation between our organisations. Dr Elaraby also addressed EU Foreign Ministers and this Parliament. In all these meetings, he stressed the need for stronger Euro-Arab co—operation and made clear his support in the fight against terrorism.  In June last year, a successful EU-LAS Foreign Affairs ministerial meeting was held in Athens. Almost 50 Foreign Ministers agreed to launch an unprecedented Strategic Dialogue as a platform for exchange on political and security matters (including crisis management, humanitarian assistance, counter-terrorism, the fight against organised crime and weapons of mass destruction).  Beyond dialogue, the aim is to tackle these various issues through operational engagement with both the League Secretariat and LAS Member States. Counter-terrorism is a particular priority for the EU at the present time. The Council conclusions adopted last month gave us a mandate to tackle terrorism at regional level, engaging with organisations such as the LAS. As I said before, the League is also committed to addressing this threat. The Arab Foreign Ministers have in fact been discussing terrorism this week.  In this context, we are exploring some concrete initiatives in the counter-terrorism field. A project on countering radicalisation and foreign fighters will be launched soon for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. We would also like to work on capacity-building measures in the fields of law enforcement, criminal justice, security sector reform, paying due regard to international human rights standards, in close co—operation with Europol, Eurojust, Frontex and CEPOL, and to address the ‘foreign fighters’ phenomenon, as agreed at the Athens meeting.  A concrete, positive example of how we can engage to jointly tackle common threats is the EU-funded crisis room in the League’s headquarters. This is an ongoing project which aims to build up a pan-Arab early warning mechanism to deal with catastrophes and crises. Our co-operation is not limited to political and security matters. Since 2012 we have a joint work program of co-operation in various fields, from human rights to energy, and other activities are being planned.  I would like to focus now on how the EU and the LAS work together on human rights. Since 2012, the EU and the LAS have identified common priorities, developed a number of initiatives, and engaged regularly including with the Arab Human Rights Charter Committee and the Arab National Human Rights Institutions. The Council of Europe has also been involved in some of this work. Key topics have included women’s empowerment, promotion and protection of human rights in line with international standards, engagement with civil society and co-operation on election observation. The EU is committed to ensuring that human rights are mainstreamed in our activities across the board. It is particularly important that we do so in the context of counter-terrorism. It is also important that we engage in cultural dialogue. Last April, for example, we organised a dialogue in Cairo on ‘co—existence and acceptance of the other’ and next month we will have a dialogue in Brussels on ‘freedom of expression and freedom of association and assembly’.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2739, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Tunne Kelam", "mepid": "28424", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, may I welcome on behalf of the PPE Group the perspective of possible EU-Arab cooperation in the fight against terrorism. The Memorandum of Understanding signed in January may look like a modest start, but has immense positive potential. It could well become the start of the EU-League of Arab States strategic dialogue.  It is clear that to defeat ISIS it is mandatory to have all countries of the region on board, each making an active contribution. It is necessary to jointly identify challenges, shared goals and possibilities for common actions to counter the terrorist expansion. King Abdullah expressed it very well yesterday, that this fight has to be carried out by Muslim countries first and foremost. It is crucial to take jointly and exchange information on sources and means of terrorist financing. Also a joint mechanism to control the illegal arms trade and cut the roots of jihadist volunteers will have significant practical value.  It is clear that in fighting terrorism the fundamental rights of people have to be safeguarded. Better protection of human rights by our Arab partners would help to develop the culture of tolerance and inclusion in the region. Arab-EU cooperation should be used to better protect terrorist-targeted religious and cultural minorities of the Middle East and will certainly help to implement King Abdullahʼs declaration that Christians form an integral part of the Arab past, as well as its future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2740, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Knut Fleckenstein", "mepid": "96840", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

But since terrorism is a global problem, it can only be solved globally, that is, with each other. And it is only with shared strength that we can really achieve this. In order to develop precisely this strength, the Memorandum of Understanding for enhanced cooperation between the Arab League and the European Union has been concluded. We very much welcome improved cooperation between the Arab League and us, not only but also in terms of counter-terrorism measures. There are many areas in which we can only achieve something together. We need to cooperate better, especially on early warning systems and crisis prevention. The Internet, and especially social networks, facilitate cross-border contacts and enable the dissemination of propaganda without a physical basis. This challenge can only be answered internationally. The phenomenon of foreign fighters or travelling fighters can only be tackled together with the states that are targets for these fighters. This is both about the fight against terror and about strategies for helping dropouts and reintegrating them into society. We welcome the fact that there are already many, very different initiatives across Europe that stand up against extremism and tolerance. Terrorism in the name of Islam is a serious threat, in the EU and in the Arab states. We can only successfully combat this threat together with Muslim communities in the EU and Muslim states outside the EU. This common ground is also needed to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not misused to incite Islam. Each side has its own tasks to consider at home. For us, it also means how important it is that we do not use it in the prosecution of criminals, but that we avoid radicalisation in the first place. For the Arab states, this means, much better than before, to prevent the supply of arms to terrorist organisations and the financing of terrorism from these countries themselves. It also means guaranteeing human rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2741, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, with the rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and Islamist terrorist attacks occurring in Europe, cooperation with our allies in the Gulf and the wider Arab world is more important today than ever in combating international terrorism. The Arab League can do much to stem the causes of jihadi terrorism at the roots. A more proactive approach in restricting the funding activities of certain religious charities that are in fact financing terrorism, restricting the travel of known terrorists, and ceasing the promotion of Wahhabi Salafism across the globe are just three examples.  This House was addressed yesterday by the King of Jordan discussing the key role that his country is playing in the air campaign against ISIS. Along with countries such as Egypt, Jordan is a great example in the region of what genuine military cooperation can look like. Tunisia is also a good example and success story of what democracy can mean for the Arab Spring.

As the King of Jordan said yesterday, the fight that is witnessed between terrorists and those who want to defend pluralism is a fight within Islam. It is important that countries of the Arab region take responsibility. Cooperation between the EU and Arab League states on counter-terrorism is welcome, yet clarification is needed. We call on the publication of the Memorandum of Understanding so that there is full transparency and we can see what is agreed. It is unfortunate that the press release by the External Action Service did not mention the importance of respecting human rights while cooperating on fighting terrorism; because in this House we have repeatedly been asked and forced to call for the respect for human rights, notably after the Arab uprisings, as they are often violated, precisely in the member states of the Arab League, severely and systematically. This kind of repression is too often legitimised by arguments of national security or by invoking counter-terrorism and the EU cannot and should not, directly or indirectly, be a part of legitimising repression in the name of counter-terrorism – not the repression of those that act entirely in line with their universal human rights. Sadly, from Bahrain to Egypt, from Saudi Arabia to Turkey, from Qatar to Sudan, we see this kind of repression.

Let me tell you quite frankly: security cooperation, which is ultimately negotiated with such undemocratic despots, does not belong. And do you really believe that, because of a few lacklustre and almost naive points on human rights in the resolution, even an Egyptian policeman will stop flouting human rights? Are our security partners really states like Bahrain, where internet activists are sent to prison for a single tweet? Is Saudi Arabia our confidant, even though people there are being publicly whipped and beheaded? And then this memorandum is not even really public. So, I have to tell you quite honestly that this is not security cooperation, but complicity. After all, we also sell weapons and surveillance instruments to our partners.

The subject is too serious for petty politics. The fight against terrorism and the cooperation of the EU with the League of Arab States, as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding, is a serious subject that deserves to be taken as seriously as indeed we have done, except that the Memorandum has not been published. This surely sends the worst possible signal to our partner countries within the region. Within the resolution, in Recital D, we highlight that fact and in point 3 we explicitly call for its publication. There is cross-party support for that. I would be grateful for an explicit reaction to that call this evening. More widely, it is not a toothless resolution either. In Recital I, we refuse to turn a blind eye to the shortcomings of our partners in that there are serious and systematic violations of human rights in member countries of the Arab League states, because we cannot turn a blind eye to their failings. We also, in point 5, state that the solution to radicalisation is not simply military. The roots are far more complex than that, and any solution must be multifaceted and much more sophisticated in nature. In point 9 we explicitly say that counter-terrorism measures may never be abused to repress legitimate dissent. That again is a nod to the practices of some of our partner countries. In point 11 we stress the importance of cooperation between the EU and the League in the field of human rights because there are things to build on. We must do that by example. The regimes in charge of the Middle East and North Africa are indeed important partners and we do indeed need to deal with them. We do have a common aim.

I repeat our firm rejection of the rhetoric of the clash of civilisations and, even more so, of religion. We need the help of all the Muslim communities in Europe to isolate extremism and to avoid – and in this respect the role of arab states can and must be fundamental, as the King of Jordan told us yesterday – that we end up with this kind of argument, with political but also cultural instruments. However, we also need a total and concrete commitment on the part of all the Member States of the Arab League not only to refrain from all forms of proxy war, but also to actively pursue those who, even as a private citizen, help to finance directly or indirectly the geopolitical conflict between the Sunni world and the Shiite world with various proxy wars.

As you know, a large number of illegal immigrants arrive every day. So their traffic routes and landing coasts are known to illegal traffickers and can comfortably be exploited. Usually terrorists arrive in small groups, encounter cores that have already arrived in these countries, coordinate, and can cause chaos by attacking various targets.  I end by saying the characteristic statement of Gaddafi's cousin, who in a British blog said that among a thousand illegal immigrants 10 to 50 are terrorists. \"In one to two years you will have a new 9/11.\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2759, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Ελένη Θεοχάρους (", "mepid": "25704", "text": "  PPE). Madam President, the European Union's Memorandum of Cooperation with the Arab World is important and timely. Its implementation and the coordination of Member States in the fight against the nightmare of terrorism are crucial factors. Arab countries are at the forefront of terrorism, but they are also its first victims. That is why close cooperation and support is needed for those forces in the Arab world that are moderate and fight all forms of extremism.  I come from a small country that is in the crosshairs of ISIS, because it provides military facilities to those who fight terrorism and because the occupied part of Cyprus is a man of fanatical Islamists. We know very well what terrorism means and especially state terrorism, of which we are victims. Cyprus works closely with some Arab countries in the fight against terrorism and can be an advanced outpost of the European Union in the Middle East.

The global war on terror after 9/11 involved measures that violated fundamental rights and international law. Respect for human rights and the rule of law must not fall victim to combating terrorism; these must be the bedrock of it. Many regimes have used repressive methods and emergency legislation to crush dissent. Repression re-provokes discontent and radicalisation, setting off a cycle of violence. Europe and the Arab League states must pursue a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy that tackles the root cause of radicalisation, with particular focus on the economic and social situation of the younger generation in many of these countries.

In a context of evident regional instability, it is essential to maintain the political visibility of relations between the European Union and the League of Arab States in exchanges like this one. I would also like to thank Members of the European Parliament for their constructive approach to the challenges faced in our region and in the Arab world. I understand that a Committee on Foreign Affairs report, prepared by rapporteur Mr Peillon, on security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa is in the making. This is very much in line with our commitment to closer cooperation with the League. Let me also mention that the European Union engages with the League of Arab States not only on security but also in numerous other fields. Since 2012, the European Union and the League of Arab States have shared a joint work programme on cooperation in many sectors. Let me mention just some of them: for example, women’s empowerment, where we engage in a programme jointly with the UN; and human rights, involving also the Council of Europe in streamlining human rights within the activities of the League of Arab States. In addition, the European Union and the League of Arab States are cooperating on election co-observation, focusing on consistent information-sharing regarding the selection of priorities, as well as capacity-building support to the League of Arab States election unit and enhanced cooperation among the respective missions deployed to observe elections in the region. We also engage in other fields, such as civil society and culture. So we can hardly say that relations between the European Union and the League of Arab States are too much security-driven. Several of you referred to the need to address root causes and to counter radicalisation. I would like to draw your attention to the very substantial Council conclusions adopted only last month, which include a clear reference to the underlying factors of radicalisation and the need to support initiatives in the areas of youth provision, education and vocational training, as well as the importance of facilitating interface and civil society dialogues. Several of you also spoke about the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Let me emphasise that the Memorandum of Understanding has been shared with the European Parliament and those in this House who have requested it. The MoU builds on the Athens Declaration. It is not the bedrock of relations between the European Union and the League of Arab States but rather a complementary instrument to ensure that the European External Action Service and the secretariat of the League of Arab States contribute to the successful development of EU—League of Arab States relations. The MoU will be made public, as requested by this House. To conclude, allow me to quote the wise words pronounced by His Majesty the King of Jordan in this Chamber when referring to the challenge posed by terrorism.

We all know that discrimination is one of the scourges of our society. We are shocked when extreme violence hits our front pages and television screens. But we all know that the problem is far more widespread. Ethnic and religious minorities, Jews and Muslims most obviously, are facing discrimination, harassment and violence and there are many reasons to believe this is getting worse.  A 2013 study by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights showed that an overwhelming majority of Jewish respondents felt that anti-Semitism has increased over the past five years. Countries like Belgium, France and Hungary were mentioned in particular. There is more than anecdotal evidence to suggest that European Jews consider emigrating due to security concerns. This is wholly unacceptable. There is also growing evidence of discrimination and stigmatisation of Muslims as well as an increase in the number of Islamophobic incidents. In France a 53 % increase in individual attacks against Muslims was registered in 2014 compared to 2012. Since the Paris attacks a further spike in incidents has been observed. Violence seems more and more part of this extremism. In just a few years, we have seen fatal terrorist attacks in Toulouse, Brussels, Paris and Copenhagen. Such trends are fundamentally contrary to the traditions and values which have made Europe the society it is today. When negative stereotypes are fuelled in the media, in political rhetoric, in public rallies, those responsible are directly challenging the traditions of pluralism, inclusion and tolerance that lie at the heart of Europe, and of the European project. The fundamental values of freedom, diversity and respect for the equal dignity of all individuals cannot be compromised. So how can the EU itself help? Of course, our direct remit is limited, but we certainly need leadership and a clear message from its institutions. This Parliament, the European Council and the Commission all gave a full and unconditional defence of our values in the wake of the Paris attacks. But we must stay vigilant. We must show that we are for solidarity, to protect communities under pressure and to avoid stigmatisation. Stepping up actions aimed at preventing and combating extreme forms of racism, prejudice and intolerance should be a priority. The EU has specific legislation on combating racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law. The Commission acquired enforcement powers for this legislation in December last year. We have also adopted a Directive to support the victims of crime, including all victims of hate crime, which will enter into effect as of November this year. The Commission will prioritise the effective enforcement of both instruments. Phenomena such as hate speech online will also be examined in this context. In order to prevent violence, extremism and radicalised behaviours we also need to strengthen measures promoting social inclusion and cohesion. A priority in this context is to fill existing gaps in EU law on protection from discrimination. In 2008, the Commission proposed a directive on equal treatment, prohibiting discrimination outside the labour market, irrespective of disability, age, sexual orientation and religion or belief. It would extend this protection beyond employment, where EU legislation is already in force, to the areas of social protection, education and access to goods and services. This must now be taken forward into law. We must make the most of the programmes we have to help Member States to address the root causes. For example, the Europe for Citizens programme brings together both the critical memory of the past and civic engagement firmly rooted in shared values as a defining feature of vibrant democracy in European Union. Particularly important is our work to address radicalisation. We need to better understand why some people are drawn down a path so much at odds not only with European values, but with the beliefs of their own communities. That takes time and effort, but there are grass-roots actions in schools, prisons and community centres across the European Union, which are working to exactly this end.  The Commission offers support to such projects and helps others to learn from them. Within the Radicalisation Awareness Network local actors can exchange their experience and knowhow. Over 1 000 practitioners have now been involved over the last three years, resulting in concrete recommendations and hands-on support.  Promoting better interfaith and intercultural understanding also plays a crucial role. In May and June this year the Commission will organise high-level meetings with religious leaders and non-confessional organisations to discuss the issue of tolerance, respect and living together.  Finally, the Commission decided to devote its first ever Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights, scheduled for this October, to fostering tolerance and respect, with a focus on preventing and combating anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hatred. Rising anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and extremism challenge the common values on which the European Union is founded. We must stand up to safeguard these values. As policymakers, political leaders, community and religious leaders, as well as citizens, we must make sure that all our communities can feel at home together and share the hope of a future in Europe, in order to give Europe a future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2777, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Esteban González Pons", "mepid": "125027", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, 'if Auschwitz could have existed for five years, then everything perverse is possible in this world'.

We are discussing anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and an issue which really has not been discussed enough, anti—radicalisation. We all know that anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are issues of the deepest complexity. Jews and Muslims have existed for generations in Europe and the millions of Jews and Muslims in Europe, who now have to face the intolerable attacks which my colleague has described, are going about their daily lives and facing these issues because of a tiny minority. We know these issues are complex, but the job we have to do in the European Union is to see what competences we have to make lives better. We understand that, with the Race Equality Directive, the Council framework decision on racism and xenophobia and all these other tools, we have a job to do and we will do that job. However, anti-radicalisation is an issue which we are just beginning to understand. The European Union will have a role to play in this, and so will Member States. It is a deeply complex issue and, when we find out what it is all about, it will have to be discussed, not at the last minute – 11 o’clock – but among all of us, and not just in one committee but right across this House.

In my own country, Sweden, where we have a fairly good reputation internationally for the protection of minorities, Jews do not feel safe today. The media and opinion leaders are helping to strengthen the climate that prevails against Jews and many are not taken seriously when they express concern. A Swedish journalist recently asked a police officer in Malmö what the police are doing to combat the attacks on Jews, for example against the rabbi in Malmö, who has been repeatedly beaten and subjected to physical violence. The police then responded that the rabbi is so self-deprecent, referring to the rabbi wearing kippa and star of David and Jewish symbols. It has gone very, very far in Europe when the very police force that is supposed to defend every person's right to be who you are, sees it as something problematic that someone is Jewish. Many Jews in Sweden and other European countries are afraid today. They want to leave Europe. Then it is no longer the same Europe in which we live. They have been met with incomprehension and accusations. We have all failed to create security and safeguard freedom of religion, and we must recognise that today. It's happening right in front of our eyes. We must stop turning a blind eye to the reality faced by our religious minorities today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2781, "date": "2015-03-11.json", "name": "Κώστας Χρυσόγονος", "mepid": "125061", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Public condemnation and criminal punishment of racism is a prerequisite for Europe not to relive similar dramas in the future. I must point out, however, that racism has many manifestations and that some of them begin in a somewhat covert way. One example is the targeting of the Greek people in recent weeks by the German newspaper Bildzeitung, with unacceptable designations such as for \"greedy\" Greeks and the like.

Quite the opposite: it shows how much insecurity there is. We see in Europe that parties are being founded on the basis of Islamophobia and of racism. It is appalling to see that parties and politicians are able to gain votes with those ideas, and equally appalling to see that there are politicians trying to do exactly that.

The barely hushed allusions, the small sentences and other insidious forms of expression are more and more trivializing an uninhibited racist word, than it is expressed in the street, in political debate, in the media or on the internet and social networks.

First, the entrenched old prejudice of far-right sectors and the more conservative and nationalistic thinking that Jews are guilty.

These worrying trends must be equally addressed by the EU. Anti-Semitism is not new in Europe and unfortunately it is still a reality for many European Jews.

The Commission should propose a framework for national strategies to combat discrimination in a comprehensive way and to promote full inclusion.  There is a crucial need for interfaith dialogue and cooperation. I have seen the success of this work in my own home town, Manchester, where Jewish and Muslim communities are working together to combat hatred and discrimination.

In this respect, one simply has to let figures speak for themselves. Of course, the number of terrorist attacks has increased. Unfortunately, 99% of terrorist attacks are perdide.

If you want to understand the rise in anti-Semitism, that is a good place to start. There is some hate speech for you. Now regarding Islamophobia, a phobia is defined as an irrational fear.

Unfortunately, as has been said by many of you, it is at a very late hour on an issue which goes to the very heart of our Union. Extremism – whether political or religious – requires a robust response from all those who believe in a free, open, tolerant and diverse democracy. The Irish statesman, Edmund Burke once said that ‘the triumph of evil is dependent on good people being silent’. We all – as authorities, as individuals – have a responsibility to ensure that all Europeans, whatever their background, whatever their religion, feel at home in Europe. As the guardian of the treaties which enshrine our fundamental values and principles – human dignity, tolerance, the rule of law, equality and fundamental rights – the Commission will do all it can within its powers and together with Member States to combat the scourges of racism and xenophobia. We all know that laws are only as good as the extent to which they are enforced and implemented in practice. This has prompted the Commission to prioritise actions aimed at ensuring that Member States not only introduce legislation to counter terrorism, racism, xenophobia and hate crimes, but also actively and effectively ensure its enforcement on the ground. Parliament will remain a key partner for the Commission in taking these actions forward, so we count on your support and I hope there will be another opportunity to discuss this issue at a more appropriate and visible time.

The lack of religious tolerance in particular fills much of the darkest pages in our history. Today, fortunately, 28 peoples united in diversity embody a territory that is founded on tolerance and that does not tolerate aggression to this freedom. Recently, the attacks in Paris were intended to threaten another pillar of our community: freedom of expression. They were not attacks in the name of faith, carried out by Muslims or Jews, were criminal acts perpetrated by radicals. We cannot therefore allow these acts to poison our most fundamental values. As the King of Jordan reminded us, the future is based on unity and respect, not on division and stereotypes. The Union and its political actors, but also the Member States and their leaders, have special responsibilities.

Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia go hand in hand. Far-right groups have gradually replaced the former, the second. Today, the main perpetrators of anti-Semitic and terrorist violence attacks are no longer right-wing extremists, but radicalised elements in Muslim communities in Europe: Muslim anti-Semitism. It is a result of the social exclusion suffered by Muslims and international politics. In this sense, ISIS only offers an identity to those who have always been marginalized and discriminated against. The proposals put forward by the Jewish community (the european-whole ban on wearing the full veil) are not long-term and constructive solutions. We need interreligious dialogue, joint civic initiatives, integrated schooling and more inclusive governance structures. Muslim leaders must fight an anti-Jewish mentality as actively as European Jews must help dispel the falsehoods that fuel Islamophobia: this is the way to beat the twin threats of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.

The best example of this is the attacks in Paris, where radical Islamists born and raised in France shot dead 17 people, four of them Jews.

While attitudes towards Muslims are negative across Europe, we’ve also seen anti-Jewish sentiment growing steadily and it has to be addressed. We need to be vigilant within our communities and not allow for anti-Jewish sentiments to develop just as much as we need to protect Muslims from damaging anti-Islam discourse. It should also be noted that the European Network Against Racism has called on the European Parliament to create a database to assess the rise of Islamophobia as we lack statistics on this, while legal tools have been created in various Member States to fight against anti-Semitism.

The wave of anti-Semitism is a pan-European problem that needs to be addressed in a coordinated manner. I therefore welcome the High Representative's support for the idea of the European Jewish Congress on the establishment of an EU working group to combat anti-Semitism, which should be composed of both MEPs, members of the European Commission and representatives of civil society. In recent years, intercultural dialogue has become an important element of THE EU's action and is one of the key weapons in tackling extremism. Although the European Union has quite a few levers to combat anti-Semitism and violent extremism, particularly through legislation, financial support and dialogue, we should be much more bold in tackling these problems. Last but not least, let us not forget education, which is a key preventive approach in the fight against anti-Semitism.
