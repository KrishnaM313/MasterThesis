His soul will remain etched forever in our hearts and memories, and his work should guide our actions. Locked up in the death camps in Auschwitz in 1944 at the age of 16, a survivor of the atrocities of the Holocaust, Simone Veil embodies courage and symbolizes hope. Her destiny led her to overcome ideology and political divisions, defending, relentlessly and against conservatism, women's rights. Driven by freedom, Simone Veil has never given up in the face of sometimes the most cruel obstacles. Woman of peace, because victim of the tragedy of war, Ms. Veil worked with a unique tenacity for a political Europe bringing together peoples in their diversity. Let us be proud to walk through the door of this institution, which she chaired between 1979 and 1982, every day. Let us above all live up to what Mrs. Simone Veil undertook during a lifetime. The terrible conflicts that persist in parts of the world remind us of the inestimable value of peace. This peace on our continent, we owe it to great women and great men. Simone Veil will be part of it, forever. His talent and his political will to build Europe oblige us. Our societies are losing landmarks and symbols in the face of the immediacy of information and knowledge. But, if the words pass, the acts remain.

Due to various circumstances – some domestic and self—inflicted, such as the well-known bank fraud, which has also led to an interruption of external support, and some external, such as a sharp decrease in exports to Russia and Ukraine – Moldova faces an external balance of payments crisis and has asked for assistance from international donors, notably the IMF and the EU.  In November last year, the IMF approved the three—year programme in the amount of almost USD 180 million and this programme is now well on track. The IMF has also calculated the country’s residual external financial needs for 2016—2018 at approximately EUR 400 million. The EU has also resumed its budgetary support operations, following the interruption in the context of the bank fraud, through the European Neighbourhood Instrument.  In January 2017, the Commission proposed the instrument that we are discussing today, a macro—financial assistance package covering approximately 25% – so only a quarter – of the country’s financial needs as identified by the IMF. This is in order to address the short-term balance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities of the Moldovan economy. The proposed assistance therefore amounts to EUR 100 million; EUR 60 million would be a loan and EUR 40 million would be a grant to be disbursed in three instalments in 2017 – ideally – and in 2018. The Commission had proposed in its original draft text that strong conditionalities be attached to the assistance. These conditionalities have been thoroughly discussed in the two committees giving opinions in this House, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, and of course in the Committee on International Trade. The result has been even stronger conditionalities attached to the disbursement of each of the three instalments. The principle is: no reforms, no money. It is the first time that the EU has taken such a tough stance, as the practice of the EU until now has been to grant the first instalment immediately and only attach some conditions to the subsequent ones.  The ambitious programme of reforms will cover financial sector governance, public sector governance, the fight against corruption, the fight against money laundering, energy sector reforms, and improvement of the business and investment climate. Parliament’s amendments have put strong emphasis on the independence of the judiciary, freedom and pluralism of the media, the depoliticisation of public administration, and the need to fight corruption and money laundering and to support the implementation of the DCFTA. We have clarified that conditions are to be attached to the disbursement of each and every one of the three instalments, that benchmarks should be clear as required by the European Court of Auditors, and that the assistance shall be immediately suspended or terminated if the conditions are not met.  If done properly, it is my strong belief that these reforms have a high potential systemic impact. These are reforms that will discipline and constrain the exercise of power by the government and any other economic or political actor for generations to come. The other two institutions have accepted one hundred percent of our requests. The agreement reached during the trilogue also includes a joint statement by Parliament, the Council and the Commission recalling that the necessary precondition for the disbursement of the assistance is respect for effective democratic institutions.  I have come up with this proposal to adopt this joint statement in order to address the concerns of colleagues in this House regarding the recent initiative by the authorities to change the electoral system in the Republic of Moldova. The process is still ongoing and the Venice Commission has recently made public its opinion on this process.  It is key that the Moldovan authorities duly take into account this recommendation. The joint statement puts a strong emphasis on the fact that the consideration by the Moldovan authorities of the recommendations of the Venice Commission will be part of the regular monitoring of the respect for the aforementioned precondition. The regular monitoring of this precondition is in fact a mandate that we have created and are giving to the Commission. I would encourage the Commission today to reconfirm the strength of its commitment in the context of this instrument that we have created together. This is important and is the underpinning factor for the consensus we have achieved in the House.  To conclude, in its current form, the decision gives us the green light – if we vote positively tomorrow – for the aid to Moldova. However, it does not mean immediate disbursement. If the decision is positive, the first instalment of the disbursement will reach Moldova in December. The European Union is therefore equipped with the right set of instruments to react to any potential developments in the Republic of Moldova.  I will conclude by thanking the shadows Mr Winkler from the PPE, Mr Takkula from ALDE, Mr Zahradil from the ECR, Mr Scholz from GUE and Ms Hautala from the Greens, as well as Mr Auštrevičius and Mr Mureşan, the rapporteurs for the opinion from the two opinion committees, and also Mr Preda from the PPE Group, who has played a key role in building a consensus in this House.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 20, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Sorin Moisă and the Committee on International Trade for their valuable work, and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Committee on Budgets for their support. As you know, the European Commission submitted its proposal for a macro-financial assistance operation to Moldova in the context of difficult political and economic transition. Following the banking fraud scandal of 2014 the new Moldovan Government was appointed in February 2016, adopting a package of key reforms in areas like public governance and anti-corruption. In support of this new reformed path, the EU and Moldova agreed on the roadmap for priority reforms at the beginning of 2016 and with the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of 16 February 2016. Moldova, which is one of the poorest countries in the European neighbourhood needs macro-financial assistance to cover its external financing needs and underpin its slow recovery from the recession in 2015. This macro-financial assistance complements the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which resumed its assistance and approved a new, extended fund facility agreement on 7 November last year. Therefore, it is crucial that the EU, together with other international donors, uses this window of opportunity for reforms in Moldova and supports the new Moldovan Government in its efforts to implement key reforms and bring back economic recovery. However, the Commission shares the concerns of Parliament with regard to important areas like corruption, money laundering, independent judiciary, independent media, and the implementation of the EU-Moldova Association Agreement. Therefore, the Commission supports the five amendments to the recitals of its proposals to address these concerns. Let me also reassure you that the Commission will entirely be guided by these new recitals when implementing this assistance and, in particular, when designing the conditionality of this operation of the memorandum of understanding between the EU and Moldova. The Commission also shares the concerns of Parliament regarding the recent initiatives in Moldova to introduce a new electoral system. Therefore we support the joint statement of the three institutions, recalling that the precondition for granting macro-financial assistance is that the beneficiary country respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. The Commission and the European External Action Service will closely monitor the fulfilment of this pre-condition throughout the lifecycle of this operation and will pay utmost attention to how Moldova follows up on the recommendations of international partners, in particular the recommendations of the Venice Commission and of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe related to the proposed changes in the electoral system. Before closing my remarks I would like to underline again that no disbursement of macro-financial assistance for Moldova will take place if the political preconditions as well as specific economic and financial conditions are not fulfilled. I hope we can count on Parliament’s support for Moldova on its path to reform and I would like to underline that the Council, in a letter of 15 June this year, from COREPER, confirmed the approval of the Commission’s proposal as agreed in the trilogue, subject the approval of the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Petras Auštrevičius", "mepid": "124766", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. –Mr President, Moldova’s future depends on much more than yet another financial tranche.

Everyone is asking for a fair European debate and a consensus—based decision and we do not see this happening. Instead we read today about yet another political party leaving the consultations on election law. I wish to draw the attention of this House to the joint statement of all EU institutions that the Commissioner has just mentioned, which is an integral part of the decision and which makes very clear reference to the Venice Commission recommendations. It is crucial to ensure that these recommendations are fully respected. We must also make sure that we are sending the right message to the Moldovan people, as there is a high risk of manipulation and political misinterpretation. Moldova does indeed have certain privileges, but it has very serious duties.

But what the government seems to be up to now on the issue of suffrage is intolerable. That is why it is very good that the institutions have agreed on the joint declaration, in which we all again explicitly refer to the conditions of the Venice Commission.

It is a catastrophe, which partly took place there, in which all sorts of so-called democratic parties were involved - one of the prime ministers is therefore in jail, others are under indictment. That is why it is absolutely right that we say: We do not want to continue along this path. The result has not only been that we have felt more and more critical, the result has also been that the people of Moldova have turned more and more away, not only from their respective governments, but also from those who support them - namely us. That is why it is correct: this cannot be continued. Now we have a new government that has really not only talked about one thing or another, but also delivered it. The International Monetary Fund has confirmed this and acted accordingly positively. We expect it to continue so that not only is there talk, but delivery is made.

As he and many others have already pointed out in this debate, Moldova is currently facing many challenges, both economic and political. It is important to remember that the purpose of macro-financial assistance has never been to interfere in the political decisions of the recipient country, but purely to create economic stability around the EU in countries such as Moldova. Moldova has slowly emerged from the 2014 banking crisis, but remains the poorest country in Europe. Creating an economically sustainable base requires macro-financial assistance. As for the much-discussed reform of the electoral law, it is, as the Venice Commission said, a matter for the sovereign state, and the EU has no power to intervene in decisions concerning it. However, the EU's most economic and political work must be based on the EU's own values ​​of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Therefore, I think it is reasonable to make these a condition for financial assistance as well. As an independent state, Moldova has the right to make its own political decisions, but the European Union must uphold its own values.

With 100 million euros, the Moldovan government should be able to pay teachers in the autumn and service the debt rates at the IMF. As a group, we have always affirmed that macro-financial assistance should not be used to map out new debt prospects; instead of loans, grants should largely be granted. In the report it just submitted on the implementation of financial aid, the EU Commission assesses the economic and political situation in the country in 2016 as increasingly difficult. I therefore ask you, Commissioner: do the latest developments in Moldova, in your assessment, meet the characteristics of a reliable partner acting in accordance with the rule of law? The country's population continues to suffer from the influence of oligarch Vlad Plahotniuc on the government and the economy. You and we know that. With this in mind, I advocated strict preconditions for the payment of each tranche. This explicitly includes respect for human rights and basic democratic rights and an independent judiciary that is bound by the rule of law. In the past week we experienced the opposite - very specifically and precisely: Grigore Petrenco and seven other young people were asked on June 28 for the organization and participation in a demonstration on social justice according to one - unanimously classified by all international observers - dubious Sentenced to three to four and a half years in prison. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the German and US governments describe the men as political prisoners. Should this be used to set the political course before the next elections? We just talked about the right to vote.

Therefore I believe that this macrofinancial assistance is different from the other agreements that have been struck between the institution since 2013. We start to see that an instrument that takes the form of budget support needs to be based on trust that the money is going to where it is needed and, as the previous speaker, Mr Scholz, said, that we are not generating debts for the future. We are indeed generating debts for the future if the Commission and the External Action Service are not very consistent with the conditioning of this macrofinancial assistance with, for instance, a very strong fight against corruption, and against money laundering.  I must remind the House about the rather recent understanding of the role of Moldovan banks, and even of Moldovan judges, in some of the biggest money-laundering scandals in our environment. The so-called Russian Laundromat revealed a lot of the reality of the banking system and the judiciary in Moldova and we cannot let that go easily. Also we still remember the embezzlement by which one billion euro was transferred from three Moldovan banks to shell companies in Hong Kong and other offshore havens.  At the same time as we are fighting against money laundering, against tax evasion, we should also expect that our associated partner countries do their utmost to eradicate these kind of things from their system. So I also, on behalf of the Green/European Free Alliance Group, expect the Commission to implement and take seriously the joint declaration that the three institutions agreed when we concluded the negotiations, and I also want to hear how the Commission is going to follow the situation and implement this.

The explanatory statement that comes with this report says that the free trade agreement between the European Union and Moldova has contributed to the process of economic recovery. Well, that is what free trade does! If only the European Union actually focused on breaking down barriers to trade rather than creating them, perhaps it would be less of a negative force throughout the world. The Economic Freedom Index places Moldova worse than countries like Rwanda and Swaziland when it comes to being attractive to trade and investment. The solution, here again, is not to give Moldova more money: the solution is for Moldova to become more competitive. Is giving so much money to a country so notorious for official corruption and economic poor performance really a good use of taxpayers’ money?

Today we see that the European Union wants to subdue the nations, and this macro-financial deal is unfortunately going in the wrong direction. In October 2017, Moldova was granted observer status with the Eurasian Economic Union. This has sparked the ire of the European Union, which sees it as a declaration of war. Yet nations have the right to decide with whom they want to cooperate. The Moldovan nation, unfortunately, has been very weakened culturally, because it is shared between East and West, but above all because this nation of 3.5 million inhabitants - that I had the opportunity to visit recently - is a nation left behind. Today you want to play on the sensitivity of this nation to attract it and bring glory to the European Union, but in fact you are only going to cause trouble with Russia once again.

Macro-financial assistance is one of many tools at our disposal for accompanying and supporting the Republic of Moldova on its process of political association and economic integration with the European Union and, although some areas require additional efforts, overall there has been substantial progress since the start of the current Executive’s term of office. This week, after very thorough, comprehensive and attentive negotiations with the Council and the Commission based on a clear mandate, the House will vote on this macro-financial assistance.

The criteria proposed by the Commission and the Council are the right ones, they are in line with the European values ​​that we all need to protect. What, from my point of view, is not correct, is to introduce a new criterion, a new conditionality, which is related to the electoral law.

I hope that is to the satisfaction of most colleagues, and I was happy to see that both Mr Preda and Mr Stolojan seemed to be satisfied with the Commission’s very clear position. I shall tackle very briefly some of the issues that were raised on this. The common thread of the discussion has been the alleged – probably real – excessive power of some business people or oligarchs in Moldova. I truly believe in the following reality: the package of conditionalities attached to this MFA has true transformative potential to limit any type of arbitrary exercise of power in the Republic of Moldova. We have focused so much on the electoral issue – which is important, that is why we have addressed it through the joint declaration – but I truly believe that the reforms will be there for a generation, maybe those attached to the package itself, and this is far more important than simply a discussion on electoral reform nowadays. I also believe that there is a false dichotomy between corruption and competitiveness. In order for a country to be competitive, it cannot be corrupt. It does need to address corruption, so I believe we are doing the right thing with the DCFT, on the one hand, and with properly addressing and incentivising the fight against corruption Moldova, that is indeed the right thing to do. I would also encourage the Moldovan authorities to truly reach out to the opposition and to civil society, and engage in this discussion if the discussion continues on the transformation of the electoral system, but I also encourage the other parties to accept the invitation for dialogue. A proper democracy requires loyal democrats on all sides. And there is a bit of a paradox here: if you try to impose consensus from the outside, then a party walking out of that consensus could have a sort of veto power which may be seen as unfair.

In each sector, standards are a necessary component and a mechanism that can improve health and safety for our citizens, can protect consumers and raise their confidence, guarantee safe products and services, reduce costs and enhance performance for businesses, increase sales and the take-up of new technologies, boost competitiveness and innovation in Europe. However, it is important that standards are developed in an open, inclusive and transparent system, based on close partnership, cooperation and broad support of industry, public authorities, consumers, workers and citizens, i.e. all the stakeholders. This is of paramount importance when standards are developed for products and services that can affect the health and safety and the wellbeing of people. And this is the main thrust of my report, Standards for the 21st Century. The objective of this report is to contribute to the ongoing debate and to set the European Parliament’s priorities in response to the Commission standardisation package, including the joint initiative on standardisation and development of ICT standards. The report will also contribute to the first interinstitutional dialogue and to the Commission’s Annual Work Programme 2018, which will be adopted in July. I would like to express my gratitude to the shadows and to the Commission for their open and collaborative work on this report. In fact, the Commission has decided to postpone their Annual Work Programme by one month, so that they can take on board our recommendations, which will be voted upon tomorrow. The standardisation environment is changing and is challenging. To respond to these challenges, I based the report on a number of salient points that are essential for the future of the European standardisation system. First, the report acknowledges that there is more to the standardisation process than an economic aspect. The European standardisation system must be based on an inclusive, holistic and common approach whereby SMEs, consumer and citizen goals – particularly those related to economic, social and health issues and the environment – are fully integrated into the standardisation process. Second, the report stresses the importance and success of the Standardisation Regulation 1025. The European system is unique, but we should always strive to improve it, without undermining all the positive work which has been done. There are two different ecosystems at European level for the development of EU standards, and that is CEN/CENELEC and ETSI. Both systems have their existing good practices but they need to be explored further. That is why the report makes some valuable suggestions on how to further improve, support and strengthen the work of the European standardisation organisations, by safeguarding that the development of standards remains open, transparent and guided by European interests. Third, it is important to stress that standards are not a legislative tool, and they should not be used as such. They are a voluntary, market-driven tool, providing technical requirements and guidance for the implementation of EU legislation. Fourth, standards is an extremely competitive area at international level and in order to maintain Europe’s leadership position in technical development and global trade, we need to pay more attention to the global role and relevance of standards. Fifth, developing standards is a long-term investment and not everyone can afford the time, expertise and investment in this complex process. Therefore, a key point in the report is supporting SMEs’ participation in the process of developing standards. The report also recognises the key role of ICT standards for the future development of the digital single market, FRAND – fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory – royalty-free licensing and open-source software implementation. Having open standardisation processes based on FRAND licensing terms, which address the legitimate interests of both the holders of rights and potential licensees, is now more important than ever. Finally, we need to increase the awareness and knowledge about standards and to explain how standardisation works and when it can be used. We are therefore proposing an Annual Standardisation Forum where once a year stakeholders can meet to discuss European standards. So I hope that you can support this report at tomorrow’s vote so that this institution can send a strong message about the importance of the European standardisation system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Hans-Olaf Henkel", "mepid": "124823", "text": "Draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mister President! First of all, thank you very much, Ms. Mizzi, for your excellent work and for taking on board the suggestions made by the ITRE committee. As someone who has spent his entire professional life in this industry, I know that it is important that we need standards in information and communication technology in order to truly achieve the digital single market. But in this discussion - not with you, but with a few other colleagues - I have repeatedly noticed that we still have some catching up to do here, including on the subject of prejudice. I noticed that American companies are often demonized on this subject. We should stop, because we also need cooperation with the Americans, especially when it comes to this issue of information and communication technology. Second, we should stop demonizing big companies. Of course, it is important that we support small and medium-sized companies. But why are corporations something bad? Because we all know that corporations - including the big ones - need many thousands of small and medium-sized companies and vice versa. Thirdly, I would like to point out that standards should not be confused with harmonization. We need the standards to create competition, because competition between small units always leads to a stronger whole. But if we now harmonize in Europe at the same time - and we do this at every opportunity - then we will disrupt and destroy competition. It's like running a marathon: of course you have to know that you can run 42 kilometers and 195 meters, and that applies to everyone. But imagine if the runners made a promise at the beginning of the run that they would all finish at the same time arrive.Then competition and with it the European internal market would be destroyed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 61, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first I want to thank Ms Mizzi for her report on European standardisation. This is an important document; important for us, important for the European standardisation community. It sets out a balanced view on several questions on the European standardisation system and as I can see from it, we agree on the fundamental principles in the area. Just one sentence: over the past 30 years European standards have delivered great benefits for companies, for consumers. They have been based on a unique partnership between European legislators, standard—setting bodies, industry workers and of course civil society groups.  At the heart of the partnership has been a voluntary, demand-led and consensus-driven approach but the standardisation system now, of course, faces a number of challenges: the increasing speed of change in the global economy, the growing role of ICT and the increasing importance of services, to name just a few of them.  So last year we set out a new direction in this area, calling for a system that is agile and that is timely. At its heart we launched a joint initiative on standardisation. We want a system that is both inclusive and collaborative, a system that taps the potential of ICT and services and, above all, a system that can set priorities and deliver results. I am pleased to see that the report recognises the importance of standardisation and welcomes at the same time the joint initiative. The report will fit into our annual Union work programme on European standardisation for next year, which is currently under discussion. The upcoming interinstitutional dialogue early next year will also be an opportunity to further discuss the topics of mutual interest. As I cannot, as you understand, now comment on the whole report, I will focus on four key aspects that the rapporteur also mentioned, the importance of inclusiveness, transparency, ICT standardisation and standard essential practices. Let me start with inclusiveness. Standards, as was said, affect everybody so everybody should have the possibility to have their opinion heard and taken into account when standards are prepared. The report acknowledges that the 2012 Regulation on standardisation has made improvements here so we will continue in this direction.  We have asked the European standardisation organisations – the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) – as well as all national standardisation bodies to intensify their cooperation with stakeholders. We are asking them to adapt their internal rules and their internal procedures to help the work of stakeholders’ organisations. In the joint initiative there are three actions focused on inclusiveness. They target inclusiveness at national, European and international level. Work on this has started and is progressing smoothly so far. Second, on transparency, I agree with the report that we need to increase the transparency, accountability and timelines of the standardisation system. I know the report called us to address the reasons behind the decreasing citation of references of harmonised standards in the Official Journal. We are working closely with the standardisation organisations to find practical and durable solutions. Third, on ICT standardisation. Most people know how frustrating it is and can be to buy digital technology only to find that it cannot connect to other devices. ICT standards ensure that these devices work together seamlessly. Last year we adopted a strategic and political plan on ICT standardisation priorities. It is focused on five key areas: 5G, the internet of things, cloud computing, cyber security and data technologies.  We are working closely together with the standardisation community to implement the actions in the time frame indicated. Success depends on high level commitment from a broad stakeholder base. This includes Member States, industry of course, standard—setting organisations and the research community. Finally, my last point, I agree that we need to ensure that industry can rely on an effective licencing system. We need a balanced licencing system for technologies endorsed in standards, in other words, standard essential patents. This system should provide for growth and efficient access to these technologies while at the same time ensuring that there are adequate incentives for research, development and innovation. We are currently working on how to improve the licencing environment and provide clarity on an SEP licencing environment and fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory practices. Once again let me thank the honourable Member for such an excellent report.

The question of standardisation is, in fact, absolutely key if we want to achieve a modern, interoperable, single European transport area. The problem is that one of the failures of the internal market is that we have not managed to confront the fragmentation of that market, with different national standards, so our companies, whether in the logistics or freight sectors, often have to cope with different national documents each time they cross a border. At a time when the transport sector is cutting down emissions and becoming much more digitalised and intermodal, at a time when the Commission has put forward the mobility package, we definitely need an interoperable, free-flow-of-data sector which will provide for the uptake of new technologies, like, for example, electric vehicles. We see too that standards now encompass the ICT standards, and this is an absolutely key area, and one in which we would like to encourage our citizens, too, to go intermodal – to use something that is called integrated ticketing. One final remark: I would expect the Commission to see this as an external plea to provide, in its proposals, for intermodal interaction based on free flow of data and everything that comes with it.

Madame la rapporteure, I would like to thank you for your excellent work and the cooperation you have shown in the work. There has really been a report that has really added value, and I can also say that it will be of strategic importance for the future. This report explicitly highlights how key standardization systems are to realizing the potential of the internal market and how important they can be for competitiveness. Without going into full detail or repeating what was said in front of me, I just want to draw attention to a few aspects. Firstly, on the future of European standardization. When we talk about this issue, the question arises as to how to approach it, what the review of this system should be. Well, we can say that the current system is relatively well regulated. So we need to touch without throwing away the current results. So we cannot make a radical change that would weaken the main element of the current system. At the same time, I would also like to mention as an aspect the importance of involving everyone in the standardization process. Be it a national organization, standards bodies and their cooperation. Another aspect is how important it is for everyone involved to have access to it. That is, for standards to be understood by those to whom they apply. Let us also not forget that not everything can be standardized. These standards must not distort competition, and it is precisely by increasing competition that barriers must be removed. It is important that we involve all stakeholders, those involved in research and development and innovation, and everyone in this process. And one last aspect: enforcing the FRAND principle throughout the process.

Chairman! In everyday life, we rarely think about the fact that there are standards everywhere, even though many of them are very important to us. Just think if the light bulb did not fit the lamp, if the screw did not fit the nut, and if the USB connector only fit a few PCs. Last year, the Commission presented a standardization package with a number of initiatives. All of this is something that will make the European standardization system work well and efficiently, which is absolutely necessary for a well-functioning internal market. For us Social Democrats, standardization work is important, and we therefore fully support the entire European standardization work. I was the Social Democrats' rapporteur on the standardization legislation we made back in 2012. But we also have a few important messages for the effort. We Social Democrats believe that standardization can neither must nor must replace legislation. Legislation is still needed to set the framework for e.g. secure products, for privacy and for the involvement of non-commercial interests. We also see that there is a particular challenge to standards in the digital age. We need to have a flexible and sustainable and inclusive standardization system, but it is also important that we get e.g. citizens and consumers when it comes to rolling out digital single market standards. It is therefore important that there is a strategic approach to the entire standardization work. We mean e.g. also, when it comes to privacy, that it is important that we have standards for the entire design phase, so that we get a high and important level of protection for consumers already in the design phase, and in this regard, standards are absolutely crucial. So we back that up.

However, if you talk to people then you hear that people are quite annoyed at having different plugs and different cables for each device that they have, and this is all due to a lack of standards. The EU needs to have an effective and proactive market-driven standardisation policy if we want to be leaders in innovation, the leaders of the race for 5G and for the Internet of Things. This sector is very fragmented, with many proprietary and semi-closed solutions and a multitude of standards. However, if we think about what the Internet of Things is all about – devices communicating with other devices – it is difficult to see how we can do this without standards. I believe that the more open standards we have, the more innovation we have. However, the discussion on this report has shown that we all talk about open standards but we all have different views about what ‘open’ really means. Can we truly call a standard open just because the standardisation process was inclusive enough? Or what about the outcome of the standard? The point of setting standards is that other companies will be able to build their innovations upon them. At least this report acknowledges that there are different business models out there, but I do think the Commission should promote solutions that ensure that different business models can co-exist. If all standardisation initiatives are based on royalties, for instance, where does it leave open-source licensing? As open source can be shared in an unlimited manner, it is not really compatible with royalty-based models.

Creating a European standard puts this reputation at risk, as not all Member States are yet able to produce products and services at the same high standard. Indeed, even testing centres for EU standards cannot yet guarantee that products produced under this proposal are all of the same quality.

It is above all cooperation between nations, which I hope, that can promote this type of voluntary approach. In this, I could support certain orientations of this report, but companies and social actors also need stability, and these standards, as useful as they are, must not become obstacles to development, either through chronic instability, either by becoming a real obstacle course or an economic brake for companies already bloodless because of a strong organized economic deregulation, finally, or by becoming the result of strong pressure from particular interest groups. Here we come to the crux of the matter: to entrust the Commission, organizations, agencies or even single standards poles with the establishment of these standards is a strategic error.

I think the report that Mrs Mizzi tabled and that was drawn up with our shadow rapporteurs is good. It may be better than the debate today. So I just want to add three points. Firstly: I believe that standards are created on the basis of private law cooperation between the institutions grouped together in the standardization organizations. That is why there is no connection with public legislation, and you may have to say that to the European Court of Justice at one point or another. Standards created under private law have nothing to do with legislation - colleagues here at the company have also pointed this out. Secondly: …. Ms. Parker is leaving now - it would be a shame because I could have explained to her how large ... companies from the UK like Vodafone came to the European continent by taking over some parts of the market because European standards allowed them to participate. I think it is outrageous that this economic coincidence is neglected here, and I think they will pay a high price for this, because without these common standards for the whole internal market, companies that operate in a smaller marketplace will be cut off. These standards allow big companies and small companies, all over Europe, to take the part of the market they want to have, and therefore I think they are also in the interest of companies from the country which Ms Parker comes from and which is leaving the European Union . Then I would like to add one more point. I think my colleague Gáll-Pelcz mentioned it: One topic in the area of ​​standardization is currently the so-called FRAND standard, which allows all parties involved in standard-essential patents to have access under fair conditions. From my point of view, this process should be strengthened so that we will continue to do the same in the future Conditions for all market participants received.Overall, thank you again for the competent processing of the report.(The speaker agreed to answer a question on the blue card procedure under Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure.)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 71, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Tibor Szanyi (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124703", "text": "Blue card question.- Mr President, please understand that sometimes I also use a blue card for keynote speakers because I want to know the views of the political groups.Although I am lucky in this case because my colleague Schwab is a very good representative of the People's Party.So I would like to add my question now, very briefly.Mrs Gállné Pelcz mentioned the issue of accessibility.Since one of the most exciting initiatives of the European Union is the 'smart villages' initiative, I ask how much of this current report can be extended to the special needs of rural areas and villages?", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 72, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Andreas Schwab (PPE)", "mepid": "28223", "text": "Answer to a question about the “blue card” procedure.- Mr Szanyi, thank you very much for the question.In fact, we have a great interest in digitally opening up rural areas everywhere in the European Union - regardless of whether that applies to your country or my country.And I believe that we not only have to have the necessary infrastructure for this, but also provide standards that can be used by companies - regardless of their size.It is therefore a good thing that we have not stipulated a definition of so-called open standards here in this report that goes beyond the definition made in Regulation 1025/2012.I think this is a good way to enable rural regions to be connected to the digital infrastructure.I hope that has answered your question.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Maria Grapini (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124785", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome the proposal for a report on standardization, given that standards are tools that contribute to a fair balance between the European and international national dimensions.

Within this, there are some priority issues in our Committee on the Internal Market - which continues to work on them - such as, for example, 5G, computing work in the cloud, the internet of things, big data technologies and cybersecurity. Both the Commission's general package on European standardization and the Communication, adopted in April 2016, on information and communication technology standards will provide the harmonization that we have been demanding for so long in this sector. With this, we are taking another step towards a common regulatory framework, which is capable of uniformly adapting to the evolution of technological and logistical advances that is developing around it.

The many differences between the systems of national rules represent today an obstacle to the free movement of goods and to healthy competition, creating significant administrative burdens and limiting the freedom of choice for consumers. I believe that the European Union must therefore invest more in regulatory harmonization processes, to be developed also with the support of all interested parties. And, first of all, I believe in the first place that a common European strategy must prove itself to be proof against small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be the main beneficiaries of new European rules. One of the main challenges to be overcome is that linked to the digitization of our society. The development of common standards in the field of new information technologies will undoubtedly strengthen the competitiveness, interoperability, security and sustainability of our digital infrastructures: essential conditions for the development of a single space of opportunity for European citizens.

Promoting the European standardization hub with a global impact is indeed an ambitious goal and will give the European economy a lead. But it can be done with steady steps and a plan to support priority areas, such as the construction sector. If the standards eventually lead to higher quality, it is likely that in the future we will avoid tragedies like the one in the Tower of London. Standards are mainly an extremely important tool for the functioning of the single market and -of course- the digital single market. They promote innovation, increase the quality of services and products, ensure consumer safety and enhance competitiveness. In the Committee on Industry we unanimously approved the report in which I represented the European People's Party. In fact, we expect the Internet of Things, data protection and cyber security to create a technological backbone so that we can develop important areas.

I would like to call on the Commissioner here to really make the Commission as ambitious as possible in this matter, so that we can really strengthen the adoption of technical standards for individual products, and thus create a single market.

I also very much appreciate that this report talks about the digital market. I consider it extremely important to strengthen the interoperability of individual digital resources at the time of digitization.

In the plan presented by the Commission, the joint initiative on standardization must be accompanied by studies of economic and social impact. In fact, I believe that the standardization process must go beyond the single economic aspects. A holistic approach is needed, in which the objectives of SMEs, consumers and citizens - especially those relating to economic, social, health and environmental issues - are fully integrated.

It is key here that our standards should become a global standard. I very much agreed with Mr Schwab when he said that those outside the system who will not participate in creating European standards will pay the price sooner rather than later. I also agree that standards are crucial for the integrity of the internal market. We are doing our best under our joint initiative launched last year to avoid the fragmentation of the single market. The joint initiative, that was broadly welcomed by all of the partners and all of the stakeholders of the Standardisation System – if I may just repeat this – is there to create a system that is inclusive, collaborative and a symbol for the companies, a system that taps the potential of IT and services, but above all a system that can set priorities in areas such as e-health, smart energy and intelligent transport systems. For example, connected automated vehicles will significantly benefit from our proposed prioritisation. Thank you very much again for this discussion.

At the same time, it is estimated that 120,000 people in the European region have developed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and in general, viral hepatitis is one of the most serious threats to public health. These three infections require long-term and permanent programs that often target multiple populations at the same time. If prevention services were integrated, synergies and savings could be achieved. The current EU Action Plan on HIV / AIDS expired at the end of 2016. The ECDC Framework Action Plan for Tuberculosis in the European Union dates from 2008 and needs to be updated. To date, there is no comprehensive plan to combat hepatitis C at European Union level. At the Informal Meeting of EU Health Ministers in Bratislava on 4 October 2016, Member States agreed to support the development of a framework for an integrated European Union policy on HIV / AIDS. tuberculosis and hepatitis C. This policy should be appropriate to the specific nature of the epidemics in the European Union and neighboring countries, in order to strengthen the policy response to these diseases. In its Communication entitled \"Next steps for a sustainable European future\", the Commission emphasized its continued efforts to eradicate HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis and reduce hepatitis by 2030. We have asked and continue to ask: What concrete steps does the Commission plan to take to has it fulfilled what it set out in the above-mentioned communication with regard to the goal of sustainable development 3 - \"ensuring a healthy life and promoting well-being for all people of all ages\"? Secondly, how is the Commission's plan responding to the Bratislava agreement between EU health ministers on 4 October on developing a framework for HIV / AIDS and hepatitis C policy? And thirdly: how does the Commission intend to increase funding to combat tuberculosis in developing EU countries by providing financial assistance to Member States, which should partially cover the high costs of tuberculosis treatment? Commission representatives, how many times have we dealt with this matter here? Honestly, your inaction in this matter is becoming unacceptable. Already in 2015, I called on you to create a new concept for combating these diseases for the years 2014-2020. I myself wrote several written questions to the Commission on this subject. And what have we seen so far? Nothing at all. Always just evasive words and promises that have not been fulfilled. And not to mention ridiculous answers to my written questions. We have already asked the three Dutch, Slovak and Maltese Presidencies to resolve the situation. Now our fourth presidency is beginning and the solution is nowhere to be seen. In the meantime, the situation has worsened much and we have also gone through the strategies that were still running two years ago. Not only is the situation outside the European Union deteriorating for us, but the catastrophic situation is beginning to be in the immediate vicinity, for example, with regard to HIV. Our ECDC's annual epidemiological reports on cross-border disease threats are eloquent proof of this. Member States have already understood that we urgently need an updated EU framework policy to combat HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C for the period 2016-2020, which would address the specific nature of the epidemic not only in the European Union but also in the Eastern Partnership countries. However, 8 months have passed since the informal meeting in Bratislava in October 2016! When will the Commission finally understand that tackling these three diseases requires a comprehensive strategy that targets the overlapping sections of the population, even the poorest? In addition, the first WHO Global Health Strategy against Viral Hepatitis (2016-2021), adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2016, emphasizes the key role of universal health care and aims, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, to reduce new cases by 2030. viral hepatitis by 90% and eventually eradicate viral hepatitis as a public health problem.It will be very difficult for the Commission to monitor progress towards the sustainable development goals for viral hepatitis, as data on the monitoring of the disease in the Member States are often missing or insufficient.The approach to combating viral hepatitis at EU level is still inconsistent and is being addressed on a country-by-country basis.Unfortunately, the Commission's response is none.We are not fulfilling our international obligations, I ask you, Commissioner?These diseases are relatively easy to prevent, but if they do occur, they are already very difficult to deal with.By not doing this, we are losing billions of euros from the health and social care system in the subsequent treatment of their chronic phase.And it is imperative to work together at a transnational and interdisciplinary level to tackle these epidemics.And we want to challenge you to that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 89, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, frankly I disagree with Ms Konečná who said that the Commission is not doing anything now. It is unfair.  I am pleased to attend this plenary session and to talk about HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis. Let me stress that I fully share your concerns about the need for concrete action to address these three diseases. It was our proposal, from the Commission side, to link HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C. Why? Because the same vulnerable groups, the same people, are affected by those diseases: the poorest people, homeless people, people in prison and so on, people with a stigma – and we have joined forces in saying yes, it is time to show synergy. These diseases continue to cause suffering to millions of citizens across the European Union. More than five million people in the EU suffer from hepatitis C. This is very serious. More than 100 000 people need lifelong treatment for HIV/AIDS, and 30 000 people become infected every year. The latest figures show an increase in HIV across the whole of Europe, from Cyprus and Malta to Germany, Ireland and Lithuania. The economic crisis since 2008 has worsened the situation: in parallel with a deterioration in social and economic determinants, inequalities are on the rise. Tuberculosis is a social illness in this respect, and all these aspects show the seriousness of the situation.  In recent years we have seen a 40% increase in new core infections of tuberculosis and HIV, and the rate of drug resistance to tuberculosis remains high. In addition to human suffering, these diseases pose serious challenges to our health systems and to our economy and our society across Europe, yet much of this suffering is preventable. The message is clear: greater efforts are needed to reduce both the suffering and the costs that these diseases inflict. As you know, health ministers exchanged views on these issues last October and they recognised the challenges, in particular with regard to tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. It was our common job, together with the Council, to discuss these issues. Just a couple of weeks ago at the Health Council, I also spoke to ministers about the need to intensify concrete action and strengthen implementation efforts to prevent the spread of these diseases. I had very comprehensive debates with the new director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), speaking about possibilities to renew our activities and once again to strengthen collaboration between Members States. In answer to your first question: what concrete action is the Commission planning to take to give effect to the commitments made in the abovementioned communication pertaining to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’? Let me assure you that the Commission remains fully committed to helping Member States achieve the goal of ending HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and reducing viral hepatitis by 2030. The Commission reaffirmed this commitment last November in its communication entitled ‘Next steps for a sustainable European future’. In this communication you can see our positions and our activities. Next year the Commission will present further measures to address HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and tuberculosis as a follow-up to this communication, and in the course of the next year we will put forward action plans to that end. In the meantime, the Commission is already fostering cooperation at EU level with Member States and stakeholders and is supporting projects and research in this area. The Commission has re-launched the HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C and tuberculosis think-tank. It has also enlarged the scope of the former HIV Civil Society Forum, which now encompasses all HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C organisations. We have started to discuss very concrete measures, and how to move in the right directions. Together we will seek to identify concrete steps to scale up our prevention and testing programmes, to reach out to the most vulnerable and to address social inequalities and determinants. To succeed, I believe we need to combine health instruments with social instruments and work together across health, social and education policies. I will be more than happy to see a very comprehensive approach, together with the European Parliament and Member States, in this direction. Integration of prevention, treatment and care for HIV/AIDS plus tuberculosis and hepatitis should become standard practice across Europe, and we will look at how to do more and to encourage Member States to move in such a direction. As for your second question, which I need not repeat: firstly, the Commission’s EU health programme is supporting action, in particular, to target the most vulnerable. The Commission is currently shaping a new joint action called ‘Integrate’ with Member States in improving the quality of prevention and care for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections. Starting in September, for three years, this joint action will help Member States develop policies to integrate early diagnosis and care for HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and other infections. With a co-funding of EUR 2.5 million, this joint action will promote capacity-building, training, exchange of good practices and the practical piloting of tools for diagnosis and linkage to care – encouraging Member States to use such opportunities and, of course, to do their best at national level. The joint action will notably expand the use of tools to increase testing and linkage to care in healthcare facilities and to facilitate the expansion of HIV home self-testing and home sampling programmes. Secondly, the Commission is also strongly committed to continuing to support research for HIV, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis. Under the Horizon 2020 Programme, we support development of novel preventative and therapeutic tools to fight this infection. Research into the development of prophylactic vaccines accounts for over half of our investment in these diseases: EUR 60 million for research on HIV vaccination and EUR 26 million for tuberculosis vaccines. Thirdly, on the subject of vaccines, to ensure that citizens fully benefit from existing vaccines and other medicines, it is important to make them more accessible and affordable to all, and therefore to encourage Member States to engage in swifter cooperation, exchanging practices and experiences, and to increase transparency in the pricing of medicines, for example by using the European Integrated Price Information Database (EURIPID) supported by the Member States. I also encourage Member States to use joint procurement agreements as a potential means of reducing shortages of vaccines. Fourthly, we also need to optimise the use of the existing regulation to allow innovative medicines that bring therapeutic added value to reach patients faster, and to explore fully the opportunities that joint procurement offers. I have also asked the Expert Group on Safe and Timely Access to Medicines for Patients (STAMP) to move in that direction. Fifthly and lastly, the need to support measures to address multidrug resistance to tuberculosis as well as HIV and hepatitis is enshrined in the new Commission Action Plan to reduce anti-microbial resistance, which the Commission adopted last Thursday. The Commission is engaged in establishing an integrated and systematic monitoring system for the 2030 Agenda to keep track of progress and to respond to the United Nations reporting requirement. It is also necessary to agree on common indicators. On your third question, our action does not stop at the borders of the European Union. The Commission is also fully engaged in international cooperation to address HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis. I attend a lot of international meetings at which we discuss together common steps. The Commission supports global health initiatives such as the global fund to fight tuberculosis and malaria. The EU has actually recently increased its financial support to this fund and to the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation, the co-called GAVI Alliance. I have high expectations for the first global ministerial conference on ending tuberculosis next November in Moscow, which I will attend. In addition, all three EU institutions have recently signed the European Consensus on Development. This consensus commits us to invest in preventing and combatting communicable diseases and securing affordable medicines and vaccines for all. The Consensus is our key external tool for implementing the 2030 Agenda in our development cooperation. I thank the European Parliament for being one of the co-founders of such a consensus and such a document in which we enshrined a lot of initiatives and set out our goals. Mr President, honourable Members, I hope and trust you share my enthusiasm to drive matters forward. Let us work more closely together to eliminate the suffering that HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis cause. It is hard to contemplate the picture we see today. Every day that I am in Strasbourg I see people sleeping on the streets – homeless people, who are in a difficult situation.

If hope is reborn with the latest wave of therapeutic innovations, such as the treatment to cure hepatitis C or a possible vaccine against AIDS, in the trial phase, the situation remains alarming: 2 and a half million people in Europe are infected with the AIDS virus, 14 million are infected with hepatitis C and a particularly worrying epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is currently affecting eastern Europe. In the face of these threats, it is clearly up to Europe to act. Only effective coordination at European level will enable these epidemics to be overcome. \"Every man for himself\" is no longer an option. A coordinated response is all the more necessary as these three pathologies present a significant co-morbidity. Their treatment is also associated with a strong social stigma which tends to isolate and make infected patients even more vulnerable. However, despite the situation, these diseases had disappeared from European political priorities, leaving us with particularly old commitments. The HIV action plan ended in December 2016, the tuberculosis action plan dates back to 2008 and no guidelines exist for viral hepatitis. As the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, I call on you, Commissioner - and I know you are very sincere - to put on the table, without delay, this new European strategic framework that you have come to describe us - an integrated, cross-cutting framework that addresses both HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis.

I know it means as much to them as it means to me.  The title of the resolution, ‘HIV, TB and HCV epidemics in Europe on the rise’, is suggestive because tuberculosis has existed for millennia and remains a major global health problem which feeds on poverty. In 2015 there were almost 30 000 newly diagnosed HIV infections reported within the EU-EEA region. Around 400 people die too each day in the European region from causes related to viral hepatitis despite the availability of prevention and treatment. This is the painful reality. The cost of HIV, TB and HCV medicines for treatment and for prevention varies from one country to another. As such, all three infections require long-term and sustained programmes, often targeting overlapping population groups. Therefore it is necessary to develop a comprehensive EU policy framework addressing HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis and hepatitis C, as the Member States agreed in Bratislava in October 2016 and because in 2016, all programmes regarding TB, HIV and HCV ended.  I want to draw your attention to the fact that fighting against HIV, TB and HCV epidemics is the responsibility of all the actors involved – the Commission, the Member States, the non-governmental organisations, social organisations and society in general. In addition, victims and vulnerable populations must be at the centre of all efforts, based on close cooperation and coordination amongst all relevant actors. In order to improve HIV, TB and HCV prevention, detection and treatment adherence, the Commission and the Member States need to develop specific programmes and financial support to strengthen work with communities and vulnerable people, especially in developing countries. Without action and funding we cannot fight against these epidemics.

In the case of tuberculosis, the biggest problem today is multi-drug resistance resulting from the overuse of antibiotics - not only in treatment, but also as antibiotic growth factors in farmed animals - which requires a solution at the central level of the EU, as the number of tuberculosis infections is increasing not only in African or Central European countries. Eastern, but also in rich countries. With over 40 million people infected with HIV, in addition to adequate healthcare organization with lifelong antiretroviral therapy, there is a need for improved diagnosis, which increases the chance of living without AIDS. However, people living with HIV play the most important role in controlling the epidemic, preventing and transmitting HIV to others, which creates a need for their education and the need to inform their sexual partners. On the other hand, the promoted pre-exposure treatment is problematic, as so far there is no clear evidence of the benefits of drug prophylaxis in HIV partners - in a situation where the HIV + partner is in the phase of effective antiretroviral therapy.

You've gotten so used to it that you think it's not that bad with AIDS. It is still a disease that leads to delayed death, but which is fatal. And she is still discriminated against. I'm from Lower Saxony, and just a few years ago I heard that someone had died of AIDS, and in order to improve the memory of the dead and the reputation of the family, it had to be said that they died of cancer, not of AIDS. So it is still the case that having this disease is discriminatory. And that is why it is important to educate and do everything possible, and also to concentrate in research on whether something can be done to cure this disease in general. My colleagues have already pointed out that the connection between AIDS, tuberculosis and hepatitis C is really deadly and really very difficult. And that is why it is important to work together between the different Member States. Tuberculosis - said the Commissioner - is a social disease, it affects poor people. That's true. In the rich countries or in the rich classes in Europe it does not actually occur at all. But in Eastern European countries or especially in poor households it is still totally present and can be really deadly. And that's why it's so important Here, too, to focus on and consider what you can do.And then also - it has already been said - the connection to the multi-resistant germs, where we have a strategy at EU level: This should also be very much in focus.The question remains whether the G20 will deal with it as we would like.Finally, hepatitis C is often not recognized in time, but it can be cured.And that's why it's so important to watch how these diseases develop.I think we are on the right track if we all do what we say here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 94, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Margrete Auken", "mepid": "28161", "text": "for the Verts / ALE Group. - Madam President!

At the same time, we know that in the poor countries where you have come through with some of these compulsory licenses, you have a price that is 99% lower! We came up in February with an own-initiative report on access to medicines, in which we imposed or encouraged or wanted the Commission to do something about these dramatic pricing, which is ruining people and plundering our budgets, and that it is done by ensuring that we get transparency around pricing. How much is research and development? How much is marketing? How much is lobbying in this context? It's about a lot of medicine.

How can we ensure that we get better cooperation between the countries so that we can negotiate some decent prices in place?

Let us focus on the causes of this increase. Young people are still unable to realize the danger of these diseases, as they grew up in an environment that focused more on sexual liberation and less on the risks of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases. Also, with the dramatic increase in migration flows, bodies from countries with substandard health systems have entered Europe uncontrollably, and a large number of cases are observed in these very individuals. The solution I propose is initially a large information campaign, so that citizens realize the problem in its true size. In addition, I consider it necessary to strictly monitor the health of those entering the Union.

An unnecessarily large number of HIV patients still die after being infected with resistant bacteria. Resistant TB strains are proliferating and spreading, while detection is inadequate. Last week, European Commissioner Andriukaitis presented the EU action plan against antimicrobial resistance. The fight against this antibiotic resistance must now be converted into policy more quickly within the European Union. In addition, there should be no political sacred houses! In third countries TB is a major problem and antibiotic use unfortunately irresponsible. Since 1993, the Netherlands has been investigating asylum seekers for tuberculosis contamination. The exemplary approach to TB through preventive screening of every incoming migrant has yielded good results in the Netherlands. Tuberculosis is therefore also rare in the Netherlands. In times of migration, doctors and the government - the RIVM - have also been able to prevent outbreaks in asylum seekers' centers through this targeted preventive screening and to treat many vulnerable migrants in a timely manner. X-rays have been used to check migrants from mostly African countries for TB and have saved the lives of many migrants. Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia are high risk areas for TB. A targeted European approach is needed in these times of large-scale migration.

Due to the mobility of European citizens, all three diseases are communicable. And then we have to make a policy of the European Union, of the internal market and I think that nothing can be more important than the allocation of funds to be a treatment for all patients and to detect diseases from an early stage.

You see now that it is clear, very shocking, that many people cannot recover from serious illnesses because their bodies are already resistant to antibiotics - and this is a huge problem in Europe. I ask how this has to do with our eating habits, which, paradoxically, the European Union is forcing on us. That we don't know what we're eating. That part of the world that particular meat we eat comes from. Mostly, right, we can talk about large-scale agriculture, where there are actually animal factories. The animals are continuously treated with antibiotics. Unlike small farms, where the farmer’s eyes immediately notice the slightest sign of the disease. Infections spread among animals on large farms. So to what extent does this phenomenon cause antibiotic resistance in the European Union?", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, colleagues, I have listened with great interest to the views expressed by this House and I am grateful for all of your valuable insights, especially as I see that we are all like-minded, speaking of possibilities to join our forces, not to separately addressing HIV or hepatitis C or tuberculosis. We need to understand that first of all it is social determinance – a lot of the same people, the same vulnerable groups, poverty and so on – and we need to provide comprehensive measures to protect, prevent, introduce, vaccinate, provide testing and so on and so on. We address those issues in our communication ‘Next Steps for a Sustainable European Future’. Following this communication we will present next year our actions to address those issues. This September we will trigger joint action inviting all the Member States to be onboard and improving the quality of prevention of HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis and sexually transmitted infectious diseases. Some of you mentioned problems with financial issues and budgetary issues and so on. The Commission is working with Member States to optimise the use of existing regulations and also asking, as I mentioned, the stem group to provide Member States with tools to explain how to use their financial capacities to address those issues. You know we are supporting, through the health programme, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) work on access to innovative medicines and sustainability. This can help Member States to strengthen analytical capacity in areas such as pricing strategies and budgetary imports because it is very important – we know very well – in times of austerity there are a lot of problems around us. This House knows very well that we have only a health programme in our hands. It would be good to discuss the new Multiannual Financial Framework and also draw attention to how to strengthen European Union financial capacities to finance more measures because I depend on those programmes which were adopted in this House, and now it is very difficult to see how to move forward. Speaking of pricing, the Commission’s role is to facilitate cooperation between Member States. This support can cover starter projects, maintenance of databases, collecting national prices. We are using European instruments but Member States do not show a big appetite. It will be also good to encourage Member States to cooperate more closely. I visited all 28 Member States. I had discussions with all national parliaments, with governments, speaking about possibilities to draw attention to the situation on the ground, because we need to cooperate. The Commission will continue to encourage Member States to exchange information on access, pricing and cost containment policies, because it is absolutely crystal clear, we need to trigger our activities. As you mentioned, in Portugal, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, they have a lot of good practices in areas of addressing issues about vulnerable people. I visited the Abrigado Centre in Luxembourg. It was a very good job on the ground for assisting people in need to provide prophylactical measures and syringes, to guarantee confidentiality and fighting against stigma and discrimination. Decriminalisation is also a big issue, speaking about the situation in different Member States. We also need to understand that we need to combine health instruments with social instruments. We have no chance to solve only through instruments of health ministers. We need to have broad social programmes on the ground. We need to encourage local authorities and local communities also to do more and providing the local instruments and especially keeping eyes on the homeless people. It is very painful to see those homeless people living on the streets. We also need to see possibilities to extend our educational programmes. I look forward to working together with you towards achieving our shared aim of eliminating these diseases which damage the lives of so many people. As you mentioned, some people are not aware of the situation. Yes, of course we need to have awareness campaigns, and I ask the ECDC and the EMA also to do more to think how to strengthen our capacity for an awareness campaign, not only one day in one year; we need to continue our efforts on an everyday basis.

Indeed, Europe has been concerned for a long time in a sectoral way with the question of the lifespan of products, but this is the first time that we have tried to discuss it transversally and, I would say, from a perspective sustainable, trying to put this issue in its global context. Its global context is the heart of the new economy, it is the heart of the sustainable development of the European Union, quite simply because we touch on the environmental question, we touch on the economic and production question, we touch on the question of consumption and the social question. The fact that we are at the heart of this issue forces us to try to think about this question in a consensual manner. This forces us to try to think about it not by opposing ourselves to each other, by opposing economics to ecology or by opposing social questions to questions of consumption, but on the contrary, it is together that we must resolve this problem. problematic. How to solve it? Quite simply by trying to get out of a logic of a waste society, a disposable society and a waste society. Resources today are precious, all resources, whether it is land, whether it is water, whether it is all the elements that make it possible to produce oil, energy. These resources must be saved. We are therefore faced with the issue of resources. Then there is the climate issue, with our products traveling thousands of kilometers to reach our stores and then enter our homes. There is also the social question. The social issue is the relocation of jobs to Europe, the fact that we are going to produce at a lower cost thousands and thousands of kilometers and that we destroy our industry. The social question is that when we throw away, when we replace and when we no longer repair the products we buy, we cause the loss of know-how, of a craft, and also the loss of “repairability” and service. Tens of thousands of jobs have disappeared on the European continent. The social issue is also that we cannot close our eyes to the conditions under which these products are produced cheaply in countries of the South, in which the exploitation of human beings is absolutely scandalous. Finally, there is the economic question, because to produce at a lower cost products which, in the end, no longer have any quality, for which only the criterion of price counts, we destroy the capacity of our European industry to be among the best in the world, if not the best, with quality products that have been recognized for decades now. Logic would want us to come together to take into account the new economy, the economy of functionality, the economy of use, the economy which means that consumers - especially the poorest - no longer want to be forced to change permanently the products they buy and which break down as soon as the legal guarantees end. We must therefore take this new economy into account. We also need to redevelop the \"repairability\" of all products placed on the market. We need to make sure that the batteries are no longer stuck, but are screwed in so that we no longer have to throw a phone out when the battery dies. We need to ensure that consumers are informed about the useful life of products and our ability to repair them. That is the whole point of my report, Madam President, Commissioner.

It is necessary to ensure the availability and reasonable price of spare parts in case of minor failures on the devices. It has been proven that the introduction of a minimum product label would increase sales of labeled products by 55 percent. Consumers are willing to pay more for product durability.

Mr Durant's report introduces many interesting proposals, such as extending the warranty period or guaranteeing the availability of spare parts, which, in my opinion, can significantly reduce the failure of products.

In particular, I would like thank the rapporteur, Mr Durand, for his hard work on this report. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their valuable input. I will first speak about the importance of promoting a longer product lifetime. I fully share your views about the importance of longer-lasting products if it affects all of us as European citizens. I am sure that many of us have experienced frustration when domestic appliances have broken down and the price of repair costs as much as – or more than – buying a new product. Also, when IT equipment and software updates are no longer compatible, we can waste a lot of time sorting out these issues. However, we all need to recognise that our products are becoming increasingly sophisticated and more reliant on IT, as well as more efficient. There are trade-offs to be made in keeping a product for 20 years versus having the latest version in terms of costs, energy and material resources. But consumers should have the choice and the possibility to keep a product longer. In addition, value chains in many product markets include both big and small players whose interests may not always necessarily be aligned. Therefore, we need to find a balanced approach in our policies and revelatory interventions. Regarding eco—design and energy labelling actions, in November 2016 the Commission adopted an Eco—design Working Plan for the years 2016—2019, setting out its working priorities and its eco—design and energy labelling framework. The Working Plan has a stronger focus on supporting circular economy objectives. The Commission has committed to explore the possibility of establishing more product—specific and horizontal requirements in areas such as durability, reparability, upgradeability, information and ease of re—use and recycling. The implementation of the Working Plan is currently under way. Regarding European standardisation action, a massive horizontal European standards effort has been mounted since December 2015 by a joint technical committee. This work looks at reparability, upgradeability and durability and is supported by NGOs, Member States and industry. We expect this work to bear fruit by 2019. These standards can then be used for individual product—related legislation and standards. Regarding the role of Member States, your report acknowledges that Member States could also play a role in promoting repairs, for example by putting lower VAT on longer-lasting goods and tax rebates on repair costs. Some Member States – for example, Sweden – are already doing this. We will examine with interest the progress of such schemes. In conclusion, we welcome Mr Durand’s report. We are already acting on some of its suggestions and will reflect in further detail regarding others.

Longer lifetime of products is naturally followed by an improvement in functionality of complementary devices and tools, such as batteries or accumulators, that should fully operate for the whole period of usage of the product.  Furthermore, the spare parts should be easily accessible on the market and a clear system of labelling, informing about the durability of the product, should be provided.

Undoubtedly, attention should be paid to the problem of faster replacement of goods with new ones; many enterprises, but also households, especially in highly developed countries, replace goods immediately after the end of the warranty, regardless of their further usefulness for use. On the other hand, many consumers have lost confidence in the reliability of the products due to their current low quality. This is especially true for household or high-tech products, which sometimes feel as though they are intentionally designed to have a short life cycle.

It is also a key issue for ensuring sustainable environmental protection. Excessive consumption and short product life increase the cost of disposal and endanger the environment, the atmosphere and ecosystems. That is why I fully support the proposal to take measures that will increase and guarantee the longer life of products and also increase interest in recycling them.

That is why it is good to want to extend the life cycle of products. In previous decades, refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, stoves, vacuum cleaners and many other appliances, even in heavy use, often lasted flawlessly for decades. Today, many home appliances contain weak parts that need to be replaced a couple of years after the appliance is put into use. Necessary spare parts and repairs often cost almost as much as new equipment, so repairs are not worth it. In addition, mobile phones, for example, are becoming obsolete. In many products, programmed aging occurs after only a few years. I think we should strive to extend the warranty periods for all machinery and equipment so that companies have an incentive to produce higher quality and longer lasting products.

Also, a longer product life cycle refers, in a broader context, to changing the way it is produced and consumed today, thus developing economic models in which goods are shared or rented and not necessarily owned. . However, the development of resource-efficient products should not encourage short shelf life or premature disposal of products.

Our goal must be to extend the life of our products and combat the built-in obsolescence of goods and software. It is necessary to establish at European level minimum resistance criteria for individual product categories, which producers should take into account at the design stage. We must also not forget to extend the warranty period for products by the duration of their repairs, provided that the repair period is longer than one month.

Ultimately, however, they are often forced to replace or dispose of the product due to high repair costs and service levels.

This is a report that my political group, the European People's Party, has proposed, for three very clear reasons which are clear from reading the text. I will first mention the fact that our Parliament's last resolution on the International Criminal Court (ICC) was six years old. It seemed necessary to me to reaffirm our strong support for this body of justice. The context imposes it, in a way, because we observe, in recent months, that despite the fact that the Court is becoming an increasingly important actor in international justice, it is not immune to questioned. I am thinking, for example, of the recent African Union resolution. This is why this report expresses, in this regrettable context, our unquestionable support for the integrity of the Rome Statute. I also take this opportunity to recall that universal adherence to this statute is the basic condition for the optimal functioning of the Court. In this sense, one of the ideas launched by the report is that the Commission and the European External Action Service assess the actions taken in recent years to encourage the accession of third countries to the ICC and identify best practices in this area. . I also believe that it is time to revisit this 2011 action plan and see where it stands. Also in this context, I would like to welcome the 2015 European Union framework for support for justice in transitional situations. The second point to which I would like to draw attention in this report is that of the prevention. Having the tools at our disposal to try war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide is obviously essential. Preventing is therefore very important. I know that the Commission and the European External Action Service are making real efforts to identify in good time any situation that could degenerate into such crimes, but we must succeed in passing the course of identification in order to move towards action . Of course, we must act jointly with our international partners, but I believe that it is also necessary to take strong positions in our bilateral relations with the countries concerned and to use all the diplomatic and other instruments at our disposal, in the face of possible crimes of this kind. The third axis of my report focuses on the impunity of non-state actors. I am of course focusing on the case of Daesh, because this terrorist organization has committed genocide in Iraq and Syria with the desire to eliminate minorities from the region. It is high time for the Union to make its voice heard on this issue. Two options are possible: either prosecution before the ICC or the establishment of an international criminal tribunal for Iraq and Syria. We need to start thinking seriously about these two possible courses of action, because the wait-and-see attitude is no longer appropriate. I hear the arguments of the detractors, who say that the geopolitical situation will never allow the ICC to be passed, nor the creation of a tribunal. The fact that the ICC has no jurisdiction in Iraq and Syria and that Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council should not stop us. What we need is political courage to condemn Daesh and thus allow the victims to rebuild themselves. We must act now because, as I speak to you, Daesh continues to commit crimes against humanity. No state is ready to support Daesh. The blockages are therefore not insurmountable. The Union must play a more prominent role, by putting in place a real strategy to fight Daesh's impunity at the United Nations and with its Member States, knowing that two of them, the United Kingdom and Belgium, are already actively engaged in this battle. The primary objective is to allow society as a whole to turn the page on seeing the executioner condemned, but it must also be remembered that the political, economic and societal reconstruction of Iraq and Syria depends on it. We are no longer talking here only of the moral value of the fight against impunity, but also of its strategic value. First of all, for the countries which are massively affected by Daesh terrorism, but also for us Europeans, who have also suffered from terrorism and who wish to see this region stabilize on a lasting basis. Millions of displaced and persecuted people must be able to return to their homes in safe conditions. This will never be possible if Daesh fighters are still at large. So those are the three thrusts of this report: prevention, support for the international legal order and firm action when it comes to atrocity crimes committed before our eyes. I hope he can contribute to EU policy in this area and I thank the other political groups for their cooperation. Still, I regret that we didn't have an exchange, but it was not accepted. We were only able to get a short introduction. I am glad to see the High Representative in this Chamber.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 144, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Jiří Pospíšil (PPE).", "mepid": "125706", "text": "- Mr President, I am very pleased to have the floor on this point because I consider it to be an extremely important point and I want to congratulate Mr Pred on this report.

Women must play a leading role in conflict prevention and reconciliation and we must never forget the role of victims and survivors in peace building. Their testimonies are hugely important. I meet and work with women survivors of sexual violence in the Western Balkans, especially in Kosovo – women who have suffered abuse through the conflict there and who, years later, are still waiting for recognition, support and justice.

In order to lower the morale of the enemy, some warlords use torture and various methods of humiliation and intimidation of the enemy, such as rape of men and women, sexual violence against women, mass murder of religious and ethnic groups, and bombings by bombs. The bad thing is that non-state actors, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria and ISIS in Iraq and Syria, are also involved in this whole situation. In order to control this unacceptable situation, the European Union, as well as the international community, must implement a strategy that will anticipate the possible occurrence of such activities, prevent them and -mostly- punish them immediately and very severely. who are responsible.

According to the Syrian Foreign Ministry, this report lacks any credibility and is said to be the product of a sick mind. Russia has also called the report rigged. I would like to strongly condemn this rejection of the professional and impartial report, and I recall that Russia and China have vetoed in the UN Security Council the referral of crimes against humanity committed in the territories of Syria to the International Criminal Court. We know that this gas has been used, and now the attacks should be investigated by a court.

It is therefore a legitimate expectation on the part of the EU to bring those responsible for crimes against humanity to justice, to bring these people to justice and to ensure that similar incidents do not occur later. Analyzing the lessons of history, however, we can conclude that without the use of military force, war crimes cannot really be prevented, or perhaps those responsible can be punished, but only after a law-making military intervention.

This means that there really is no so-called \"pit\" in which criminals committing these war crimes can hide.

Let me also mention that, although I have got used to the night sessions of this plenary, I still do not find it completely normal that we are running more than two hours late. I will also be here tomorrow night – diligently – but I still think that this plenary could perhaps work in a more time-efficient manner. Our work to prevent and address human-rights violations is not only – as some of you pointed out – a matter of humanity and values. It is also a matter of interest and strategy for us. Crimes against humanity can spark the next war, propagate conflict or the next refugee crisis; and, in a conflict situation, war crimes make post—conflict reconciliation much harder to achieve, and complicate our work in the post-conflict phase. They destroy the very fabric of society and they spread fear and mistrust, opening wounds that may take decades and a lot of work to heal. For all these reasons our responsibility to protect people and to prevent atrocities is now part of all our main European Union policies. I very much agree with your report’s strong focus on prevention, and in recent weeks we have worked to set up a better early warning system inside the European External Action Service, which also focuses on crimes against humanity. Our military and civilian missions have a very special role to play in this regard because, if we want to prevent human-rights violations, we must also engage with security forces in our partner countries, building their capabilities and training them in respect for human rights. I am also glad to see that your report does not forget to address a very important element of what we are working on here, namely sexual and gender-based violence. Last year alone, the European Union’s aid for the prevention of, and response to, this kind of violence reached almost 3.5 million women, men, girls and boys. Our last package in support of the Syrian refugees strengthens access to protection from gender—based violence for at least 700 000 Syrians, both inside and outside the country. However, beyond prevention, we know that war crimes and crimes against humanity are happening today and that we have a duty to address the consequences. Justice is the only effective and sustainable response to such violence because impunity generates more hatred and often leads to revenge and more suffering. So justice is, for us, the only way towards reconciliation and sustainable peace. To achieve this goal, we are bringing into play a combination of different elements: criminal justice, reparations, truth seeking and institutional reforms. I will mention just a few cases where we are currently at work to prevent impunity and achieve justice. In Syria we are working for the international, impartial and independent mechanism to be fully operational as soon as possible. The European Union is mobilising funds to support this mechanism with up to EUR 1.5 million. I know Member States are playing their part. I am counting on them and also on your support in obtaining even stronger support from the Member State side. In Iraq, as new areas are liberated from Daesh, it is important to assess any war crimes and violations of human rights. We welcome the commitments made by the Federal Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government to investigate swiftly all allegations of crimes committed by the Iraqi forces. Beyond Syria and Iraq, last year we led the resolution at the UN Human Rights Council to establish a commission of inquiry in Burundi and we fully support the African group resolution tabled in Geneva last month, which created an international investigation mechanism for the Kasai region in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I very much welcome your acknowledgment of our strong work and support in relation to the International Criminal Court. This is a key element of our strategy. Since 2000, we have committed EUR 37 million in direct support for the International Criminal Court. Last Saturday, we marked 15 years since the Rome Statute entered into force and, for all those 15 years, the European Union has promoted the universal ratification of the Rome Statute.  Last year, as you well remember, we faced a crisis. We kept close contacts with many African states after the Gambia, South Africa and Burundi notified their withdrawal from the Rome Statute and today two of these decisions have been revoked. This is an important achievement, realised in part thanks to the work we have done diplomatically, but we know very well that the work is not over yet. We are currently working on how to improve further the promotion of the universal ratification of the Rome Statute. This is a complex time for the multilateral system at large and for the United Nations and UN system in particular, which has come under attack from many corners. So let me conclude by saying that there cannot be any doubt about the EU’s full support for multilateral global governance based on international law, on human rights and on strong international institutions. The European Union will continue to be a strong, reliable and indispensable partner for the UN and for all who believe that violence must be met with justice and reconciliation. Our work, together with Parliament, will continue in this direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "23768", "text": "Thank you very much, High Representative, and I apologize for the two-hour delay.We are partially justified because it took us about half an hour to commemorate Simone Veil, and then we made further delays ourselves.I promise you that in the next point we will only have 5 minutes for the reports from the audience.Thanks a lot for your understanding and thank you for paying attention.I close the debate.The vote will take place on Tuesday 4 July 2017.

That is why I think it is now clear that we need to cooperate more, not only between countries, but also between the public and private sectors. You know that the private sector is an expanding sector that is growing in importance every day. More than 100,000 security companies operate worldwide, employing more than 3.5 million citizens, of which 1.5 million in Europe. And that is good. But it is clear that we need a discussion about how to use these firms. Which firms can we deploy, for which tasks, within which legal framework? How can we provide joint training? How can we ensure that the data exchange runs more smoothly? These are all questions that have made it clear to us in committee that there is an urgent need for a legal framework. In fact, Commissioner, we are asking for a directive from the Commission to harmonize the differences between Member States and with standard rules that firms must comply with. In this way, we request, for example, that there is an open list of companies that we as the EU can rely on. That we describe very well what they must meet, which standard requirements they must meet. Because you know that if we bring in firms from within the European Union and they violate human rights, it will also damage our image and that is exactly what we want to prevent here in committee. The report also calls for any contract with the private sector to include detailed requirements on - and it will make sense to you - gun ownership, who works there, what permits are in place and how data exchange is handled. These are things we do ask of the companies that we may entrust with tasks. Mrs Mogherini, our report goes very far in terms of very concrete suggestions and questions to the European Commission. But there is one that is me is particularly important, namely that you should prepare a Green Paper. I know, it is often said, green papers, white papers, so many books ... But I think a green paper is appropriate here. That we initiate clear consultation with all actors within the security data, both public and private, and that we really enter into consultation. I also think this should be done quickly. This is what the citizens of Europe expect. If we have this, Mrs Mogherini, we will be better able to exercise proper control and also see where abuses are occurring. Colleagues, you know that I intervene here very often about defense and in this case I would dare to say: more defense for less money. We know that in Europe there are shrinking defense budgets everywhere, that we have to do it with fewer defense personnel everywhere. And also that the tasks we ask to respect and guarantee our safety require more and more specialization. So we know that if we want to be able to sustain those assignments, we have to work with the private sector. We will be able to increase the safety of our citizens. That is why I hope that you will use this report to come up with that directive and those standards. Then it is also clear what private security firms are allowed to do. \"More defense for less money\". - Because it should be clear: we are of course not going to use private security firms to take over the tasks of the army. Of course that cannot be the intention. However, we can engage private security firms in field operations to perform certain non-military duties. Then we can also check it very well.

Let me start by saying that we very much welcome the report on this issue, which can open a new chapter in our awareness about private security companies. Private security companies, as you mentioned, are sometimes essential to safety, including that of European diplomatic and humanitarian operations in the world. On this point the European Union is fully in line with the International Committee of the Red Cross, which means we consider that hiring private security companies is legitimate and can be necessary – for instance, they can have an important role in protecting aid workers or people living in conflict areas – but, of course, these companies are not exempt from the observance of international humanitarian law. In their role as security providers, they must always respect the highest international standards on human rights. The report points out that a legal framework already exists. The private security companies do not operate in a vacuum and the European Union was the first international organisation to sign up to the Montreux Document, promoted by Switzerland and the Red Cross, about obligations and good practices for private security companies. It is now essential that we continue to work for this framework to be expanded and, especially, to be universalised. The UN Human Rights Council is considering drawing up an international framework to regulate, monitor and oversee private military and security companies, and this UN framework could complement and strengthen existing initiatives such as the Montreux Document Forum and International Code of Conduct Association.  I am pleased with the increased recognition of the relevance of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and their implementation. Their value was recognised in the European Union Council conclusion on business and human rights adopted last year. I would like to focus briefly on three points about the work ahead. First, if we want to create a better regulatory framework, progress is in the hands of Member States: in particular they can contribute to changing our current public procurement directives and rules. As for the External Action Service all our potential security contractors have to be signatories of the International Code of Conduct and our delegations closely monitor the implementation of their contractual obligations. Second, the work of security contractors is evolving fast, with a growing role for drones, cyber and civilian military operations. Our systems of safeguards must be continuously updated and we therefore need the cooperation not only of Member States and academics but also of legal experts and NGOs. In particular, we need to assess better which services can be outsourced and which have to remain under the sole responsibility of professional armed forces. My third and final comment is about cooperation between the public and private sectors. Much of the experience of security services in the European public sector in recent years can be of help to the private sector too. Moreover, private security companies are often called on to operate side by side with our military. So it is essential that our institutions continue to engage regularly with the International Code of Conduct Association in order to meet common standards.  Finally, let me conclude by saying that it has been more than 10 years since public opinion began to hear about security contractors. A stronger legal framework for private security companies is in everybody’s interest: it is certainly in the European Union’s interest, so that they can contribute in the right manner to the security of many people, from diplomatic staff to humanitarian workers, around the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 164, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "23768", "text": "I close the debate.The vote will take place on Tuesday 4 July 2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "23768", "text": "The next item on the agenda is the report by Neoklis Sylikiotis, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on working conditions and precarious employment (2016/2221 (INI)) (A8-0224 / 2017).", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 166, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Νεοκλής Συλικιώτης", "mepid": "124689", "text": "Rapporteur. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, social poverty and backwardness in employment have forced the European Parliament, in previous reports, to take a stand against policies that lead to the dissolution of the welfare state and against the attack on workers for their rights over the last decade. The report on employment conditions and precarious employment is a continuation of this series of reports. The Committee on Employment of this Parliament has, I believe, stood up to the circumstances and is presenting a balanced report in plenary. On this occasion, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for the constructive cooperation we have had during the discussions on the report. It is now accepted by all political groups that social protection, protection through collective bargaining and collective bargaining must be accessible to all workers. Today's apparent increase in employment rates hides an increase in precarious forms of employment, such as zero-hour contracts, false self-employment and jobs with involuntary part-time contracts that do not provide decent living and employment rights for workers. A series of surveys, and in particular a survey by the European Parliament's Employment Committee, clearly show that part-time and often part-time workers, who are often required to do so, have grown significantly in the Union over the last 15 years. These contracts may have existed before the financial crisis, however, the inadequate and socially inappropriate solutions provided to combat them exacerbated job insecurity and these are the anti-development policies of austerity and memoranda that led to the disintegration of the social fabric and poverty. sections of the population, mainly employees and retirees. Our goal in this report was to put the concept of employment back on track. Employment must be decent and offer the worker and his family a good and balanced life and all this, of course, in parallel with the social protection of the state to its citizens. As the rapporteur of the report, I think that we, together with the main rapporteurs, have been able to take steps in this direction. We have used the definition of the International Labor Organization for Decent Employment, which defines decent work as full-time and productive employment that ensures the dignity of the worker, a fair income and safety at work, which provides freedom of expression, opinion, organization and participation. in decisions that affect his life and that ensures equal opportunities and equal treatment for all, men and women. We have also condemned abuses in the context of internships or flexible employment contracts. We reminded you that, according to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, every worker is entitled to a maximum working time limit, to daily and weekly rest periods, as well as to an annual paid holiday period. We stressed that this right must apply to all employees without exception. Finally, we called on the Commission and the Member States to ensure effective protection for workers in the context of labor relations, but also a comprehensive political response to reduce and ultimately dismantle precarious employment. Commissioner, there is an urgent need for a change of pace from uncontrolled market and austerity policies. The Union must promote policies that empower workers through social dialogue and the expansion of collective bargaining, ensuring that all workers can exercise their rights. of assembly and collective bargaining freely and without fear.At the same time, the welfare state obviously needs to be strengthened, but policies to create decent jobs through public investment and long-term government strategies are also needed.The Committee also calls on the Member States and the Commission to promote strategies for universal coverage of employees through collective agreements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 167, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Michaela Šojdrová (PPE).", "mepid": "124710", "text": "- Mr President, this report responds to the growing number of different forms of employment in the European Union, which it calls precarious.

On the contrary, I support the need for some regulation of new forms of work and fundamentally reject the idea that the only decent work is employment for an indefinite period.

Politics then tries to present itself as a protector of the people, so it guarantees that it will make these jobs safe. In the long run, a secure job is only one that is commercially viable. Any business that is not commercially viable, and with the help of politics survives, does so at the expense of another who then also becomes unsustainable. The more policies it saves, the more unsustainable they are which then completely sink in times of recession and provoke a chain reaction.

The report rightly calls for work being transformed through digitalisation and new employment being created as a result of it, to be decent. It also points out the need to guarantee effective protection for workers, regardless of the type and duration of employment relationship, and to address non-standard, atypical and precarious forms of employment, while paying special attention to vulnerable groups. And we hear your call to strengthen social dialogue and promoting the extension of collective bargaining. All these concerns about workers’ rights and opportunities in the 21st century were also raised by different stakeholders last year during the extensive public consultation we organised on establishing a European Pillar of Social Rights. So let me assure you that the Commission is taking action to address those challenges. Let me give you three examples. On 26 April, we launched a social partners’ consultation to collect their views on the possible direction of an EU action to ensure that people in all forms of employment have adequate access to social protection and employment services. We have also initiated a social partners’ consultation on a possible revision of the Written Statement Directive. We want to ensure clarity for workers and employers on their contractual relationship, irrespective of the type of contract. Another important work strand is the European Pillar of Social Rights that we presented on 26 April. Among other things, it aims to promote employment relationships that do not lead to precariousness and to deal with the abusive use of atypical employment contracts. We have opened the discussion on how to better align our social security systems with the new forms of work. We want to ensure that as many people as possible, including the self-employed and gig economy workers, are covered and can build up rights against contributions. The Pillar also recognises the right to fair and equal treatment for workers regarding working conditions and access to social protection and training, regardless of the type and duration of the employment relationship. In addition, the Pillar recognises the right to quality and inclusive education, training and lifelong learning, in order to acquire and maintain skills that enable people to participate fully in society and manage successfully the transition into the labour market. The Commission already recognised the importance of reskilling and upskilling last year. A year ago we launched a New Skills Agenda for Europe, calling on all stakeholders to work together to improve skills in Europe and keep pace with the fast-changing needs of the labour market and society. Last but not least, a word on social dialogue. The Commission is very committed to promote well—functioning social dialogue at all levels. This is also recognised by the Pillar, which encourages the social partners to negotiate and conclude collective agreements in matters relevant to them while respecting their autonomy and the right to collective action. The Commission already supports the capacity-building of social partners in order to develop a broad collective bargaining and effective social dialogue mechanism across the EU. Your report raises awareness of the current challenges, such as the rapid digitalisation or new forms of employment that are blurring the boundaries between dependent employment and self—employment. So we need to act now. Our common goal should be improving the life chances of every European. We need to keep up the momentum for social Europe at all levels. This is why we are aiming at high—level political endorsement of the social pillar by the end of the year. As you know, we have proposed an interinstitutional proclamation of the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.

They are convenient and efficient for the issuing institutions and they are reliable assets for investors, in particular for financial institutions. This success relies on basically two factors. Factor one is economic: economically the success relies on the existence of high-quality collateral on long-lasting assets which are easily valued and repossessed. The second factor is institutional: institutionally the success relies on the existence of a legal and supervisory framework, such as dual recourse, segregation of cover pools and special public supervision. Given the success of covered bonds, EU law has granted preferential treatment to covered bonds over other assets in various pieces of European legislation, in particular in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and in the Liquidity Coverage Requirement (LCR) delegated act. This preferential treatment is only justified if the collateral quality is high, so the first factor that I have mentioned is indeed satisfied. However, the problem is that Union law lacks a clear definition of covered bonds. The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive definition is silent on precisely this first factor, on the quality of assets, relying merely on the institutional characteristics of covered bonds. This is not enough to warrant preferential treatment. On the other hand, if we look at the second factor – the institutional environment – this suggests that the institutional environment might be expanded to other types of assets, perhaps more risky and less liquid types of assets and covered pools, such as SME credits, infrastructure projects which are not guaranteed by government, or consumer credits, and possibly to shipping finance.  The European Parliament is suggesting drawing a distinction between three different categories of assets, with the third and final class not called ‘covered bond’ but ‘European secured note’. We would like to distinguish between premium covered bonds and ordinary covered bonds, where the premium covered bonds are those which satisfy the higher criteria on the quality of assets that are specified in the CRR, whereas the ordinary covered bonds are merely UCITS compatible. Parliament is also appealing to national lawmakers to distinguish clearly higher-risk or lower-liquidity assets from those assets which are eligible for UCITS-type covered bonds, leaving SME credits, infrastructure investments and consumer credits to a new instrument which, as I have said, would be called European secured notes. Expanding the institutional environment to these riskier or less liquid classes of assets would be growth-enhancing, we believe, and would serve the objectives of the Capital Markets Union. Moreover, the European Union’s covered bond framework could then be a sort of gold standard for developing covered bond markets world-wide and could open up the EU capital market for issuers in third countries which make use of this efficient debt instrument, provided they have developed a comparable institutional framework. However, we insist that EU legislation be principles-based. One of the principles which should not be compromised is financial stability, and we therefore advise that soft bullet and conditional pass-through structures, which shift issuer risk to investors, may play an important role in preventing fire sales in the event of defaulter resolution, but they should be used only in these cases and only with approval of the supervisory authority. To conclude, what remains to be done, and what this report is silent on, is to remove the market distortions which set CBs at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis government bonds. Zero-risk weights for government bonds strongly influence buyers’ market demand by banks in favour of government bonds and are a great impediment in disentangling sovereign debt crisis from banking crisis. It would be preferable to have all risk weights reflect market assessments of risk, and thereby remove a market distortion which disfavours CBs and involves great systemic risk.

This is encouraging in view of our future work and the upcoming proposal. As announced in the Capital Markets Union mid-term review, the Commission intends to present a legislative proposal on covered bonds in the first quarter of next year. An EU initiative in my view should serve two complementary purposes. First, we should stimulate covered bond markets as a stable and cheap source of funding for credit institutions, and in return, banks should be able to better finance the real economy. Second, we should make sure that our framework is robust enough to justify the preferential prudential treatment granted to it, for instance, in the form of preferential capital risk weights. We welcome the key point made in your report in favour of a principle-based approach, building on the strengths and specificities of existing national frameworks – an approach that would respect the characteristics of national markets that are already working well. The Commission will certainly keep this approach in mind when designing our proposals. In addition, there is a great potential in developing covered bond markets in EU countries that do not have them yet, and also in attracting third-country investors. A robust and widely recognised EU covered bond label would be a major help in this regard. We will be analysing all these elements in the impact assessment that will help us to design the future proposal. We note your interest in building on the success of EU covered bonds in areas where this label cannot be used at this stage. I am referring to the so-called European Secured Notes.

In Europe, new solutions are being sought and tested, which go towards the diversification of the fishing activity, also developing sectors such as those related to tourism, which in some countries are called fishing tourism and fish tourism. The common fisheries policy already provides for this, but the report was created to give a new impetus to this type of activity. The goal is to create new jobs, promote social inclusion and the revitalization of communities that depend on fishing. Europe's coastal areas attract millions of visitors every year and there has recently been a growing interest in sustainable tourism. Therefore, the diversification of activities will allow not only to help a sector in crisis to recover, but also to help fishermen and tourists to meet and get to know each other through an ancient, difficult and complex profession. Not only that: thanks to this meeting the awareness of responsible consumption can grow, starting from the knowledge of the different species of fish, even of the lesser known ones, which are often less expensive but no less good. To fully benefit from the economic and social potential associated with this sector, it is necessary to act on several fronts: first of all by harmonizing the definition and legal basis of tourism linked to fishing, which sees considerable differences from one Member State to another - for example , in Italy it is considered a professional activity, while in France an occasional activity. It is also necessary to harmonize the European standards on safety, in so you can use the boats used for artisanal fishing for tourist excursions or direct fishing experiences, ensuring the safety of those on board. Finally, it is necessary to encourage investments at national, regional and local level to improve services, from a better Internet connection to the restructuring of plants, passing through the enhancement of local cultures and traditions. The resources made available by the EMFF should be better exploited, and at the same time collaboration between public administrations, FLAGs (i.e. local action groups), tourism experts and stakeholders should be strengthened to promote sustainable growth and to develop innovative products, capable of responding to visitors' expectations. The issue of seasonality could be addressed through information and promotional campaigns capable of offering visitors various activities throughout the year, for example through the organization of events. Tourist activities linked to fishing, in particular fishing tourism and fish tourism, therefore represent a real form of integration and diversification of the primary activity in many European regions, and are economically advantageous for fishermen and environmentally sustainable. Unfortunately, however, they are still too little known by the general public and too little valued by the institutions. For this there is a need for a common and shared effort that involves all stakeholders and that allows coastal communities, fishermen and tourists to fully benefit from the great opportunities this sector has to offer.

Fishing is, above all, a fundamental economic activity in countries such as Galicia and other coastal areas in Europe. Fishermen and women want to live off their work, they do not want to become tourist guides. We must keep in mind that not all areas have the same possibilities to attract fishing tourism and that these types of projects, if not developed in a responsible manner, can be quickly exhausted and be extremely seasonal. For this reason, we ask for a lot of prudence before any type of tax incentive for maritime tourism.

It is in the context of this resounding failure that many of the theories of diversification emerge, which, moreover, have parallels in other sectors such as agriculture. Without calling into question positive aspects that may result from activities that, alongside fishing, are complementary (and not alternatively) carried out by fishermen, as is the case with tourism, it is important to underline that the primary objective and function of the fisherman is to fish. So that they can continue to do so for many years, what we need is, first of all, a change in policies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 196, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I welcome Parliament’s own-initiative report on the role of fisheries-related tourism in the diversification of fisheries. As Ms Briano rightly pointed out in the report, supporting small-scale coastal fisheries, and promoting diversification within and outside commercial fisheries towards tourism activities, in particular at the local level, is important for the socio-economic fabric of coastal areas and helps to improve the quality of life of fishermen and their families. Thanks to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, which is the structural support tool for the common fisheries policy for the period 2014-2020, Member States can implement several of the measures that are proposed in the report. Concerning diversification within commercial fisheries, these measures range from training of fishermen, promoting networking and exchange of experiences and best practices to diversification and new forms of income for fishermen. We estimate that these measures amount to close to EUR 65 million of European Maritime and Fisheries Fund resources under shared management. As regards the specific support to small-scale coastal fishing, let me underline the fact that the fund permits higher aid intensity rates of up to 80% for all operations related to small-scale coastal fishing. Some examples of the latter are: support for young fishermen in starting out, health and safety, diversification, partnerships between scientists and fishermen, training, life-long learning, marketing and processing and innovation. For activities outside commercial fisheries, fishermen can apply for funding under community-led local development, in the framework of a local development strategy. Approximately 10%, or around EUR 519 million of our fund, is devoted to community-led local development. Under the EMFF, 73% of all local development strategies funded include tourism as an important part of their strategy. Therefore, in the current period, the Commission estimates that approximately three quarters of all expected 350 fisheries local action groups will have included tourism as one of their main areas of action in their local development strategies. Thus, tourism-related activities feature prominently. And this should be surprise. Tourism employs over 3.2 million people and generates a total of EUR 183 billion in gross value added. It represents over one third of the maritime economy. An important part of that is marine recreational fisheries, which are becoming increasingly important for many coastal communities that rely on tourism. Our 2014 coastal and maritime tourism strategy, which you have also mentioned, considers recreational fishing as one of the options for diversifying the tourism offer and for helping address the issue of seasonality. We are supporting this diversification, for instance we have three ongoing projects funded under the EMFF that are linked to underwater cultural heritage, which is also in line with the 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage. Thematic itineraries along nautical routes have been very successful, and we are currently selecting new projects for funding. In March this year, we presented the nautical tourism staff working document, which analyses a number of actions to be undertaken in the field of nautical tourism. These range from support for the qualifications of professional yacht skippers and recreational boating, to waste prevention and the management of marine litter. You have highlighted the importance of sustainability and preservation of resources. 2017 is the UN Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development. The Commission has been working towards promoting sustainable tourism for many years, through initiatives such as the European destinations of excellence, a Commission initiative which promotes sustainable tourism destination models, dealing with seasonality and rebalancing the tourism flows towards non-traditional destinations.  Sustainable tourism also has an important focus in some sea-basin strategies, such as the European strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian macro-region, where sustainable tourism is one of the central pillars. Also in the context of marine protected areas we work with member states to support the creation and extension of existing marine protection areas, and to ensure that tourism activities in marine protection areas are managed in a sustainable manner, and are preferably distributed in a balanced way throughout the year, avoiding summer peaks.  In conclusion, we welcome this report and its emphasis on promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive tourism, also at the local level, by pulling together the resources, contact persons and actions of all the relevant services. We hope that by doing so, we will be able to preserve both our traditional fishing activities and our marine resources, while ensuring the well-being of people living in those fishery areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 197, "date": "2017-07-03.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "23768", "text": "I close the debate.The vote will take place on Tuesday 4 July 2017.

His act contributed to the division of Czechoslovakia in a peaceful way in the form of an agreement, which some countries consider exemplary.

Teran wine is produced in Slovenia from the Refošk variety, and in Croatia from the Teran variety. Due to its earlier accession to the Union, Slovenia was able to protect the geographical origin of its wine earlier, and Croatian producers suffered significant damage due to the impossibility of placing their product on the European market. On May 19, the European Commission regulated this issue by a delegated act, so that in addition to the name Teran, the appendix Croatian Istria was printed. However, a request for a postponement of its application was submitted a few days before the entry into force of the act. The Agriculture Committee will vote on this next week. I urge that the unfounded request to postpone the application of the delegated act on Teran be rejected. Croatian winemakers have been waiting 4 years too long. Product names in many cases cross national borders, which is the best evidence of the product’s common past and need for collaboration.
