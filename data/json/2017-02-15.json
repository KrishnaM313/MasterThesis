Today is the day when we can decide how to go forward with this deal. I would say it is a judgment day, because since 2016 we have discussed in the European Parliament – more than18 times in different large groups – what this trade deal really means for us. We have been taking into account most, if not all, of the concerns that have been raised by analysing the previous trade deals with other countries, and I think that we can say with great confidence that this trade deal, is in many ways, a golden standard for future trade deals in the world.  I would also like to say that CETA is a litmus test for our European Union policies. We are standing at the crossroads, and we can take one of two directions. The first direction is protectionism, provincialism, decline and the building of walls. Do we really want it? I do not think so – at least, I do not want it. The second direction is openness to the world, it is leadership, it is effective decision making, it is growth, and finally, also, the bringing of wealth to our Union and each and every nation and Member State here on the European continent. Of course, the CETA trade deal is not a cure, a medicine, for each and every disease. We must understand that. It is comprehensive, but it will not solve all the problems that our workers, small and medium enterprises and people are facing. It is not meant to do this, and this is why I would like to say to those who are not listening to the facts but following the alternative news and not trying to go into depths of the analysis of this trade deal: please do not bark up the wrong tree. Try to find other solutions for other existing problems, but go forward with this deal. As regards CETA, it has two very important aspects for us included in this deal. One is the geopolitical aspect, another is the purely trade and economic aspect. As regards geopolitics are concerned, the Canadian nation has always stood for the same values that we stand for here in Europe. There is no other nation outside the European Union so like us as the Canadians. Sometimes, I think they are even closer to us than some of our Members from time to time (that was a bit of a joke). They have been sending their soldiers since the First World War to defend our freedoms and our liberties. They died in the Second World War for our freedoms and liberties, and even now, when the European Union is facing security challenges at its external borders, Canadian soldiers are again on our sandy beaches in northern Europe. Thank you to Canada for this.  Secondly, if we are speaking about the economy, there is a number of things that this trade deal will deliver. It will deliver trade in goods and decreased tariffs. It will deliver additional possibilities for services. It will give us the possibility to join procurement in Canada, which has not happened before. Geographic indications, a lot of geographic indications for many of our producers, and of course the investment part. So from that perspective, I would say that every country, just like my small country, Latvia, will benefit from this. Our products which are now sold in Canada – Latvian products, for instance, and also Swedish or German or French products – will be between 8% and 12% cheaper after the trade deal is passed. It is a good thing. The world is watching us. The world is watching the European Union and which direction we will take. Will we take the direction of protectionism and closedness, or will we fight for liberal democratic values, for growth and for the new golden standards of international trade? It is a unique chance for the European Union now to take again a leading position in the global economy and global politics, and in many ways the vote for CETA will decide this. Never before has the world needed such a strong Europe at this moment, and it needs guidelines for good trade. CETA is like a lighthouse for these guidelines, for many who are searching for wealth and trade. Please do not switch off this light. Vote for CETA.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, Canada enjoys one of the closest possible relationships with the European Union. It is a country that shares a common culture –‘c’est un pays bilingue’ – with two EU languages as national languages, and that has a healthy respect for democracy and the rule of law. That we are set to ratify the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) and Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) later today demonstrates the value that we in the European Union place on that strong, traditional and lengthy relationship. Canada, with its similar levels of GDP per capita, as an advanced economy and a NATO Member State further cements ties and mutual interests. For example, there are two extracts from the SPA that, to my mind, sum up exactly what this is all about and what it stands for. The first reads, ‘The Parties shall implement this Agreement based on shared values, the principles of dialogue, mutual respect, equal partnership, multilateralism, consensus and respect for international law.’ The second extract reads, ‘Recognising that sustainable globalisation and greater prosperity can only be achieved through an open world economy based on market principles, effective regulations and strong global institutions [...]’. I think these two passages sum it all up, illustrating exactly what the SPA and CETA are all about, namely ambitious, free-trade, liberal multilateralism. These are the values that they seek to embody and defend, at a time when they need defending more than at any other time in the European Union’s recent history. Whilst my main area of concern, as rapporteur, is the SPA, it is important that we consider this alongside CETA and the wider international political climate in which we now find ourselves. Whether we look to the election of President Donald Trump in the United States or, in my personal view, the regrettable decision of my country, the United Kingdom, to leave the European Union, or the rise of populist, protectionist parties across Europe, it is clear that the merits of free trade, multilateralism and the liberal international world order are, unfortunately, being questioned by many, and we must stand up and fight for them. Such questions can be answered only by concrete results. This means increasing trade, creating economic growth, providing jobs and creating a safe and secure world. The SPA and CETA will, hopefully, do exactly these things, and I can illustrate what can be achieved by defending these values that they are based on. To focus on some of the main headlines of the SPA in the areas where coordination of efforts is envisaged, I will take a few areas of particular interest. Preventing nuclear proliferation; ensuring the effective working of the International Criminal Court, now increasingly challenged; strengthening counterterrorism efforts and combating the financing of international terrorism; enforcing consumer protection; fighting the trade in illicit drugs; tackling cybercrime; and discussing the High North Arctic Strategy, increasingly threatened by an expansionist Russia – these are just a few examples of what is envisaged in the SPA. Much of what we see in the SPA is, in fact, the development of long—standing links and coordination. I am proud to say that 2017 marks the 40th anniversary of the initial political agreement between Canada and the European Union, all the way back to 1977, a testament to the long and enduring links between the two sides. It was only a year later that, as a student, I found myself living for several months, in 1978, in Canada and appreciating at first hand the strong bonds and common culture that bind us together. Existing cooperation between Canada and the EU and its Member States spans a number of key policy areas: for example, the Europol Agreement, active since 2005, which provides a valuable vehicle for the sharing of data and information in the fight against international crime and terrorism; Canada’s consistent military contributions to the common security and defence policy of the European Union; and our frequent meetings with Canadian parliamentarians when they participate in joint electoral observation missions with the OSCE and NATO parliamentary assemblies. Furthermore, the visa liberalisation agreement, in place since 2015, will now be completed and extended to the entire European Union, as agreed. Trump’s attitude to NATO and to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will also bind Canada closer to the European Union on both defence and commercial policies. The EU already enjoys close political and trade relations with Mexico, making it a reliable ally against any US attempts to undermine NAFTA. Although the United Kingdom is, unfortunately, leaving the European Union, Malta and Cyprus will still provide an important Commonwealth link. To conclude, the SPA comes at a time of increasing scepticism about free trade and multilateralism among certain elements of the political class and voters. I believe that the strong relationship and record of cooperation between the European Union and Canada can therefore be a much-needed poster child for those values at this critical time, and that the benefits and prosperity brought by increased trade and cooperation fostered by these agreements are in both Europe’s and Canada’s interest.

Je suis québecoise, nous sommes tous québecois. With Canada, we share the democratic values of openness and tolerance. We cooperate in tackling common challenges such as migration, sustainable development, climate change and terrorism. The two agreements that we are discussing here today – the free trade agreement (CETA) and the Strategic Partnership Agreement – together offer an opportunity to upgrade our EU—Canada relationship. Those agreements strengthen both our economic relations and our geopolitical alliance, reflecting our partnership, which is both unique and distinctive, making that partnership deeper and more powerful, reaffirming our fundamental values and political principles and using them to shape globalisation, with an institutional framework that allows for deeper exchange, to help each side serve its citizens in the 21st Century.  CETA will benefit EU citizens and business. Exports to Canada today support around 900 000 European jobs. But the 70 000, or perhaps a little more, EU companies who export to Canada face many obstacles. These obstacles are particularly burdensome for small and medium-size companies, which make up about 80% of the total. CETA helps those companies in many ways. It removes almost all tariffs from day one. Exporters stand to save over EUR 500 million a year, and that is a lot of money, especially for the small companies. It also cuts red tape, the lengthy customs and duplicative certification procedures which small businesses can ill afford. It opens up markets in services and public procurement on all levels, and it protects over 140 of the most traded geographical indications, helping European farmers sell more of their high—quality products in Canada. Trade policy is about opening markets, but it is also about our values, so CETA is a progressive agreement with a progressive partner, upholding our standards and protecting our sensitivities. Nothing in this agreement undermines a government’s right to regulate in the public interest; nothing in this agreement affects the safety of food we eat or the products we buy; nothing prevents governments from providing public services or bringing these services back to the public domain if they have been privatised; nothing requires privatisation of water or healthcare, and nothing changes the prerogative of EU lawmakers to set EU rules under EU procedures. In particular, decision—making in the CETA joint committee cannot circumvent or derogate from EU Treaty requirements, particularly the role of the EU institutions in making policy. CETA will not change food safety standards or any other EU requirements; only the EU institutions can do that, and Member States may also adopt relevant legislation for that. The Commission will fully abide by EU internal processes, as defined by the Treaties, before taking any position in the CETA committee, and there can be no doubt that the role of this Parliament will be both fully respected and your contribution is also welcomed.  I know this Parliament has concerns and had concerns about the private ad hoc arbitration known as the Investor-State Dispute Resolution (ISDS), so we have reformed it. Your role here has been critical in shaping the new investment court system. This new system guarantees a government’s right to regulate; it uses public courts, qualified judges, transparent proceedings, an appeal mechanism and a strict code of ethics, and this Parliament will be involved in selecting its tribunal members, similar to its involvement for ECJ judges. As you know, with Canada we are right now working on the international scene to promote the idea of a multilateral investment court.  CETA is a modern, new kind of agreement, promoting our values of free, fair and sustainable trade. Canada and the EU pledge to effectively implement major international agreements on labour and the environment. These provisions are ambitious, but they are also binding and legally enforceable, and they are having an effect: Canada is on the path to ratify the last outstanding core labour convention on collective bargaining. The agreement contains a mechanism to review these provisions, notably on enforcement, and I commit, as I have written to you in letters, to set in motion this review mechanism soon after CETA is provisionally applied. To feed into this review, I intend to open a broad and inclusive debate on sustainable development provisions in our free trade agreements, involving all stakeholders, including of course this Parliament.  The Strategic Partnership Agreement accompanies and complements CETA, reinforcing our partnership, deepening contacts and coordination in areas like foreign security and defence policy, migration, counterterrorism, human rights, sustainable development and climate change – areas where we can work, and where we are already working together, to make life better for our citizens and promote a progressive international agenda rooted in our principles. Honourable Members, we are at a time where many stand against what the EU stands for – openness, international cooperation, freedom to trade, etc. – and those who oppose those principles often also question the foundation and the future of the EU itself. Against those trends, we have the chance to work with like-minded partners to show that protectionism does not work: that putting up barriers and building walls is not the answer. Good, efficient fair trade agreements with like-minded partners are the answer, and we have this opportunity today by consenting to the two agreements.  I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Pabriks, and of course Mr Tannock on the Strategic Partnership Agreement, the shadows, and many more who have worked for a long time on this agreement. I am looking forward to the debate, and hopefully a successful vote. Thank you very much.

We saw attempts for the Passenger Name Record Agreement to go before this Parliament, and it was referred to the ECJ. I hope that eventually comes to fruition. There is also the creation of a Joint Ministerial Council and Joint Consultative Council for the first time, which will enable senior policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic to exchange ideas. On how to mitigate the effects of climate change, Canada and the European Union will have to look at this very carefully, particularly with the risk of the melting of the ice sheets in the High North and the increased migratory pressures from Sub—Saharan Africa impacting on the EU with climate change, a very important common shared challenge. President Trump’s repeated threats to pull America out of the Paris climate change agreement means an additional threat to global stability which the EU, together with Canada, will have to face together. Lastly, the SPA and CETA will become the model for the European Union to conduct future advanced close trade and political relations with third—country partners, including, in all probability, the so-called bespoke deal with the European Union currently envisaged with the UK and the British Government after Brexit.

The Committee found, however, that the agreement seriously fails and falls short on all three scores.  Real world models and assessments indicate no more than a 0.018% increase in overall EU employment over six to ten years, with significant sectoral dislocations and increases in long-term unemployment. Income gaps are projected to widen between skilled and unskilled workers. There is no single chapter with specific measures in favour of SMEs, and finally, the privileged status of investors under the Investment Court System stands in stark contrast to the mere consultations envisaged for protecting labour interests and rights.

In the first few minutes we can feel what it's all about today. It's about the discussion between feelings, between creating fear and between facts. Afterwards we will listen to Mrs Le Pen - (heckling) everyone can express their opinion here, and everyone can listen, okay? If Mrs Le Pen takes the floor afterwards, she will be afraid of trading. She will say she rejects Canada. She will say she opposes Australia. She will say she rejects New Zealand. It wants to bring about a complete isolation of France, and it scares the people - the farmers, the workers, as we have seen it. I say: These models already existed. In Europe there have already been countries that have completely isolated themselves, for example Albania under a dictator who has completely built up all borders. Le Pen wants to turn France into a large Albania that is not led into the future, but wants to isolate itself. We in the EPP Group believe in the facts, we believe in facts. And if we look at South Korea, for example, the last agreement we concluded five years ago - dear colleague Le Pen and dear colleagues - led to an export increase of 55%, EUR 17 billion more was exported, which is 14 000 new jobs created. A total of 30 million jobs in Europe depend on export. These are facts. You can of course counteract that with emotions. We as the EPP continue to believe in the facts. I would like to thank Commissioner Malmström for her hard work. That is a great agreement that you have presented to us today. Thanks to public participation, consumer protection associations and the trade unions, it was possible to take up the worries and also to dispel many worries. And I also have to make it clear: with whom should we still hold talks? Can we, if we cannot hold talks with Canada, a highly developed democratic country based on partnership, and conclude these talks accordingly? (Applause) Dear colleagues! Unfortunately, I also have to become a bit partisan in the debate, because of course we need to know who leads this Parliament and who leads into the future of this continent. And Gianni, unfortunately I have to say that the social democratic group is deeply divided. The Socialist Group cannot give any guidance on how things will continue in Europe. Half are for CETA, the other half are against CETA. And the Greens must allow themselves to be asked very critically whether they are in good company when they are at the same time campaigning against CETA with Le Pen and the communists. One must be able to ask this question. I believe that the Greens and consumer groups have had many important debates, but now they should also recognize that we are on the right track and that the agreement is a good deal. Finally, two quick points. One is the decision-making process. I think we have to realize, when we consider CETA, that we will need clear responsibilities in Europe in the future. The discussion about Wallonia - we as the EPP respect every parliament in Europe, federalism and regionalism are important to us. But we need responsibilities that are clear in the future, so that people know when Europe is discussing free trade, then the European Parliament must be the place where CETA will be the only and final vote in the future. Finally, the big picture is that we have Donald Trump. And Donald Trump has terminated TPP. He wants to build walls. And we as Europeans want on this day, with this vote today, to make it clear that we don't want to build walls, we want to build bridges, we want to Partnership.And that is why my group will be voting for CETA.(Applause and boos)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "During the interventions of the representatives of the groups I will not grant \"blue cards\", because I repeat that it is a delicate debate and I invite everyone to respect the ideas of others.Each group will have the right to express their ideas and positions.This is democracy and therefore please respect your colleagues, even if they express different ideas from yours.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have heard triumphal tones which I do not share.

My group demands respect. We are not a barracks and we never will be. I want to say right away that for us Socialists and Democrats, CETA is not a model, it is only the beginning of a change in European trade policy. There are those who think that what is happening in the world should not condition and influence our reflections, that we can go on putting our heads in the sand. We are not among them. Trump is not Obama, and we must reflect on what is happening. Trump took advantage of a naïve view of globalization. Trade agreements are meant only for the interests of large companies. Our voters are turning against this vision of globalization. We support CETA as part of an awareness that a new trade policy is needed. We must acknowledge that in recent months we have been committed to improving CETA and also thanks to our work today we have a better agreement than in the past. We have overcome the ISDS which, if not modified, would have been the Trojan horse with which multinationals would have undermined our legal systems. In its place there is now a mechanism with an appeal, with judges above any conflict of interest, and it is also thanks to our work as Socialists that public services will not be affected, as well as workers' rights. We were able to achieve these improvements also thanks to the work of the Commissioner and above all thanks to a partner, Canada, to which we are bound by common values ​​and hopes, a country with which we share the ambition to build a new, more democratic multilateral system, a positive globalization different from that pursued until now. I thank Premier Trudeau, who we know is with us in this battle against the viruses of populism and isolationism. This agreement is the beginning for us, but we need a broader and clearer progressive international trade agenda, on the basis of which we will evaluate future agreements, starting with the one between the European Union and Japan. We will no longer cast our vote unless there is a new progressive trade policy agenda, and we will never again tolerate ISDS-like dispute resolution tools. We want more transparency in the negotiations and we want adherence to the most advanced standards of workers' rights to become the norm. In short, our support is not a vote to keep, but a vote to change. It is a way to listen to the concerns of our citizens.

It is about new jobs created by Polish fruit exporters or Italian tie makers facing lower barriers to selling their products in Canada, it is about cheaper prices and more choice for consumers, and it is about allowing our small businesses to bid for public procurement contracts in Canada. My ECR Group supports CETA and other trade agreements because international trade is between willing sellers in one country and willing buyers in another country.  Opponents of international trade will often highlight the losses, but they fail to point to the often larger gains which are dispersed across a nation or across international borders. I am not saying that we should ignore these legitimate concerns. We should encourage lifelong learning programmes for workers in declining companies and sectors to retrain for new roles in the face of globalisation and new technology. We should address the concerns of both Canadians and citizens of EU countries who accuse each other of having lower environmental and labour standards. Both cannot be right. And we should also remind the anti-capitalists over there, and the anti-globalisation movement over here, that they are in fact the true friends of the multinationals, for it is often the multinationals with their armies of lawyers and lobbyists who call for, or shape, the regulatory barriers which keep smaller businesses confined to their local markets.

It is Mr. Harper, climate skeptic, who now advises multinationals; it is Mr Barroso, former President of the European Commission, who now advises Goldman Sachs; it is Mr De Gucht, former trade commissioner, who now advises multinationals. The culmination of this process of deregulation and privatization of the norm is precisely the government of Mr. Trump, where it is not the commissioners and former prime ministers who pass to the multinationals, but the multinationals who are in Trump administration.

If we don't want Brexits, if we don't want more Trump, more far-right, we have to make Europe the pillar of public regulation of globalization.

A colossal rip-off, given that in Canada 81% of corn and 80% of wheat are GMOs, meat contains ractopamine and other substances currently banned in Europe, but which will be very easy to make legal in the future thanks to CETA.

It has hardly ever been discussed in front of the big debating bodies of the media because neither of you is willing or able to defend it publicly. Ah! Voting, hidden in the shadows, you like it, but to debate in broad daylight, you hate! Worse, members of the Socialist Party, who are often very indulgent about CETA in this Parliament, pretend to oppose it in a few confidential media. The French UMPs all voted for CETA in committee but say they are opposed to it when asked. When the people understand all these lies, they will never trust you again. This is why this treaty is a villainous treaty vis-à-vis the peoples of Europe. It eliminates almost all customs duties on products traded between the European Union and Canada and will destroy, once again, hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, tens of thousands in France. Agriculture and animal husbandry, already damaged by all the free trade treaties you have already signed, will continue their descent into hell.

To level the playing field for multinationals, you are giving away our right to regulate and aligning standards with those of Canada, denying our citizens the protection they expect from their political representatives. Unfortunately for them, the profits of multinationals are more important to you than the protection of citizens and the environment. The various committees that you set up as these obscure regulatory cooperation mechanisms are supranational in nature, are not controlled by anyone, so much so that great French jurists are asking themselves the question of their constitutionality. To complete it all, you create an exceptional private justice to allow multinationals to attack states so that no more regulation displeases these new lords of modern times. Those who will do justice in this tribunal are not judges, neutral public officials, they will most often be business lawyers in international law, in conflict of interest because they have received fees from these same multinationals or their sisters. Finally, the public services that are so important for the middle and popular classes will have to operate in a purely commercial logic, with the exception of a few sovereign services. This is the disastrous picture of the CETA treaty. If this treaty is voted in a few hours, it will demonstrate, once again, to all Europeans your inability to defend them and the crucial importance for each people to regain its sovereignty, its ability to freely decide its future. The only reassuring thing is that the French people will have a possibility to reverse this treaty and all the other rogue treaties, with the presidential election of May 2017, as it is true that it is up to the nations to negotiate their trade policy and not to an unelected structure which only represents its own interests and not those of the peoples.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Κωνσταντίνος Παπαδάκης (NI).", "mepid": "125093", "text": "- Mr President, CETA serves the interests of the monopolies and is a single market plan to further increase capitalist profits, with significant geopolitical implications.

The United States groups play a particularly important role in these competitions, with their strong position in Canada. CETA paves the way for the challenge and abolition of any labor rights that remain unresolved, with mass redundancies on both sides of the Atlantic.

They are concerned about the many half-true and untrue claims that are being made about this trade deal.

It is about better market access for our small and large companies and it is not about the forced privatization of municipal services of general interest. It is about protecting our citizens from discrimination abroad, and not about restricting the freedom to make political decisions or disempowering national courts. That is why our result as an EPP is: We say yes to CETA, because foreclosure only produces losers on all sides. We say yes to CETA because we want to realize the opportunities that lie ahead. We say yes to CETA because we finally want to give globalization rules. In these uncertain times, people are looking for support and guidance.

The S&amp;D Group has followed closely, as have many colleagues in this House, the negotiations since before what I would call its first conclusion in September 2014. We have voiced concerns, demanded changes and achieved most of those already on the occasion of what was effectively the second conclusion of the negotiations in February 2016. The most important of these was the removal of the old, toxic, ISDS from the Treaty and its replacement with a public system, the new ICS.  In the past year, we have also contributed to, and closely scrutinised and debated, what became the new CETA package submitted to the European Parliament for consent today. We welcome, as a Group, the fact that many of the citizens’ concerns have been addressed through clarifications and commitments from the Commission and the Canadian authorities, through the joint interpretative instrument and the other instruments in the package. CETA is not perfect, far from it, but it is an important step in the right direction: a more progressive trade policy where the benefits are widely spread among all citizens.  The S&amp;D Group has tabled its own consensual resolution which clarifies what we mean by progressive trade agreements by spelling out clearly what we like about CETA, and what we do not like about CETA and expect to be further corrected in CETA where agreed, or in future trade agreements more widely: better provisions on sustainable development and a sanctions-based approach; further improvements to the ICS system and full European Parliament involvement in the designation of judges; better forms to cover the protection of public services; and improved transparency for all trade agreements in future.  The S&amp;D Group has decided to vote in favour of CETA. This is because most of us believe CETA is good for our economy, particularly for SMEs, and it does not threaten our choices, values or laws. But it is also an act of trust and an offer of partnership towards the EU institutions, notably the Commission and the Council, with which we want to work together for a better trade policy, and towards Canada, which is a country that shares our values, our objectives and our hopes for a better future.

As ECR Group shadow rapporteur on the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), I have worked for years on this, as have others like my colleague, Charles Tannock, on the parallel Strategic Partnership Agreement. The CETA trade deal will eliminate 99% of non-agricultural tariffs, saving EU exporters almost EUR 500 million a year immediately, and will deliver near-complete market access both ways. This includes the best-ever services deal and it will also give European companies access to Canadian procurement markets for the first time. In addition, it contains mutual recognition of professional qualifications for midwives, architects, lawyers and doctors, but there is no free movement and no access fees payable either way. It would make a very good template for Britain. Once fully implemented, the agreement is expected to increase bilateral trade in goods and services between the EU Member States and Canada by 23% or GBP 19 billion. It has, however, taken too long (seven years) to get to this point. Two years were wasted on EU human rights demands, and another two years on the question of investor disputes, with the unacceptable Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) system being replaced by the better Investment Court system. The EU must reflect on the time it takes to get agreements with any major trading partner negotiated if they are going to be taken seriously in future.

This is a big achievement, and without you we would never have got that far. The Commission and many colleagues say that the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is a new-style agreement, but beware: it is not. It is an agreement of the very old sort. It is an agreement for putting investor rights over people’s interests, for liberalisation without end, and for harming the climate, the environment and also social standards. On transparency it is even worse than the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). And to all who think that Canada is a beacon of liberalism, well, as was mentioned, CETA was not negotiated by Prime Minister Trudeau. It was negotiated by his predecessor and by your predecessor, Commissioner, Mr De Gucht, along with Mr Barroso – and if I were a Social Democrat I would get pretty nervous around that. But anyway, if the idea is that we like CETA because Canada is nice, then we should all be aware that the Commission is negotiating on many fronts, with many countries. So who are colleagues then willing to reject because they are less nice?

Trade needs to be good for workers and employees, for consumers, for small-scale enterprises, for society as a whole, and not just for the super-big companies.

At the confirmation hearings, there the Commissioner stated in prepared remarks that trade is a powerful foreign policy tool and that it must support Europe’s wider international goals.

The EU should not manipulate the trade of the Member States in order to promote the foreign policy pretensions of a wannabe European superstate.

We are here discussing a trade agreement. Trade has made the European Union the biggest economy of the world. It has benefited the prosperity and welfare of Europeans. Trade with other countries outside the European Union has created millions of jobs, 31 million in the export sectors and many, many millions in the import sectors. Countries are queuing up to make trade agreements with us but they are, of course, looking very carefully at what is going to happen today, whether we are a reliable partner or not. Trade globally has lifted millions and millions of people out of poverty, so trade is a good thing, but of course trade needs to be regulated in trade agreements and that is what we are discussing here today.  This is not business as usual; this is a new type of trade agreement. It has economic advantages: we are taking away tariffs, we are increasing market access, we have achieved the recognition of many important geographical indications, we are taking away red tape and this is beneficial. After all, most small and medium-sized companies – 80% of the 70 000 companies who today export to Canada are SMEs – have smaller margins than the big companies because the latter can always manage. SMEs benefit from lower tariffs, from increased market access, from less red tape. We are taking away tariffs, for instance on textiles of 18%, on shoes of up to 18%, on machinery of 9%. These are not small sums for small companies, and many of them are also involved in exporting geographical indications. We know that trade works. The trade agreement with South Korea has increased exports by impressive figures and created many jobs.  This is also an agreement about values, about the right of governments to regulate, about maintaining our high standards, about labour rights, about environmental rights, about sustainable development, about reforming the old ISDS system – because it was not invented in CETA, it has existed since 1959, it was invented in Germany. All countries, except Ireland, have ISDS clauses. We have made them more democratic, more transparent and introduced a more ethical system. You, here in the European Parliament, have been very active in that transformation. (The President interrupted the speaker to call for less noise in the House)  J’allais juste répondre aux collègues français qui ont exprimé leurs inquiétudes par rapport au secteur bovin. J’ai discuté avec le commissaire Hogan et M. le Président Juncker, et nous allons vous adresser une lettre pour répondre plus en détail à vos questions. Je peux vous affirmer qu’en ce qui concerne l’accord avec le Canada, celui-ci a été bien conçu, en tenant compte de la sensibilité de ce secteur. Je reste convaincue que les importations n’auront pas un effet dramatique sur le secteur. Les services de la Commission assureront le suivi régulier des importations en question, y compris le taux de remplissage des contingents, en utilisant tous les instruments dont nous disposons afin d’être en mesure de réagir avec efficacité et rapidité en cas de distorsion. Vous aurez plus de détails dans une lettre à la fin de cette semaine. Actually, honourable Members of this House, for years many of you have been calling for trade agreements which include sustainable development, human rights, labour rights, environment, climate, animal rights. All this is in this unique agreement, but it does not include anything which forces any municipality, country or region to implement privatisation. It will not lower standards, and it will not deprive the governments of their right to regulate in the interests of their citizens. Things that are forbidden on the European market today will remain forbidden, and the Joint Committee will not change anything in our legislation. That is for the EU institutions, including you, to do.  We are making this agreement with Canada, and I would like to salute the presence of the Minister of International Trade, Mr Champagne, who is in the Tribune here today. Canada is a democratic country which shares so many of our values, which is committed to the rule of law, to human rights, and which plays an important international role in defending the multilateral system. They have a strong public sector and they are committed to working with us to shape globalisation.

Twenty-eight governments have signed this agreement, and it has been done in transparency. The CETA texts have been public since September 2014.

Our shared culture, democratic norms and history bind us together in a way that is unique. It is vital that the EU champions those shared values to maintain the levels of prosperity and success that we enjoy today and to stand together as strong advocates for free trade and liberal multilateralism across the globe. The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) will act as a model for future trade and political relationships between the European Union and third countries. This is also a potential model around which the United Kingdom could base its future trade relationships with the EU post—Brexit. Fighting international crime and terrorism, tackling climate change and ensuring continued space for economic growth and job creation in an era of globalisation and technological change are all issues that cross borders, and they can only be tackled by democracies like Canada and the EU Member States working together. As these changes take effect, it is vital that we all pull together to ensure that they work for all our citizens, and that we do not allow our economies to drift towards the simple allure of nationalism, isolationism and protectionism that can only lead to less prosperity and security for our citizens. It has taken many years to reach today and to conclude these deals, but as we are now finally moving in this House to ratify the SPA and CETA, it is clear that this time and effort has been very well worthwhile.

The underlying objective of this type of agreement is cooperation and regulatory convergence with a view to removing non-tariff barriers to trade, but without first settling the issue of differences in regulations and public aid, l He European Union runs the risk of unfair competition between Canadians and Europeans.

Shipping is a sector that has a big margin of improvement in terms of reducing its emissions by pushing the transition to less carbon fossil fuels in a stronger manner, rather than starting a market-based approach again. Nevertheless, the amendments have been rejected, and therefore we voted against the report.  I hope the EU will realise soon that trying to fix the ETS again will not bring any real reduction in emissions and any real investment in clean production. A new and alternative solution could finally be debated and hopefully adopted and implemented.

Despite the fact that the past year turned out to be relatively good for the European economy and the situation on the labor market, we should not forget about the still unsolved problems. It seems that from the point of view of long-term consequences, the greatest challenge is still high unemployment among young people. Across the European Union, more than 4 million people aged 15-24 are unemployed, and those who do have jobs very often have to work below their qualifications part-time or in the so-called flexible forms of employment. Six and a half million people in this age group, in turn, belong to the NEET category, which often means that it will not be easy to bring them back to the labor market or make them improve their qualifications. Almost 30% of young people are unemployed for more than a year and it will be necessary to undertake particularly intensive activities to activate them professionally. All these data show that there will be huge problems for social security systems in the future, but the need for more action by public and private employment services is absolutely necessary. There is a whole generation growing in Europe, many of which have never worked or will not have a stable job, therefore it is necessary to take appropriate action at all levels, including the European Union. In addition, we, as the European Parliament, must ensure that during the review of the multiannual financial framework, adequate and stable funding is guaranteed for all initiatives aimed at improving the situation of young people on the labor market.

A big part of the social agenda was left to national states and very often these national states failed to provide adequate social protection for their citizens. From the other side, the European Union developed free movement of people inside the EU and the result of this imbalance is that many citizens move to other EU states with higher salaries and higher social protection. In the last 25 years, my country, Latvia, has lost more than 35% of its population, partly because of low birth rates, but mainly because of migration to other EU countries. Thus places have been created in the EU where population density is very low. The economy cannot develop because of the declining number of workers, taxpayers and customers, the remaining population becomes older, and in these circumstances it is very hard to maintain and develop infrastructure and attract investment.

I am delighted that we are able to lead the discussion here in the European Parliament today which concerns the fight against terrorism and which focuses on the criminal law directive, the anti-terrorism directive. The attacks of the past few months, the past two years, have alarmed us immensely within the European Union. Many people have been killed, they have been injured, there are many people affected. And for us within the European Union it was not easy to understand that we are now the target in the focus of international terrorism. That is why I am particularly pleased that we have succeeded in meaningfully incorporating the essential questions of the modern and new international standards set by the UN and the FATF in questions of the financing of terrorist networks in this directive. On the one hand, it is about transferring what framework decisions we had on the part of the interior ministers, namely before we, as co-decision-makers, as the European Parliament, could have a say. This had to be translated into a directive. On the other hand, it is also about tackling the new challenges. These new challenges include, for example, the subject of training terrorists, either if you are the organizer, the facilitator, or the financier, or someone who can actually be trained for terrorist attacks. This includes questions of propaganda and also the recruitment of young people, the recruiting of young people for terrorist purposes. There was also a discussion here: What does glorification mean? Glorification - just take a look at the consequences of Bataclan, how it was presented on the Internet by the IS propaganda machine. The glorification the perpetrator and the specific call to follow these perpetrators to commit similar glorious deeds. That means trying to radicalize young people and win them over to criminal and terrorist targets. Another focus is terrorist financing. Another focus is the topic of aiding and abetting terrorist offenses. We have achieved something special in this direction, and I would like to thank my co-rapporteurs, you, dear Caterina Chinnici, as well as my colleague Petr Ježek. I would like to thank my colleague Monica Macovei very much and also, in the critical discussion, Cornelia Ernst and colleague Joly, because we really tried to define the subject of the obligation to exchange information in particular. For the first time, the Member States have committed themselves to exchanging information. At the same time, however, we have strengthened victims' rights. I would particularly like to thank my colleague Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and the Maite, who are particularly committed to ensuring that the rights of the victims are seen. They become victims because terrorists are taking action against our value system, against the state. And that means in consequence: We have to give the victims better rights. This has been achieved in this guideline. We have also succeeded in finding a good balance between security on the one hand, but also the strict observance of fundamental rights, because security without fundamental rights is not possible. Security serves basic rights and must be based on them. For this reason also the explicit listing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 23, the express listing of the freedom of expression, the freedom of the press. Also the clarification that one may express oneself in a polemical or radical way; that has nothing to do with propaganda, that has nothing to do with glorification, that is simply freedom of expression and nothing else.I think we managed to achieve this balance very well here.I would like to express my thanks to all colleagues who were willing to work so intensively here, to work constructively.I would like to thank the Commission for the excellent cooperation and for the willingness to always contribute with new ideas and support, and I thank the Council, the Slovak Presidency, for their very constructive attitude.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 188, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members. Terrorism creates havoc. It takes away lives and leaves those of us who live on scarred forever. In the last 18 months, in particular, we have seen too many attacks and far too many victims. At the same time, the terrorist threat has continued to change and evolve. It is more than ever present and more indiscriminate. That is why I think we should be proud that, together, we have been able to reach this point on this very important piece of legislation. I would like to thank the Council for the work they have done, and, in particular, the Parliament and the rapporteur, Ms Hohlmeier, for their commitment and the effort made to review this counter-terrorism directive. It will contribute greatly to the effective work done by law enforcement authorities and prosecutors in countering the terrorist threat, and this will contribute to making our lives safer, without compromising our values, which are the very same values that the terrorists seek to harm. Fundamental rights are and must remain at the heart of our action. As Ms Hohlmeier said, with this piece of legislation we are also aligning the EU definitions of terrorist offences with the standards agreed under the Council of Europe Convention on Terrorism. Let me highlight very briefly the main elements of the text. First, it will criminalise travel for the purposes of terrorism. Not only will it be a crime to travel from the EU to conflict zones to participate in terrorist activities but also, thanks to the support of people in this House, it will cover those coming to the EU with terrorist intent, including terrorist fighters. Second, an efficient exchange of information is key to combating the terrorist threat. The new rules will strengthen the obligation to exchange information and will make the Member State receiving information responsible for taking appropriate action. Last, but by no means least, the new law will make a real difference for victims. It builds on existing rules, reinforcing in particular the immediate and coordinated nature of the response to victims of a terrorist attack, including legal aid and medical treatment. It also strengthens the rights of cross-border victims, who will get help with information and referrals to relevant services. I am happy to say that this piece of legislation shows that the EU is able to act in a swift and united manner. The political agreement on the directive was reached in less than a year. Now, we need to make sure that implementation follows with the same speed The Commission is ready to support the Member States in this task and will organise transposition workshops in the coming months. Let me conclude, Mr President, by saying it is clear that an effective response to terrorism is a complex and challenging process, which includes the fight against radicalisation as well as the efficient exchange of information between all relevant parties. That is why I would like to reiterate the Commission’s support for the joint statement by the three EU institutions which accompanies the agreement on this directive, expressing commitment to take forward action in all of those fields.

The attacks on our soil were no random attacks. Paris, Nice, Brussels, Berlin, were all targeted because these cities are the very embodiment of what Europe stands for. They were planned to strike the maximum amount of panic into all of us and designed to make us feel unsafe doing the things we always do, and living the lives that we want to live. They failed because fear did not define us, but determination did. And with this report we are going some way in ensuring that our systems adapt to the reality under which we find ourselves and ensure that we remain one step ahead of criminals and terrorists while respecting the values we cherish in Europe. We are coming down harder on those so-called foreign fighters, EU nationals who travel to conflict zones only to return radicalised and recruit more people for their murderous cause. We are pushing forward concrete plans for better cooperation between Member States, and we come down on hate preachers or anyone who incites terrorism.

The directive on the fight against terrorism is an important legislative document with which Europe lays the common basis for harmonizing the national laws of the Member States, some of which, unfortunately even recently, have experienced dramatic terrorist attacks. I believe that as Parliament we have managed to make a good contribution to the text, introducing particularly significant measures to combat terrorism in the balance between security and respect for rights, including the mandatory exchange of information, with a view to increasing cooperation. and coordination between judicial police and intelligence forces. Too many times, in fact, in this House we have found ourselves discussing the fact that a timely exchange of information could perhaps have prevented dramatic attacks. The directive then gives the Member States some regulatory instruments aimed at combating the financing of terrorism, but also at breaking the growing relationship of collaboration between criminal groups and terrorist formations. I am thinking of the confiscation or punishment of certain crimes connected with terrorist activity such as the production of false documents or the trafficking of cultural goods. However, we still have to work towards a swift approval of further measures to counter terrorist financing, such as the revision of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive.

This new directive, the Counter-Terrorism Directive, punishes those who finance, organize or facilitate travel to areas where the Islamic State operates. It also punishes those who organize training for fighters or finance terrorist acts. Incitement to terrorism and public distribution of messages, including messages glorifying terrorist acts, will now be defined as terrorist activities. So we will have new crimes in terms of terrorist activities, which will have to be transposed into the law of the Member States. The threat of terrorism is not a momentary issue, but a long-term one. It is undeniable that we need a united response to protect ourselves and resist the danger of terrorism together. First of all, we need to talk about the right to life. The right to life is the first right to be protected in this world because without the right to life there is no other right and, therefore, the real threat comes from those who seek to destroy the right to life.

We need to adapt our counterterrorism measures to this reality and add a truly European approach. 82% of Europeans want Europe to do more to combat terrorism and 69% consider its current measures to be insufficient. I believe that this new directive is part of our response to their demands. It will strengthen the EU’s arsenal against terrorism by criminalising acts such as receiving training for terrorism or travelling for terrorist purposes, while, of course, preserving fundamental rights and freedoms.

In Hungary, Ahmed, a Syrian, was recently sentenced to ten years in prison for participating in protests against the closing of the border. He was condemned as a terrorist because the Hungarian anti-terrorist laws allow it. Only he's not a terrorist - he demonstrated. These laws have already been criticized several times before the European Court of Human Rights because of their unclear, far too broad definitions. I ask you: are we changing anything substantial about it with the directive? No i don't believe The definition of terrorism in the directive remains blurred. On the contrary, one has to ask how safely demonstrators - those who think differently - can still exercise their rights. The prosecution of the glorification of terrorism is also a noble goal and I can understand that. But the connection to a real terrorist act is far too weak. Regarding the paragraph on travel for criminal purposes: I can understand you, I know what is meant. But we are really on thin ice because the difference between a criminal and a lawful act lies solely in the intent to terrorize, and that is difficult to determine. Of course, terror must be fought. We see it that way too. We need to deal with it in a complex manner. It starts with proper police and judicial training.

Is this terrorism? In France, an Internet user who had the bad taste to baptize his wifi access \"Daech 21\" was sentenced to three months in prison for apologizing for terrorism. Is this really the apology for terrorism? Let’s not be fooled. Anti-terrorism laws are routinely abused or used for other purposes in violation of our rights and freedoms. There are already too many examples. We don't want the list to grow any further. The criminal harmonization of anti-terrorism laws at European level is obviously a laudable and necessary objective, but the harmonization must be precise in order to limit the interpretations which could infringe our rights and freedoms. Unfortunately, this directive contains too many vague concepts. In the current climate, Europe cannot afford to leave loopholes that governments can so easily abuse. This directive criminalizes indirect provocation to terrorism when no one knows what this vague notion covers and the risks to freedom of expression and information are real. The definition of \"terrorist offense\" is also problematic because it includes, for example, acts that may cause major economic loss. Governments will, as we well know, have no qualms about using this broad definition to muzzle acts of civil and environmental disobedience that go against their interests. Finally, the added value of the criminalization of travel has not been demonstrated.An individual suspected of terrorism may already be arrested because of this suspicion.There is no need to criminalize travel as such.The risk that this provision will be misused and misused in a discriminatory manner is itself real.Rather than increasing the number of blurred and dangerous grounds for criminalization, we should focus on the essential: the automatic and compulsory exchange of information and greater cooperation between Member States.All the recent attacks have revealed gaping flaws in this area.What are we waiting for to take measures that have real added value in the fight against terrorism?The hypocrisy of Member States in the fight against terrorism is blatant.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 197, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Laura Ferrara", "mepid": "124833", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the terrorism we are fighting today acts with unprecedented operational, communication and financing methods. It represents an internal threat that manifests itself through individual actors or even through groups that easily move between the borders of the Member States. Thinking that it can be defeated with national policies alone is illusory. In order to give a European response to a transnational phenomenon and an imminent danger, we have tried to reconcile the need to strengthen measures to combat terrorism with the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. On the one hand, we have therefore asked for greater cooperation between the Member States, certain that a better exchange of information and compulsory cooperation between the judicial authorities represent an effective measure to combat the activity of terrorist groups. On the other hand, as Movimento 5 Stelle, we have presented amendments aimed at better defining the types of offense, for example keeping the basic principle of materiality firm and respecting the Latin phrase cogitationis poenam nemo patitur. We have defended freedom of expression on the Internet and on social media, demanding that any repressive intervention on the network should be subject to the control of the judicial authority. The balance between freedom and security of eternal discussion is therefore fundamental to the rule of law. The fight against terrorism and in general the protection of security must not represent the picklock to limit or worse still repress fundamental rights, but must always be functional to the protection of individual rights and freedoms.

International terrorism is one of the greatest threats of our time, it brings endless suffering to those affected. A few weeks ago we were able to see for ourselves here in this house when we heard the testimonials of the Yezidi Sakharov Prize winner. International terrorism seeks above all to destroy the very foundations of our free society. I fear that this threatening scenario will be with us for a long time. International terrorism cannot be tackled with national methods alone. Something that is not national in character - ISIS - sees itself as a stateless actor - something it is not. It must therefore first and foremost be combated by the international community. Security Council resolution 2178 provides a very good definition framework and obliges states to criminalize actual or intended travel to other countries in the context of terrorist activities, as well as propaganda and training. It is therefore very important that we, the Union, finally have an appropriate legal framework with this directive on combating terrorism. The previous framework decision was not sufficient for this and the legal situation in the individual member states varied widely. The directive is a very important step. It allows the police and judicial authorities to act in a coordinated and systematic manner. But we shouldn't feel safe and believe that this will solve the problem. Rapid implementation is required, accompanying measures, deradicalization work and work in prisons need to be improved, and above all law enforcement needs to be intensified, not just among those returning.

Third, I think we have all agreed that terrorists do not just target one Member State or another, they target our way of life and our values, and the Commission stands second to no-one in its support for fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, which is an essential foundation of our society. Those rights are enshrined in the Charter and the Charter will steer the implementation of this directive. We, the Commission, will report on the implementation of the directive and that report will in particular assess the directive’s impact on fundamental rights. Lastly, our response, as many speakers have underlined, needs to be comprehensive and sustainable. It needs to build on trust and effective cooperation between these institutions and our Member States. From the Commission’s side we will continue to focus on strengthening the fight against terrorism by depriving terrorists of the means they use to commit their attacks and by enhancing our defences and building our resilience, and we shall continue to maintain the closest possible engagement with you, with this House, as we take that work forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 255, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "Rapporteur. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! First of all, I would like to thank you very, very sincerely for the many very constructive and excellent contributions made by colleagues who support the directive. I have a request for the address of the critics: I really ask you to read the text carefully. Because some of the assertions that have been made here cannot be substantiated by this directive. The directive expressly provides a precise definition of terrorist acts, such as the hijacking of an airplane, such as the poisoning of water facilities, such as the possession of nuclear or radiological material with the aim of committing a terrorist attack. So, the definitions are very, very clear and not vague. They must be implemented accordingly in national law. Second: When traveling within the EU, the investigative authorities must provide evidence that someone is specifically planning a terrorist act. Only then can a corresponding investigation be carried out against the person. And then it does not matter whether he comes from Syria or whether he is traveling from Brussels to Paris or from Düsseldorf to Paris. We need to stop the perpetrators before they commit an attack, not complain about the dead and injured afterwards. We have to prevent it from occurring in the first place. Furthermore: the presumption of innocence and the guarantees of fundamental rights are set out very precisely in Article 23. The presumption of innocence must not be restricted, procedural rights must be guaranteed, fundamental rights must be observed, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press is a fundamental right and is expressly mentioned. For this reason: We do not give up any fundamental rights, but we also protect these fundamental rights from terrorists who do not even want you to have such fundamental rights.

European. In short, what does this proposed regulation bring: the verification of people entering and leaving the European Union, through any external border of the European Union, in databases - and I will refer to this immediately: in databases. This means a change in the situation today, in which citizens of the European Union are not checked in and out of the Schengen area, and citizens who do not belong to the European Union, but are from third countries, are checked only at the entrance, not at exit. So what we are changing is that everyone, both EU citizens and non-EU citizens, will be checked both at entry and exit, and we are not just talking about the Schengen area, but the whole of the European Union, so the external border of European Union. How will they be checked? They will be checked in the databases. According to this proposal for a regulation, the mandatory databases to be used by the Member States are the Schengen Information System and the Interpol Lost or Stolen Documents Database. The regulation also provides for verification in any other relevant European database. It could be: the Visa database or, in the future, because it has not yet been adopted, the Exit database of people entering or leaving the European Union. Of course, these databases must be full of complete, accurate information and transmitted immediately by the Member States. Here again I appeal to the Member States, that all this cooperation and all this construction that we do depends on the speed and accuracy of the data that they send to the databases, because the Member States Member States are the ones who feed the databases, so they have a great responsibility to send the information quickly, completely and correctly. Checking each person has a few exceptions, just so as not to hinder traffic at the border. For land and sea borders there is the possibility that, at any time, when there is a very heavy traffic of passengers, by those crossing the border, to ask for targeted checks, based on information, so that only certain persons are checked, verified in databases only certain persons for whom there is information. Obviously, this can be done with the agreement of the Commission and after a risk assessment. There is a six-month transition period for air borders, during which Member States are required to purchase all the necessary equipment for these checks, equipment and for the training of airport workers. This six-month period may be extended by up to 18 months by the Commission, when requested by a Member State for certain airports. It is not necessary, for example, to apply for all airports in a country. Here you have to prove that you still have structural and technical problems. I would like to give an example of how this control will be done, so that everyone can understand. It is basically a scan of the travel document, the passport and, if information about that person appears in one of these databases, then the information appears on the screen of the person controlling and the person goes through other checks. So this is not a row check in the databases. It is a single interface where a red flag appears if you find that name in one of the mentioned databases, which means that this check in the databases should not take long. I also want to mention that for all this equipment and for all this training there is a European fund for internal security, which is at the Commission, the Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs, DG HOME, and from which Member States will receive money to purchase this equipment and for training. I would also like to point out that this regulation, this proposal for a regulation - I hope that it will be voted on tomorrow and be a regulation - is complemented by other provisions, in addition to those in the Counter-Terrorism Directive that we discussed earlier. which we vote on tomorrow. We also have other provisions which, for example, provide for mobile teams, which can come to the aid, if necessary, at an external border, immediately providing that, from Member States which are within the Union and do not have an external border of appropriate personnel to be sent to assist Member States at the Union's border. That is, to be a joint effort to defend our borders. Finally, I would like to thank all my colleagues for their collaboration, for how I worked. It was not a short road, it was not an easy road, but we came to understand each other wisely and to make a regulation, I say, good, for the citizens of the European Union. Again, it is very important how it will be applied by the Member States and how it will be put into practice by the border people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 265, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris, the Commission proposed the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code introducing systematic checks for all citizens at our external borders. As we have just heard, these checks are vital to stopping, amongst others, potential terrorists, not just from coming into the EU, but also to prevent them from travelling to conflict zones. On behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Avramopoulos, as well as myself, I would like to say how grateful we are to the Parliament, and in particular to the rapporteur, Mrs Macovei, for the work that they have done on this important dossier. The amendment will oblige Member States to carry out systematic checks on all persons crossing an external border. They will be checked – as Mrs Macovei has just set out – against law enforcement databases, notably the Schengen Information System, to verify that they do not pose a threat to public order or internal security. This obligation will apply at all external borders – air, sea and land – both at entry and exit.  However, if a systematic consultation of databases leads to a disproportionate impact on the flow of border traffic, then Member States will have the option of carrying out targeted checks against the databases, provided that they first carry out an appropriate risk assessment. In the case of airports – again, as we have just heard – this option is generally only available for a transition arrangement of six months unless an airport has specific infrastructure problems, in which case an exception can be made to extend that transition period up to 18 months.  The EU will provide financial assistance to Member States to help them implement the new rules and in turn – like others here – I trust that the Member States will do their utmost to be ready on time and that the new measures will translate into immediate and tangible results.  The amended Schengen Borders Code, together with the European border and coast guards, are crucial in our bid to preserve freedom of movement within the Schengen Area and to ensure the security of our citizens.

First of all, as so often, there was no impact assessment. It seems the Commission does not consider that necessary when it is about security and fundamental rights. I also think that the justification used, namely the Paris attacks, is a very strange one, because what turned out to be the case was that Member States were not sharing information and terrorists were able to cross internal borders without problems; so this does not seem to me to be a coherent vision on security and external border control but the usual Pavlov reflexes and salami tactics.  We are, however, pleased that we got at least one thing, namely that compulsory checks will be limited to well-defined databases, rather than the rather general reference that was included initially, namely checks against ‘all relevant databases’, which might be anything. Because what has also become clear is that the Member States actually fail to make full use of the Schengen Information System (SIS). We have a system in place and Member States are not using it, they are not feeding information into it, and they are not checking it. So again we are finding solutions to the wrong problem. I wish that the Member States would finally do their duty and accept that there is an obligation to use the existing systems rather than, every time it turns out they failed to share information, coming up with something new.  We also wanted a risk-based system, proportional and necessary, rather than the default setting of systematic checks. We wanted risk assessment at the European level, based on common European criteria, but that was impossible.  Finally, and this was also one of the priorities of Parliament, we wanted equal treatment of land, air and sea borders, and we did not get it.

We must have modern legislation in place to respond to new and evolving threats.

Having systematic checks for persons enjoying the right of free movement across external land, sea and air borders is necessary and it is being required. In recent years, Europe has learned some very difficult lessons. As we have seen, the phenomenon of foreign fighters continues to plague our communities. We cannot allow terrorists to hide behind the protection afforded to them by their European passports. The reinforcement of checks will make it easier for our law enforcement agencies to identify those people at the border. With Islamic State losing ground in its traditional strongholds, it is becoming more likely that more of the approximately 5 000 foreign fighters in conflict zones will attempt to return to Europe. The measures being proposed are a clear and important response in terms of keeping our citizens safe. We simply must know whether people coming or going pose a threat to our internal security. We must have more security on our external borders while ensuring that our controls are efficient and secure.

As we heard in the previous discussion, security is one of the major concerns of our citizens and we believe that the reinforcement of checks against relevant databases will reinforce our external borders and strengthen our knowledge about who enters and leaves our shared space, and that can have an impact. I have seen myself at Charles de Gaulle Airport, where they already implement the systematic checks, the impact that that can have in terms of the increased knowledge about people who are arriving and, in a significant number of cases there, the controls that they were able to conduct as a result of that knowledge.  We are not, in these proposals, creating new databases. This is about checks against the relevant specified databases. But I do agree completely with those who have underlined how important it is that those databases are properly used and properly supplied by the Member States, in particular, the most important and significant of these databases, I believe, the Schengen Information System; which is precisely why, in the proposals that the Commission brought forward in December, which you are going to be discussing, we have made a number of suggestions for strengthening the Schengen Information System and, for the first time, we are proposing the introduction of an obligation on Member States to share information with that system regarding terrorism. I hope that you will support that.  I agree that we need borders that are not just resilient but also functioning and that is why, as a number of speakers have underlined, there are elements of flexibility that are included in these proposals and those depend on risk assessment.

One of the objectives of such controls is to contribute to the fight against irregular migration and trafficking in human beings, and to prevent all threats to internal security. In such cases, it is advisable to strengthen the protection of the external borders in order to identify more effectively those persons who intend to conceal their true identity.

Last June, the need to address the issue led the Council to endorse a roadmap on information exchange and information management in the Justice and Home Affairs area, including interoperability solutions. The roadmap contains no less than 50 practical short and medium—term actions and long—term orientations. The implementation of those actions is monitored by the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security. The essence of the roadmap is to make sure that the practitioners have access to the information they need. It provides a coherent framework for a more integrated EU information architecture in the Justice and Home Affairs area. This must obviously happen in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection rules.  Improving information exchange and implementing the roadmap has been a priority of the previous Presidencies and it continues to be a priority for our Presidency. I believe that, based on available statistics, it is fair to say that there has been substantive progress in increasing the information exchange, both among the Member States and with Europol, over the past year. Let me give you some figures to demonstrate this point. For instance, in the third quarter of 2016, more than 200 000 messages were exchanged via the Secure Information Exchange Network Application amongst the Member States, and between the Member States and Europol. This is an increase of 16% compared to the same quarter of the year before, 2015. Regarding new cases, nearly 11 000 new cases were initiated via the same network application in the third quarter of 2016, which amounts to an increase of 6% compared to 2015. As regards the use of Europol’s databases, both the input of data and the number of searches in the Europol information system substantially increased in 2016. The number of searches conducted in this database even set a new record in the third quarter of last year, reaching more than one million searches for the first time. I am aware of the fact that using the existing tools is only one part of the process. The implementation of many of the actions of the roadmap and achieving interoperability of information systems will require certain legislative changes. Important work in this direction is ongoing in the high—level expert group which the Commission set up last April and in which the European Parliament participates. Once the group’s report is presented to Parliament and the Council in April, our common role as co-legislators will be crucial when addressing some of the challenges ahead.  Regarding the various legal instruments, I would like to make the following points. Regarding the exchange of information on terrorism offences, the Council, throughout the negotiations last year on the Counter—Terrorism Directive, was actively engaged in seeking a compromise with Parliament on strengthening the exchange of information. I am glad that Parliament has just had a debate on the directive and will vote on it tomorrow. I would like once again to thank Ms Hohlmeier and her colleagues for their work on the directive. The directive will strengthen the European Union’s legal framework to prevent terrorist attacks, notably by criminalising acts such as training or travelling for terrorist purposes, and it also reinforces the rights of the victims. This morning we had the opportunity to address the media, together with the rapporteur and Commissioner King, on the expectation that tomorrow’s vote on this directive would now pave the way to its adoption. The political agreement on the directive envisages that Member States will be obliged to exchange relevant information gathered in criminal proceedings wherever such information could be used in the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist offences, and irrespective of whether there has been a request to that effect.  To ensure better compliance by Member States, an explicit obligation for the receiving competent authorities to take active follow-up measures on such information is also introduced. At the same time Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed that to ensure efficient and timely exchange of information on terrorism, measures in a broader policy context are necessary. In a joint statement the three institutions underlined the necessity of making full use of all the existing Union instruments, channels and agencies to exchange information. A swift implementation of all adopted Union legislation in this field is key.  Madam President, I will stop here – though I can see that in the time that I have been addressing the House, it is no longer Madam President but Mr President – and I now look forward to listening to your debate in the House and responding later.

Forgive me in advance if some of this gets a bit technical. I know that there are many experts here who can match, indeed far exceed, my technical expertise. EU Member States are in the front line for dealing with many of these issues to do with tackling terrorism, security, and law enforcement. But we can, and should, do all we can at the EU level to help and assist and support EU Member States and EU Member States’ agencies. Information sharing is a key part of that, as we all recognise, and indeed the Member States and their agencies recognise. Unfortunately, and we have already talked about this in earlier discussions this afternoon, some of the recent attacks have shown some weaknesses in the way that information is currently being shared across the European Union and, more generally, in the way that some of these systems are operating currently, including how they operate with each other. The Commission has consistently called on Member States to exploit fully the potential of the existing information systems at EU level. And we work to support the Member States in doing this with funding, expertise and by getting them to share best practice. As I have said on several occasions before this House, EU instruments can only bring added value on the ground, if and when they are fully implemented by the Member States and applied in practice. This is why a key aspect of our work towards an effective and sustainable security union is better application and implementation of existing EU instruments. It is one of the pillars of our work towards a stronger and smarter set of information systems and greater interoperability; it is a key part of the work of the high-level expert group to assess various options and make recommendations to that end. The Commission assists Member States in every possible way to ensure the proper implementation of our agreements, but where necessary we do not shy away from enforcing the law, including the use of infringement procedures. Let me turn to some of the key instruments and give you a brief update on where we stand in terms of their implementation and their use. The main instrument, we have already touched upon it earlier this afternoon, that I am going to address, is the Schengen Information System (SIS). It is the most widely used information-sharing system in Europe and I believe it is a real operational success, thanks in part to our collective – and I include very much the work of the Parliament here – support and work to raise awareness. There is a clear upward trend in the way Member States are using the SIS. To take just one example, there has been a significant increase in checks by, and involvement of Member State security services with this system. An 800% increase in the discreet and specific check alerts issued by those services over the last two years. So I believe we are moving in the right direction, but there is still a long way to go. We need to make technical and operational improvements to the SIS if it is to become more effective and efficient, as we all want. That is why, as I have just said in finishing the last debate, in December, the Commission presented a set of proposals to improve the technical functioning of SIS, to streamline national processes and to strengthen data protection by introducing additional safeguards. In doing so, we propose to turn the current Council decisions on the SIS – which are pre-Lisbon instruments and part of the so-called former third pillar – into regulations to be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedures. From the various improvements tabled I would highlight one in particular: for the first time, we propose to make it obligatory for Member States to issue alerts in SIS for persons related to terrorist offences. I hope you will support that and we stand ready to examine whether such mandatory obligations for information-sharing could/should be introduced for other EU databases. It is important that the co-legislators work together for the swift adoption of these proposed measures. In parallel we are continuing to work with the Member States to ensure the full implementation and effective use of all of our information exchange tools. One well-known tool is the Prüm framework for exchanging data regarding DNA, fingerprints and vehicle registration, and for enhancing cross-border cooperation against crime and terrorism. We are focused on getting to full implementation of this system, which, as you know, was agreed some years ago. Despite all the efforts we have made collectively there are five Member States that still do not comply with the requirements of the Prüm Decision. That is why, for the first time in relation to a former third-pillar instrument, infringement proceedings were launched in September last year. All five Member States have responded; we are looking at their replies and, in the light of those, we will need to take a decision on next steps. We have also got the high-level expert working group looking into the challenge of strengthening and improving the functioning of Prüm cooperation. Another instrument that I want to pause on is the Council framework decision referred to as ‘the Swedish initiative’, well known to you here. It provides a common legal framework for the effective and expeditious exchange of information and criminal intelligence between Member States’ law enforcement authorities. Now good progress has been made, and only one Member State has not notified transposition. But some Member States use the Swedish framework decision more extensively than others – to put it politely – and overall there remains room for improvement. That is why the Commission is currently looking at the Member States’ use of the Swedish initiative and why we plan to launch a compliance study to look into this in more detail. It will help us to determine what is needed to ensure a better use of this important instrument. The last instrument I want to pause on is Council decision 2005/671 on the exchange of information on terrorist offences. This legislation, again well-known to you, requires Member States to designate contact points with responsibility for sending information on terrorist offences to Europol and Eurojust. It defines a minimum base for what types of information should be shared with the two agencies. It requires Member States to transmit information on terrorist offences to Eurojust, Europol and other Member States concerned, unless this would jeopardise ongoing investigations. Information sharing with Europol and Eurojust has increased significantly over the last year. For instance, the number of foreign terrorist fighters communicated to Europol and entered into its Europol information system increased from 3 740 entries in December 2015 to 7 884 entries in December 2016. The volume of data concerning foreign terrorist fighters shared with Europol’s Focal Point Travellers – Europol’s specialist team of analysts and experts who work on analysing information around foreign terrorist fighters – increased almost threefold over the course of 2016. Now I take this progress to be encouraging, but the level of engagement still differs between different Member States. The obligations in the Council decision will be strengthened through the Directive on combating terrorism which you are voting on tomorrow. Thanks to the work of the Parliament, the Directive will make the exchange of information mandatory and include an obligation for the receiving Member State to take appropriate action when they get information. Finally, let me say a few words about our work on information systems and interoperability and the preparatory work at senior officials level that is currently being done by the high-level expert group. President Juncker’s State of the Union address in September and the European Council conclusions of December, refer to the importance of overcoming the current shortcomings in information management and improving the interoperability and interconnection between existing information systems. To accelerate the work of the high-level expert group, the chairman presented an interim report last December. We discussed the findings with some of you in the LIBE Committee in January and I look forward to continuing a discussion on this important subject. Today I would just like briefly to refer to the interim report’s recommendations. First, the Group suggests ways to improve data quality in EU Information Systems. The Commission welcomes this, as information systems are really only as effective as the quality of the data they hold and we intend to pursue the proposals put forward by the Group. Second, the Group proposes to look at a European portal capable of searching simultaneously all relevant EU databases to which the person conducting the search has access rights. Again this would seek to make better use of existing systems in full compliance with existing rules on access, the use of data and data protection rules. I think it is a good suggestion which I commend to you. More generally the process we initiated last year with a strategy presented in April, the setting-up of the high-level expert group, allows us to address shortcomings in the EU information systems in an inclusive and transparent way. The high-level expert group will present its final report later this spring, and, on this basis, the Commission will consider if, and if so what, further measures might increase the effectiveness and help address the current security threats. Any proposals – I think it goes without saying – for amending the existing legal framework will of course need to be taken forward with you in the normal way. On that and indeed all of these issues to do with information exchange, I look forward to continuing the close dialogue that we have between the Commission and the Parliament because these subjects merit it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 306, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, dear Presidency! First of all, thank you for the very detailed answers. Nevertheless, I want to ask a few critical questions. First of all, I think it is very good that we are talking about replacing the pre-Lisbon instruments, because we have had a say in these issues in the European Parliament since the Lisbon Treaty. It is necessary to implement the terrorism directive, which we will adopt tomorrow, with further legal instruments. We are currently having a lot of talk and are justified in talking about terrorism. However, we also have other forms of serious international crime - in particular organized crime - which in part facilitate each other with terrorist networks, support each other and thus in part develop forms that are dangerous to the state. I think it is particularly important that, firstly, when it comes to the exchange of information, we ensure that all Member States are actually feeding in information, that the information is analyzed - first at national level, then merged at European level - and that we have significantly more manpower when it comes to analyzing information and also to provide technical equipment, because it is thanks to the precise analysis of information that we can prevent serious criminal offenses, and not only to the mere collection of information. Secondly, I think it is very important that we also ensure that data is fed into the SIS. It's been years since we've been debating this, and there are still some who don't feed in - I don't want to believe it! But slowly the last one should have understood. A common list of threats would also be needed, and it would be essential to give the Joint Investigation Teams less bureaucracy and more money to help us have more cross-border cooperation and less ineffective bureaucratic structures.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 307, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Claude Moraes", "mepid": "4519", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive assessment. Commissioner, you mention that colleagues here can match you for technical detail. Sadly, we cannot match you for speaking time, so I am only going to identify one or two of the issues that you spread over 12 to 14 minutes.  Ms Hohlmeier mentioned the pre-Lisbon instruments.  Let me say first of all that we must be there; this is why Ms Hohlmeier mentioned the pre-Lisbon instruments. I want to say to Mr Borg: thank you to your JHA Council for keeping up the pressure, and we as a Parliament will want to see the Council face to face, because this is very much about the Member States.  The Commissioner mentioned the Prüm Convention. I only have two minutes, so let me mention the Prüm Convention. In terms of intelligence cooperation this, as the Commissioner mentioned, is the building blocks, the vehicle licensing, the DNA databases. All of the things he said were correct: evaluation, implementation, ensuring that there is cooperation, and ensuring at the bottom of this that there are fundamental rights, the Police Directive. But in the end, if the Member States are not willing to share the basic information, as we saw with the Prüm Convention and as we now see with continuing infringement procedures by the Commission, then we don’t have the genuine sharing of intelligence and police information, and that is the problem.  So, before we have any new legislation or any new avenues, we must have a proper structure in sharing of information which has all of these elements together, which takes the valuable private information of individuals to fight the crime or terrorism that invades our fundamental freedoms. This is the really important area when we see record numbers of searches on the SIS database, when we see records being made on the Europol searches, all of the things that the Commissioner mentioned. The High Level Working Group on Interoperability is now one of the key challenges for us.  I think Parliament is doing its work. There are experts here. In fact, the small number of Members here in the Chamber now are experts, as you as you rightly identified. We are doing our work to ensure that this balance is created, but the key, as the Commissioner said, is implementation and evaluation, and of course we will do our work in relation to fundamental rights. This is such an important area because as soon as there is a terrorist attack, everyone says: have we had the intelligence-sharing? We need to answer, intelligently and with practicality in this House, that we have also done our job.

However, given the changed security situation, the question is whether the exchange of information between Member States on terror and serious crime should remain non-committal. My party is in favor of a thorough exchange of information because it promotes security. Earlier we discussed the border surveillance regulation, which introduces systematic checks for everyone entering or leaving the European Union, including through international airports. The intention is to screen both EU and non-EU citizens by consulting the EU databases, such as the SIS system, and international databases, such as the SLTD system. It goes without saying that those databases must contain relevant data. In addition, the anti-terror directive to be voted on tomorrow requires member states to share relevant intelligence on criminal investigations with other EU countries. The uniform definitions for terror offenses should also facilitate this. At the same time, we understand that intelligence services may share less information if they are obliged to actually share everything with the countries they do not fully trust. The fact that the Council is now considering a directive for a stricter legal framework for the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities at Union level is an interesting option.

Commissioner, I am not going to talk technical today. You've taught us a lesson, so I'm not going to venture that far. I do not dispute the progress that has been made in recent years in the exchange of information, but, Presidency of the Council, this is the least of things after the events we have known. The increase that is observed shows how insufficient it was previously. Therefore, the need remains the same and the little progress made is not enough. I also take careful note of what the Commissioner said - and I welcome it - about the creation of the high level group on interoperability. It is all the same extraordinary, Commissioner, that it was not until the creation of ten to twelve systems for collecting information at European level, in very different matters, before we really began to worry, in a systemic way. , their interoperability.

Furthermore, I want to warmly welcome the Commission proposal, which aims to make the reporting of suspected terrorists in the Schengen information system compulsory.

When we talk about the fight against terrorism, we must of course also talk about the exchange of data and how the two Council decisions from 2005 and 2006 are actually implemented.

Any suspects have been suspicious for a long time, are then arrested, let out again for lack of evidence, only to turn up at crime scenes at some point. The necessary data exchange - we know that - doesn't work at the front and back. I wonder why someone is known as a terrorist suspect in one EU country and the other neighboring country does not know that. There are three options: Either - and you said that, Mister King - the member states are not implementing EU law properly, or the information that is exchanged is the wrong one, or both. That is precisely why we need a comprehensive qualitative evaluation of the existing instruments in the Member States too.

One case we saw recently was the Berlin attacker who was very well known to the intelligence services in Germany at least, and who, even after this attack in Berlin, was fleeing through some Member States, even France which is in a state of emergency, with a weapon in his hand, and I think that shows very much that we have to divert away from spending big money into new systems, rather than investing, and that should be our focus in the cooperation between the police authorities, for example in the field of joint investigation teams with Europol.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 312, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Dubravka Šuica (PPE).", "mepid": "119434", "text": "- Mr. President, are there better topics than this to prove that no member state can do it alone, how we must cooperate, how the problem of migration and terrorism has called us to cooperation.

The slowness with which the Union is working on prevention is not admissible, especially in a historical moment in which European citizens feel the need for security more. I believe it is essential that the Commission act decisively, launching an infringement procedure against Member States which are reluctant to share information to which they are obliged by the current legal framework, and in the meantime make an ambitious proposal for a directive aimed at guaranteeing a legal framework compliant and stricter for the exchange of law enforcement and intelligence information at Union level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 319, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς (ECR).", "mepid": "125069", "text": "- Mr President, matters of internal security and public policy, such as the fight against terrorism, are the sole responsibility of the Member States of the Union.

They are not science fiction: all kinds of robots are already on the market, new, more autonomous robots are being developed in laboratories. It is therefore urgent that the widest possible debate takes place and that it not remain compartmentalized in the circle of scientists and engineers, because it is a question of organizing, for the good of man, the interaction human beings with these new increasingly autonomous machines. I would like to clarify two points at the outset: firstly, robots are not humans and there is no question of equating them with human beings, and secondly, European robotics industry and research are very efficient and we let’s support them. Robotics and artificial intelligence are sectors of the future. It is important that Europe remains competitive in the global market. This is why the time has come to set out principles that will serve as guidelines and a framework for the development of robotics. Regulate, without excess, when necessary. First of all, there is the question of civil liability in the event of damage caused by a robot. There are two options: either strict liability or risk-based management, but the main thing is that there be redress for the damage caused. Standardization must be accelerated. To ensure the highest level of security possible, protocols must be established. As for testing, why not create areas in Europe where all kinds of robots can be tested in real life in real life? The biggest challenge is the enforcement of data protection regulations. Robots collect and receive masses of information of all kinds: who owns this data, who has access to it? The report proposes an ethics charter, a code of ethics for programmers, because we want robots whose actions serve the well-being of humans and which respect dignity, privacy and freedom. We stress the need for transparency, for robot actions to be explained and explainable, and understandable to ordinary people. The deployment of robots will have an impact on all aspects of life and therefore on work. Studies diverge: some predict a massive destruction of jobs, others are less pessimistic and believe that the jobs destroyed will be offset by the creation of new jobs. However, it is clear that our ways of working will change and that our education systems will be faced with enormous challenges in ensuring the retraining of those who are in work and training young people in professions that do not yet exist. The report is not technophobic, it identifies the positive contributions: robots can perform dangerous or arduous work, they will facilitate the work of many professionals, they will promote the integration of people with a disability. But no one can predict whether robots will destroy more jobs than they create. On the other hand, I listen to my fellow citizens and I hear great concern from many of them. So I think we have to take them seriously, prepare for different scenarios and think about possible solutions. If, indeed, work becomes scarce, we must ensure that all our citizens have sufficient income to live a life of dignity. This is why I am arguing for a rational debate, supported by expertise and studies, on the option of a universal income and, of course, how to finance it by seeking alternative sources of finance. I don't want the debate to be killed before it has begin.In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues who made it possible to enrich this report, the secretariat, the services of Parliament and above all the STOA team who have accompanied us in this wonderful adventure.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 331, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Michał Boni", "mepid": "124896", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. – Mr President, (inaudible) opportunities of robotics.

Secondly, ethical principles and respect for fundamental rights are crucial. This should begin from the moment constructors start the work with algorithms on privacy and security, to make those by default. Thirdly, it is crucial to raise awareness and avoid, through ethical guidance, the emotional dependency of humans cooperating with robots. Fourthly, this is not the time for strong regulation. It is better to use the soft-law principles approved by all stakeholders in the Code of Conduct, using existing laws and adjusting them to the new challenges. Fifthly, this is not the time for new taxes, but we have to continue work on the liability problem.

This is a crucial report on all the legal questions related to development of robotics and artificial intelligence. This House, to my knowledge, will be one of the first to have a clear and comprehensive position on robotics and artificial intelligence, a topic that is getting great public attention, and rightly so. Your text highlights the challenges and opportunities of this sector, and points towards a clear need for a coherent European approach. You are also calling for Europe to have a strong presence and investment in its technology in order to maintain leadership. In the European Commission, we have long recognised the importance and the potential of robotics and artificial intelligence, and the need for significant investment in these areas. We have set an ambitious public and private partnership for robotics in Europe: Sparc. This partnership not only brings the academic and research institutions, industry and business together, but also looks into questions related to ethics and law. Sparc is by far the biggest civilian research programme in this area in the world, with EUR 700 million from EU funding from Horizon 2020 to be leveraged up to EUR 2.8 billion by private investment. Ladies and gentlemen, for a very long time, robots were a kind of a futuristic idea. Today, they are a fact of life. They are operational in our industry and used in many sectors of the economy and life. Robots in the internet of things are going to be the internet of the intelligent things, and they will move beyond manufacturing and industry into areas such as transportation, medicine, care for the elderly, and financial services. As Mr Mayer said, they will complement human skills. And let me tell you that this is only the beginning. Without doubt, we need to frame and facilitate the technical revolution brought by autonomous systems, because we all want Europe to remain the leader in this field and make sure robotics and artificial intelligence continue to bring benefits to European citizens, industry and especially SMEs and start-ups that are active in this sector. As Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation, I recognise that we have to further invest in scientific understanding of the technical aspects of artificial intelligence and of its socio-economic impacts, as well as of its consequences for the rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy. But let me stress that moving forward in this area needs to be guided by an ethical approach based on principles and values enshrined in the Treaty on the European Union and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Let me now comment in particular on your request for the Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal on civil liability for damage caused by robots. First, as you know, we already have EU legislation applying to robots. The Machinery Directive, the General Product Safety Directive, the proposed legislation on medical devices, and the regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation currently under revision also includes concrete measures to ensure the safe operation of civil drones. And the new General Data Protection Regulation that will also be fully applicable to any kind of processing of personal data, which includes artificial intelligence and robots. Second, we are obviously looking at any need for adjustment of the current legislation. And third we are well aware that legal certainty on liability is of paramount importance for innovators, investors and consumers, providing them with the legal certainty they need. But the complexity of digital technologies makes it particularly difficult to determine who is liable and to what extent in case of failure. That is why the Commission has put in its communication and presented a communication last month on building up a European data economy. We are consulting with a wide range of stakeholders on the new challenges in this field, covering the liability questions relating to autonomous systems. Simultaneously, we are evaluating the Product Liabilities Directive with regard to emerging technologies. Fourth, testing and experimenting will be important as will gathering data and gaining experience. This in turn will then help us with designing a suitable legal framework. On the communication on building a new European data economy, we included plans for cross-border corridors to test connected automated driving. My fifth and final point on the question of legislation is to underline the importance of smart legislation, technologically neutral and future proof when dealing with technologies and jobs. As Ms Delvaux said, we cannot even imagine what they will be in the future. Honourable Members, I agree with you that the impact of digitalisation on our societies and our labour market needs to be closely monitored and anticipated, and we have to improve our understanding of this phenomenon. The different studies that have assessed that evolution reached diverging conclusions from catastrophic predictions on the labour market to a positive impact on job creation. In 2015, the Fraunhofer Institute indicated that EU companies which are intensive users of robotics are less likely to offshore production to low-cost regions because robots improve their cost production so much that they can stay in high-wage regions and create other jobs. We all know that technological change will not only replace or change existing tasks, but it will, as Mr Mayer said, create new jobs in services, it will complement human skills. Robots are also used in many areas with labour shortages such as healthcare, farming and even manufacturing. Many robots do tasks that are repetitive and dangerous for humans, such as inspecting oil tanks or welding metal parts. Far from replacing humans, robots allow the workforce to focus on other more economically useful, creative or social activities where robots cannot and will never replace us. The Commission is fully aware of the challenges ahead and has already launched concrete measures to address them. We adopted a New Skills Agenda for Europe, the Digitising European Industry blueprint and, last December, we launched a Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, which aims at equipping the workforce at large with the necessary digital skills to thrive in a digital workplace. Ladies and gentlemen once again, I would like to thank the European Parliament for this timely and comprehensive report and for the support for our activities.

In the short to medium term, robotics and artificial intelligence do promise benefits, but it is feared that the number of jobs appearing in this area will not grow as much as the number of jobs expected to be lost. The next generations need to be educated to meet these challenges through appropriate education.

If we think about robots in terms of Star Wars and Terminator, we get it wrong. Robots and artificial intelligence are already here in our daily lives, helping us to solve complex tasks. I said ‘helping’ because robots need to compliment humans: both need to, and can, work as a team. Our role is to drive policy that makes individuals active consumers of robots rather than passive ones. We cannot, however, have active and empowered individuals if we shift all the responsibility onto robots or manufacturers if something goes wrong. This is the problem with the strict liability approach or an electronic personality for robots. Last but certainly not least, we should not forget that developing autonomous robots and putting them on the market requires risk-taking investment and vision. So let us focus not only on precaution but also on innovation.

While I am honoured that the report makes note of the important role of the Czech nation in the creation of the word ‘robot’ and in our literature as a Czech, I believe it is wrong to mix science fiction and a real need to address issues like liability. We must reject the belief that robots are going to steal everyone’s job. This is simply not true. We must reject that we are creating ‘electronic persons’: I am sorry, but robots are not humans, it is pure science fiction to think otherwise. We must reject attacks on robots, and a new EU agency. The bottom line: go and see the robots that exist today and those in development. They are already transforming our industry and society and I believe for the better. This transformation is not something to fear. By 2025, in less than 10 years, robotics could add more than EUR 1 trillion to our European economy. The benefits far outweigh any risks.

The report starts a debate on robotics and brings to the fore different possibilities and solutions. The report is prescriptive only on one element: robots are not human; no matter how autonomous and self-learning they become, they do not attain the characteristics of a living human. Our work discusses solutions to liability for damages caused by robots. Who will be responsible? How will any legal solution affect the development of robotics, those who own them, and victims of the damage? The current legal framework on liability may not entirely work for robotics, so we need to consider the impact of different solutions to make sure that harm caused to persons and to our environment will be addressed. Ethical considerations also need to be made, so we can set an ethical framework within which robotics will develop. In all of this we have to understand how robotisation of industry and professions will affect our workers and our professionals, and find ways to provide the right skills and support. Allow me also to thank Ms Delvaux and all the rapporteurs who have worked on this report. I think that together we have managed to produce a report which deserves a plenary vote in favour.

It is also a courageous report, because sometimes we are a little dizzy at the extent of the field we have to clear. It is true that it might be more comfortable to look away and imagine that if we refuse to look at these questions, they will disappear on their own, or else to rely solely on the industry and think that from a strictly economic point of view, it will find solutions. On the contrary, I believe that a secure legal framework, based on the values ​​of the European project, humanist values, is both an asset for European companies and a guarantee of well-being and security for European citizens. What are these questions that we face? Legal questions on liability, security and intellectual property; ethical questions on respect for private life, bioethics and democracy, on the transparency of decisions; and then questions about the very organization of society: what distribution of wealth and what impact on the labor market?

But let me reiterate my concerns, especially when it comes to this legislative proposal. Not only are there issues related to ethics, morality and social impact that need to be addressed in detail, but there are also much more important, more fundamental issues, such as the application of the so-called A \"universal approach\" on this issue. Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, the difference between technological progress in the Member States of the European Union's central and peripheral regions has not been taken into account in the document in question. Last but not least, the burden will fall on consumers. This proposal, which at some point could become European Union legislation, has the ability to oblige citizens of all Member States to pay even more insurance, costs that will fund a new robot insurance scheme such as the Robotics Agency. and artificial intelligence.

Cyber physical systems (CPS), so-called healthcare robots, will incontestably be part of this solution. Robots and smart devices will be more and more incorporated into diagnosis, treatment and care at hospitals and healthcare centres. The development of new technological devices will lead to healthier societies and quicker recovery times, and will decrease the number of medical errors. Furthermore, CPS is a growing market in healthcare, and will create numerous jobs and businesses in the medical field. I therefore take a positive view of the major positive outcomes for the healthcare sector throughout the EU.  I therefore also support the report even if I found it sometimes fearful.

We find ourselves in a situation similar to that of the workers in the manufactories, when their work began to be replaced by machines. Even today, we should be mainly interested in the impact of the development of robotics on the labor market. While the European Commission envisages € 8 billion in investment in support of robotics in its SPARC program, as it should help create as many as 240,000 new jobs in industry and other sectors by 2020, there are also studies showing the opposite figures. up to catastrophic. For example, in the Czech Republic alone, up to 140,000 people should lose their jobs by 2025 and a number of fields should disappear. Whatever the outlined scenarios come true, it is evident that for many the time is coming to an end, when one job, one profession, has become a livelihood for life. The field of education in particular will have to respond, the emphasis must be on education in new, creative and future-oriented fields.

But robotics and artificial intelligence are no longer science fiction, they are taking place, and they are already among us. There are robots among us. The question of which rules are needed, especially with regard to liability, especially with regard to safety standards, we have to answer now. I am a bit surprised at how reluctant the European Commission is to point out what problems there are and how complicated the questions are. We are of the opinion that, especially when it comes to questions of liability, the question of responsibility, that behind every decision made by a robot or an intelligent machine there must of course be a natural or legal person, that there must be no liability gaps and that we Impact assessments and technology impact assessments must be made mandatory, we must also require that there is a framework for how, for example, the precautionary principle is firmly anchored in this question. These are important areas of regulation that must now be answered. And there is also, for example, the question of security standards, liability for missing standards.

It is therefore necessary to frame their use by ethical principles, such as respect for private life and human freedom. In terms of liability, alas, the Delvaux report recommends dangerous solutions, because it does not limit itself - as it should have done - to recommending the establishment of a compulsory insurance scheme and a fund. warranty. It envisages, in effect, the creation of a legal personality specific to robots, which would amount to considering robots as - and I quote - \"responsible electronic persons\". I object to this prospect for two reasons: first, because it would exonerate their manufacturers and users of all liability, which would undoubtedly delight powerful lobbies; secondly and above all, because I believe, like Jacques Maritain, that the human person has a spiritual superexistence to which no artificial intelligence can be compared.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 349, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Pavel Svoboda (PPE).", "mepid": "96272", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Delvaux, and all the colleagues in the JURI Committee who took part in this report.

Yet there are still many things to be regulated in ICT, despite the fact that the World Wide Web spread over twenty years ago. To name a few topical here, geoblocking, online privacy, liability and intellectual property. As legislators we should intercept changes in advance and define regulatory frameworks quickly that do not come to approval already old and inadequate. So it is our responsibility to intervene before the future glimpsed today quickly becomes a present without rules. Artificial intelligence, in fact, is already capable of self-learning and the consequent evolution of cyber-physical systems will very soon generate enormous social, productive, economic and cultural changes, both positive and negative. Among the negatives awaits unprecedented rapid technological unemployment. The Bank of England estimates that one in two jobs in Britain will disappear by 2020. By the same year, according to the World Economic Forum, 7 million jobs will be lost in the 15 most industrialized economies of the world of work, replaced by just 2 million of new jobs. We know well how the spending power of citizens and the tax revenue that supports the public welfare and health system derive from work. Added to this picture is the growing concentration of global wealth.

In Articles 36 and 38, when we speak of “repair”, at the medical level, that does not pose a problem for me, but when we speak of “improvement” or “enhancement”, there we are on a subject that not related to. What does this mean? This reflects the project that is also developing very strongly in the United States: the project of transhumanists, of augmented man. On this point, I think we need to be very firm. It is for this reason that I would like that tomorrow, during the vote, to remove this notion of \"better man\". In my opinion, this is fundamental.

On the other hand, I find the report too extensive. There are a number of things that, in my opinion, are not related to this topic. I think that issues that are social in nature, such as the introduction of a universal basic income, are things that are unrelated to the civil law aspects of robots, and perhaps it raises a problem for me to support the report without further questions.

In short and well, European law, which derives from Roman law, has distinguished between a natural person and a legal person for two thousand years.

We have touched really upon a very broad array of complex issues: technology and society – Ms Lauristin brought us that issue which for me is fundamental in terms of research; jobs; regulation, with Ms Charanzová; and education, there we had Mr Maštálka, Mr Kósa and Ms Kyllönen who brought us the big changes that will have to take place in education. Also Ms Rozière with la valeur humaniste, very important for our debate, and also sectors like health – Mr Buşoi and Mr Selimovic brought these to the table. So there was a really fantastic discussion with so many ideas for the future. But one thing that was clear from our discussion is that we all agree, and I think Ms Kallas was the first to say it, that we want to promote innovation, we do not want to stop innovation, and that has to be very clear and I was very happy that we agree on that.  But there is a political choice to make, to think what we want for the future and I think we agree that we don’t want robots to replace us; we want robots to get us to be better at doing things that we can’t do alone. We want them to really augment our abilities and get us to a better place. Not so long ago in real time the following experiment was carried out: experts, medical experts, looking at scanners of lung cancer compared to machines, looking at the same scans. The results were staggering: machines were 50% better than doctors. But more than that, the false negatives – meaning when you miss cancer and you put someone in danger – was zero for the machine and 7% for great medical experts. That changes the profession but changes it in a good way, because the machines will never be able to relate the whole human body and the different diseases; they will be very good at this specific task and the doctors will be good at the other task, which is to relate all the tasks [to each other].  So robotics changes jobs, it is true, and makes us better, to focus on what we are good at. I believe that we can digitalise everything but we cannot digitalise experience, we cannot digitalise the experience of life, we cannot digitalise the experience of what we do. So I believe that we will have a better future, it will be a future that will entail complex policy changes, and that is why this report is so important. That is why we need together to shape this process and create the framework which allows robotics and artificial intelligence to create all the desired advantages – and there are so many –while safeguarding the fundamental values of our society and important features of our economy, striking the right balance between all the interests at stake.

Dear Commissioner, I am going to ask you two simple questions tonight, and I think you would actually like to answer no to those simple questions. But I ask the first question: Is this German car toll compliant with EU law? At this point I would also like to quote a proven expert on these issues who said: A road user charge is only in conformity with EU law if it does not discriminate on the basis of nationality. I am not saying that, you said that, Commissioner Bulc, at the start of the infringement procedure in June 2015. Let us therefore start from this principle. Has this discrimination been eliminated by the alleged agreement? Not in my opinion. As a result, foreigners from the EU are still more burdened than German nationals. Or to put it simply: a Belgian driver with a Euro 6 car pays the toll, a German driver does not. Hence the answer to the first question “Is the new German toll model compliant with EU law?”: No, it is not. I come to the second question: is this toll a symbol of good European cooperation? Here too the answer: No, it isn't. There is currently no European toll system. This toll violates the fundamental principles of our Union, which you and the Commission must protect. There must be no feeling that our European partners finance Germany's roads at the expense of our neighbors. Because what would be the result then? The long-term consequence would be that we are shaking up the basic principles of the internal market and coexistence in Europe. That is why this toll must not have a place in Europe, especially not in our time when so many doubt the EU. Ms. Bulc, you so have it in your hand.The case is currently on hold.I therefore make an urgent appeal to you: continue the infringement procedure, otherwise Member States will sue.And don't doubt it: this idea is gaining more and more support, because it is about more than the toll, it is about the basic principles of our European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 385, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you for giving the Commission the opportunity to clarify its position on the German road-charging reform. I know this issue has stirred up a lot of emotions, in Germany as well as in neighbouring countries, and this is why I would like to focus today on facts.  First, the Commission has consistently promoted, and continues to promote, road-charging in line with the ‘user and polluter pays’ principle. In our view, this is the most sustainable and fairest way to ensure infrastructure financing, and this is clearly referable to taxation.  Secondly, there is at this stage no specific EU legislation on road-charging for passenger cars, only for heavy goods vehicles. There is also no EU law on vehicle taxation of passenger cars. Both remain national competences. This being said, it is vital that Member States respect the EU Treaty. This includes, of course, the principle of non-discrimination based on nationality, and yes, I still stand for that. So let me be very clear: foreign drivers cannot be discriminated against. Thirdly, the Commission has been in discussions with the German authorities on their road-charging reform for several years. Since the beginning, the Commission has raised several reservations concerning the German plans. These reservations were only partly taken into account by the German authorities while drafting the first version of the laws. This is the reason why the Commission was able to react only a week after the adoption of these laws by starting an infringement case. The launch of this infringement case had the immediate effect of Germany suspending implementation of the PkW-Maut. The Commission had two main concerns relating to discrimination against foreign users. First, the one-to-one vehicle tax compensation of German vehicle owners, and second, the excessively high prices of shorter vignettes, purchased mainly by foreign vehicle—owners. The launch of the infringement case did not stop discussions with the German authorities. The Commission indicated repeatedly that it would continue, as is often the case during infringement procedures, to try to find a solution without having to go to court, and on 1 December Minister Alexander Dobrindt and I were able to announce publicly that we had reached a political understanding on the way forward. That’s it.  I am very pleased that the German authorities recognised the need to amend the two laws to meet the following principles. Firstly, the German vehicle tax law should be based on environmental logic and avoid one-to-one compensation of all German-owned vehicles. Secondly, the prices for short-term vignettes should be reasonable and proportionate to ensure that foreigners, who usually buy these vignettes, are not discriminated against in favour of German users, who would, in general, buy annual vignettes.  On this basis, the German Government issued new legislative proposals just three weeks ago on 25 January. These proposals will now have to be examined and voted on in the German Parliament.  In the meantime, the infringement case is still there and, as you know, infringement cases are matters strictly between the Member States and the Commission and therefore I cannot discuss the details of the case. I am fully aware of the concerns of neighbouring Member States which believe that the amended German PkW-Maut and vehicle tax law may still be discriminatory, but it is way too early to reply to these concerns as the new laws have not yet been debated and voted on in the German Bundestag.  When these new laws are adopted, and only then, will the Commission assess them and decide on further actions. The infringement case will be closed if, and only if, the Commission is convinced that the German laws do not discriminate against foreign drivers. It is very important for me and the European Union that Germany now agree to put their road-charging reform in the context of a future EU-wide system. As you know, the Commission is currently preparing a revision of EU legislation on road-charging as part of the road initiatives. The plan is to adopt them this spring.  On road-charging we are considering proposing rules that underpin non-discrimination of foreign vehicle-owners and pave the way for an EU-wide system. This could include for the first time passenger cars, excluded so far, and remove obstacles for operators to provide EU-wide toll services. This would ensure equal treatment of all vehicles – passenger cars and heavy goods vehicles – and better services to users related to payment of tolls, especially for cross-border traffic. It will also represent a major step in delivering on our low emission strategy adopted last summer.

The German toll plans show us the problems we have in Europe today. First, the Commission seems to have problems applying the same yardstick to large Member States as it does to small ones. As a reminder: In Europe, the strength of the law really still applies and not the law of the stronger. Second: Following the submission to the Bundestag, Commission President Juncker personally announced in May 2015 that the toll would be checked due to considerable doubts under European law. In September 2016, the Commission decides to refer Germany to the European Court of Justice, and an agreement is surprisingly announced on November 3rd. Commissioner, what has changed? I still pay more with the same car on the same route, just because I have an Austrian license plate, regardless of the emission class. Discrimination remains discrimination. Third: Although Transport Minister Dobrindt deserves another European thistle in his collection, I would also like to break a lance for the German approach. If there is a European solution in the course of the revision of the Eurovignette Directive, then national taxes must go down. But if - as in the present case - only the neighboring countries should bear the relief for German taxpayers, then that is not acceptable. The Commission is called upon to watch.

But you must now represent what was ultimately bagged at the top level - between Mr Juncker and Mrs Merkel - in order to smoke a pipe of peace within the Federal Government, within the CDU and the CSU, and at least one problematic area, namely the foreigner toll to clear away. Nevertheless, Commissioner, the fact remains that the questions that Mrs Schmidt has just asked are still on the table. I would like to remind you that at the beginning of this period, when this proposal was on the table, we spoke to each other repeatedly. We have discussed all these components that they would ultimately still not contribute to making the whole thing that began as a foreigner toll on the part of the CSU in the end in conformity with European law.

I have an article here, of course you can't see it down there. But it says: Together against the toll. This is an article from Lower Saxony and the Netherlands in the border area in common. It is the case that our state government - I come from this part of Germany - is totally against introducing this toll. It is like this: we have a Euregio region right now in the border area with the Netherlands. It was deliberately set up in order to have cross-border traffic to work. There are many people who live in the Netherlands and work in Lower Saxony. In Lower Saxony there are more jobs, so there are more people there who can fill the jobs. This is being massively undermined. There is too little public transport, you have to rely on the car and that means that only some people pay and others don't. It is also the case that with the German toll, if you have an environmentally friendly car - which is basically nothing bad, Euro 6 - you can even earn money from the toll. Mr Dobrindt is still saying today: The Germans no longer pay. That means: who will pay for it then? From a German point of view, the question is of course: Is there enough income at all? Isn't that a zero-sum game? But we have to discuss that in Germany. In general, I actually think that this principle of user pays, polluter pays, is of course good. It would be best if we had no road tax at all, everywhere in all European countries, and only paid whenever you were driving. That would be the fairest and the best. Of course, that is not possible at the moment, because we cannot simply say: Everyone must abolish the vehicle tax. Only, what we have on the table now is actually not a good blueprint.

The Commission said again: this is anti-European. It was introduced anyway. Now Alexander Dobrindt comes with the third attempt. I always say: mistakes make one smart.

First: There are toll systems in many European member states, so we can introduce a toll system in Germany too. Second: What we are doing with the toll in Germany is exactly what has always been prescribed by the Commission and Parliament for financing infrastructure at European level, namely that the user pays. Third: the amount of the toll. This is based on the pollutant emissions. Well, you and the Greens should actually be happy, dear Mr Cramer, that that is the criterion for the amount of the toll. And now to the alleged discrimination. I cannot see them, and the Commissioner rightly said: every user of our German autobahns should pay in future, and I emphasize: every user - regardless of their nationality. The tax issue has also been raised. The reduction of road tax is a matter for the Member States. In Austria there is also the commuter allowance. There, too, tax breaks are provided for drivers driving in Austria. That's fine. That’s okay with us. One last word about our Austrian friends. Dear colleagues, when I drive from Munich to Bolzano at the weekend, I only pay around 40 euros for road use. I have to pay the Austrian ten-day vignette, I pay for the Europabrücke, I pay the Italian toll. So if I compare that with our ten-day vignette, which costs from 2.50 euros to a maximum of 20 euros, then it's almost a bargain.

I hope that this debate has been as useful for you as it has been for me. Let me once again reassure you that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will ensure that there is no discrimination based on nationality. For now, we will have to wait for the outcome of the vote in the German Bundestag on the PkW-Maut and the vehicle tax. When this has taken place, the Commission will assess the law and will take a final decision on the case. I would like just to stress that currently the infringement procedure is not closed, but on hold, to allow time for revision of the law. This practice has been used before in different cases and I see no reason why it should not be used in this case.  Let me reply to some of your many questions and concerns. Is the Commission satisfied with the outcome? The Commission strongly favours road-charging in line with the ‘user and polluter pays’ principle. There is no doubt about that. Therefore it is positive that Germany is moving towards road-charging for passenger cars as many other Member States have already done in the past. It is also positive that the German authorities agreed to amend their legislation as requested by the Commission. This should ensure a fair treatment of EU citizens and should incentivise the use of cleaner vehicles, but, at this point, I cannot speculate on the final outcome of the law. The Commission will only be able to comment after the law has been presented and confirmed.  As far as the questions relating to the European Court of Justice are concerned, let me explain that the aim of infringement cases is to bring national legislation into line with EU law. It is not the aim, per se, to bring Member States to the European Court of Justice. But also let me stress once again that the Commission will not close the infringement procedure until German legislation has been satisfactorily amended in accordance with EU law. I would also like to say very clearly that all infringement procedures are managed by the Commission in the collegial manner. The PkW-Maut procedure is no exception.  Regarding the Commission apparently changing its position, allow me to comment on that as well. The Commission did not change its position at any stage of the process. The infringement case was launched based on the identification of very clear breaches of EU law. The political understanding which was reached between Minister Dobrindt and me in December specifically addresses these same breaches. I would like to underline that the Commission always, and consistently, acts as the guardian of the Treaties.  You also speculated that the talks with Germany were kept secret. Infringement cases are matters strictly between the Commission and the Member States in question. It is usual practice for the Commission to have bilateral discussions with Member States in order to find solutions and Germany is no exception here. But let me say that the Commission has been as transparent as possible in its proceedings, including with public statements. When taking further steps in the infringement procedures, this was also publicly announced and, on the day of the political understanding, this was announced in a press conference by Mr Dobrindt and myself. I was very clear in that press conference about the position of the Commission.  Let me also stress that, in the absence of EU legislation on charging and vehicle taxation for passenger cars, we have to ensure that Article 18 of the Treaty, on non-discrimination, is respected. As I said earlier, we believe that one way to avoid discrimination is to apply charges and taxes based on different criteria, for instance on environmental performance and the infrastructure use of vehicles. This is precisely what we expect from the new German law.  And what about the claims made by neighbouring Member States? I am very attentive to the voices of Member States. I have been listening to them and this underlines the need to establish, as soon as possible, an EU-wide system for road-charging. I am glad to say that we have already taken many of your comments on board and they will be presented soon. I am also aware that the Committee on Transport and Tourism is preparing a resolution on the PkW-Maut, which will be voted in plenary in March. I look forward to seeing the resolution and hope that the debate today has been informative in this regard. Before I conclude, please allow me to restate what is at the heart of our forthcoming road initiatives. We want to take decisive steps towards decarbonisation, promoting a well—functioning, fair, social and efficient internal market, favouring innovation, digital solutions and investments. Any debate on road-charging has to be placed in this perspective. I can only hope that I can count on your support for an EU—based tolling system.

The new proposal, which is the result of a compromise between the German government and the European Commission, is better than the original one, but in my opinion it does not remove the basic objection, which is discrimination against motorway users who are foreigners.

Today we produce 2.5 billion – billion – bytes of data per day. That is, as someone once put it, four Eiffel Towers of Blu-ray discs per day, so the fundamental question for us tonight is really how we should deal with it, and the Cloud Initiative is part of the answer to this question. The Communication proposed the creation of an inclusive, European, open science cloud, deploying an efficient European data infrastructure to address such enormous data flows and opening up the user base to the public sector and industry. As Commissioner for research, science and innovation, I have followed very closely the work of this House and it culminated with the adoption of the report in front of us today.  Let me say a word of gratitude to the Chair, Jerzy Buzek, for stepping up as a rapporteur, and to Mr Boni and Ms Maydell for their work in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO). I knew from the beginning that the contribution of this Parliament would be a valuable support for our strategy for an open and trusted cloud-based data environment geared to the scientific community.  We are now deeply committed to engaging with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that the European Cloud Initiative can achieve its objectives. We are now discussing sustainable funding and implementation instruments with the Member States, research infrastructures, scientific communities and other key players. But let me assure you that we are here to tell you that your advice will be followed, that the Commission has already started to implement the initiative very much along the lines that you suggest.  First, on the European Open Science Cloud the Commission is preparing a roadmap for governance and financing to be presented to, and discussed with, the Member States in the course of 2017. Our aim is very simple. We want our 1.7 million European scientists to have the best services for text and data mining, the best data management plans and the best training programmes. We made open data the default in Horizon 2020, starting in 2017. In other words, we kind of transformed an exception into a rule simply because we intend and we believe that the Commission should lead by example. We will fund a pilot project on the European Science Cloud to ensure that the governance in the European Open Science Cloud is truly representative of European science, that it create synergies amongst existing and future initiatives of this kind.  Over the year, we will do more. We will define a governance board before the end of 2017 and we will work on making all our research data fair; findable, so scientists can identify each piece of data in a unique way; accessible, so it can always be obtained freely; interoperable, because science is today at the intersection of disciplines; and reusable, because you cannot lose important data after you have used it, you have to be able to use it in different disciplines at different times. So if we want better research, if we want better science and if we want better innovation, it is essential to be able to set these fair principles of data as the global standard, so we all speak to same language and we can advance in science.  After addressing you on the Science Cloud, let me now give you some information about the European data infrastructure, a European high performance computing strategy under development with Member States and European industry. This includes a pooling of the necessary investments at all levels to create a world-class pan-European high performance computing and big data ecosystem by 2023.  We want this ecosystem to be built on two exascale computers. That means a billion operations per second, which is basically one thousand times faster than today’s supercomputers. The Commission agrees that the take-up of high performance computing services by businesses, consumers, public administrations and scientific sectors requires seamless user-friendly access with appropriate levels of data protection, security and services to ensure trust and confidence in their use. I believe the key for the future in terms of data is about exactly these two principles: trust and confidence.  And so in this context, on 10 January last, the Commission adopted the Communication on Building a European Data Economy. That deals with additional big data issues. It advocates reducing barriers to the free flow of data. It looks into questions of ownership, access to data, liability in the context of data-driven processes and autonomous systems. It puts emphasis on measures necessary to ensure an open and competitive economy without unjustified lock-in effects. As regards widening the benefits of the European Cloud Initiative to industry, the Commission is considering several proposals on the supply and demand side and on the extension to SMEs.  Let me finish by reiterating that the Commission is fully committed with you to supporting science, industry and public authorities in Europe, access to world-class data infrastructures and cloud-based services as they become the decisive factors for success in this digital era. In a recent visit to Heidelberg I saw how the Institute of Bioinformatics generates more than EUR 1.3 billion per year of value just by having made one very simple choice: scientific information freely available to the global science community.

First of all, the initiative should deal with what the sector is willing to do and wants to do. Second of all, it has to have a regional approach: newer Member States also have to have a key role in the discussions in bringing forward this initiative. Third, we need European legislation to guarantee the free flow of data. We want the free flow of data to be the fifth freedom in Europe.

As the benefits of cloud computing are key to sustainable growth, job creation and research, it is important to reduce the fragmentation of digital infrastructures, ensure proper governance and funding for the European cloud. The development of 5G technology and the new rules to be established by the European Electronic Communications Code should make the European cloud for open science more attractive, providing high-quality internet services and new, high-quality infrastructure.

I call for a strong signal from the European Parliament on this European Cloud Initiative. I would like us to be able to say: we are “proud of the Cloud”. Because it is crucial for our international competitiveness that Europe has an ultra-modern digital infrastructure as soon as possible. That is actually a no-brainer when you consider that all sectors of the economy are digitizing. Data flows are growing explosively due to the internet of things. When we consider that 80 percent of the data that is now stored has been collected in the past two years, you can see how fast that will go. This initiative bridges the gap between data and digitization, especially through the Open Science Cloud. By seizing this opportunity, we can create additional growth and jobs. The Open Science Cloud will give millions of scientists in Europe, regardless of national borders or specific research areas, access to a lot of new data that they currently cannot easily access. But of course other users should also be able to benefit from the Open Science Cloud. Companies must have cheap and easy access to big data, which enables them to develop new innovative products. By using the cloud, they can reduce their IT costs by an average of 20 to 50 percent. So, our digital infrastructure must be of the highest quality and I am pleased that the Commission is committed to three critical areas: supercomputers, high-speed connections and mass storage of data. I am particularly pleased with the billion euros that the Commission is making available for quantum research, because this new generation of supercomputers will be able to handle all current computers. We must ensure that Europe remains in the lead and I am pleased that the Council is also taking this seriously.

The same applies to access: there are access problems because we do not have this capacity within the European Union. This project that is presented today is an ambitious project, but for it to work to its fullest, it is necessary, first of all, that the system be kept in the public domain, guaranteeing the use and access to the whole community, from researchers to small and medium-sized companies and other industry sectors; second, to ensure data portability and interoperability; thirdly, to protect personal and research data under the legislation we already have and not to give up even a millimeter. The European cloud initiative is a fundamental project for the digital society, but we cannot allow private interests to overlap and, therefore, we can even end public-private partnerships.

Of course, we also need a cloud computing compliance control catalog system in order to set standards here that will enable us to eliminate the mistrust and the crisis of confidence that exists in this area. We need a European cloud seal of approval that ensures data storage by European cloud providers also in European data centers and the full source code is accordingly available in Europe.

Secondly, principles: we need a much more secure cloud and we need to implement the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and privacy protection.

Thirdly, cooperation of all partners, because I think it is very important to involve scientists, to involve universities, to involve business and to involve citizens. Fourthly, we need to promote this solution because there are many mental barriers, including in our universities among our scientists.

I thank the Commission and all the colleagues for all the facts and figures and materials that we got on this Article 16(3) report. There are a lot of positive numbers in terms of growth and jobs. We support 150 000 startups. We have the creation of more than 500 000 jobs. This is substantial, and we also see a real shift from the infrastructure – roads and roads, bridges and bridges – of the last period to a knowledge-driven economy, to applied science, ICT, the green economy and social cohesion.  This renewed policy definitively leads to more local and European added value. We see commitments in the social field, especially for younger people to bring them to a job. The ex-ante conditionalities we have formulated lead to a more integrated policy and a better structured and targeted result. We initiated a package of simplification synergies with other funds and performance-based budgeting. It was something new in this House. The practical reflection and the relation with the European Semester is established. Cohesion concerns three-fourths of the country-specific recommendations, and we made a performance framework as an example, as I said, of this performance-based budgeting.  And on this basis we had studied and debated, I asked the Commission to come with three points of action. First, a cohesion master plan rescheduling the 2014-2020 period on the basis of the approvals of the operational programmes and the consequences for payments in the next years. N+3 has not helped to speed things up, and the austerity on the national level brought serious constraints in the co-financing. We need a new payment plan until 2023. I ask you to include three aspects in this cohesion master plan: taking away the hindrances to the expenditure in the Member States; clarifying the effects of the late start-up in the 2017-2023 period, not having this great backlog of bills in the next years to come; and clarifying the effects of the late start for the next years: N+3 will lead to performance payments in the years until 2023. Does this materially extend the period 2014-2020? Will the experience of 2014-2016 be repeated? Member States were still working to finalise the programmes and came with very late agreed programmes for the new period. Let us learn from these consequences. I can just mention two other points. In Bratislava, the informal meeting on cohesion had a very positive assessment on how we have changed our methods, but there was also a proposal, an initiative from you, Commissioner, to present another way of communication, to come forward with a new communication plan. On the communication plan, let the European star shine, I mean the projects and those people in it. My last point is territorial cohesion. I want to underline this smart specialisation approach and the wish of Parliament in my report to come forward with a bigger envelope in the total cohesion amount for this cross-regional and cross-country cooperation.

Just last year we adopted a similar resolution on accelerating the implementation of cohesion policy. Three years have now passed since the start of the new programming period and we are still seeing delays. They have resulted in significant setbacks to project implementation at local, regional and national level, as well as a considerable decrease in payment appropriations compared to last year. We are concerned that this situation will lead to high levels of decommitments in the years to come. It also calls into question the goals and targets of cohesion policy and the smooth implementation of all the projects and operational programmes. While new requirements, such as those on thematic concentration and financial management, ensure increased performance they have also slowed down the implementation process. With this in mind, we underline the importance of simplification. We also encourage the Commission to increase flexibility in relation to the priorities in its operational programmes and to improve coordination between European structural and investment funds and other financial instruments, particularly the European Fund for Strategic Investments. We welcome the support provided through the Taskforce for Better Implementation but we believe more can be done to assist the managing authorities and speed up implementation.  The Regional Development Committee therefore calls on the Commission to present an implementation action plan in the first quarter of 2017. This should assess the cause of the current delays, and it should be drawn up in close cooperation with the Member States, with the aim of accelerating the implementation of operational programmes. The Regional Development Committee wants to know how the Commission will increase flexibility and avoid decommitments. This is the first part of our question. Secondly, how will the Commission ensure the full implementation of the payment plan by 2023? Thirdly, we are asking how the Commission will increase technical assistance for the managing authorities. We ask the Commission to come forward with the solution to these issues in the Cohesion Forum and the 7th Cohesion Report. We urge the Commission to address these questions and deliver an implementation action plan in order to speed up the implementation of cohesion policy for this period. We hope that the lessons learned from these delays can inform the debate on the future European structural and investment funds post-2020. Bearing in mind the importance of this debate, we need to follow the situation with regard to implementation in the current planning period, and it is extremely important to encourage Member States to take special measures to improve implementation, otherwise we will have a not-very-successful period, which will lead to more debates concerning the future of the core of cohesion policy and the core results of the policy.

Regarding the objective of maximising the contribution of European Structural and Investment Funds, I would like to highlight two issues of particular concern. One is the serious concern and disappointment of EMPL about the late adoption of the European Social Fund operational programmes due to the considerable novelties introduced for the 2014-2020 period, which has led to administrative difficulties despite efforts for simplification, thus bringing about the urgent need for both the Member States and the Commission to accelerate the implementation of operational programmes.

I would like to thank the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development for this oral question. Thanks to Mrs. Mihaylova. I would also like to thank Mr van Nistelrooij for his own-initiative report on the impact of cohesion policy and the way forward. Your comments, of all, are very important to us. As you know, the Working Group for Better Implementation is working hard and will continue to work for the period 2014-2020. Also, cross-border cooperation, to which Mr van Nistelrooij referred, is very close to my soul and we will come in the coming months to show a study on the impact of these cross-border policies. I think that these studies are very important, at a time when we are trying to show that we want to build links between countries, and not walls that separate the citizens of the European Union. As for the oral question, it comes, I think, at the right time. A number of Members of Parliament expressed concern about delays in investment through cohesion funds. Of course I understand these concerns you have expressed. I, for my part, have repeatedly expressed it to the Member States, because cohesion policy is, as you know, the European Union's main investment force. As Mr van Nistelrooij points out in his report, cohesion policy investment is now needed, more than ever, to boost growth and create jobs, reduce disparities between regions, and address a personalized to the specific needs of all our regions, in which 500 million citizens live. But let me assure you that this is exactly what is happening on the ground, where it is needed and where it really matters. The value of the selected projects, which are currently being implemented, gives us a clear picture of what cohesion policy really does. So far, more than € 176 billion has already been invested in the real economy in 2014-2020, which will soon be reflected in payments made by the European Union to Member States. This is exactly what happened in 2007-2013. More than 315,000 projects are underway in all regions of the European Union, providing support for 140,000 businesses, tens of thousands of households that will benefit from access to broadband, more than 8.5 million citizens who will enjoy appropriate wastewater facilities, improved infrastructure for thousands of researchers and - we work closely with Commissioner Moedas in this regard - new schools for thousands of students in the European Union. We have many examples of projects that are a symbol for the European Union. I would not like to draw your attention to them, because I know that in every region, in every Member State, you have examples of this kind. I believe that the success of cohesion policy investments should not be quantified by how many invoices are sent to Brussels and paid, but rather by how the programs are actually implemented on the ground. I agree with Mr van Nistelrooij, because, as I have said many times, quality must prevail over speed and the results must be good in terms of absorption, but we do not do absorption just for the sake of absorption. We want concrete, quality projects that respond ex ante to conditionalities, to respond to structural reforms, to make this transition you were talking about, from infrastructure to research, development, competitiveness, supporting small and medium enterprises, which is the column the backbone of any economy. With regard to your report, the Commission welcomes and appreciates, as I said, the opinion of Mr van Nistelrooij, and we want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to further reform this cohesion policy so that it becomes more effective by strengthening support. towards the knowledge-based economy, by creating tools such as the performance framework, preconditions for efficient investment, e-Cohesion, for the designation of authorities that ensure the regularity of expenditure and guarantee legal certainty. However, we must remember the responsibility of the Member States. After all, it is a shared responsibility. It is up to the Member States and regions to make use of these possibilities that the European Commission makes available. They are primarily responsible for selecting and implementing projects. Of course we need to work together to strengthen administrative capacity. As I said, in many cases, administrative capacity is more important than money, because, look, we are in a situation where we have money in Brussels, but we do not have contracted projects, quality projects and adequate administrative capacity. Thank you very much. I wish I had more time, but I want to assure you that we are closely monitoring the implementation of the programs in the 2014-2020 programming period, to ensure that payments are in line with commitments. I agree with you that I have made a big mistake in recent years, because I have not communicated enough about what cohesion policy has done, how it has changed the lives of citizens for the better, and thus I have ignored all attacks on the European Union and we have reached this situation, where everything that is bad comes from Brussels and everything that is good comes from the Member States.

We must take better care of the synergy between various funds, better identification of the spending targets and removal of further administrative barriers to access to these funds for local governments and small and medium-sized enterprises. As responsible for drafting the opinion of the Transport Committee, I would particularly like to highlight the role of ESIF in the infrastructure building process. Without a shadow of a doubt, it can be said that without these funds it would be impossible to complete the TEN-T network in its final shape.

However, the late implementation of that policy will harm not just certain projects, but our entire image in the Union. Therefore, a grand master plan is needed. Firstly, Member States are lagging behind in the schedule. We should explore the possibility of extending the programme period for some operational programmes. We should explore the benefits of having a monofund, keeping the same share of different funds, but operating under a single rule book. This would cut red tape and increase the absorption rate. Last, but not least, managing authorities should go to the beneficiaries, not the other way around.

Lambert van Nistelrooij's report gives us the chance to take a look at the current state of cohesion policy and what needs arise for us, how we can and must react to challenges in the future. One thing is clear to all of us: we have to be very careful with cohesion policy, with the tax money that is available to us. I believe that Parliament did that by negotiating the legal framework and thus also significantly reforming cohesion policy. We have urged, together with the Commission, to implement results-orientation. We said we want to focus the money we have on a few priorities. We made sure that the local partners were involved in the entire work. The operational programs have now been installed and project work begins. But we also have to make sure that we communicate carefully. After all, how often do local citizens not even know that the European Union is supporting them financially in many projects in their immediate neighborhood? We have to talk about it if we want citizens to support the added value that the European Union brings to them. How many of the many young people to whom we have given work through our youth initiative have given qualifications, then know that it is the Europeans who support it to have?Of course, we need flexibility for unexpected challenges.But I believe we have to find a balance between the challenges and the objectives of the cohesion policy itself, namely social, economic and territorial cohesion.Financial instruments in the right place and at the right time can be well suited to pursuing these goals.But they are not a panacea and cannot be used everywhere and for everything.The European Parliament has to weigh that up again and again and decide, for the benefit of all European citizens, for the development of all European regions.We should support that in this report by Mr Lambert von Nistelrooij.I think we are on the right track for future cohesion policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 460, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Branislav Škripek", "mepid": "124927", "text": "for the ECR Group. - Mr President, the Cohesion Fund has been a welcome help for the Eastern Bloc countries for years.

I am very pleased that this report makes a very strong link between cohesion policy and the European Semester. Country-specific recommendations, structural reforms and investment must go hand in hand. In some European countries, the many years of use of European funds have unfortunately not led to the desired success, and this is often because too little reform has been done. Investing in European jobs and growth will only pay off if the foundations are in order, if Member States take their responsibility to reform their economies and their labor markets. If necessary, the operational programs should be adapted in the future precisely to bring them into line with the country-specific recommendations. I would like to hear from the Commissioner what her opinion is on this. Then a point about the delays in the implementation of the operational programs. In fact, this is about the problem of payments that is now re-emerging, and about the prevention of problems after 2020, with the new cohesion policy. The European Commission must very quickly come up with an action plan for tackling the payment ceilings, in order to avoid an increasing payment backlog at the end of the current programming period. Above all, we must also learn from the past with a view to the future. So let us all, Commission, Parliament and Council, ensure that the legislative process for the adoption of the next multiannual financial framework is now completed in good time.

In our view, both reports are not bad, but they both show the same bad trend: very high and vague, vague hopes for 'new forms of flexibility' between priorities and between operational programs. We have reason to suspect that this could lead to a pumping of funds into more investment-intensive but less cohesion-related projects. The same goes for the great admiration for the possibilities of financial instruments. These instruments run the risk that the funds allocated to them may not become real investments at all, but remain in the financial sector. And the fact that there are delays in launching at least a third of the Structural Funds programs should not be a basis for justifying such 'innovation' here.

There are several aspects that can be shared, such as the clear criticism of the EFSI, the importance of the absence of data on the effects and results produced by financial instruments or the weak link between these and the general objectives of the European Union. The parties are also positive about the need to strengthen administrative capacities and the quality of spending. I welcome the acceptance of one of our amendments, which underlines that in the future there is a need for a faster absorption of the available funds but with a more balanced progression of expenditure during the programming cycle. This is also to avoid the frequent use of retrospective or coherent projects, often aimed at avoiding automatic decommitment at the end of the programming period. However, there are two very critical issues, namely the close link of cohesion policy with the European Semester and the mention of structural reforms, subject to possible modification of the operational programs of the Member States in the post 2020. This is also important because the reform support program structural reforms will subtract EUR 142 million from cohesion policy to be used for structural reforms. With respect to the delays in cohesion policy, the late conclusion of the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 and the late adoption of the regulations on the European Structural and Investment Funds are unfortunately known, which in turn slowed down the process of implementing the agreements partnership and operational programs. It should be noted that some regions only saw their operational program approved in October and some even in December 2015. It must be admitted, however, that several delays stem from Member States and regions. These need to strengthen their administrative capacity and demonstrate the real usefulness of the projects that are implemented. Here too we find the negative aspect given by structural reforms and their specific weight on the shoulders of citizens. Not to mention that there are open questions that require urgent answers. Who are responsible for the delays in the designation of managing, certifying and audit authorities, resulting in delays in the submission of payment applications? Who is responsible for the dizzying acceleration of payments in 2016, almost nine years after the start of programming? Is it only useful to avoid disengagement? We are in favor of a strong and severe criticism of absurd rules such as the Stability Pact and structural reforms, but we are in favor of a Europe of citizens and solidarity.

The thematic concentration, designed to avoid the sprinkling of funds, abandons rural and peri-urban areas in favor of large metropolises. The administrative complexity inherent in the bureaucracy discourages many beneficiaries and project leaders from resorting to European funds. Finally, the introduction of ex ante criteria conditions the allocation of these structural funds to the implementation of ultraliberal austerity policies in the Member States.

The funds are committed but not channeled directly to the real economy. The second obstacle is the poor performance of the European Social Fund and the Youth Employment Initiative. If the numbers gave jobs, then it would not be youth unemployment at 45%.

What is certain is that we need sustainable jobs for young people after education or apprenticeship and this must be done immediately.

Reflection on the future of regional policy should take greater account of the fact that cohesion policy is at the same time a victim and a better ally of the territories, which with their specific characteristics determine its implementation. Giving proper prominence to projects carried out through the structural funds is important because it brings citizens closer to European policies and encourages other administrations through the exchange of good practices. However, there is a need to evolve along two lines: flexibility and simplification. It is not possible to follow only the logic of respecting the zero point rules.

Delays in the designations of managing authorities translate into delays in interim payments which, as of 30 November 2016, were well below what was initially expected.

However, our concerns go further and also concern the search for causes. The local and national capacities to implement effective and timely policies appear to be different. Among the main factors that have determined this disparity, above all, those of a purely regional nature: the availability of human capital, the innovative entrepreneurial capacity, the quality of local institutions.

We also have to do something else, which is to promote synergies. I am the rapporteur for the Juncker Plan of the European Fund for Strategic Investments. It is essential that there is an articulation between this Fund, the Juncker Plan and the Structural Investment Funds, namely the cohesion policy funds. I give you another piece of information: as of January 31, 2017, 127 management authorities were still to be appointed out of a total of 564 management authorities. This is unacceptable! 127 unmanaged management authorities? Whose fault is this non-appointment? Without the appointment of these authorities, there will be no payments and it is essential that the amounts of the European Union budget and these funds reach the economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 479, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "Louis-Joseph Manscour (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124725", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner, with a budget of 351 billion euros for the period 2014-2020, cohesion policy constitutes the main expenditure item of the European Union and allows the realization of many crucial projects for the development of our regions. However, the late conclusion of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the complexity of the management rules for the Structural Funds have resulted in many delays in the adoption of operational programs. As you know, the late implementation of these programs runs the risk of automatic decommitment, a regrettable event when many regions, still hard hit by the crisis, have a real need for this funding. The mid-term review of the MFF offers an opportunity to simplify both the management and accessibility of funds and improve their efficiency.

Loss of these funds would therefore be a real blow for local economic growth in communities. In my region, Greater Manchester’s programmes for supporting people into work are underpinned by European money. Since early 2014, its Working Well pilot programme has so far engaged 4 000 residents who are on employment and support alliance to help overcome their barriers to work. The initiative will run until 2020 and is reliant on GBP 12 million yet to be received from the EU to help a further 15 000 who are on out—of—work benefits or in low—paid work. Brexit provokes many questions, including whether the UK Government will replace EU funds lost to the regions beyond 2020. It is imperative that Theresa May presents us with a long-term commitment to secure investments at a local level.

I am very glad that, despite the many criticisms I heard, it is clear we in this House all care about cohesion policy. As Mr Zeller and many of you put it, this is the most visible policy we have that has changed people’s lives over the past 40 years since the creation of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). I think this debate could not be more timely. I heard a lot of comments about delays. They were referring to the limited amount of Commission payments but, in fact, spending and project selection rates in 2016 are similar to 2009 levels in the previous programming period. Once all the designated authorities are in place, I am sure we will have invoices and we will have a flow of reimbursement of contributions by Member States which are now paying from their national budgets. As I said, the reality on the ground is completely different. We have 315 000 projects already up and running, raising investments to over EUR 107 billion. We have action plans for all operational programmes and, as I said, it is not just about quantity, it is also about quality. The recent reformed cohesion policy, to which the European Parliament contributed so much, introduced a range of tools that made this policy more effective. Of course we know it is sometimes hard to accept the preconditions, but they are very important for efficient investment. That is why, in the last parliamentary term, you approved this new reformed cohesion policy. I am convinced that we can do even better. When we spoke here before the Committee on Regional Policy the key word was simplification, but when I go to the Committee on Budgetary Control the key word is control, and we have to find the right balance because both are right. We need simplification and, at the same time, we need better control over how taxpayers’ money is used. You are right, honourable Members, about simplification but I would like to tell you, Mr Fernandes and Mr Buda, that shared management also means the sharing of responsibilities between the Commission and Member States. You know very well, for instance, Mr Buda, that in many Member States, including the country we both know best, there are many requirements that are not EU requirements. It is also about red tape, gold-plating, adding requirements at national level, and we also have to convince Member States about simplification for the beneficiaries. As you said, and you are right, the beneficiaries should be our ambassadors – the presidents of regions and the mayors – because this is the only policy which is working hand in hand with local citizens’ representatives. So please spread the word among your colleagues in this House. Maybe you come from a town where people do not know how many things were done by the European Union. I do not know how many people in Naples know that the metro was funded by the European Union. I do not know how many people in Athens know that the metro there was funded by the European Union. And, by the way, provide us please with all your requirements because we are ready to address them. We pushed hard on the Greek authorities to accelerate the implementation of the metro in Thessaloniki. I think it is unacceptable for a country in which we have invested EUR 80 billion since 1981, where everything – the provision of thousands of schools, hospitals, highways and bridges – has been accomplished with European money, then to say that cohesion policy does not exist. In Greece, 75% of all public investment is provided by the European Union, so we have to be honest with ourselves. Look at the picture: how was Greece before 1981 and how is Greece now? (Inaudible interjection by Mr Marias) Please send me a written letter. I would just like to say that the cohesion policy works, it delivers and it really changes people’s lives. I am very glad to hear that we need technical assistance but we cannot give technical assistance without knowing the requirements of the Member States. We have so many European instruments which are not used by the Member States and they do not ask for these instruments to be activated, which are subsidised 100% by the Commission We have very few requirements from the Member States and from the regions. We are here to help. We are here to improve this policy, and I am here to fight for this policy post-2020. All the political groups know that we are already working together with the Committee of the Regions, and with you, for a better and more effective European policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 482, "date": "2017-02-15.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  Thank you very much indeed for making an effort to answer the questions.

Let me highlight three points.  The first point is about the effect of this kind of debate. As Ms Maletić said, we had already had a resolution before, and there was not really a follow-up. Tomorrow this House will agree on a resolution. In the resolution is a clear request, without any doubt, and you could also hear it today, that you want to have a master plan on acceleration. And this is not a theoretical thing. The last subject we debated was about the cloud, wasn’t it, the science cloud? But this is not a cloud, this is an agreement between the Commissioner and Parliament to come with an acceleration plan. And this means that you look and tell us honestly: what does it mean if you start three years later? What is the effect on bills? Because we don’t want to have again the backlog of bills that we had last time. It was a shame for Parliament and the other European institutions.  My second point: you heard several contributions about, as they say in Germany, Bürgernähe, it means closeness to the citizens. If the Member States don’t like to show that they could perform better with European money, go directly to those who act in the programmes, the youngsters who get these qualifications, etc. It was Juncker, exactly in the place where you sit now, who said we need the story of normal people, the volunteers, but also those in real programmes. So let the star shine, I mean with those who really feel that Europe is important for them, and bypass the Member States. So do not just say it but modernise and change your communication policy. My third point – it’s late but not too late – I don’t want to have these type of debates repeated and repeated. Maybe in the omnibus we can find a little loophole to get some legal restrictions so that we can throw them out, for instance, in the interest of this better communication. Thank you very much for being here so late, all of you.

In some Member States, more than 60% of investments were financed from this source. They seem to have fulfilled their role, especially during the fiscal crisis. Today we should consider how to make them more effective and add value. A fundamental problem in many Member States is high unemployment, especially among young people with mismatched qualifications. Currently, however, infrastructure problems are often a barrier to finding employment. Therefore, it would be good to think how to effectively reconcile the needs related to the development of infrastructure necessary for a modern economy, e.g. increasing the availability of broadband Internet in rural areas, with the need to adapt education and training systems to the requirements of a modern economy. The situation on the labor market is changing very dynamically and we must find appropriate response mechanisms also at the EU level. It is necessary to simplify and make the availability of funds from the funds more flexible. The changes introduced in recent years have had quite the opposite effect, for example delays in the actual implementation of cohesion policy. It is good for the Commission, the Council and the governments to learn the lessons of the current programming period and not to make similar mistakes again.
