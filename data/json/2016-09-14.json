I am pleased to welcome you, President Juncker, to the plenary again for the annual State of the European Union address. It is the moment that has become the reference point in European Union policy in recent years – a moment of certainly pause, of reflection on the work of the past year, but certainly also of the opportunity to debate and define together the guidelines in principle and the fundamental directions for the coming year. The speech has therefore become an essential part of the democratic European Union, and it is being presented today for the second time by you, Mr President of the Commission. You said last year, Mr Juncker, as President of the Commission, that the product – and I quote you – is 'a democratic recovery process'. Even if you are not a product, the wording was still correct. Because, together with the European Parliament, you brought back a bit more parliamentary democracy to our Community in 2014. This is a success in itself, and I believe that both institutions must continue along this path together. We are also certain to note, through the enormous media attention we are seeing here in this House this morning, that the State of the Union address by the President of the Commission is a very special event in the course of the year also for the European Parliament. There is no doubt that we are facing a historic challenge, if not a break, in terms of the development of our continent and the European Union. Mr President Juncker, I would like to thank President Juncker for his Two days before the summit of the 27 Heads of State or Government in Bratislava, we now have the opportunity, together with the Commission, to send out a signal, together with the Commission, of the unity of Europe that we urgently need. I know that you and your College have worked very hard over the last few weeks on your speech today. We look forward to it. I give the floor to the President of the European Commission on the State of the Union address.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr President of the Commission. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. A year ago, in September 2015, in the State of the European Union address, I noted that the state of the Union left much to be desired. There is not enough Europe, as I said at the time, in our Union and not enough Union in it. A year later, despite progress, this assessment is still valid. The European Union is not currently in top shape. Much has not changed for the better, and some suggest that we are dealing in parts with an existential crisis in the European Union. The number of areas where we meet spontaneously or not spontaneously is too large; the number of areas where we work together in solidarity is too small. Too often, exclusive national interests are given priority. So that we do not get along wrong: European integration cannot be forced at the expense of nations, the crowbar is not an instrument of European unification, Europe must not become a melting pot, a colourless, uniform integration magma. Europe thrives on its diversity. The Commission does not intend – although this is often claimed – to flatten the nation states. We are not nihilists, nor antichrists by the way, no destroyers, no destroyers – we are constructors who no longer want, but in some places, want a better Europe. Europe is not on the road to nationalisation. Europe will never and must never become a unitary state. But all too often cracks and fractures occur. Too often, convenient fragmentation arises where strenuous union is needed. This opens up spaces for galloping populism in which there can be no coexistence. Populism does not solve problems – on the contrary, populism creates problems. We must resist this! (Applause) It is more than ever time to take an honest stock: unemployment in Europe is still too high, despite the fact that 8 million new jobs were created between 2013 and today and employment is constantly rising. But social injustice remains. That is why we must work swiftly on the European pillar of social rights, and we will do so with energy and enthusiasm. Europe is not social enough – we need to change that! (Applause) Debt levels in the European Union are still too high, although deficit levels have been reduced from an average of 6.3% in 2009 to 1.9%. The Stability Pact is therefore having an effect. It must not become a flexibility pact, but must be applied with intelligent flexibility in such a way that it neither slows down nor hinders growth. The inventory also includes a look into the eyes of those who observe us from a distance. Our friends and partners around the world, all deeply deplore Brexit, are concerned about whether the British decision is the beginning of a process of undissolution of the European Union. I say here today that we respect and regret the British decision at the same time, but the European Union is not in danger of its existence. (Applause) We would be glad if the British withdrawal request were to reach us as soon as possible, so that the current growing uncertainties can be stopped ... (Applause) and so that we can reorganise our relationship with Britain, which must remain friendly. Part of this reorganisation is that only those who are committed to the free movement of persons and workers can have full access to the internal market. There will be no single market a la carte. (Applause) Our partners are increasingly confronting us with the question of whether the European Union is still willing and capable of concluding trade agreements with the rest of the world. We are the largest trading power in the world, we have concluded trade agreements with 140 countries around the world. I am not a blind fanatical free trader, but I am in favour of ensuring that we do not ignore the employment impact of trade agreements. And trade means more work, and trade means more jobs. 30 million jobs in Europe depend on exports, one in seven jobs in Europe depends on our exports to other parts of the world, and a billion more export trade volumes create 14 000 additional jobs in Europe. That is why, above all, I am strongly in favour of the trade agreement with Canada. It is the best, the most progressive trade agreement we have ever concluded. (Applause) The guarantees we need can be clarified in the various parliamentary ratification procedures, and concerns can be addressed. But there can be no renegotiation with Canada. Our Partners in the world – currently mainly in the US and China, but soon also in India and Japan – are keeping the climate change level in front of our faces. The Paris agreement on climate change – a legally binding global agreement – would not have been reached without the European Union. We were pioneers, we were drivers, we called on others to act, sometimes very full-bodied. And now? Ratify Americans and Chinese – and where are we? I urge us – only a few EU countries have done so so far – to ratify the Paris climate pact! (Applause) Any delay in ratification, or even delay, exposes us to ridicule and costs us international credibility. And our partners out there and millions of Europeans on their own continent no longer understand our decision-making procedures and how we interact with each other and with each other. We are not the United States of Europe. The speech I am making here is in no way comparable to the American President's speech on the State of the Union. Europe is more complex, more complex than state entities of the same size and therefore incomprehensible to many. But the history, the terrible history of Europe, wanted us to be as we have become. But this is no reason why we are making things even more complicated and incomprehensible than they already are. Making a committed European speech in the European Parliament requires little courage, but committed speeches on Europe must be given by everyone in their national parliaments. (Applause) To say 'yes' in Brussels and to act at home as if we had not been present at joint decision-making is the opposite of comprehensible coherence and consistency. (Applause) The citizens of Europe must no longer be fooled. You have to look them in the eye. The people of Europe are tired of the institutional show fights, they do not like the grotesque jealousies between states and institutions, and they hate the constantly repeated insinuations, half-truths and lies. People expect tangible results from Europe and their timely implementation. Mr President, colleagues, I am therefore proposing a positive agenda of concrete European actions for the next 12 months, because I believe the next 12 months are decisive if we want to reunite our Union. If we want to overcome the divisions between East and West that have opened up in recent months, if we want to show that we can be fast and decisive on the things that really matter, if we want to show the world that Europe is still a force capable of joint action, we have to get to work. I sent a letter with this message to President Schulz and Prime Minister Fico this morning. The next 12 months are the crucial time to deliver a better Europe: a Europe that protects and preserves the European way of life; that empowers and defends our citizens at home and abroad; and a Europe that takes responsibility. I am convinced the European way of life is something worth preserving. I have the impression that many seem to have forgotten what being European means. What it means to be part of this European Union, of this Union of Europeans, to remember why European nations chose to work together – to remember why crowds celebrated solidarity in the streets of Warsaw on 1 May 2004, the date of accession of this great Polish nation – Poland because is a great nation. (Applause) To remember why the European flag waved proudly in Lisboa and Porto, and in Madrid and Seville, welcoming the young democracies of Spain and Portugal into our sphere of solidarity and freedom. To remember that Europe is a driving force that can help bring about the unification of Cyprus – something on which I am supporting the two leaders of Cyprus. It has to be done and it has to be done now. (Applause) Above all, Europe means peace. It is no coincidence that the longest period of peace in written history in Europe began with the formation of the European Communities – 70 years of lasting peace in Europe, in a world with 40 active armed conflicts, which claim the lives of 200,000 people year after year. Of course we still have our differences, sometimes we fight, but we fight with words. And we settle our conflicts around the table, not in trenches. An integral part of our European way of life is our values. The values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. We Europeans can never accept – never – Polish workers being harassed, beaten up or, indeed, murdered on the streets of Essex. (Loud applause) We Europeans stood firmly against the death penalty, and we Europeans also believe in independent, effective justice systems. Effective justice systems support economic growth and defend fundamental rights. That is why the European Union promotes and defends the rule of law everywhere in Europe. (Applause) Being European means the right to have your personal data protected by strong, European laws – because Europeans do not like drones overhead recording their every move, or companies stockpiling their every mouse click. This is why Parliament, Council and Commission agreed in May this year a common European Data Protection Regulation. In Europe, privacy matters. Being European also means a fair playing field. This means that workers should get the same pay for the same work in the same place. And this is why the Commission stood behind our proposal on the Posting of Workers Directive. The internal market is not a place in which workers can be exploited or subjected to lower social standards than others. Europe is not the Wild West: it is a social market economy without social dumping. (Applause) A fair playing field also means that consumers in Europe are protected against cartels and abuses by powerful companies, and that every company, no matter how big or small, has to pay its taxes where it makes its profits. (Applause) I promised you that my Commission would fight against tax evasion, and many of you did not believe me, but that is what we are doing. We are delivering. This Commission is delivering on the fight against tax evasion. (Applause) Being European also means standing up for our steel industry. We already have 37 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures in place to protect our steel industry from unfair competition. But we need to do more, as overproduction in some parts of the world is putting European producers out of business and the noble steelworkers out of work. This is why I was in China twice this year to address the issue of overcapacity. This is also why the Commission has proposed changing the 'lesser duty rule'. We call on all Member States and on this Parliament to support the Commission in strengthening our trade defence instruments. We should not be na've free traders: we should be able to respond as forcefully to dumping as the United States of America is doing. A strong part of the European way of life that I want to preserve is our agricultural sector. The Commission will always stand by our farmers, especially when they are going through difficult times, as is the case today. Last year, the dairy sector was hit with a ban imposed by Russia. That is why the Commission mobilised EUR 1 billion in support of milk farmers to help them get back on their feet – because I will not accept that milk should be cheaper than water. Being European, for most of us, so means the euro. During the global financial crisis, the euro stayed strong and protected us from even worse instability. The euro is a leading world currency, and it brings huge, often invisible, economic benefits. Euro area countries saved EUR 50 billion this year in interest payments, thanks to the European Central Bank's monetary policy: EUR 50 billion extra that governments can and should invest in the economy, EUR 50 billion that can be used for debt reduction. And, by the way, the Five Presidents' Report on the deepening of the euro area describes the ambition which the Commission is still sticking to. I wish all this was recalled more often – everywhere in Europe where elected politicians take the floor. The European Union should not only preserve our European way of life but should also empower those living it. We need to work for a Europe that empowers our citizens and our economy. And today, both have gone digital. Digital technologies and digital communications are moving into every aspect of life: all they require is access to high-speed internet. We need to be connected. Our economy needs it. People need it. And we have to invest in that connectivity now. That is why today, the Commission is proposing a reform for our European telecommunications markets. We want to create a new legal framework that attracts and enables investments in connectivity. Businesses should be able to plan their investments in Europe for the next 20 years, because if Europeans invest in new networks and services, that means at least 1.3 million new jobs over the next decade. And connectivity should benefit everyone: that is why the Commission is proposing a fully deployed 5G across the European Union by 2025. This has the potential to create another two million jobs in the European Union. Ensuring that everyone benefits from connectivity means that it should not matter where you live or how much you earn. So we propose today to equip every European village and every city with free wireless internet access around the main centers of public life by 2020. As the world goes digital, we also have to empower our artists and creators and protect their works. Artists and creators are our crown jewels. The creation of content is not a hobby: it is a profession. I want journalists, publishers and authors to be paid fairly for their work, whether it is made in studios or in living rooms, whether it is disseminated offline or online, Whether it is published via a copying machine or hyperlinked on the web. The overhaul of Europe's copyright rules we are proposing today achieves exactly that. (Applause) Empowering our European economy means investing not just in connectivity but also in job creation. The EUR 315 billion Investment Plan for Europe, which we agreed here, has already raised EUR 116 billion in investments in its first year of operation. More than 200,000 small firms and start-ups across Europe got loans thanks to the European Fund for Strategic Investments. And now we will take it further. Today, we propose to double the duration of the fund and to double its financial capacity. With your support, we will make sure that our European Investment Fund will provide a total of at least EUR 500 billion – half a trillion – of investment by 2020, and we will work beyond that to reach EUR 630 billion by 2022. Of course, with Member States contributing, we can get there even faster. Alongside these efforts to attract private investment, we also need to create the right environment to invest in. European banks are in much better shape than two years ago thanks to our joint European efforts. Europe needs its banks, but an economy almost entirely dependent on bank credit is bad for financial stability. It is also bad for business, as we saw during the financial crisis. That is why it is now urgent that we accelerate our work on the Capital Markets Union. The Commission is putting a concrete roadmap for this on the table today. A Capital Markets Union wants to make our financial system far more resilient. It will give companies easier and more diversified access to finance. Imagine you want to establish a start-up and your bank refuses you a loan. Right now, the options are very limited. The Capital Markets Union will offer alternative, vital sources of funding to help start-ups get started – business angels, venture capital, market financing, for example. To just mention one example, our proposal on securitisation has been on the table of the co-legislators for almost a year now. It has the potential to free up to EUR 100 billion in additional finance for EU businesses, so let us, please, speed up its adoption. Our Investment Plan has worked better than anyone expected inside Europe, and now we are going to take it globally. Today we are launching an ambitious investment plan for Africa and the neighbourhood, which has the potential to raise EUR 44 billion in investments. It can go up to EUR 88 billion if Member States pitch in. This will complement our development aid and help address one of the root causes of migration. With economic growth in developing countries at its lowest level since 2003, this is crucial. The new plan will offer lifelines for those who would otherwise be pushed to take dangerous journeys in search of a better life. It has to be done. (Applause) As much as we invest in improving conditions abroad, we also need to invest in responding to humanitarian crises back home. And, more than anything, we need to invest in our young people. I cannot and will not accept that Europe is and remains the continent of youth unemployment. I cannot and will not accept that the millennials, Generation Y, might be the first generation in 70 years to be poorer than their parents. Of course, this is mainly a task of national governments (of which you are not a part, I know) but the European Union can support this effort and their efforts. We are doing this with the EU Youth Guarantee that was launched three years ago. The Commission enhanced the effectiveness and speeded up delivery of the Youth Guarantee. More than nine million young people got a job, a traineeship or an apprenticeship because of the European Union, and we will continue to roll out the Youth Guarantee across Europe, mainly focusing on apprenticeships, improving the skillset of Europeans and reaching out to the regions and young people most in need. The European Union can also contribute to helping create more opportunities for young people. There are many socially minded young people in Europe willing to make a meaningful contribution to society and help show solidarity. The word solidarity appears 16 times in the Treaties. Our European budget is living proof of financial solidarity. The euro is an expression of solidarity and our development policy is a strong external sign of solidarity. And when it comes to managing the refugee crisis, we have started to see solidarity. I am convinced much more solidarity is needed, but I also know that solidarity must be voluntary. It must come from the heart. It cannot be forced. It's not a good time. I am urging the Slovak Presidency to bridge the divergences and differences between those who are reluctant to integrate refugees in their societies and those who are convinced, as I am, that fair sharing in terms of allocation and resettlement is of the essence. (Applause) I am asking for strong and immediate action, both from Greece and the European Union, to protect what we call in French 'les enfants non-accompagnés'. If we do not protect these children, the European Union is betraying its historic values. (Applause) In the same spirit, the Commission is proposing today to set up a European Solidarity Corps. Young people across the European Union will be able to volunteer their help where it is needed most, to respond to crisis situations like the refugee crisis or the recent earthquakes in Italy. By voluntarily joining the European Solidarity Corps, these young people will be able to develop their skills and not only work but also invaluable human experience. (Applause) Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, Monsieur le Président du Conseil, une Europe qui prot ge est une Europe qui se défend, tant l'intérieur qu'é l'extérieur de son territoire. Nous devons nous défendre d'abord - et c'est une priorité absolue – contre le terrorisme. Depuis 2004, l'Europe a connu plus de trente attaques terroristes, dont quatorze au cours de l'année écoulée. Tout comme nous sommes restés solidaires dans le deuil, nous devons rester unis dans notre réponse collective. Face ce que l'homme peut faire de pire, nous devons rester fid les nous-mes, nos valeurs, nos sociétés démocratiques plurielles ouvertes et tolérantes. Nous devons montrer aux terroristes qu'ils n'ont aucune chance lorsqu'ils essaient de s'attaquer ces valeurs-l. (Applaudissements) Mais cette tolérance, qui doit étre la n'tre, ne peut se faire au détriment de notre sécurité. C'est pourquoi la Commission, d's le premier jour, a donné la priorité la sécurité. Nous avons érigé en infraction pénale le terrorisme et le retour des combattants étrangers dans toute l'Union européenne, nous avons pris des mesures rigoureuses contre l'utilisation des armes à feu et le financement du terrorisme, nous avons travaillé avec les entreprises de l'internet pour retirer du web les contenus de propagande terroriste et nous avons lutté contre la radicalisation dans les écoles et prisons en Europe. Mais il y a encore du travail faire. Nous devons savoir quels individus franchissent nos fronti éres. C'est pourquoi nous défendrons nos fronti res avec l'aide de la nouvelle Agence européenne de gardes-fronti res et de gardes-cétes. Frontex dispose déj de plus de 600 agents postés en Grace aux fronti res avec la Turquie et de plus de 100 agents en Bulgarie. Présent, les institutions de l'Union et les états membres devraient collaborer tr s étroitement pour contribuer rapidement la mise en place de la nouvelle agence. Je veux voir le déploiement, d's le mois d'octobre, d'au moins 200 gardes-fronti res et 50 véhicules supplémentaires aux fronti res extérieures de la Bulgarie. Nous défendrons aussi nos fronti res par un contr le strict de ceux qui franchiront, suivant des modalités adoptées d'ici la fin de l'année, nos fronti res. Chaque fois qu'une personne entrera dans l'Union européenne ou quittera son territoire, il y aura un enregistrement de la date, du lieu et de la raison expliquant le mouvement et le déplacement. D'ici au mois de novembre, nous proposons un syst me européen d'informations de voyage, savoir un syst me automatisé visant déterminer qui sera autorisé voyager destination de l'Europe. De cette mani ére, nous saurons qui voyage vers l'Europe avant m me que cette personne n'arrive en Europe. La sécurité des fronti éres implique également de donner la priorité l'échange d'informations et de renseignements. Cette fin, nous renforcerons Europol, notre agence d'appui aux services répressifs nationaux, en lui donnant un meilleur acc s aux banques de données et en lui octroyant les mesures supplémentaires dont elle a besoin. L encore, nous devons nous donner les moyens de nos ambitions. Une Europe qui prot ge doit aussi défendre ses intér ts au-del de nos fronti res. Les faits sont tr s clairs: le monde devient plus grand chaque jour et l'Europe plus petite chaque jour, démographiquement et économiquement. Si nous voulons garder rang et influence dans le monde, il est évident que ce n'est qu'ensemble que nous sommes et que nous resterons incontournables. Pourtant, m me si l'Europe est fiére d'etre une puissance douce, il faut dire que celle-ci ne suffit pas tant notre voisinage compliqué est de plus en plus dangereux. Regardez le conflit qui sévit en Syrie. Ses conséquences pour l'Europe sont immédiates. Maize o'est l'Union? O sont ses états membres dans les négociations en vue d'un r glement du conflit? (Applaudissements) Federica Mogherini, notre haute représentante et vice-présidente de la Commission, fait – ce n'est pas seulement mon avis – un travail des plus remarquables. Mais elle doit devenir une véritable ministre européenne des affaires extérieures, celle qui rassemblera... (Applaudissements) les forces de nos diplomaties nationales pour pouvoir peser dans les négociations internationales. C'est pourquoi j'appelle aujourd'hui à développer une stratégie européenne pour la Syrie. Federica devrait disposer d'un si'ge la table des discussions sur l'avenir de la Syrie. L'Europe, Mesdames et Messieurs, doit s'affirmer davantage. C'est particuli rement vrai pour notre politique de défense. L'Europe ne peut plus se permettre de dépendre de la seule puissance et des seules capacités militaires de pays individuels. Nous devons ensemble prendre en charge la protection de nos intéréts. Au cours des dix derni éres années, nous avons participé plus de trente missions militaires et civiles de l'Union européenne. Mais, sans structure permanente, nous ne pouvons pas agir de mani're efficace. Il faudra que nous nous dotions d'un quartier général unique au sein de l'Union européenne. Nous devons également nous orienter vers des ressources militaires communes qui, dans certains cas, rel veront de l'Union en pleine complémentarité avec l'OTAN. Plus de défense européenne ne veut pas dire moins de défense et de solidarité transatlantique.  D'un point de vue strictement économique, la mise en commun de nos ressources militaires se justifierait clairement. Suivant les formes de coopération qui sont retenues, le manque de coopération en mati re de défense co te l'Europe entre 20 et 100 milliards d'euros par an.  Ne faut-il pas faire quelque chose? Il faut prendre des mesures cet égard. Pour garantir la solidité de la défense européenne, l'industrie européenne de la défense doit faire preuve d'innovation. C'est pourquoi nous proposerons, avant la fin de l'année, la création d'un Fonds européen de la défense pour stimuler activement la recherche et l'innovation. Le traité de Lisbonne permet aux états membres qui le souhaitent de mettre en commun leur capacité de défense sous la forme d'une coopération structurée permanente. Je pense que l'heure est venue de faire usage de cette possibilité.  (Applaudissements) Monsieur le Président, le dernier point que j'aborderai a trait notre responsabilité collective. J'appelle toutes les institutions de l'Union européenne et chacun de nos états membres assumer plus de responsabilités. Nous devons en finir avec cette vieille rengaine selon laquelle le succ s est national et l'échec européen, sans quoi notre projet commun ne survivra pas. L'Europe doit étre mieux expliquée. J'ai demandé chacun des commissaires de visiter au cours des prochaines semaines les parlements nationaux pour débattre de l'état de notre union. Depuis le début de mon mandat, les commissaires se sont rendus plus de 350 fois dans les parlements nationaux. Et je veux qu'ils le fassent encore davantage maintenant, car l'Europe ne peut se construire que si elle est bien comprise, et donc mieux expliquée. Elle ne peut se construire qu'avec les etats membres, jamais contre les états membres. La Commission que j'ai l'honneur de présider se veut étre une Commission politique, ce qui donne lieu toutes sortes de fantasmes. Mais cela implique d'abord qu'elle soit une Commission qui est l'écoute, l'écoute des citoyens, l'écoute du Parlement européen, l'écoute des états membres. Nous sommes l'écoute de nos concitoyens et nous voulons l'étre plus intensément. Je lis parfois que je suis prisonnier dans le palais du Berlaymont, que je ne parle pas ceux que nous prétendons gouverner. Je veux dire ceux qui croient que je suis un sourd-muet bien payé qui ne regarde et n'écoute pas les autres, qu'ils se trompent énormément. Au cours d'une longue vie politique, j'ai parlé chaque jour, et je continue le faire, aux citoyens, c'est notre obligation tous. (Applaudissements) La Commission, comme je vous l'avais annoncé, a retiré cent propositions au cours des deux premi res années de son mandat, a diminué de 80% le nombre d'initiatives présentées par rapport aux cinq années précédentes et a lancé un réexamen en profondeur de l'ensemble de la législation. Parce que ce n'est qu'en nous concentrant sur les domaines dans lesquels l'Europe peut apporter une véritable valeur ajoutée que nous serons capables de faire de l'Europe un espace o subsidiarité et solidarité forment une intersection vertueuse.  Etre politique, pour la Commission, signifie aussi corriger les erreurs, disons, technocratiques d's qu'elles se produisent. La Commission, le Parlement et le Conseil ont décidé conjointement de supprimer les frais d'itinérance pour les téléphones mobiles. C'est une promesse que nous tiendrons, c'est pourquoi j'ai retiré un projet rédigé cet été par nos services concernant les frais d'itinérance. (Applaudissements) Ce projet évidemment partait d'une bonne intention, il était correct sur le plan technique, mais il ne correspondait pas aux promesses qui avaient été faites et d's la semaine prochaine, vous verrez un nouveau projet bien meilleur. Lorsque vous voyagez en Europe, avec votre téléphone mobile, vous devez vous sentir chez vous partout en Europe.  (Applaudissements) Enfin, prendre nos responsabilités entra ne l'obligation de répondre de nos actes devant les électeurs. C'est pourquoi je vais proposer de changer la r gle, mes yeux absurde, qui veut que les commissaires qui se présentent aux élections européennes doivent renoncer leur fonction. Les premiers ministres et les ministres dans nos états membres ne quittent pas leur poste lorsqu'ils se présentent aux élections, les commissaires ne devraient pas devoir le faire. Si nous voulons une Commission responsable et proche des citoyens, nous devons encourager les commissaires prendre rendez-vous avec la démocratie, prendre rendez-vous avec le suffrage universel.  (Applaudissements) Monsieur le Président, je suis aussi jeune que le projet européen, qui fétera ses 60 ans l'année prochaine en mars 2017 – vrai dire un peu plus égé. Je l'ai vécu, ce projet. Je me suis consacré, toute ma vie, par conviction et sans hésitation. Mon pére travaillait en Europe, car il croyait la stabilité continentale, aux droits des travailleurs et au progr s social. Il avait compris quel point la paix en Europe était précieuse et fragile, lui qui a d'faire la guerre contre sa volonté et contre la volonté de son pays. Je crois en l'Europe parce que mon pére m'a inculqué ses valeurs. Mais que transmettons-nous nos enfants en ce moment? Qu'allons-nous leur laisser en héritage? Une Union qui s'effiloche dans la désunion? Une Union qui a oublié son passé et qui n'a aucune vision pour l'avenir? Nos enfants, Mesdames et Messieurs, méritent mieux. Ils méritent une Europe qui préserve leur mode de vie, qui les défend et qui les protége. Il est temps que nous, les citoyens, les institutions, les gouvernements, prenions tous la responsabilité de construire cette Europe et de la construire ensemble.  Je sais qu'il y a débat, lorsqu'il s'agit de l'avenir de l'Europe, entre les optimistes, quelquefois béats, et les pessimistes qui doutent de tout et de son contraire au sujet de l'Europe. L'Europe a une mission chez elle et une mission dans le monde. Mais, entre le pessimisme, qui ne voit que défauts et déclin, et l'optimisme, qui voit tout en rose, il y a la volonté, la volonté de ceux qui ne désarment pas, qui ne pleurent pas sur leur propre sort, mais qui ont l'esprit le sort de ceux qui vienn. J'appelle cette volonté-l, qui a été la volonté de ceux qui nous ont précédés. J'appelle notre volonté de dépasser les différences et les clivages. L'histoire ne retiendra pas notre nom, mais nous serons jugés sur la force de notre volonté et sur la force de nos convictions. Les deux doivent étre intégrales.  L'histoire ne se souviendra pas de nous, mais elle se souviendra de nos erreurs. Ne nous rendons pas coupables d'erreurs qui mettraient fin au r ve européen. (L'Assemblée, debout, applaudit l'orateur)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, during the Brexit debate I spoke about the young generation in Great Britain and how they wanted to belong to Europe. Again today I want to speak about the young generation. They had a great summer, I have to say, as over a quarter of a million youngsters demonstrated their love of Europe this summer when they took trains with Interrail. They did not fuel mistrust; they made friends with other European youths instead. Journalists from the German weekly Der Spiegel interviewed some of these young people. One of them was a young Brit named Jamie. He said: 'yes we voted to remain and it feels terrible to be out'. For Europe's youth, Europe is the hope for a better future. A young Italian named Matteo was asked: 'Which European nationality can you not stand? Which country should not be part of the European Union?'. Listen to his answer, which was: 'none of course, what a stupid question'. This is the atmosphere among the young generation in the European Union. They want to shape a common future and this is precisely the message of Jean-Claude Junker today in his speech and the message for all of us. I thank Jean-Claude Juncker for today's speech and I thank his whole Commission for their perfect work for Europe.  (Applause) What is important now in the next twelve months? The people of Europe do not want a divided Europe. They simply want us to take care of the concerns, to work out solutions, to focus on what Europe can do better, and not to interfere everywhere. The European way of life, as Jean-Claude Juncker said, is up for debate. For us, the defence of the European way of life is linked to security. That is why: yes to a common effective exchange of data, a European entry/exit system and border security that also protects us. For us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the European way of life stands for values. We want to preserve the identity of Europe, its roots in Christianity, Judaism and the Enlightenment; we want Europe to remain as it is. For us, the European way of life stands for solidarity – for the rich to help the poor and for us not to leave Greece and Italy alone on the refugee issue. The European way of life stands for economic strength: yes to the Juncker Plan, investment incentives and yes to much more investment in innovation and research. The European way of life stands for the social market economy – finally fair taxes for all companies. That is why, by my group, I would like to express my thanks to Jean-Claude Juncker and the Commissioner responsible for the fact that we are now also using the Internet companies, the heavy-handed Internet companies, to a fair share of taxes. Thank you for that! The European way of life stands for growth. Only if we have good export opportunities, only if we export, can we provide work for the young generation in the south of the continent. That is why my group is fully convinced that it is saying 'yes' to CETA and will make that clear. The European way of life stands for sustainability. Debt and interest must be paid by our children. That's not fair! We must therefore stop making new debts. The European way of life stands for honesty. Turkey is an important partner. We want friendship with Turkey, but from our point of view full membership of the European Union cannot work. And the European way of life stands for creativity. And that's why thank you for the copyright suggestions. Anyone who is creative is the basis of prosperity in this European Union. And that is why we must protect creativity in the digital age. Perhaps, at the end of this list of the European way of life and what is important to us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, allow me to make a specific proposal, because I quoted Interrail: how about giving every European young person who turns 18 in future an Interrail ticket from the European Union so that he can experience this Europe in everyday life for three weeks? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she That is what we intend to do for the next twelve months. Now, however, we have a second debate ahead of us this week, namely the discussion in the European Council in Bratislava. I would also like to underline an appeal here, and that is the request: stop arguing! Stop cheap populism! Finally take responsibility for what you have to do for Europe! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which I would like to point out a specific example: during this parliamentary term, the Council of Ministers has held 148 legislative votes – France has abstained once and has always agreed, the Czech Republic and Poland – Poland, piS government – have only once opposed a Council of Ministers decision and otherwise always voted against it. and Italy has always agreed, never abstained and never voted against. That is why my most important request to the European Council is: take responsibility at long last, explain to the citizens what you decide in Brussels, and stop this cheap populism against Brussels! (Applause) Politicians must burn! Politicians must be convinced of what is important to them, even if resistance comes. And do you know where we can learn this enthusiasm, this burning? We can learn it from young people on this continent. The young Europeans, the Interrail generation – if I may call it that – who know the value of this common Europe and who say: let us fight for this Europe, every day! And that, ladies and gentlemen, we will do so together!

He spoke clearly about post-Brexit, relaunched the investment plan, said clear opening words about flexibility, never uttered the word austerity – and I thank him – he said clear things about combating tax evasion, he proposed a credible programme for the next 12 months, which will be crucial for our citizens.  We will support it loyally and our support will be conditioned by the ability to put the commitments into practice, to be – as you said – manufacturers. I find in your speech, at last, an ability to react. After Brexit we heard so many grandiose statements, leaders saying 'we are on the brink', 'Europe is now coming to an end' 'either we save it now or never' and then nothing. There are leaders who seem sleepwalking in the middle of the night, and then there is Theresa May, who, faced with a clear, albeit sad for us, result of the referendum, three months later continues to keep the EU in check – if it were not so tragic, it would be ridiculous!  This Commission has maintained an economic policy profile that we Socialists like, which still brings urticaria – take a few antihistamines – to the last ultras of austerity: Mr Schäuble and his friends. I say this once again, Dear Weber, in this line of blind rigorism, we will never stay there. We are a progressive force, an alternative to conservatives.  But we know that these are extraordinary times, we must work together, we want to work with all the pro-European forces in this Parliament and we want to work on serious political priorities, not least in order to defeat the nationalism cloaked in so-called patriotic democracy. Jean-Claude Juncker has given positive responses to our priorities, to many of our priorities. I would like to reiterate them: firstly, sustainable growth, work, the moralisation of European democracy, solidarity – four key words for our values, consistent with our values, with our socialist principles: sustainable growth – well the investment programme, we must steer it towards riskier investments and towards sustainability – completion of the Banking Union; fiscal capacity; tripling of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund; flexibility and the opening of a debate on the Stability Pact unreservedly, including on the Fiscal Compact; we cannot dismantle it at all. We must have a financial framework adapted to the challenges: no to the reduction of the Structural Funds in Spain and Portugal.  Europe must not be the arch judge who punishes, punishes. Europe must understand, support and unite, it must be a friend of its citizens, it must defend the well-being of the planet – this great, immense leader named Jacques Delors reminded us of this. We need a battle for the moralisation of economic life, the fight against tax fraud, we are waiting for the directive. You said 'taxes must be paid where profits are made', it is not possible for the baker in Strasbourg to pay more tax than the American multinational!  We want the blacklist of tax havens, whistleblower rules, a stricter code of conduct on Commissioners or Presidents of the European Commission, and then the social agenda – thank you for posting of workers . We want a Child Guarantee in addition to the Youth Guarantee. We want dumping to be combated, and I say to my people's friends: follow the things that President Juncker said about social dumping, because there is social dumping in the European Union. Let us fight together against this social iniquity! Then there is the directive on precarious employment and European unemployment insurance.  I will end with immigration and foreign policy: Federica Mogherini deserved to be the real Foreign Minister of the European Union on the ground. Common defence policies are good, we should move forward on the Migration Compact with Africa – that is excellent, revolutionary, Mr Juncker! - and then good on unaccompanied migrants and humanitarian corridors, intelligence cooperation, Schengen for Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia.  Mr President, this Commission has the intelligence, authority and prestige to lead a new phase. We have an invisible, almost impalpable danger: this danger is called fear. But a world forged on fear is a world worse than what we live in. It is not right to make our children live and to ourselves and those who will come and to overcome fear we need political intelligence, determination and a great European heart. (Loud applause from the left)", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Syed Kamall", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, in June this year the British people voted to leave the EU.  (Applause from some quarters) But the voices of discontent reach far beyond the English Channel. In many other EU countries the warning signals are there and, if they continue to be ignored, do not be surprised if others ask to follow. The ECR Group that I lead has MEPs from 18 Member States, who want an EU that works better for their voters and for their countries. Our fear is that ‘project Europe’ has been set to cruise control and its drivers are unwilling to apply the brakes, whilst they ignore the warning signals. Today was billed as a relaunch, but sadly it is fundamentally the same mantra we have heard year after year: more military integration, more requests for money from Member States, more debt for tomorrow’s children to keep today’s socialists happy. More, more, more. But the more Europe you build, the more detached our citizens feel. The more you propagate EU supranationalism, the more nationalism has arisen in our Member States. The more you condemn or ignore scepticism, the more likely the prospect of a President Le Pen or a Prime Minister Wilders. I know that scares most of us, but dismissing people’s legitimate concerns will simply drive voters into their arms. This debate does not have to be about left versus right or about Eurosceptics versus integrationists. This debate should be about delivering security, delivering jobs and delivering opportunities for our constituents. The ECR Group believes that we can have greater cooperation where it counts without greater centralisation. We believe the EU can do less, but do it better. The next EU Treaty needs to strip back and simplify what the EU does – an EU which gives the flexibility of a network, rather than rigidity of a bloc, because diversity is one of the European Union’s greatest strengths. Yet diversity and mutual recognition are being challenged by the mantra of harmonisation, a common eurozone budget, EU—wide unemployment insurance and tax harmonisation. Diversity should also mean treating all countries equally, but today some countries are being treated as a more equal than others. We see France getting away with flouting EU budget rules, and I quote, ‘because it’s France’. We see Mrs Merkel’s Germany breaking every immigration rule in the book. We see old Europe getting away with it, while countries in Central and Eastern Europe are actively targeted by the Commission. So, instead of more rules that are broken, how about fewer rules; rules that everyone signs up to in good faith?  We also need democracy and openness to be reinvigorated within this Chamber and within our institutions. We need to see an end to the so-called grand coalition where decisions are taken by only five men from only four countries in only two political groups. So let me remind these five gentlemen that the European Parliament has 751 MEPs from eight political groups, and it is time you started to respect every one of them.  My group, and the people who elected them in 18 countries, want the EU to respond to the warning signals, to go in a new direction and to deliver meaningful reform. Reform that does not think that the EU has all the answers. Reform which unleashes the spirit of enterprise which once made Europe great. And reform that helps us compete and provide opportunities for our citizens in a globalised world.  (Applause) ", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, if I have fully understood, according to the last speech, the source of nationalism and populism is here. We are the source of nationalism and populism. If you defend Europe and if you defend a European vision, if you defend the European civilisation, then you are accused today of being the source of nationalism and protectionism. It is ridiculous, dear friends, to hear that. It is ridiculous, on the one hand, but it is a huge problem that we face because on one point Mr Kamall is right: the rise of nationalists and populists is a reality because a large part of our population no longer sees Europe as a solution. It is true what Mr Weber said. Young people are in favour of Europe and, on the other hand, you have many large parts of the population who no longer see Europe as the solution. That is the real crisis in Europe for the moment, this split between generations, you could say, between young people believing in a European future and others who have huge problems with it. Why do they have problems with it? Let us face it together, not the young generation, but the other parts. I think it is important to do that at the time of the State of the Union.  I think that people have the impression that their lives are no longer controlled by the politicians that they have elected, neither on a national level, nor on the European level. What they see is terrorism, tax evasion, international crime, migration flows and so on. They have the feeling that they are not protected against such things. On the contrary, they see forces like competition, the free market and free trade as a source of unfairness and inequality rather than what I believe, which is that competition, free trade and so on are a source of new opportunities and of progress for the future. And that is the problem for the moment on the European continent. It is in such an environment that you have a split between generations and people who have lost control over their lives and do not believe that we politicians are capable of controlling their lives and helping them in their fears. It is in such an environment that you see the rise of nationalism and populism, not only in Europe, let us face it. Mr Trump in the US is another example. Here we have our own nationalists and populists from Madame Le Pen to Mélenchon – I do not see the difference – from time to time and they all preach one thing: a false sense of security. They believe that, with walls and fences, we can solve the problem and that we can keep problems outside our territories. With walls and fences they solve every problem. The migration problem is solved with that and climate change is solved with that. They solve every problem with walls and fences and I think that is wrong. How can you keep climate change outside your borders? With fences, with walls? How can you keep terrorists outside your borders? With national walls and fences, or with a European policy instead? How do you deal, for example, with tax evasion and with offshoring? You can only do that with supranational policies and supranational instruments in the future. (Applause) I believe that it is true that the discontent, the fear and the anger of our citizens is caused by this fracture, a fracture that means that on the one hand we have the globalisation of our world and, on the other hand, democratic policies which are still only being developed on a national or local level. It is in my opinion this imbalance that was also the basis for the financial crisis in 2008 because the markets were global and our policies were not. It is also there that you can find weakness in a Europe faced with Putin and faced with autocrats like Erdogan and so on. I think, if you really want to give a positive response to the fears of our citizens and to regain control over their lives, we need European solutions and European capacities as soon as possible. That does not mean abolishing national democracies. It means complementing them and that means at the same time, in my opinion – you could say it in one word – that Europe is not the source but is the counterweight for wild and uncontrolled globalisation. At the same time, Europe is also the cure against the cancer of nationalism that we have today in Europe.  That is in my opinion the right analysis to make and I think that you have responded to that with a list of concrete proposals. I see three essential proposals there. First of all, this European defence union, finally. This is the third attempt, Mr Juncker. The first time, in 1954, was refused by the French National Assembly – let us not talk about that, it is good that France is now coming back after their mistake of 1954. We had a new attempt in 2003 – you remember that – and we also failed. Now I am very pleased with the proposals, already backed by the Hungarian and the Polish Governments. So let us do it because – let us be honest with each other – the Americans will not take responsibility in our neighbourhood for much longer. We will do it ourselves or it will not be done in our neighbourhood. Certainly, if Trump is elected, I do not have any illusions about this unwillingness on their side to do anything.  Secondly, a good real governance for the euro and the economy. Let us be honest, we cannot continue – Gianni and Manfred – as we are doing now. You say that we have to apply the Stability and Growth Pact and then Gianni stands up saying that we should not apply it. That is the reality today. France has a stability pact but says that it is no problem as they do not apply it. Germany, on the other hand, says that it still has a stability pact, even though it does not apply it. That is the reality of today. We have to change it and I encourage you, Mr Juncker, to push forward the Five Presidents’ report with the Treasury, with the Minister of Finance, with the fiscal capacity in the eurozone, and with the convergence call as soon as possible because this little game with the Stability Pact cannot go on anymore. We will lose any credibility towards the outside world. My last point is a common migration and asylum policy without delay. Do we have the possibility to create this, to make this an achievement? Have we the courage to do it? I think the environment is there because, let us look to Brexit. Brexit is not a liability. I see it more as an opportunity. Why do I see it as an opportunity? Because the British Government wants to make a success of Brexit and that is fair enough. That is their duty. But we also have our duty and our responsibility is to make Brexit a success for Europe and for all the citizens of Europe. It is possible to end the dramatic complexity of our institution so for me – and I want to conclude with this – Brexit is not a matter of punishment, it is not matter of revenge – I have never done politics like that. In my opinion, it is a question of the sound relationship between Britain and Europe and, moreover, it is about how we want Europe, our own European Union, in the future. That is at stake.  So my message today is very clear and I will stop there. Let us, on both sides of the Channel, stop our collective depression and let us stop the politics of division and seize this opportunity not to kill Europe, as some of you want, but to reinvent Europe.

Thank you very much, Mr President, and also for announcing that you want to turn a blind eye today. We have to make a choice. Is it a question of maintaining the status quo and managing the grievances, the misconstructions in the EU, in order to ultimately fail, or that we dare a new democratic and social EU? That is actually the question we have to ask ourselves. From our point of view, the European house must be fundamentally renovated and not just a crumbling plaster repaired. The European house must become habitable again. It must become habitable for citizens with affordable housing, with secure jobs, with sustainable development, with a safe environment – all this belongs together. With future prospects for the younger generation, but also with clear announcements against rising old-age poverty or even homelessness. We are doing too little about this. We no longer believe it when a firework sembsolication of promises is made here in Parliament or elsewhere, because so far no one has made it clear that the European Union's previous concept of relying on global competitiveness is, in the end, always at the expense of the citizens, who have to bear the burden of the debt, who have to bear the burden of their national budgets, the cuts to national budgets, the privatisations of the public service, public property. But that is precisely the point. If we do not change that, if we do not change this perspective within the European Union, then we will turn in circles, then the cat will bite its tail, because we cannot talk about more social security, about good jobs, if, on the other hand, we continue to talk about flexibility and unprotected employment.  How do you really want to change youth unemployment? What should be presented? At the end of the day, if the question is asked here as to why we are dealing with growing nationalism, with a growing retreat into national responsibility of Member States, then there is a reason here. The only thing is that the governments themselves are also helping to roll out the red carpet and also to promote this national withdrawal, thereby ultimately minimising the European house once and for all, leaving it to the right-wing populists, the right-wing nationalists, who would rather replace the foundations of the European Union with a patchwork. That will not work. In my view, this is one of the greatest dangers we face, and I have not heard enough of what we want to counter. For me, there are only two answers: firstly, to make the Union democratic, to truly democratise it. Your suggestion that Commissioners should take part in elections in the future is simply not enough. That's nothing compared to what we really need. Look at your responsibilities as the Commission, with a view to the European citizens' initiatives! That is not enough at all. None of the initiatives and proposals you have put forward have practically underpind a democratic foundation. You did not say how you intend to organise this together with the citizens. In the end, we have to say that the questions we are asking you here today are actually more to be asked of the Council. We have to say that even your predecessor, Mr Barroso, has made a massive contribution to the question of who governs the European Union today, but many citizens answer it in such a way that they say: it is the lobbyists, it is not the democratically elected representatives. Such action also harms your commission today. It is not enough to qualify Mr Barroso as a lobbyist now. I think this is really about more. Please do something about it! Understand that the citizens want to be involved, that they want to be involved, that they no longer just want decisions over their heads! Many of the responses have been launched today as calls. I have heard the term 'call' at least five or six times in your speech today. Who are you calling? We have to do something. You, as the Commission, must do something and the Council must do something. Is everything getting better now because Brexit was decided in a referendum? Is the troublemaker Britain gone, and can things be done now that were not feasible before? But then you could have said today: we are discussing a common unemployment insurance scheme, we are discussing common European minimum wages, common European minimum incomes. These are the questions you ask yourself Have. We expect more here, here we expect concrete things; then we are also prepared to continue to interfere in this discussion. (Interim remark by the President) One comment only to Mr Verhofstadt.

For my group, whatever is being discussed at the moment, the European Union, with its achievements and with its weaknesses, which we are getting to know better and better, is the answer to nationalism. And because we in the European Union have learned in 60 years that we can better defend our interests together, and that together we can better defend our values, this Very European Union is also the answer for us in the – admittedly – unsettling times of globalisation. I know why there is a great desire among Mrs Mogherini and others for more competences in Brussels. But everything has its time. I am convinced that we do not have to discuss institutional changes first, but that today we must regain confidence in the European Union and our policies through very concrete action. We must gain confidence – not only in the European Union, but in the European, open, plural, liberal society, because that is what many developments in recent years have been under fundamental pressure. Where do the Greens want to see action so that citizens can have confidence – have new confidence – in the common European path? We have seen over the last year – because a small proportion of the people who are fleeing around the world have come to us – what this is actually, this global problem of 'escape', even though it has only penetrated us in homeopathic doses. Since then, we have been arguing in the European Union. The polarisation of the EU, the EU's policy, is becoming stronger on this issue. I would like to say at this point that I and my group remain convinced that the EU states can and must better fulfil their international obligations to take in refugees. But looking to Africa or even Syria – and if I were to pray, I would pray that the ceasefire will hold – because the view across our borders to the south shows us that we must do much more and act more reliably outside the European Union. If last year's conclusion is once again just displacement, if there is again no better concept for policy for Africa, if we do not get a functioning asylum law and certainly no immigration law, then the problems we have come to know last year will return in the foreseeable future, and I fear that it will be of greater force. Much has been said today about solidarity in the EU. And I believe that responding to the misfortunes of others, as we have been increasingly seeking since last year, it will be more difficult if the European Union does not show solidarity internally. The wealth gap in the EU, an extreme urban-rural divide, the feeling of saving banks, but our schools and hospitals in large parts of the EU simply degenerate, that our borders are not working, terror – there are so many sources of uncertainty that we have to deal with. Let me say this now in the direction of Bratislava and the summit: we cannot do this alone; nor should we delude ourselves with our answers that this works without the participation of the governments in the Member States. The investment plan, Mr Juncker, to which you referred, is good, but it is too short. And to be interested in youth unemployment, but then to give Interrail answers – that is really not how well I think Interrail can be done, Mr Weber. To create tax justice and to look at the difficulties of the Stability Pact in the context of unemployment, youth unemployment – that is what must be at stake! I believe that with one of the great green projects for the future, the Climate Union – provided that we not only ratify Paris quickly, but take it seriously with transformation and focus on efficiency and renewables – we can set in motion in many countries an economic dynamism that will benefit everyone. But it has to be thought consistently. As Greens, we are always prepared to defend the European Union's great achievements in consumer protection, environmental protection and nature conservation, even in the meantime, in terms of data protection. What we expect – and Mr Juncker, I believe that you really have to take very seriously with your Commission; if you do not take these achievements very seriously for the citizens in negotiations for CETA and TTIP, defend them very seriously and are even prepared to develop them further, then at this point you will lose the confidence of the citizens more than you would like.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Nigel Farage", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, this annual tradition of the State of the Union speech was started by your predecessor, Mr Barroso, and perhaps now is a good opportunity – and I am sure the whole House would like to join me – to congratulate Mr Barroso on his new, highly paid job at Goldman Sachs. Is it not all wonderful? Whatever happens, Mr Juncker, I am sure the big boys will look after you. Having listened to what you have said this morning, all I can say is that I am pleased we voted to leave. It is clear that no lessons are going to be learned from Brexit. Indeed, it was the usual recipe: more Europe, and in this particular case, more military Europe – a European army, common defence, and already in this House people are saying, well, the Americans will not be here anymore and we will have to stand alone with our own military structures. Instead of a project of peace, I would have thought this is probably a very dangerous move. It is not going to change the rapid growth in opposition parties across the whole of Europe. It is not going to stop the Central and Eastern European countries from saying no to Mrs Merkel’s migrant quotas, and I think you have got a lot more referenda to look forward to.  But in terms of Brexit, you are probably right to be slightly critical of the British Government who, I agree, ought to get on with it. But is pretty clear that the EU is getting on with it, and you have already appointed your divorce lawyers. On behalf of the European Parliament we have got Guy Verhofstadt: he is the man who is going to be negotiating Brexit. If you were to think of this building as a temple, Mr Verhofstadt is the high priest, a fanatic. In fact, there is only one real nationalist in the room and it is you, Mr Verhofstadt, because you want flags, anthems and armies. You are an EU nationalist, and I frankly think that this appointment amounts to pretty much a declaration of war on any sensible negotiating process. If you stick to the dogma of saying that for reciprocal tariff-free access to the single market we must maintain the free movement of people, then you will inevitably drive us towards no deal – no deal on trading under WTO rules for the United Kingdom, which is actually not too bad because it is very much better and cheaper than the current deal we have got. But for hundreds of thousands of German car workers and French wine producers, it is potentially very bad news, because we are their biggest market; their most profitable market in the world. I would argue that what we really need is to have a sensible, common-sense approach, and for this Parliament to recognise that it has made a mistake and to find somebody who actually likes the United Kingdom to lead these talks.

Mr President, Mr Juncker, rarely have we been served a duller, tasteless speech, without any breath, no vision, no flat encephalogram. It was like the Eulogy of the European Union. Except perhaps, admittedly, the fairly successful moment of humor where you presented yourself as the hero of the fight against the savage tax optimization of companies. But back to basics. In fact, you have seen nothing, nothing heard of the immense aspiration of peoples to regain their independence and freedom. Mr. Weber gave us an element: he reads what people think in the newspaper. Stop reading the paper, Mr. Weber. If you want to know what young people think, look at what they are voting for, and I say it with great peace of mind because, in my country, France, the movement that I have the honour of presiding over is the first party among young people.  In fact, Brexit has broken a taboo. The British prove that it is possible to leave the European Union and, better, to come out of it to their advantage. The catastrophic forecasts were a lie. The United Kingdom is doing very well, the shock of defiance you were hoping for has turned into a shock of confidence. You would have liked, as we all understand, to see the apocalypse fall on the British. Well it's not for tomorrow.  Your solution, the same regardless of the problems or circumstances, is more Europe. Terrorism, immigration, economy, agriculture, you are counting on Europe to protect us. But this Europe that \"protects\" us - I put huge quotation marks - no one believes in it anymore, it is no more than a magic formula, without any power.  By refusing national borders in the name of Schengen, you are allowing all trafficking, all crimes to flourish. By attacking the idea of nationhood, by preventing the control of immigration, you are allowing communitarianism, Islamism and ultimately terrorism to grow. What is Europe protecting us from? Security?  By imposing a destructive economic policy on the countries of southern Europe to save the euro and not the peoples, you have killed economic growth, put many companies into liquidation and caused unemployment to explode. What is Europe protecting us from? Prosperity?  You are imposing more European Union against the will of the people at the risk of increasing tensions. Your scathing comments, Mr Juncker, in May against the British, your contempt for the referendums are worrying. What is Europe protecting us from? Freedom, democracy?  It's time to put your hand up. The different European peoples need plans for the future, a destiny that only their national community can offer them. Let the nations free themselves, let them cooperate with each other, as they wish, better than with Brussels. Finally be a democrat, let the people determine their destiny.

You will understand I would not be in a position to do so at this point because all the work on the basis of what President Juncker has outlined as plans for the Commission for next year lies ahead of us. I hope, however, that I can say, on behalf of the Slovak Presidency, that I thank him for proposing a positive agenda. I feel it a privilege to represent the Slovak Presidency. I could not be here when he was presenting the speech on the State of the Union, but I would like to reassure you that we are, as the Presidency, aware of the urgency with which we need to act in order to address all the challenges the EU is facing. We are aware of them and I do not need to elaborate on them. They are obvious and unprecedented, but I would like to say that, if there is one challenge we need to tackle immediately, it is that of uncertainty. Otherwise, I believe the European Union will be the first victim of populism, and I agree with President Juncker that populism does not solve problems, it creates problems. Secondly I would like to say, having listened to President Juncker, that the Slovak Presidency has, I believe, received further confirmation of the sound principles on which we have built our priorities. We want to bring tangible results, we want to focus on citizens and to help stop fragmentation. The second point that I would like to make concerns the upcoming meeting of the heads of state or government in Bratislava on Friday, which many speakers have mentioned. What is the idea behind it? It is very simple. The heads of state met in June, and in the aftermath of the United Kingdom vote they came to the conviction that they need a frank and open debate among themselves about the state of the Union and how to find a proper response to what happened in the UK. I dare say that this debate will may bring diverging views, but I do not think we should be afraid of it. At the level of heads of state, this debate is long overdue and, if it has the common objective of finding common ground for future responses, I think it will bring added value for Bratislava. I believe it will kick off a reflection process that will take place over the following six months until we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome. I hope I can say that there are three areas on which the heads of state may focus their attention in the coming months. The first is migration. Thank you President Juncker for sending an appeal to the Slovak Presidency to work on solutions for overcoming the reluctance in some countries to take in refugees. At the same time, I believe it is important that we create a concept whereby all can participate in solidarity. The second area is internal security and external security. Of course this will be extremely important. And, finally, we will simply want to communicate better about the European Union. I think Jean-Claude Juncker has made that point as well. Lastly, Mr President, for the Slovak Presidency, in order to bring tangible results and to implement as much as we can, the starting point is the implementation of an interinstitutional agreement. That will be the first point that we will make, together with the Commission, when we discuss the letter of intent that you have submitted to Prime Minister Fico today, and I hope that, towards the end of this year, the Presidency will be able to arrive at a joint declaration with the Commission and the European Parliament on legislative priorities.

And I want to support or put it into practice in a few places.  Against populists only helps if we regain credibility. And, firstly, credibility is gained by proving that you are following your own rules and your own right. That is why, colleagues from the Socialist Group, it is also a matter of keeping agreements on the issue of the Stability Pact and not changing them every week. Credibility also means standing by what we have agreed together and what the rules say. That is also the responsibility of the Commission.  Secondly, take positions towards populists, not always swim with them when any moods come, but have their own positions. This gives you credibility. TTIP, CETA and others: do we always give in to sentiments, or is it not our job to ensure that things that are recognized as correct are enforced? The latter is the case.  And thirdly, solutions need to be made, not meetings. And solutions must be concrete, practical. What answer do we provide to people for the problem of security needs? What are we really doing to ensure that data exchange between security agencies happens? What do we do on entry, exit? What are we doing when it is externalborders strengthened? What are we doing about a common defence policy? We do not need large models, but, as correctly described, very concrete steps; rather two, but the right one, rather than constantly just describing the things.  Last but not least, if you want to have growth in Europe, you not only have to take money into your hands, but you have to create the conditions for companies to start businesses, and that's where it's happening at every corner of Europe.

How can the European Union be decisively involved in the Syrian crisis when its foreign policy is identical to that of the United States? How can European standards and the European way of life be maintained when all the countries of Europe, especially Greece, have been overwhelmed by millions of Muslims, who proudly and resolutely proclaim that they will enforce Islamic Sharia law throughout Europe? How can youth unemployment be tackled when Mr Juncker himself said that talented young people should come from third countries? Finally, how is it possible that Mr. Younger is proud of FRODEX? Has he not been informed by the Italian coast guard, and especially by the Greek coast guard, that all FRODEX can do is pretend to be the traffic warden of those who want to enter these two countries illegally?

I have not ignored the negative, but for reasons of time I cannot now respond to all the points that have been raised – because arguments have not always been. I would like to thank the large groups in this House for their broad support. I would just like to say a word about Turkey, because this could not be dealt with in my speech. We are still in intensive negotiations with Turkey on the visa issue. I would like to make it clear once again that visa liberalisation can only take place if all the preconditions mentioned are met by Turkey, although I call on us to be a little more patient on a number of points, because it is necessary to resolve the most difficult issues in Turkey. I am convinced that this will happen, but it will not necessarily be possible within the timeframe set for this purpose. But without a reform of, for example, the anti-terrorism law, it will not be possible to seriously consider visa liberalisation with regard to Turkey on a specific date. I am glad that almost everyone has spoken out in favour of strengthening social rights in the European Union. You know what consultation procedures are currently under way on the fundamental pillar of social workers' rights. We will await the outcome of these consultations and then present our proposals.

And what we can see today is that Jean-Claude Juncker, with his programme and the entire Commission with the great backing of this House, can now start this work. The two institutions , the European Commission and the European Parliament, are capable of delivering. That is the first important point after these three hours of debate. The second point remains: are the Member States now able to move? The debate between North and South on the euro issue, the debate between East and West on migration, and a few days ago, another one came up with the idea of applying for the exclusion of a Member State. Don't be angry with me, but sometimes it sounds more like kindergarten and not serious politics that are being made there.

And the third – on our question of dealing with populists and extremists from the left and right: I would like to start by saying on Brexit: do not be angry with me – I am politically with those who say that the effect across Europe is such that, according to the polls conducted neutrally, we now have as high approval ratings for the European idea in many, many states of the European Union as we have not been for a long time – in Germany. , my own country, as has not been in the polls since 1977 – because people across Europe see that berlin does not have a problem, people see that it is not Paris that has a problem, people see that it is not Rome that has a problem, but people see that London has a big problem, namely how to deal with the situation. We are experiencing strife, we are experiencing disunity, and even the protagonists of the exit, the upper supporters of the exit, have disappeared. Farage resigns, Johnston is no longer heard. Farage even says: the 350 million we save - that was a lie. That is the reality we are in. And that is why we should now approach the Brexit debate in a really positive way. If a country wants to go out, it is not only the British who say: Brexit means Brexit, but then we Europeans too would have to say: Brexit is Brexit.

When I listen and watch the statements of some Euro-MEP members, it seems as if all this was already seen twenty-five years ago when Yugoslavia was falling apart.

Workers in Europe do not have the same rights and obligations, which causes unfair economic and social competition between companies. For these reasons, the report presents the measures necessary to fill the legislative and regulatory shortcomings that, to date, favour unfair competition.  As a first step, the aim is to strengthen controls on the implementation of today's policies by increasing and training the human and financial resources responsible for enforcing the rules. It also calls for modernisation of reforms on the registration of labour benefits and the creation of a digital document on social rights that will be made available to all European workers. In the light of the above, I am voting in favour of the report on social dumping in the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1279, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Gilles Lebreton (ENF)", "mepid": "124738", "text": "  In writing.

However, they have not been able to empty it of its contents. The report proposes three areas of action to tackle this problem: strengthening controls between and by Member States; Bridging regulatory loopholes to enforce labour law at all levels (European and national); promote equal treatment and non-discrimination among workers. In addition to these directions, it proposes three concrete measures: the creation of a European road transport agency to monitor drifts in this sector, which is heavily affected by social dumping; Establishing a blacklist that prevents fraudulent companies from accessing certain markets; introduction of a minimum wage equivalent to at least 60% of the national average wage.

In reality, however, while we have made great strides in terms of economic elements, apart from a few principles set out in the Treaty and in some directives, the competence in the social field has remained with the Member States.

I believe that the principle of the reverse between the development of the social system and economic development prevails, which many people have mistaken for: Member States that maintain a quality social system (and not the other way around) are successful economically. I agree that there is competition between companies in an asymmetrical system, which also hinders the maintenance of a high level of social protection in Europe (e.g. fierce competition between economic operators encourages companies to reduce spending).

What is different, however, is to criticise and actually combat such abuses and, more differently, to try to include in these practices the objective economic differences that exist between Member States.

The reason is that I need to rush back home because we are finalising the preparations for the meeting in Bratislava. You added this point to the agenda on Monday, therefore I changed my schedule because it was important to present the position but I will not be able to stay here for the debate. News of the closures announced, most recently in Belgium and France, created anxiety and anger in the towns and regions concerned. The recent cases of Caterpillar and Alstom are a reflection of a more widespread phenomenon of mass redundancies across the EU as a result of the changing economic environment, with deep employment and social effects. The recent crisis in the steel and automotive industries, as well as the announced restructuring, show that serious reflection and action is needed in the Member States and at EU level. We need to decide whether we want to let our industrial know—how slip away elsewhere or whether we should take determined action to improve the framework conditions for our industries. Back in June 2013 the European Council recognised the vital importance of a strong European industrial base as an essential building block of the EU’s growth and competitiveness agenda. As you noted in your resolution of 2014, there are several aspects to consider, and I will touch upon them. Like Parliament, the Council has called for an ambitious and active industrial policy. This should include sectoral initiatives to be pursued by the Commission whenever the challenges to competitiveness and the need to maintain a strong industrial base require it. To ensure an active industrial policy, industrial competitiveness needs to be mainstreamed across all relevant policy areas. Infrastructures, including digital ones, must also be developed with a long—term view. Labour markets should enable growth, while safeguarding the social rights of workers. In the area of financing, progress has been made through recent instruments such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments. There is, however, still a need to remove obstacles to – and to promote – new debt and equity financing. The potential of increasingly strategic and targeted lending by the European Investment Bank to innovation and industrial transformation projects, notably in manufacturing and related services, could also be looked into. As local and regional decision makers are responsible for two-thirds of public investment in the EU, their interaction with business and industry is highly relevant. Regions can play a key role in supporting industrial modernisation. This can be done, inter alia, by combining regional policy and industrial policy tools. As recent events show, there is also a need for effective social dialogue involving governments and the social partners. At Union level there has been a growing recognition of the importance of involving the social partners at different levels. The Council has welcomed the steps taken by the Commission to involve the social partners in policies that may have a significant impact on the employment and social situation, but dialogue and policy also need to take into account the financial aspects. To this end the European Union has developed an instrument to support workers’ employability and mitigate the adverse social consequences of restructuring. The European Globalisation Fund (EGF) gives specific one-off support aiming to facilitate the reintegration of redundant workers suffering the shock of serious economic disruption. The EGF is, however, only a tool to manage such difficult situations once they arise. Together we need to engage in efforts to manage the adaptation of the current economic environment, achieving gains in competitiveness, whilst preserving quality employment. There are some excellent signs. Research and innovation are essential for the sustainable development of the European economy. It is in this context that the Presidency, in cooperation with the Commission, is inviting representatives from European and international research, innovation communities and the business sector to a major international conference on the re-industrialisation of the European Union. This event will take place in Bratislava on 26-28 October 2016 and will focus on the fields of nanotechnologies, advanced materials, manufacturing and production technologies, as well as biotechnology. Another key element is the digitalisation of industry, which has a cross-fertilising effect on all sectors. However, we are still lacking coherent development across Europe. The EU, Member States, regions and industry all have a role to play in fostering the digitalisation of business processes and in developing the industrial dimension of the digital agenda. Therefore the Council welcomes the recent Commission communication on digitising European industry. Finally, as the Commission has indicated in its new Skills Agenda, sustained investment in education and training and better alignment of skills and labour market needs are necessary as a way of contributing to employment, growth and competitiveness. These are the different aspects we need to work on if we want to re-industrialise Europe. Parliament and the Commission are working hard towards these goals and so is the Council. Re—industrialisation will be addressed by the Competitiveness Council on 29 September 2016, and I would remind you once again of the conference that we will be hosting in Bratislava. I invite you to attend. Once again I apologise that I have to leave but I am already very late.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1523, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Marianne Thyssen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the recent announcements by Caterpillar and Alstom about the envisaged closings of major industrial plants in Europe are a hard blow for the affected people and a severe setback for the regions concerned. I thank the European Parliament for organising this debate and for making the link with the vitally important issue of the future of the European industry and the need for industrial competitiveness.  In cases like these, the immediate priority of the Commission is to support those directly affected. It is absolutely necessary to quickly establish a perspective for the workers, their families, as well as the local economy. Europe does not stay on the side—line. We must work together at all political levels to help the workers who have lost their jobs and to assist the regions in overcoming this difficult economic and social situation. First and foremost, companies operating in Europe have the legal and moral responsibility to put social dialogue at the heart of the restructuring processes. Information and consultation of workers is a core feature of our European Social Model. It is absolutely clear that no company is allowed to escape this responsibility towards its workers. Secondly, where redundancies or closing a business are linked largely to developments at global level, we have a Solidarity Fund, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (Fonds Européen d’Ajustement à la Mondialisation), which can provide financial support for the workers and regions affected. EUR 3 million have already been granted in the past years to cover redundant workers from Caterpillar and some related companies in the region. Seeing the context, additional financial support from the European Globalisation Fund can be made available, upon request from the Member States concerned. Financial means from the EGF can be used to support, amongst others, the professional retraining of workers. In addition, the European Regional Fund and the European Social Fund can be put at the service of the conversion of the region and the affected workers.  To respond to the serious situation in Gosselies, we have set up a taskforce, a taskforce which will be an interface for the Belgian authorities with the Commission, and which will assist with any questions arising during the process ahead, for instance related to the legal framework or the use of European funds. While these measures all contribute to our short-term response, this Commission has from the beginning sent a strong signal on the necessity to preserve and improve the competitiveness of our industrial economy over the long term with the Investment Plan for Europe.  In July 2016, EUR 20.4 billion had already been invested in infrastructure projects, innovation and small- and medium-sized enterprises under the European Fund for Strategic Investment. This amount is expected to generate EUR 115 billion in investments. And, as announced this morning by President Juncker in his State of the Union address, the Commission will take this further by doubling the duration of the Fund, and doubling its financial capacity. This should lead to a total of at least EUR 500 billion of private investments by 2020. The Investment Plan also aims at removing barriers to investment and at creating simpler, better and more predictable regulation in the European Union. The industrial dimension is also incorporated into all other major Commission policies: the Single Market Strategy, the Circular Economy package, the Digital Single Market, the Energy Union, the Capital Markets Union, our Research and Development agenda, the Better Regulation agenda, the Trade for All Strategy and the New Skills Agenda for Europe. Indeed, in a fast-changing global economy, skills will, to a large extent, determine Europe’s competitiveness and the capacity to drive innovation. They also help mobilise and attract investment and they are a catalyst in the virtuous circle of job creation and growth. Our skills agenda is an agenda for all: young, old, in education, unemployed, in work or indeed in transition between jobs. Our industry is strong. Nevertheless, worldwide competition is increasing. So we must step up our efforts at all levels to ensure that Europe remains a competitive and attractive environment for manufacturing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1524, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Françoise Grossetête", "mepid": "2025", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, unfortunately, once again we are led to talk about this profound crisis of competitiveness and lack of investment for our industry in Europe. The closures of the two Caterpillar sites on one side and Alstom on the other are symptomatic of the industrial depression we are experiencing in Europe. There are more closures than industrial start-ups in Europe. This is an alarming signal and it is what causes and generates a lot of anxiety and anger. And yet, the authorities were aware of the difficult situation of these sites and unfortunately these authorities are panicking at the last minute, seeking a hasty rescue plan. The fundamental problem is the nagging lack of competitiveness of our companies and also the lack of willingness of some Member States to create the right environment. In reality, companies constantly need to restructure to adapt to change, but in order to grow, they must benefit from a favourable fiscal and social environment that is not paralyzed by one or the other.  In the case of Alstom, which I particularly deplore, it seems to me dangerous that a government would propose to another French company that is in debt trouble - SNCF - to place orders urgently. Artificial orders in the end, whereas for years there is not a real rail policy in France. In reality, what is missing in Europe is anticipation. We are constantly talking about industrial policy but who proposes real long-term industrial development strategies for our European companies? This is what is most lacking and, unfortunately, it is the employees who bear the brunt of the inaction of some governments in the face of structural reforms to be carried out and in the face of the social dumping that unfortunately exists in Europe. The closures of these sites are always difficult times for employees. That is why it is essential to accompany them, as you said, Commissioner, in the defence of their social rights. Above all what our European industry needs is stability, fiscal stability, legislative stability, it needs to feel encouraged by long-term strategies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1525, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Maria Arena", "mepid": "124936", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S and D. Madam President, the announced closure of Caterpillar in Gosselies has plunged more than 6,000 workers into disarray, but also into misunderstanding. Caterpillar is not unique. Every week, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund receives files: Finland, Nokia/Microsoft, more than 8,000 redundancies; Sweden, Ericsson, more than 1,500 redundancies. The list is long, but what is unacceptable is not just a firm business, but how it closes and why it closes. Going back to Caterpillar, it's a group that's setting up its seats where it pays the least. Caterpillar is in Switzerland to avoid paying tax in Europe. Caterpillar is also a beneficiary company that chooses to pay its capital rather than invest in meaningful employment strategies. Caterpillar is also a decision-making centre outside Europe that neglects the role a company must have at the European level. Well, this model is a model that is found with many multinationals at the moment. Finally, Caterpillar is also a direct effect of European austerity, because less public works equals less investment in machinery, whereas it is said that green investment could bring jobs, and I think we should work in that direction. So what to do? First, Commissioner, as you said, we need to help the laid-off workers and the regions that are affected, and I know how willing you are. Second, we need to boost public investment. Third, we must guarantee taxation, where the production of wealth takes place. Fourth, we must fight against the financialization of our economy. Fifth, it is important not to give absolute rights to foreign investors. However, we here in this Parliament are ready to accept agreements with private investments and arbitration courses that would give absolute rights to foreign investors. We absolutely have to stop this mechanism.  Finally, we need to have impact studies on globalisation and not just impact studies on what it brings positive - it is true that there are positive effects - but also on the negative effects. If we defy the negative effects, we will not be able to prepare ourselves to adapt companies and adapt our structure and, therefore, we must be much more sincere about globalisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1526, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Helga Stevens", "mepid": "125105", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – The first thought of an announcement like Caterpillar's always goes out to those involved. The ECR Group and my party, the N-VA, sympathize with the thousands of affected workers and subcontractors. For them, the intention to close is hard. There is a great deal of concern about globalisation. The correct answer is: well-thought-out policy. Some elements are crucial. We must not give in to protectionist tendencies. International competition is just creating more jobs, not fewer. We need job security to take precedence over job security. Continuous technological change requires a rapidly adaptable labour market in order to maintain and improve our prosperity and employment. We must not write anyone off prematurely for the labour market. In order to pay for an ageing population, the labour market position of older workers needs to change dramatically. We can expect the EU to support collective redundancies. But passing the bill to the taxpayer is not a sustainable solution. With a European transfer union, we will not solve unemployment. It is up to the Member States to make a full use of structural reforms that maxim enerti y to promote job creation and entrepreneurship.

On the morning of 2 September, Caterpillar announced the closure of its Gosselies site, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The announcement is stiff, the blow is brutal, the workers are sounded and the politicians shocked. More than 2,000 workers will be laid off by the company, double by subcontractors. Any business closure, as we know, is done in pain. But this one hurts particularly badly. First, there is the brutality if not the violence of a decision of a faceless capitalism; this decision has not been announced to the government of my country and the American leaders are absent subscribers, even when the Belgian Parliament asks them to come. There is also the injustice of fate. This closure hits a region tragically affected by industrial decline, which has a very high level of unemployment and an extremely worrying lack of attractiveness. Finally, it has been said, there is the budgetary constraint that arises from the Stability Pact and which weighs on the means of action of the Walloon and Brussels governments.  So what to do? First, require Caterpillar to comply scrupulously with all the provisions of the Renault procedure. This means, first of all, requiring credible justifications as to why a company, which makes a profit and has little debt, decides to close a successful site. Secondly, if the decision is confirmed, make every effort to ensure that workers receive fair compensation and a strong prospect of reclassification. You have understood the situation, Commissioner, by meeting with trade unions and politicians and by announcing from the outset the creation of a task force within the Commission's services and your willingness to mobilise all possible means to support efforts to reclassify workers. All of these initiatives need to be taken, but it is not enough. This morning I heard the President of the Commission reaffirm, in his State of the Union address, his desire to build a social Europe and a Europe that protects. I doubt that the workers of Caterpillar or Alstom are now convinced that Europe is protecting them.  I am well aware that we are living in times of great change as a result of globalization and the emergence of an economically multipolar world. And it is good, Commissioner, to have reminded Caterpillar management that social dialogue is part of Europe's DNA. But it would also be better to have, at European level, new instruments such as a strategic investment fund specifically industrial to consolidate or recreate a solid industrial base in Europe and it would be nice to have with the companies that invest in our countries a broader and more contractual code of conduct than the Renault procedure which actually only regulates closures.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The Commission is setting out major objectives for the reindustrialisation of Europe – that is a good thing – but we are currently seeing the opposite: it is not only at Caterpillar that jobs are being destroyed in regions that are already suffering to the highest degree of unemployment. This is often done in companies that are not only profitable, but also in no case suffer from a lack of competitiveness. Of course, it is usually the pure profit interests of companies that destroy jobs. But it is the policy that could fall into the arm of companies with a forward-looking, long-term industrial policy, in this case in the construction sector and in public transport. The Alstom case is not an indication of a long-term employment-ensuring industrial policy, either nationally or European.  We are only reacting and sharing the worst consequences of job destruction with funds from the Globalisation Fund and thus from taxpayers' money. That is a good thing, but not enough.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Caterpillar, between 2009 and 2015, there was a 50% increase in the dividend per share and a 15% increase in job losses. These figures alone show that the cancer of financialization continues to eat away at the heart of our economy and that, despite the professions of faith following the financial crisis, maximizing short-term profit remains the alpha and omega of multinational policy, and the return of finance and the economy to the service of society, a wishful thinking. The case of Caterpillar is not isolated as industrial employment in Europe has increased from 20% to 15% of the labour force since 2000. And to hear Commissioner Malmstrom, who is a little obsessive about pushing the CETA and TTIP trade agreements, we can expect even more social disruption since she is asking you, Mrs Thyssen, for a strengthening of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, all of this, while the Europeans have set themselves the objective of increasing the share of industry in their GDP to 20%. And we are right because, whether it is energy, mobility, buildings, to take just these three examples, industry has a vital role to play in the transition of our economy to a low energy and resource economy. Europe, ladies and gentlemen, has every interest, for its own competitiveness, in leading this transition, in being a leader rather than a follower. Therefore, beyond the emotion aroused by the arbitrary closure of Caterpillar in Gosselies, we must finally learn from these serial restructurings and adopt the essential elements of an industrial policy. First, it involves the re-eding of finance. And there, a lot remains to be done. As long as the standard of profit is set by financial institutions too big to fail, then our economy will be fully enslaved to finance. Second, a shift in trade policy. We must put an end to these draft trade agreements tailored solely to the interests of shareholders and condition access to the European market on compliance with the social, environmental and fiscal standards of our Union. Third, industry must be put at the service of transition and transition at the service of industry. Indeed, we have ways to put our industry at the forefront of their transition. Let us give ourselves ambitious and binding energy efficiency and resource targets. Let's make the Juncker investment plan, instead of sprinkling a little money everywhere, focus on industry and the ecological transition. Finally, industrial employment is increasingly being replaced by machines. That in itself is not a bad thing, provided that the profits are distributed. In other words, we need to challenge our work organization model, which is to share work and income. This is the inevitable evolution of our societies if we do not want to leave millions of people on the side of the road.

Madam President, the case of Alstom's Belfortaine plant, which is still hoped to find a more favourable outcome than that of the Gandrange and Florange steel mills, is emblematic of the submission of our managers to the dictates of shareholders and pension funds. What a symbol this Belfort factory! Opened in 1879, it was from this factory that the first prototype of our high-speed train came out in 1971, our now famous TGV that the world envy us, a factory that employed up to 9,000 employees. Today, almost only in the tertiary sector is hired, while the dramatic destruction of industrial employment continues: last year, more than 33,000 jobs were lost in our French industries. Without absolve our national leaders of their responsibilities, it must be recognised that it is the European Union that imposes the financialisation of our economies on us, and which, in the name of supposedly free and undistorted competition, forbids us from any protectionism, even if it is European.  It is also the European Union which, claiming to fight monopolies, imposes the separation between network and transport activity in the rail sector. Now we are cutting our companies branch by branch, to better resell them to their competitors. The announcement of the closure of the Belfort plant is thus only the logical continuation of Alstom's skinning with the sale in 2014 of its energy division to the American General Electrics.  The challenge, beyond safeguarding our industrial jobs, is the maintenance of the skills and innovation poles that depend on production sites.  This is why it is imperative that the public authorities help industrial sites that operate temporarily under production, especially when it comes to national flagships. But our ministers still need to work on their files, rather than focusing on their career plans.  It is not surprising, then, that banker Macron did not see anything coming. In between photo shoots for the \"people\" press, the Minister of the Economy did not want to listen to the calls for help from Alstom's executives and employees. Macron had given his word: \"Zero layoffs\" and here are 2,000 jobs that are threatened, including nearly 500 in Belfort.

Can this just leave us cold? No, it doesn't. Has this closure been fairly completed? No, it is not. And, dear managers, dear managers, dear caterpillar shareholders, you should be ashamed! Therefore, in the short term, we must help the workers concerned. This can be done very concretely through the activation of the European Globalisation Fund. But in the long term – and this is important – we must create a fair and effective framework in Europe in order to safeguard jobs and industrial sites in Europe. I therefore see three concrete approaches: firstly, the fight against this painful tax evasion. Caterpillar draws profits almost untaxed in Switzerland, worked and no longer invested in Belgium. In Europe, the tax is to be paid where the work is done. That is a simple principle; we just have to implement it, and I very much support the Commission, which has put this proposal on the table. Secondly, one question: is it wise that European accounting standards make it almost impossible for public investment in industrial parks, for example, to be made almost impossible? The answer, of course, is no, it kills investment. That is why I have a concrete idea: let us amend the so-called SEC standards so that states, regions, municipalities and cities do not have to write off investments for one year as is now required. After all, we also get jobs in Europe through public investment. Thirdly, how do we ensure that industry remains and grows in Europe? By creating innovative products. This is through investment in research and development. We need a lot of Silicon Valleys in Europe. Only at this level can we compete with low-wage countries. We must also create excellent education and qualifications. We achieve this through clusters of excellence between universities and industry, as in Aachen, and through dual training as a model for the whole of Europe.

What is often forgotten in the discussion, however, is that these two individual cases are part of a trend. Between 2008 and 2014, three and a half million jobs were lost in Europe's manufacturing sector. France alone has seen a decline in industrial jobs of more than one million since the turn of the millennium. Aggressive and partly state-backed competition with Chinese and other manufacturers puts high pressure on industries such as the railway industry. In addition, there is the digitisation of manufacturing, which is certainly an opportunity for some, but also threatens industrial jobs elsewhere. Both also drive productivity expectations into the unattainable. The economy is forced to lag behind the market. It puts workers under pressure to perform that makes them sick, and yet we in Europe are gradually losing our industrial base. This has nothing to do with a social, reliable market economy.

I welcome the debate we had today and I have taken note of your recommendations. I would like to stress once more that our immediate priority now is to support those directly affected. The European Union will continue to show solidarity with the workers and regions affected by major closures, and we are ready to offer our support through the European funds, the legal acquis and any other relevant policy instruments. I can announce that today the Commission has adopted a proposal to prolong the derogation for needs beyond 2017. This prolongation that is foreseen in the regulation on the Globalisation Fund in Article 6(2).  To support job creation we must keep improving the framework conditions for jobs, growth and investment. We do this via the European semester, recommending, clarifying and simplifying rules and regulations, ensuring that tax systems encourage, and not discourage, employment reducing the scale of undeclared work.  We must also act directly to help create jobs by deepening our internal market in all its dimensions. The crucial tool is the Investment Plan for Europe, which has the potential to bring investments back in line with historical trends. Structural reforms in the framework of the so-called third pillar of the investment plan will nurture the economic recovery and can provide further basis for sustainable growth.  There were some reactions on the Stability and Growth Pact. It should first be noted that the closure of the Caterpillar plant in Gosselies and the stability pact are of course two different things. The stability pact is critical to preserve sound public finances in the European Union and to stimulate sustainable economic growth. The rules of the pact should not therefore be holding back investments, as President Junker also said this morning in his ‘State of the Union’,  and here we see a common responsibility for Member States and for the European institutions. There was also something said on the European Parliament’s resolution on the competitiveness of the European rail supply industry. We are aware of this resolution. We know it. We are preparing a draft reply, and I can tell you that we are taking due note of Parliament’s resolution on the competitiveness of the rail supply industry. We welcome the emphasis on our common effort to maintain a thriving industry. There were a lot of remarks on the international trade agreement. I can tell you that Commissioner Malmström is a good negotiator; she is negotiating hard and she has already said that we will not have an agreement on everything. Her aim, and the aim of this agreement must, of course, be to strive for a good thing for Europe, not a bad thing. In so doing, she is taking into account all the social consequences and is acting for the best future for us all. As for the market economy status of China, on which some remarks were made, whatever the final decision will be, one thing is for sure: we will have effective trade defence instruments in place and the tools at our disposal will be sharpened and not weakened.

I am thankful for the European Parliament’s interest in this case and happy to be here today to inform you about the decision. It is an honour.  This decision follows an in-depth investigation into two tax rulings that Ireland had issued to Apple. We concluded that they gave Apple a selective advantage over other companies, artificially reducing Apple’s tax burden over two decades. This is illegal under EU State aid rules. Apple now has to pay the unpaid tax of up to EUR 13 billion plus interest.  Member States cannot give unfair tax benefits and thereby selectively favour certain companies. EU State aid rules keep the level playing field in the single market and ensure that companies can compete on equal terms, thus protecting European taxpayers.  The State aid decision on Apple does not call into question Ireland’s general tax system or its corporate tax rate. The investigation concerned two Irish tax rulings from 1991 and 2007. They gave selective tax treatment to two Irish companies in the Apple group. The ruling endorsed an internal allocation of profits within Apple Sales International between its head office and branch. The bulk of the company’s profits were allocated to the company’s head office. The thing was that Apple Sales International’s head office had no employees, no premises and no real economic activity. It existed only on paper. Therefore, there was no factual or economic justification for allocating almost all of the company’s profits to the head office.  Under the Irish tax law applicable at the time, the head office was not subject to tax in Ireland or anywhere else. The rulings therefore allowed Apple Sales International to pay very little tax on its profits. In fact, the effective tax rate for Apple Sales International was as little as 0.005% in 2014. This means that Apple paid less than EUR 50 in tax for every million euros in profits, giving it a significant advantage over other businesses in breach of State aid rules.  To restore fair competition the decision now orders the recovery of Apple’s unpaid taxes back to 2003. It is for the Irish tax authorities to calculate the exact amount. We estimate that it could be as much as EUR 13 billion plus interest. Apple and Ireland have announced that they will appeal, and they of course have the right to do so. We have a robust decision and will defend it in court. Once agreed by Ireland, we will publish our decision for all to see, and I hope that this can happen as fast as possible.  The published information may also be relevant to tax authorities in other jurisdictions. This is because Apple decided to record most of its profits from European sales in Ireland. This is not an issue for the EU State aid rules, but as soon as the decision is published, tax authorities will be able to read across the information provided by Apple in Ireland and in their jurisdiction, and of course assess whether this updated information is relevant under national tax rules. In addition, if the US tax authorities consider that Apple should have paid a higher contribution for research and development to its US parent, it could lead to a higher taxable amount in the US.  Looking ahead, the goal is that all companies, big or small, should pay taxes where they generate their profits. To that end, the EU, the US and the international partners as such must work together, and significant steps have already been taken by the OECD and endorsed by the G20. In the EU, under the responsibility of my colleagues Valdis Dombrovskis and Pierre Moscovici, we are pursuing a strategy towards fair taxation and greater transparency. Firstly, European tax authorities will next year start to exchange information on tax rulings, a real change for the better. But we should go even further. Transparency is very important in an open, democratic society. It is important that basic tax information on multinational companies becomes public. The public should see the number of employees, what activities a company has in each country, what profits they generate and what taxes they pay. This is the objective of the Commission proposal on country-by-country public reporting.  These reforms and even-handed enforcement of our competition rules contribute to a fairer investment environment, and a single market where  companies can compete on merit, as reflected in the quality of their products, prices, and the services they can provide, and not on the basis of their tax arrangements.

And in this context, these citizens, whom we have asked for many efforts, do not understand that large multinationals do not participate in this collective effort. On the contrary: unfortunately, they have the opposite perception. On the other hand, in this context I believe that the citizens of Europe should be grateful for the effort and forceful effort with which Commissioner Vestager has acted in the Apple case. Because, without a doubt, actions like this contribute to European citizens seeing us as part of the solution and not as part of the problem. Dear colleagues, we must say loud and clear that the party is over; it is true that multinationals contribute to growth and job creation, but they cannot have privileges that European citizens do not have. We must move towards fiscal union. A fundamental first step, without a doubt, is the consolidated common basis of corporation tax. That does not mean the same taxes, but means the same rules and, as the Commissioner said, more transparency.

This ruling has no effect whatsoever on our tax rate or our ability to attract inward investment or to create jobs.

With $200 billion in cash, Apple, without faith or law, has organized a real corporate tax heist. In my country, France, Apple has paid only 56 million corporate taxes in ten years. It's insignificant. The European Union explains that these tax rulings are not illegal. They are not illegal, but they are immoral to taxpayers and businesses who have to go through hyper-taxes to make up for budget deficits. I say to you in advance, Mrs Vestager, the European Union will never see the colour of the EUR 13 billion.

As part of the EU’s march to nation statehood, it needs to finance its over—ambitious policies: this Parliament, civil service, courts, foreign policy and, of course, the burgeoning EU army. To raise money, it must have taxes. The Apple tax ruling forms part of the EU’s long-standing plan – which includes VAT and the common consolidated corporation tax base – to take control of EU citizens’ taxes directly. The Apple tax ruling is an attack on the tax sovereignty of EU nation states by the back door, and the EU has weaponised EU competition law and, in particular, state aid rules to achieve this.  The ruling is a massive problem for those Europhiles and Conservative Ministers who believe we should stay in the single market or want even EEA status. Remaining in either will lead the UK to be part of the EU’s competition law, acquis and EU state aid rules. Either could lead to retrospective tax rulings and stop us from having an independent competitive tax policy. Just as the manzanilla tree is the little apple of death for those that eat its fruit, the EU is the big apple of death to prosperity and freedom.

A decision which our GUE Sinn Féin representative described as ‘morally wrong’. Well, if it is morally wrong to defend the reputation of a country, what is morally right? We have been accused of illegal state aid, which we deny; Apple did not get a sweetheart deal. We also take issue with the use of competition law to undermine the sovereignty of a national state.

We could call them the evil lovers who are welded together and ready for anything, and even to commit the irreparable, since I think that what they really want is to undermine the European economy, all to avoid participating in the financing of our social model, be it accessible and quality health care, social protection, education for all , support for jobs, a sustainable economy or security for all of us. And unfortunately if it is not Apple or the other multinationals that contribute to it, well it is small and medium-sized enterprises and our citizens who have to overcome the incivility of multinationals, with the result of citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises who have to pay more taxes than they should. And all for the benefit of Apple, its shareholders, its executives and its American employees. And what is left for European countries? Very little, except the impression of financing the extravagant lifestyle of the firm with apple. You know, Commissioner, in 2014, the revenues of Apple's six most senior executives, all American, peaked at 133 million euros. But for Apple, the European Commission is seriously wrong, and the multinational does not intend to reimburse or change its practices. As for Ireland, it is the same speech, and worse, the government refuses to ask Apple to repay the 13 billion. This is not a unique case because, contrary to what my colleague Sander said a few months ago, after a conviction by the European Commission, the Belgian government has also refused to recover from the multinationals the reimbursement of the defrauded sums. We can see, therefore, that the Commission, on the one hand, is doing its job but that the Member States are not following this path. This has already been noted with the report on the rules against tax evasion by multinationals, when states decided not to follow Parliament's recommendations and to postpone the implementation of these measures until 2024. Commissioner, should we not think about allowing the European Union to recover these sums directly from multinationals. One could imagine going back to the European budget and dedicating them, for example, to the fight against tax evasion. Especially since another news has confirmed Apple's condemnation, it is the closure by Caterpillar of its only headquarters in Belgium, more than 5,000 layoffs.

If competition law is the lever for constantly pointing this out, then I am happy and happy about it, and we should continue in this regard.

The danger of having a political Commission is that sometimes decisions are taken based on politics and not on law; decisions that are more about agenda-setting. In my view, there was a clear determination on this case to get Apple in the midst of this investigation, irrespective of the damage done to Ireland. The Apple case will not be decided here, it will be decided in the European courts and the right of Ireland to appeal this decision must be respected by all of us. Ireland makes no apology for attracting investment to our country. The multinational sector in Ireland employs many thousands of Irish people, and indeed people from the European Union. In Apple’s case 6 000 real Irish people are living and working in those communities. The European business environment will not be helped by reinventing competition rules for the US, or indeed for other businesses that come into Europe. Chancellor Merkel recently made this point about sending out mixed messages. My final remark is this: the Commission now asks Ireland to collect this back tax from Apple while, at the same time, encouraging other Member States to seek a portion of it. How is this logical?

Thank you to so many Members – Giegold, Lambert, Gomes, Cato Scott, Nunes, De Masi, Da Vito, Caputo, all of these colleagues, among others – for their support and encouragement, which are very much appreciated: the encouragement to do what we do, which is very basic – to enforce competition law and our State-aid rules so as to ensure fair competition.  A lot of you mentioned small and medium sized businesses. These are businesses who pay their taxes. These are businesses who contribute by taking apprentices. These are businesses where you do not find the same statistics – as I am quite sure that my colleague Pierre Moscovici has presented to you – as you see with multinationals in terms of tax burden and taxes being paid. If taxes are not being paid by some, then they have to be paid by others and that is why it is not fair competition when some Member States hand out selective benefits.  A lot of you have been asking about the rule of law and the legal basis. This goes back to the very beginning, because our founding fathers saw very clearly that you cannot have fairness and fair competition if rich Member States or decisive Member States hand out selective benefits to some companies which are not available to others. The courts have said very clearly that State aid can come in many forms – it can be a very cheap piece of land, a very favourable loan, a bundle of cash in your hand, a tax benefit. But State aid it is, because it lowers your costs and lower costs are a thing which is not available to your competitors.  Secondly, the court has also said very clearly, talking about SMEs, stand-alone businesses and multinationals, that when multinationals do what they of course need to do, intra-holding trading, then there should be a resemblance to market conditions. Because stand-alone companies, the small and medium-sized businesses who are on their own, they have to do their thing in the market. Therefore the court has several times committed to the fact that we should be fair and transparent.  This is also why, Mr Hayes, this cannot be a political decision. It is built on the rule of law, it is built on due process, and it will of course be tested by our courts because of the completely legitimate opportunity for Ireland to appeal. But the court will hear nothing about party politics or emotions or gut feelings. They want the facts of the case, the court practice, how the case has been decided previously, and that of course will be tested.  Talking about what guidance we can give, we have too little case practice now to make great guidelines, but we have started to give guidance and to discuss in our high-level State-aid forum how to make sure that Member States can work with this, because obviously it is the responsibility of the Member States to make sure that national tax legislation, which is 100% a national issue, is upheld at the same time as what we have decided in common in EU State-aid rules.  Bernd Lucke asked about why just now. Well, actually this is a very good example of why we need transparency because this case was only opened because of hearings in the US Senate. This was where data came out that enabled the Commission to get concerned that something may not be as it ought to be, that there was a risk of State aid being handed out.  Mr Kelly asked about retroactivity. No, this is exactly the way things are always dealt with. If a benefit is handed out as a selective benefit to a particular company, it has to be taken back. We do that with a 10-year perspective from the date we asked the first question. This tax ruling has been in place since 1998, but we do not go back the whole way. We do exactly as we used to do: maximum 10 years’ going back. It is not retroactivity. Not a single rule has been changed. The only secrecy here was the tax rulings and that is why unpaid taxes have to be paid, just as well as other selective benefits will have to be repaid if they are seen to be illegal State aid. Last but not least, State-aid control cannot change tax legislation. If tax legislation is to be changed, it is done by the front door. It is either in the national parliaments, as done in Ireland a couple of years ago where the double Irish was done away with; or it is by unanimity in the Council of Ministers, and we do that by the front door to propose to ministers to make things easier. I am talking about the common corporate consolidated tax base. Not only will this make it more tricky for people to escape or to aggressively plan their taxation, but also it will make it much easier for small and medium-sized companies because they do not need to hire advisers in order to explain to them what they should be taxed on if they are active in more than one country, maybe just a few.  Sven Giegold asked about resources. What we are doing right now is trying to empower Member States to take as many State-aid decisions as possible themselves within the framework of the Treaty. I think we are up to 80 or 90% now, which frees up resources for us to look at the more tricky cases where you have a true cross-border issue and where fair competition is at stake.  I also, lastly, thank you for the encouragement to work within the OECD and the G20, because obviously this is a global matter. And obviously the highly qualified work done in the OECD to prevent base erosion and profit shifting is a cornerstone of what we can do in the future, because this is for all of us, and a global tax alliance is being formed in these years in order to ensure fair taxation, where everyone participates in paying their fair share, not more and not less, and where all the companies who pay their taxes to see that we have fair competition and that we are willing to work for it.

The relocation decision that was taken a little over a year ago was from my understanding a real paradigm shift. For the first time we saw that solidarity was implemented for real in the area of migration and asylum within the Member States, and that is really good. The relocation programme of course has also a lot of floss and a lot of problems. There are too few places overall available. There is an arbitrary threshold of 75% of recognition rate, which really does not correspond with reality. There is a lot of bureaucracy that has been dealt with and many other problems. But still I believe it is a ground-breaking programme.  But there is one thing, one thing that is really threatening this relocation programme and the success that we could have with it, and that is the unwillingness of Member States to really use it, to fill it with life.  To date, and these are figures this week from the Commission, we have just 3 677 refugees relocated from Greece and only 1 064 from Italy. Let us remember that overall there are 160 000 places, which as such is not so much, but the figures that have been relocated over the past year, the people behind the figures – that number is simply not enough, and that is the problem that we are having here: Member States are not pledging places or they are not fulfilling their promises and this is especially a problem for unaccompanied minors who can hardly find any place anywhere. This is what is really threatening the programme, and some Member States have not relocated even a single refugee. What more can we do about European solidarity, where is the spirit of our Lisbon Treaty? Where is the spirit of working together if Member States are not able and willing to relocate even very small numbers of refugees? We have already this week discussed in plenary the huge numbers that a country like Lebanon has to deal with, while we as European Union Member States are not able to do at least our bit of the share.  I think this really has to change, also because the unwillingness to relocate has very concrete consequences for the refugees who are stuck in Greece or in Italy. We are talking about children who are sleeping in unbearable conditions, children who are not able to go to school, people who are not receiving proper medical care, refugees who are completely left in a limbo and who don't know what tomorrow will bring or where they will end up. Those are the real consequences that we see and we really have to address those big problems. With the vote tomorrow in the European Parliament, I think we as a Parliament we can give a strong signal that we will stick to the relocation decision, that we are committed to it and do not want to see it watered down by places being taken away from the relocation programme while there are still thousands of refugees in Greece and Italy and more are arriving on a daily basis. We need to strengthen the instrument rather than weaken it. We need to make it faster, much, much faster, and for that we have proposals. We also need to include a group like the Afghans, who make up a big part of the refugees arriving and who are in dire need of protection. I believe we can, but also we should, make the relocation programme a success story; a success story for the European Union, but much more for each and every refugee who is affected and for all those families and children who are stuck in Italy and Greece – we must give them hope and a perspective and give them the protection that they need.

As the guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is here to ensure that Member States face up to their responsibilities and I can assure you this is what they have been doing over recent months. With more than 50 000 people in Greece, and more than 125 000 arrivals already in Italy, this is not only the sensible thing to do, it is the truly European thing to do, because what happens in Greece and Italy today might also happen in other countries one day. Ultimately, the impact of the migration crisis is felt not only in the frontline Member States, but also in the rest of the European Union. What is happening in Italy has a direct impact on your country or on northern Europeans, and a European challenge requires a European answer. That answer is relocation. Even here in this House we disagree. Believe me, it is always a pleasure to be here and debate with you. You have repeatedly enriched my knowledge and my judgement and I want to express my gratitude for that. What matters is that we agree on the political goal and on the importance of the success of the relocation scheme, because relocation, as I said at the beginning, is the most tangible proof of European solidarity towards both the people in need of protection, and the over-burdened Member States. Better sharing of responsibility among Member States is not a pull factor: it is an indispensable tool at our disposal for managing the refugee crisis, and the migration challenge in general, more effectively. This is the essence of our comprehensive migration policy, as President Juncker stressed this morning. We have to be realistic: while Greece and Italy are making great efforts, they cannot shoulder the responsibility alone and host and protect entirely all the asylum seekers present on their territory. So all Member States have to step in and take their share of the responsibility. We should not forget what these people went through, risking their lives to reach safety. It is time that they were all welcomed in countries where protection is offered properly, in line with our legal and moral obligations. But most importantly, in the long term, we have to avoid these people undertaking such dangerous journeys, by bringing them to Europe safely and legally. That is what resettlement is about – and this task is already starting now. Let me turn now to this specific proposal. The purpose of the Commission proposal was to make it possible for Member States to use the 54 000 unallocated relocation places for resettlement and other forms of legal admission of Syrians from Turkey to the EU. This is the essence of our proposal. We cannot support amendments that change the essential purpose or substantially modify the main elements of the relocation procedure as provided for in Council Decision 2015/1601. Some of the amendments that you propose to the original Council Decision could, in principle, be acceptable for us. We believe, however, that now it is time to pull together all our efforts to ensure the smooth implementation of relocation commitments. So far, 4 741 migrants have been relocated from Italy and Greece. We all agree that it is not enough, but numbers have been steadily increasing. We therefore have to keep going. The Commission and the EU agencies work closely with all the Member States to define and implement efficient procedures allowing Member States of relocation to assess each application properly and to increase both the numbers and the speed of relocations. Just yesterday, a relocation forum took place in Greece and tomorrow a meeting with all Member States will take place in Italy to find a common solution in order to increase relocations there too. Our aim is to address, to the extent possible, the objectives behind some of your amendments. For example: shorter procedures, more regular pledges, European Asylum Support Office (EASO) regular updates on eligible nationalities, etcetera. As we are approaching the last year of implementation of the relocation schemes, further action is urgently needed to accelerate their implementation. At this point, I want to reiterate the need for Member States to respond to the EASO experts’ call. At the beginning of August, I sent a letter to all Member States to urge them to increase the number of migrants relocated. I can assure you that I use all opportunities in bilateral meetings and at all Justice and Home Affairs Councils to remind Member States that it is the moment to demonstrate solidarity. The same goes for resettlement, where Member States should have all the tools in hand for delivering on their commitments. So far, since 4 April 2016, 1 583 Syrians have been resettled from Turkey under the 1:1 mechanism. We will have to increase this figure urgently. Our proposal today will introduce flexibility to ensure that all Member States that invest in relocation or resettlement will receive the necessary technical and financial support from the EU. Relocation and resettlement should be among the top EU’s priorities in the months ahead, and they go hand in hand. These are the real humanitarian needs – and all the Member States should stop merely talking about them and start acting and delivering more.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1630, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Salvatore Domenico Pogliese", "mepid": "124853", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this dossier, for which I had the pleasure and honour of representing my parliamentary group as shadow rapporteur, is in fact a passage from the EU-Turkey agreement signed in March 2016, a commitment that is being made today on time on the issue of promoting the resettlement in Europe of Syrians hosted in Turkey.  I believe that the text examined in committee is perfectly balanced, thanks to the sensitivity of the rapporteur, Mrs Keller, and the other shadow rapporteurs, especially in so far as it eliminates the possibility for Member States to deduct the number of Syrians resettled by Turkey from the number of refugees that the Member State had undertaken to host under the relocation agreements from Italy and Greece. , and in so far as it is hoped that relocations will affect, as the rapporteur, Mrs Keller, she also pointed out, not only syrians, but also Eritreans, Iraqis and Afghans, in order to make the relocation mechanism more effective. That is why I believe that this text must be absolutely approved. But let me make one further point: I believe that the EU-Turkey agreement was an obligatory choice that is producing excellent results on the subject of containing the Balkan route, if it is true, as it is true, that the landings in Greece have been reduced by 90%. I hope that Europe will also show the same determination and efficiency in containing the Mediterranean trade, where, at the same time, there has been an increase in inflows, as was physiological.  On the subject of relocations, which the Commissioner mentioned, to date the data we can record are not at all exciting: we are talking about 4 000 migrants relocated compared to the 66 000 who, according to the initial project of 6 000 migrants per month, had to be relocated in these months from the start of that journey.

Today's debate gives us the opportunity to take stock of European refugee policy. In May 2015, we committed to moving 22,000 refugees from outbreaks of war in Europe, but only 8,000 were resettled. In September 2015 we committed to moving 160,000 refugees from frontline countries - Greece and Italy - but relocated only 5,000. You understand that if we were a trading company, all the planners and implementers would have been fired. But we are the ones who hold the fortunes of people in our hands. So what's going on? Why are the Commission and the Council planning, but the Member States not implementing? Today President Juncker stressed to us that solidarity is not necessary, it comes out of the heart. That's an interesting observation. If we were talking about the Stability Pact and national subsidies, would he have the same relaxed view? Not to blame, however, he has brought, as proof of European solidarity, the investments of the European Funds in the various countries.  I will fully agree with the balance he proposes. No solidarity, no investment. And if at first we were right to have the excuse that Greece is no longer cooperating, that does not exist either. All refugees have been registered. The data is being processed and already 7,751 people are waiting with suitcases and papers in their hands to relocate. But the European door does not open. The Commission is also asking us today for refugees resettled from war zones in the various states, under particular schemes such as humanitarian visas and work visas, to be considered as meeting obligations to frontline states, Greece and Italy. That is to say, to let those who are already in Europe overwin the crisis in Greece and Italy. We describe the defeat of European integration.

Unfortunately, I must say very clearly that the relocation decision, the whole relocation programme, bears the hallmarks of a programme burdened with arbitrariness and centralism. He does not see the difference between refugees and migrants, he does not see that refugees in these areas want to go only to selected rich European countries, and he does not see the complex context of this situation, so I cannot support Mrs Keller's report, and I urge you to look for other real forms of European solidarity that will give the opportunity to actually resolve this issue.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Ska Keller, and all the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation. And I think we've done something good. As we all know, the name of our debate today is not really correct, because we are actually discussing the first part of the famous EU-Turkey refugee deal.  The Commission wants to apply the agreed relocation quotas for the one-to-one scheme between Turkey and Greece, and that is where I see the problem. In my opinion, the resettlement of refugees must not be at the expense of the resettlement quotas that have already been decided upon. We need both. Member States that have agreed to the relocation initiative must finally fulfil the obligations that this has enduring, as the Commissioner rightly called for. This is necessary not only to protect refugees, but also to support the border states.  Just as Jean-Claude Juncker and Commissioner Avramopoulos are just beginning, I would like to call once again for solidarity as a fundamental principle of working together. So far, as we have heard, the number of people resettled by Greece and Italy is simply too small. The human suffering that this unnecessarily causes or is prolonged may, for some, fulfil its objective as a deterrent, but that is not the way in which EU policy must proceed. We must not operate on the backs of fundamental and human rights as a flagship democracy, which I hope we all want to be. If what has happened so far is the implementation of common solutions in refugee policy, then we need much more tailwinds for the much-needed common EU asylum and migration policy.  Finally, I have to put a question to the representatives of the people's and family parties.

This is not the first time that the Commission has tended to exclude Parliament on the pretext of the emergency linked to sudden influxes of refugees; the other example is the agreement with Turkey. For a long time, however, inflows have not been sudden, so there is no reason why Parliament should not be fully involved as a co-legislator.  I would therefore ask you to consider my amendment. It highlights that the legal basis of the proposal – Article 78(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union – should be replaced by Article 78(2), which involves Parliament in its own right.

The aim now is to sacrifice a proportion of the resettlement relocation provided for in the EU-Turkey agreement, further debasing the supposed internal solidarity between the Member States.

Mr President, the proposal to introduce temporary international protection measures for Italy and Greece is another grand plan of the European Union which will not be implemented in practice. Why, how can it be implemented when all states, in panic, close their borders and refuse to accept the migrants who are theirs. Really, what about that famous and empty phrase \"a Syrian from Greece to Turkey, a Syrian from Turkey to Europe\"? The Syrians go from Greece to Turkey with the eyedropper. Turkey, however, is throwing illegal immigrants into Greece with the \"bucket\". After her election failure, Mrs Merkel threatened to send to Greece 400,000 migrants accepted by Germany, taking out the dublin II treaty under review. In other words, Greece should become a vast concentration camp for unhappy and desperate people. To make our country once again a scapegoat, a scapegoat upon which all the failures of the European Union's foreign policy will be loaded. Moreover, you, Commissioner, Mr Avramopoule, fantasize about the creation of a European Coast Guard and Border Guard to do what the failed FRONTEX did. In other words, to become the traffic warden of those who move illegally to Italy and Greece. Nice guards you envision, Commissioner.

Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Keller and her colleagues, deserve congratulations on this important initiative today. Nevertheless, the decision, the amendment of which we are discussing today, we know, ladies and gentlemen, that it is not working adequately, because the positions that are committed are inadequate and implementation is slow and difficult. Only 3% of the original migration target has been implemented. We referred to 4,740 people who have left, out of a total of 160,000 decided over a two-year period by Greece and Italy. In Greece today there are 60,000 people, 13,500 on the islands, who are already in a difficult position, unaccompanied minors and not about 2,500 who have not joined the families, while the Minister responsible referred to about 5,000 unidentified people. This situation also makes asylum procedures more difficult. Relocation, ladies and gentlemen, is a practical demonstration and a strengthening of solidarity and a fair distribution of responsibilities. But today, the Commission has launched infringement proceedings against Greece for improper compliance with asylum laws and reception conditions. However, those legal actions that need to be taken have not been taken. It is precisely in order to repay the equal to those Member States which do not agree to implement the decisions.

But there are also thousands of unaccompanied children in this group in Greece. Children who have fled to Europe without their parents or whose parents have not survived the journey. Children who have been unceremoniously locked up after arriving in Greece without education, without legal assistance and without proper supervision. Children in a desperate situation because there seems to be no place for them in Europe. Of the promised redistribution of more than 66 000 refugees from Greece to the rest of Europe, less than 4 000 people have actually been transferred to another European country after a year. That is the same number that arrived on the Greek islands in one day less than a year ago. Why are these unaccompanied minors not given the highest priority in relocation? And what are our political leaders worth if they cannot ensure that Europe keeps its promises and cannot at least ensure that fundamental rights are protected for all, but especially for the most vulnerable, such as the unaccompanied children? As far as I am concerned, we are starting today to redistribute these young people to other Member States.

I could not agree more with you on the need for Member States to relocate more and more asylum applicants, and in parallel on the need for more resettlement. We have invested a lot in making relocation and resettlement work in practice and we have started to see some good, positive results. However, our efforts must now significantly accelerate. As I told you, I have sent letters to the Ministers and I am planning direct communication with Ministers to encourage them to send a signal of commitment. I would like to see real progress ahead of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and, in particular, ahead of the October European Council. To conclude, I thank you for coming here and sharing your frustration about the lack of results. But here, in this Chamber, most of us agree: what is important is that you reach out to your governments and you urge them to pledge. What is equally important is to address European citizens directly about our values, about our own historical past, and about the need to show solidarity to those in need today. Dear Members of Parliament, do not limit yourselves to this Chamber. You know better than anyone else that it was never an easy task to implement our EU migration policy and that half of the victory will be the right communication. As always, I need and I count on your support. Since I was asked some questions by my Greek friends here I would like to shift to Greek now. Mr Kyrko, first of all I would like to thank you for the question. First of all the numbers. There are currently 4,741 refugees relocated from Greece and Italy. The total number of refugees who have relocated directly to Europe is close to 10,600. You're asking me if I'm satisfied. Of course I'm not satisfied and I've said it publicly many times, by the numbers at least, obviously not yet. However, progress is being made and procedures are accelerating. As far as financial aid is concerned, as Mr Chrysogonos mentioned earlier, Greece has received and continues to receive aid, both in the form of emergency funding and funds through the national programmes which absolutely must be absorbed. As I said earlier, speeding up and increasing relocations is the main topic of discussion with my counterparts in every bilateral contact and in every Home Affairs Council. I even sent a letter to that in early August. It is the Commission's priority and mine. As President Juncker stressed this morning, the concept of solidarity is legally binding on the Treaties. Well, yes, relocation has to work. Not just to relieve countries under strong pressure, such as Greece and Italy. Because, in fact, they are taking on a disproportionate burden, but because every other European country may at some point find itself in the same position. Above all, because at these crucial moments for the political future of Europe, everyone must rise to the occasion. This means that they must show solidarity and responsibility in practice and respect the decisions taken at European level. I repeat, in conclusion, that relocation remains a priority for the Commission and my own personally.

I think they are very helpful. But I still do not agree with your latest proposal, because if you say – and indeed there were some bureaucratic problems in the beginning – that now things are starting to run more smoothly, why should we change the path? Those 54 000 places are urgently needed in Greece and Italy – people are still arriving on a daily basis. The numbers are not low, not at all. And resettlement: you said it is very important, and I guess most of us will agree, it’s extremely important. We should do it, but we should not do the one thing to the detriment of the other thing – we cannot calculate the numbers so that we take a bit from the big part and put it somewhere else and say the part wasn’t so big from the beginning. I think we should rather extend the programme and make sure that the Member States resettle people; it’s absolutely needed. But we should not do it to the disadvantage of the relocation program, which in itself is already very, very small. The European Union, I believe, can – and must – do more, and the vote tomorrow will be a vote to support the relocation program, so it’s full support for you and full support for the relocation.

The initiative to provide a European travel document for the return of third-country nationals who are in the EU illegally is to be welcomed. Europe and refugees have the same interest: that refugees can return to their home countries as soon as the root causes are eliminated. To do this, you don't have to bring them here and distribute them, you have to take the help there. The EP's report, rather than confined to the technical form of the EU-Turkey agreement, seeks to expand and speed up the scope of this misguided mechanism, which will only make the functioning of this already functioning system even more impossible.  We believe that in the hope of distribution, people smugglers will have to take more and more vulnerable migrants on their way to Europe, risking their lives.

Therefore, Hungary, together with other Member States, opposes the mandatory form of re-allocation on principle.

We had to reduce poverty, and in fact we have reached 200 million poor citizens in Europe, an increase of 5 million poor people in recent years.  And instead of listening to us and understanding that there are essential and indispensable policies to help them, there is an empty chair, and they should be ashamed not to fill that chair and not to listen to what we have to say!

As you know, the Commission decided to maintain the guidelines adopted in 2015 for this year and the Council agrees with our approach. We consider that the employment guidelines adopted in 2015 are still valid and relevant in today’s economic and social context. The Commission regrets that your position was not taken into account by the Council when adopting its decision in 2015. Nevertheless, I would like to assure you that the Commission paid due consideration to the opinion expressed by Parliament and has tried to accommodate it in several ways. A good example in this respect is the emphasis we put on the role of the social partners. The European Parliament has stressed on several occasions the need to enhance the role of the social partners when talking about employment and social policies. In the guidelines adopted in March 2015 social partners are invited to play, for the first time, a prominent role. This reflects the position you have often taken and which we fully share. The Commission agrees with you on the importance of developing inclusive and integrated labour markets. This is highlighted in the annual growth survey and reflected in the employment guidelines. The Commission monitors progress in these areas in the context of the European Semester and has addressed recommendations to the Member States to push reforms forward where relevant. I am glad that the report emphasises the importance of employment and social considerations in the European Semester. In 2016 the Commission has considerably reinforced this dimension in the European Semester and we will continue to place employment and social issues at the core of the semester in the future. The inclusion of three new employment indicators in the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP) scoreboard is a concrete deliverable on the Commission’s commitment to strengthen its analysis of macroeconomic imbalances, as you recommend in your report. The indicators are included in order better to capture the employment and social dimension of imbalances and adjustment processes. As regards your recommendations on national minimum income schemes, the Commission is committed to promoting among Member States adequate income support, which is one of the pillars of the 2008 Commission recommendation on active inclusion. This has also already been reflected in the country-specific recommendations addressed to those Member States most concerned. The Commission also agrees with you on the importance of making progress towards achieving the Europe 2020 targets in the employment and social areas. This is one of the key elements that the Commission takes into consideration when deciding on country-specific recommendations within the European Semester.

I remember Polish presidency of the 2011 European Parliament – the Council has always been represented by representatives Polish and has participated in almost all the debates. It is truly unacceptable that these standards, which have been introduced in Parliament, are not being respected today. Especially today. The European Parliament, in its institutional system, is the voice of citizens and seeks to represent their interests in the best possible way. In this regard, we are criticised for the fact that, with regard to the employment guidelines, the Council of the European Union has not taken into account the recommendations of the European Parliament in the past year. On behalf of the PPE Group, I would like to express my hope that this will not happen again in the future. In times of democratic deficits, we cannot afford to disregard the voice of Europeans.  Job creation remains a priority for the coming months. It requires investment in projects that facilitate business start-up, as well as the functioning of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the main source of employment in the European Union. Another challenge is to improve the transition from education to the labour market, and this requires investing in the right skills that are needed. The problem of non-compliance with labour market requirements has been known for a long time, but we have still not been able to fully respond to it. The centre of our activities should be young people who are currently in an extremely difficult situation. We must also not forget about seniorcitizens, who are an indispensable part of the labour market in a situation of demographic decline, and of building a stable social security system for workers, based on seniority and developed rights. All these actions and investments, including expenditure incurred by Member States, should respect budgetary discipline. The fact that Europe is out of crisis today and that economic parameters are improving is due to austerity and rationalisation of expenditure. In this context, I would like to draw attention to today's words of Jean-Claud Juncker, who spoke of the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact cannot become a pact of flexibility.

It is very important that our proposals were not heard last year, but that this year we continued without hearing the work that this House does. Because, of course, it is a lack of institutional respect and also calls into question some of the mechanisms we have between institutions to make decisions. The Council believes that things are going very well, that employment in Europe is very positive, that we are going in the right direction, that we have no problems and that our opinions and our view are both expendable.

It is only necessary to point out some other areas of the world, such as the United States, with a minimum unemployment record below 5%, after the economic crisis has passed. And we have five million more people at risk of social exclusion. They have to listen to our opinion: better social protection and greater social protection networks, which we can have; more active employment policies, which obviously require investment; and, as we have done so far, to place our social indicators in the European Semester at the same level as macroeconomic indicators.

This we believe can be achieved by, for example, introducing optional entrepreneurship courses at schools and colleges, and in the creation of student enterprises also. We asked for greater efforts to be made in ensuring a smooth transition from education and training to work, and one of the practical suggestions we put forward is to make it possible for young people to convert several months’ unemployment benefit, up front, into a start-up grant. Some of the other ALDE priorities that are included in the document are supporting the creation and the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises, and one way we can do that is to cut red tape and get rid of unnecessary bureaucracy.

Deregulation of industrial relations, downward pressure on wages and labour rights, the dissolution of the social state and social dumping are imposed on the peoples in order for multinationals and large capital to benefit.

We can also participate in a debate on the minimum guaranteed income if this is in the interests of workers, in particular, the low and middle classes.

As I was watching the results come in, it was the working class areas, it was the traditional Labour areas that were coming in with massive votes to leave the European Union, and it was obvious why. It was obvious before the referendum was even called. You talk about employment policies, well let us look at the biggest issue that has faced the United Kingdom for several years now: that of uncontrolled, unfettered, mass immigration. Now I do not blame people wanting to get a better life for themselves and their family. If your minimum wage is GBP 1 an hour, and you have the ability to go to a country where the minimum wage is GBP 8 or 9 an hour, you would do that, and I do not blame people for doing that. The people I do blame are the politicians who forgot that they were public servants. They forgot that they had a responsibility to their constituents, who are their employers. As public servants they have to make sure that they do everything within their power to improve the lot of their employers, and they have not. It was the Governor of the Bank of England who sealed the deal for the referendum when he said that mass immigration had led to incredible wage compression. Wages had fallen, jobs had stagnated, and why? Because people were coming in, taking a minimum wage that was much above their own wage, but big business cottoned on to this. The government in allowing for in-work benefits meant that big employers did not have to increase wages because the taxpayer will top up the bill. Fortunately, with our Brexit, we have made sure that we can fix this problem and there is not a day that goes by when I do not thank the British people for giving us our freedom. But I also worry day after day, because those of you here who cling to the euro, who cling to free movement and the unreasonable policies of this Union, you are condemning your futures, your youth, to misery and unemployment.

In fact, they have a fundamental design flaw in the same important place, which also accompanies EU policy in so many other policy areas as an evil shadow. As long as European so-called guidelines for employment policies do not explicitly commit themselves to a policy of stopping immigration, effective border management and effective protection against illegal migration, all other labour market policies, however well-intentioned, will inevitably have to fizzle out ineffectively. We discussed the problem yesterday in connection with social dumping. Such dumping is only possible because, up to now, the influx of cheap labour from all over the world into European labour markets has not even been stopped, which inevitably drives down the price of labour in accordance with the principles of supply and demand.

In order for the European guidelines for member states' employment policies to be effective, they must be appropriate to the common realities and objectives of the Union, but also to the specificities of each Member State.

These are over 45s who are no longer very young, but also not very old. Studies show that their digital skills are falling sharply compared to those under 30 and just over 30.

In my own country, Estonia, the Ministry of Labour has started a preventive retraining programme to give those workers whose speciality is currently at risk of disappearance due to the digital revolution the opportunity to prepare well in advance to go along with time and find new skills.

Instead of a reduction, as was the target, of the officially poor, there was an increase of 5 million. A quarter of the Union's population, 120 million people, are directly threatened by poverty, while one in four children leave school. Instead of working conditions converging upwards, they converge everywhere downwards. What does the report propose? We also see this in Greece, where the evaluation of the third left-wing memorandum will also bring a further reduction in wages in the private sector, undermining collective agreements, and linking wages to productivity, as the European Social Standard says. Already unemployment benefit instead of the unemployed is given in hot money to employers. After all, unemployment is being used to give more to capital. Do you propose a tax cut for employers, and taxes, who will pay them? The people! So you're suggesting active aging, work to death? Propose - listen, listen - in 2016, the level of pension at the poverty line while for young people generalisation of work flexibility, mobility, i.e. migration. Finally, minimum guaranteed income that is not social sensitivity, but downward pressure of all wages. You can't explain, not why you didn't meet the targets, but the main one: why when so much wealth is produced does poverty widen so much?

Mr President, the European Council has set some guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States of the Union, within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy, with the aim - supposedly - of smart sustainable and unrestricted growth. But at a time when the European Union is imposing policies of austerity and violent fiscal adjustment on the countries of the European South, these guidelines are turning into empty letter projects. Not only have the Member States of the Union not benefited from the supposed support for the Europe 2020 strategy, but, on the contrary, armies of unemployed people have been created throughout Europe. Social inequalities have been established and every day more and more citizens are being driven into poverty. Therefore, the development of employment in Europe so far shows that the employment policy guidelines will not produce the desired results, as long as the Member States remain attached to the harsh austerity policies that, as has been shown in Greece in Spain and Portugal, have created poverty and unemployment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1695, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE).", "mepid": "96922", "text": "   – Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to propose a reflection to improve the outcome of these guidelines for coordinating European employment policy.

In addition, some of the institutional instruments that are decisive for improving employability, such as education, are managed by regions. For these organisation and functional reasons, I insist that we define European standards to ensure the minimums that the labour market must raise across the Union and that we categorice employment policies to better meet the needs of each economy.

As we all know, having a job or not having a job really makes the difference for many people in feeling part of the ‘ins’ or the ‘outs’. It is very important for society and for the economy, but also for individuals, to have employment. It is also important to have a good, and also a stable, policy framework for reforms in the employment and social fields. This is particularly relevant with regard to the implementation of the country—specific recommendations. As you stressed in your report this year, as well as last year, qualitative and social considerations must find their place throughout the employment guidelines. Your report is very ambitious and allows for an enriched reading of the text that is on the table. I hope that you will continue to support it since many of your recommendations are already covered not only in the employment guidelines but also in the Annual Growth Survey (AGS) and, more broadly, in the European Semester. I welcome the honest debate we had today and I am confident that we will have other opportunities to continue this exchange. We are looking forward to your feedback and input through all channels, either in the committees or in the plenary. The Commission always values your opinions and we try to reflect them in our proposals. Some Members of this House made reference to President Juncker’s assertion, in his speech this morning on the State of the Union, that Europe needs to be more social. Others said that we have to work on this together. I could not agree more. We are convinced – and I hope that you share this conviction with me – that the economic strengthening of the Union goes hand in hand with social policy, with the aim of improving people’s lives. This is the core of the European social model and a vital component of our social market economy.  What Europe needs is fair and balanced growth leading to the creation of jobs – decent jobs and quality jobs – as well as opportunities and protection for everyone throughout their lives. May I remind you that this Commission has already taken many concrete steps to make sure that we deserve a triple—A rating in social affairs. We have the European Semester, in which we have deepened the analysis of employment and social performance, including by adding three employment indicators to the scoreboard under the alert mechanism report underpinning the macroeconomic imbalance procedures. We have strengthened the role of the social partners at European and at national level. We have proposed recommendations to the Member States on the reintegration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market. You supported this and I thank you again for that. We proposed – and you quickly accepted – the increase in pre-financing for the Youth Employment Initiative. I can announce to you that today we have decided, with the Commission, to adopt the proposal to add EUR 1 billion extra to the Youth Employment Initiative: EUR 1 billion that has to be matched by EUR 1 billion extra out of European Social Fund (ESF) money. This is to reinforce the Youth Guarantee strategy and to make it possible for Member States really to roll this out. We have also proposed the European Accessibility Act, currently under discussion in this House, which will help many disabled people to have more choices and to have better access to the labour market. We have the newly established European Platform – Mr Pirinski is still here – which will also help to combat undeclared work and change it into declared work and, by doing this, create better working conditions for people. We have the new EURES regulation which will make it easier for jobseekers to widen their job search into other Member States. We have also launched a New Start initiative, the new work—life balance initiative, together with Commissioner Jourová, which aims to address the challenges of work-life balance and to remove barriers to women’s participation in the labour market. Many of you, of course, made reference to the need for skills development, and we have also launched the Skills Agenda. We proposed some initiatives on 10 June 2016 and we will come forward with others soon. This is, of course, one of the most important initiatives on the Commission’s work programme of this year and will directly contribute to our promise to deliver on jobs, growth and fairness. We have better protection of occupational safety and health, and the Carcinogens and Mutagens Directive to which we have proposed amendments, and we will come forward with another batch of amendments. Last, but of course not least, we launched the broad consultation on the European pillar of social rights which, as you know, will entail the development of a reference framework that helps us to screen the social – and also employment – policy of the Member States and of the European Union. So a lot has been done and, of course, a lot still has to be done. Whether we have concrete results for our citizens – and you are right to say that we need concrete results – will also depend on us and whether we are capable of working together. If the social partners, Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission all work together, we have the best possible chance of achieving those results. This is what people rightly expect from us, so I can only call on you to continue to work together in a constructive way.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. Postal services in Europe make an important contribution to cohesion in the European Union. When I was able to negotiate the directive – the third postal directive – here in this House in 2007, it was very important to us that we achieve this territorial cohesion and economic cohesion well together. At that time, we had postal services that developed in a good direction. We had cross-border competition, we had new service providers within the Member States that had developed, new suppliers came onto the market, the supply has widened – everything went in a good direction. Of course, the digitalization of communication has also changed a lot in the 21st century. This cannot be ignored. However, we must also note, of course, that the postal services, which were very active on the European market ten years ago, have retreated back to their home countries. This is actually a development that we did not want to achieve. We really wanted to achieve more competition at European level. Let me give me a quote from Voltaire: \"The post is the comforter of life, for it transforms absentees into present.\" So I can't think of a better advertisement for the post office than Voltaire gave here. We note that what we had been agreeing with each other since the 1990s – I would remind you here of former colleague Brian Simpson, who was the first rapporteur of the first Postal Directive in 1997 – that we have defined a universal service, because it has always been a great concern for us that not only the people in the conurbations receive a good postal service, but that it is also true that in remote regions – on the mountains, we have also been able to do so. , on the islands, in peripheral regions of the Member States, a high-quality postal service is available. Ten years later, however, we find that this is not guaranteed in all Member States. I was surprised to find that we have a Member State – a large Member State, by the way – which has defined for 25% of the population that daily delivery is not necessary. I think it is in all our interests that the universal service, as we have agreed with each other, should really take effect. In order to do this, it must be ensured that universal service providers also have the appropriate framework conditions. They are now found through the VAT exemption. I would also like to point out that all those who have universal service obligations are equipped with an instrument that their competitors do not have. That is why it is also in our interest for those who have the VAT privilege – that is, do not have to charge VAT on stamps – to also provide a rich range of services. This, too, is, of course, part of the universal service. Our aim is to create a level playing field for postal services, as it is so beautifully called in European terms, for small, large, niche and cross-border services. We want the supervisory authorities to ensure that this is ensured. We also want to strengthen the Commission to put more pressure on the national supervisory authorities to ensure that the obligations of the European directive are applied in all Member States. I would particularly like to thank my shadow rapporteurs for their very constructive cooperation. It's been a bit difficult because the team that negotiated in 2007 seems to have just left me. But we got it right together. I am now looking forward to the debate and hope that tomorrow we will send out a clear signal for a strong universal service for our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1699, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your own-initiative report and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, and the rapporteurs for the committee opinions, Ms Anderson and Mr Bach. Postal services are an important sector of the economy. In 2014, over 500 million parcels and 64 billion letters were sent in the EU, but the sector is changing. In that same year, the number of letters sent across the EU declined by nearly 4%. In some Member States the decline was much more severe. In Denmark, for instance, it fell by 14% and in Italy by over 9%. On the other hand, the number of parcels is growing rapidly, as a result of e-commerce.  Improving cross-border e-commerce is one the pillars of the Digital Single Market Strategy. I am very pleased that Parliament agrees with the need for better and more affordable cross-border parcel delivery services. I will come back to parcels, but first I want to say a bit more about the Postal Services Directive.  As you know, we adopted our Application Report on the Postal Services Directive at the end of last year. We concluded that close monitoring and further analysis of the market was needed, and we committed to publishing statistics each year. I am pleased to report that the latest EU postal statistics for the year 2014 were published on the Commission’s website in June. The Commission is also setting up an expert group on postal statistics. We are also working to automate the data collection process to reduce the administrative burden and to enable faster publication. The Postal Services Directive requires universal service providers to deliver both letters and parcels on five days each week, except in exceptional circumstances. But as citizens move to electronic forms of communication and the number of letters declines, delivering each day is becoming more expensive. For example, the price for a 20 g letter rose on average by 7.5% last year. The directive gives a degree of flexibility on how Member States may implement and apply the Directive. This allows them to adapt to the changing needs of users and maintain the sustainability of services. For example, fewer Member States now include bulk letter and newspaper or periodical services in the universal service obligation. And fewer Member States now require deliveries on six days each week instead of five. Universal service providers can be compensated for net costs they incur in providing universal services. This is important, but compensation should be limited to what is strictly necessary and should not distort competition. To help with the next cost calculation, in an annex to the Application Report we set out approaches to that calculation that have been found to be consistent with the Directive.  The draft own-initiative report recognises the fundamental role of independent regulators in the implementation of the Postal Services Directive. In 2010 we established the European Regulators Group for Postal Services to help and advise us and to share best practices between European regulators. We really appreciate the work of the Group on the implementation of the Postal Services Directive and on cross-border parcel delivery. The Group will also have an important role implementing that proposal for a regulation. Now I come back to parcel delivery. As you know, the proposal was adopted in May as part of a package of measures to improve cross-border e—commerce. It is a targeted proposal to drive change in areas where the market and competition have not worked. It complements our 2013 Roadmap and market-led innovation, such as a universal service providers programme to make their services interoperable and an information platform that is being part-funded through COSME. The Regulation proposes action in three key areas. First, it will give postal regulators information about all the parcel delivery companies who are established in that Member State, except for the smallest ones. This will make it easier for them to spot problems in the market. Second, it will make the prices that individuals and small businesses pay more transparent, and require regulators to assess the affordability of those prices. Third, it will require non-discriminatory third-party access to be offered to universal services providers’ cross-border networks.  The proposal should help citizens benefit from lower delivery prices and choose from a wider range of goods, especially in remote and peripheral areas. It should also help small e-retailers get a better deal and help them gain new customers. Parcel delivery companies, especially universal service providers, will also be able to benefit from a growing number of parcels. This can help to create or safeguard jobs, especially in remote and rural areas.  Finally, let me briefly mention employment, since this has been raised by Parliament. As noted in your opinion by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Postal Services Directive allows Member States to reflect working conditions in their authorisation procedures. That means that Member States and postal regulators can require that certain minimum standards are met. Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing your views and to a very productive debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1700, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Georges Bach", "mepid": "97293", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

Firstly, as Mr Ferber has already mentioned, this is to preserve universal service in its present form. Secondly, that the role of national regulators should be strengthened. And thirdly, that we keep an eye on the impact on employees. This sector is changing and this is, of course, having an impact on employees. The traditional providers have managed to retrain people. That was done pretty well. Unfortunately, we have to note that new forms of employment contracts have found their way into the postal sector. There are major differences in working conditions and precarious contracts: part-time and temporary work are increasing.  It is important to us, as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to ensure that workers continue to enjoy decent working conditions, good social security, health and safety at work, as well as adequate pay and working time.

I am glad to say that we have got a good result.  Recent years have seen significant changes to postal services in the EU alongside the rapid development of the parcel delivery sector, as has been said. The review of the Postal Services Directive is a welcome opportunity to assess these developments now and establish our priorities for the future of services in Europe. It is important to note at the outset that the Postal Services Review and the report that we will vote on tomorrow have both confirmed that the directive does not require the privatisation of a universal service provider. In fact, it stresses that EU citizens have a guaranteed right to affordable and regular postal delivery services and it makes clear that these rights need to be protected. So together we must ensure the long-term sustainability of the universal service obligation, protecting, as has also been said, minimum delivery standards while recognising that the current provisions do provide Member States with the necessary flexibility within the law in the application of the directive, according to particular geographical circumstances. I would urge you very much to welcome this report with me. Parliament’s report makes it clear that competition in the postal sector must develop in a way that enhances rather than impedes citizens’ basic rights. Greater consumer choice is to be welcomed, but we must ensure that this does not lead to cherry picking, particularly in relation to employment practices in the sector. It has been acknowledged in the report that liberalisation of the postal sector has led to substantial differences in working conditions and wages and the report also stresses that increasing competition should not lead to illegal social practices. The EU and the Member States must work together to protect fundamental workers’ rights across the sector irrespective of employment status. Now while this report deals primarily with the review of the Postal Services Directive, we know that online shopping is a major factor, and that has also been mentioned.

It may be a little strange that in this digital world we are still talking about traditional mail delivery, but I have learned in recent months that the classic mail delivery and also the general service of De Post is extremely important for many people in Europe. I am not just talking about the elderly or people in less densely populated areas. In fact, everyone still has orders that expire by post.

I was initially delighted when it looked as though we had reached a common conclusion after such a long time, but it is not quite there.  The Royal Mail means a great deal to all of us in the UK. Indeed, its origins date back to Henry VIII, the original Brexiteer. 1635, in the reign of King Charles I,  paved the way for a unified postal service across the UK and 1883 saw the introduction of our postman. So, as it stands, the current UK Postal Services Act 2011 goes further than the minimum obligations laid down for a universal service. A six-day a week provision is guaranteed with uniform prices and free services to blind and partially sighted people, which shows that we have fully met the requirements to date. Regrettably, due to the unwelcome inclusion of a social dimension we are unlikely to support the rapporteur in the vote tomorrow. The key reason for this is not that we do not support great opportunities and good working conditions, but the reference in paragraph 48 to the possible installation of tachographs on vehicles of less than 3.5 tons. It was only in 2014, following a lengthy battle to exclude vehicles of this weight, that that regulation was supported. Finally, Mr President, we now live in a world where most of us will be buying goods online and we expect a 24/7 service. Because of this, the advantages of SMEs and the rise of entrepreneurs in this business have been most welcome. I therefore cannot support your report, Mr Ferber, unless paragraph 48 is removed.

I do not think that there is anything else that has changed as much in the last 20 years as communication. I wonder what the ratio was between the number of postcards sent last summer and the number of WhatsApp messages or pictures sent through Facebook. It has changed dramatically. If we look at the first directive of 1997 now it seems like history, and even if we look at the third directive of 2008 it is well overdue. I very much appreciate that our colleague, Mr Ferber, did not stick to the directive, but tried to look at not only what is happening today, but what will be happening tomorrow. I think that this is the way to go. We need to meet the expectations and demands of consumers, and we need essentially to keep up the pace.  For me, the way to do this is to have a solid regulatory environment in which we have high-quality universal services with a certain degree of flexibility, independent – and I stress independent – national authorities that monitor the situation on the market, a fair environment between the companies that have been on the market for a long time and the newcomers, between the universal services companies and the SMEs, and also a solid awareness of cross-border opportunities.

And, as in so many other sectors, the arguments underlying this strategy are to ensure accessibility throughout the Union, to ensure quality and reliability criteria or to boost dynamism and job creation. It is no surprise, as in so many other sectors, that these objectives have not been met; on the contrary, the effects on the States which have most intensively implemented the provisions of the Directive are precisely the opposite. On the one hand, the characteristics of the service, with an overall deterioration in quality, with recorded increases in complaints and complaints, especially those aimed at new operators. And with a specific worsening of the two notes characteristics of the public postal service: accessibility and universality; because new operators, private operators, concentrate their efforts on the most lucrative segments of the postal market to the detriment of services for small users; and because higher quality losses occur in less urban and worst-connected areas, increasing service inequality by geographic area.

Online shopping doesn't work without it.  It is therefore particularly necessary to provide postal services in remote, secluded and less densely populated regions. But we also need to retain flexibility, which is why I am pleased that the document we are discussing also takes into account local specificities and the scope of the long-term sustainability of the service, which is extremely important for the Member States.  In addition to domestic services, it is also very important to provide cross-border postal services at transparent and reasonable prices, while using the achievements of the present day, such as cross-border track and trace systems, which are still quite expensive in today's context.

There is no denying the need to ensure, in exceptional circumstances, an adequate margin of flexibility to preserve the sustainability of the service, adapting it to the new needs of users and recent market developments. This is, however, provided that the role and function of universal service, characterised by the pre-eminence of the public interest, does not fail.

The postal services market in Europe is undergoing changes that result in a decrease in demand for basic services. Of course, this process must not mean giving up the obligation for the State to provide universal postal services, but some reflection on the scope and frequency of their provision is needed. Universal operators cannot compete effectively on the commercial services market when they bear the cost of providing services that are unnecessary for consumers' needs. The construction of the Single European Digital Market, particularly in the area of e-commerce, means that the market for parcels, especially those delivered across borders, requires certain regulations that will reduce costs and enable new eri actors in the small and medium-sized enterprises sector to enter the market. Full access to information such as the price of the service, delivery time and return cost is particularly important, which will allow consumers and traders to choose the best postal service.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1711, "date": "2016-09-14.json", "name": "Merja Kyllönen (GUE/NGL).", "mepid": "124736", "text": "   – Mr President, thank you to the rapporteur for his work.

In my country too, when the debate is hot, I would like to say that I do not believe that low population density constitutes an argument for reducing the frequency of distribution under the universal service obligation. Affordable and reliable delivery of postal consignments and parcels is an important basic service for all citizens, but also a lifeline for businesses across Europe. I hope that the structures will not be reformed in a problem-oriented way, but precisely in a solution-oriented way, and we will see that mail delivery is not a burden or an expense, but a key function of society that also builds territorial cohesion.

And the exceptions that are already in place today are very careful, and generosity is absolutely out of place.  I would remind you that the Member State from which I come – Italy – has made a provision that 20% of the population can be exempted from universal service. This means, for example, in my region that of the 116 municipalities, universal service is only guaranteed in around a handful of municipalities; everyone else is looking through their fingers and have to hope for a mail delivery every other day. Well, if the bill comes from the telephone service or the electricity bill a day later, that is not a problem, but when the daily newspaper arrives yesterday, it is indeed a problem. There is nothing older than the daily newspaper from the day before.  That is why we should be very careful with the universal service and oblige the postal services to carry out this service, this obligation.

It has shown the continuing importance of affordable, reliable and sustainable postal services across the EU, and it has underlined the role of postal operators in providing employment. As I said at the outset, the postal market is changing quickly across the EU. I can assure you the Commission is keeping a close eye on developments. I am pleased that, overall, Parliament agrees that there is a need for flexibility in the universal service obligation, within the boundaries set by the Postal Services Directive. I am also pleased that you agree that we need better and more affordable cross-border parcel delivery services. On some of the specific questions raised on this point let me underline the following. The Commission has listened to the European Parliament’s views following the adoption of the Commission’s parcel roadmap in 2013. The proposal for a regulation on cross-border parcel delivery was adopted in May 2016, as part of the Package on the digital single market measures to improve e—commerce. The proposal is not for price regulation like roaming price caps, so one should not draw parallels here and we need to look at parcels and postal services because both are used in e-commerce.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. First of all, a heartfelt thank you to all those who took part in the debate – it has shown that it makes sense for us to have once again dealt with the postal services. The current directive had to be implemented in all Member States by 2013. The Commission has made a communication – it was also its legal obligation – on the implementation of the directive, and that is now Parliament's opinion on this implementation report. In this respect, it also makes sense. I very much regret that our British colleagues from the Conservative side are not only leaving the EU, but are also unable to vote in favour of this report. I would have been very happy to have her in the boat. I would like to draw the attention of the members of the GUE Group to this: I think we have different views on this. This is also reflected in the amendments, which my group will not support. And if you have different views, you have to look at how the votes turn out. In any case, I come from a region where we now have a well-established second service provider, which also supplies mountain areas and rural areas. All this works if the framework conditions are right – and the directive lays the foundations for creating framework conditions so that this can work. But we have also heard that it is not yet working in a number of regions. The report also asks the Commission to ensure that national regulators are properly monitored so that they fully implement European law. The last point I would like to make: we have, of course, already noted that the traditional postal service providers, through the World Postal Association, have tried to fight against this directive, particularly on the issue of charges for cross-border mail. When I think of the fact that, when I was elected here, a letter from my constituency to Brussels cost the same as a letter within my constituency, which is no longer the case today, it shows that the traditional postal service providers could still do a lot for a Europe that is growing together.

This is a drag on the development of e-commerce in the Islands. The ultraperiphery cannot be an impediment to competitiveness in global trade. Removing barriers to e-commerce must be crucial to achieving a true digital single market, without excluding any region. It is imperative to seek solutions so that canaries are not penalized with \"abusive intermediation extracosts\" in postal mailing to and from the Archipelago, and are no longer discriminated against in the virtual market.

I think we need to take the whole palette, because on top of the financial crisis it has become even more pronounced that small and medium-sized enterprises are finding it difficult to raise the capital that is needed. It is also what we are hearing from all the speakers tonight that we need to do more. Today we have heard that Juncker is increasing the entire investment plan. It is also good for small and medium-sized enterprises. Many people have already received funding from the first part of the package. What I would like to highlight this evening is also that the implementation of the Basel rules in Capital Requirements Directive IV has not made it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to obtain bank financing and to obtain financing through mortgage bonds. Now we are faced with a revision of Capital Requirements Directive IV, we are in fact faced with stricter rules again from the Basel Committee, which means that we need to padded even more.
