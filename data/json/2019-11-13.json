Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to greet the previous Presidents of Parliament who are here with us today, in particular President Enrique Barόn Crespo, who was in office on the day of the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Thirty years ago, Germany and Europe lived one of the most important and significant pages in their recent history.  After decades of suffering, the tearful wound of the division of Germany and Europe found its recomposition through the fall of its most obvious and odious symbol. At last, the Wall fell under the pressure of thousands of women and men, anxious to regain their freedom and dignity, after years of oppression and deprivation of their fundamental rights.  I would like to remind you that the success of that night was the result of the determination of millions of Eastern European citizens who peacefully, without any violence, but only through the force of their own reasons, were able to free themselves from the yoke to which they had been subjected for decades.  It is also to the courage of those European citizens that I would like to pay tribute today.  Witnessing those moments was the amazement and joy of hundreds of thousands of German citizens on both side and, alongside them, thousands of young people who had come from all over Europe to share the overwhelming enthusiasm of those hours.  I, in those days, was among those young people, together with many perhaps of you, and I remember the irrepressible happiness, the hugs, the tears, the incredulous gaze of the Vopos who saw their world crumble at the same speed with which the Wall unraed under the blows of the pickaxes.  I also well remember the awareness, well rooted in all of us, of living a unique and unrepeatable moment in history that finally closed a dark page, made up of oppression, mourning, the annulment of freedom and personality, and opened another charge of optimism, of hope.  Today, thirty years after the fall of the Wall, we can say that that enthusiasm and hope have not been betrayed: if the Europe in which we live today is a better place, we owe it to the European Union and to the achievements it has been able to achieve.  I want to make it clear that European democracy, the values and principles on which it is based are unfortunately not irreversible. That is why we need the commitment and determination of all of us to defend them. This is a fight that we have to fight every day, non-stop.  As a witness to those extraordinary days in Berlin, I cannot but look with great concern at the return to Europe of ghosts that we believed dead, buried under the weight of history.  It is with disbelief, but also with immense anger, that we find ourselves seeing how the demon of anti-Semitism is once again entering our Europe today. The unfortunately numerous episodes of recent history come to mind and I am thinking, and we think, of what happened in Halle only a few weeks ago, of the desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Randers in Denmark, of the threats to which Senator Liliana Segre was subjected in Italy.  The resurgence of anti-Semitism is the result of the resurgence of nationalism, xenophobia, racism and the rejection of everything that is different from us. These phenomena are also the breeding ground for terrorism, which threatens Europe and the whole world with acts of violence. Just today marks the anniversary of the tragic events of the Bataclan, a history that belongs to us, the history we lived together, and our moved memory was with the 130 victims who lost their lives that night and their families.  The threat to our values also comes from outside. We are forced to confront interference on a daily basis which seeks to undermine our achievements and the security of European citizens in different forms. We have to be united. Yes united, to respond to these attacks, to strengthen our union, to secure our borders.  It is against these threats that we must fight with great determination and unity if we are to honour the promises made that evening in Berlin, when the Wall was crumbled. I am convinced that this is a battle that we can only win if we are together. And we must do so, by opposing with all our might those who mystify the facts of history, who give simple answers to complex problems, who confuse the legitimate pride that each of us feels for our country, for our country and for our own culture, with hatred and contempt for others.  It's not an easy battle. We often wonder how it is possible today for a European citizen to forget the lesson of the history of our continent and our fathers. A story full of glorious pages, but also of suffering and horrors, like those I mentioned a moment ago.  The answer I find is that of the the need to insist on knowledge and remembrance and I am referring, in particular, to the youngest who have not lived that story, but have learned it perhaps on books or on the internet or on the Internet. It is to them that I wish to address them with particular affection at this time, because it is in them that we place our hopes. Today I want, we want to make our contribution to this challenge here. We are doing so, in the presence of the President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, which we have the honour of having today precisely to remember what happened in Berlin thirty years ago. You have the floor, Mr President.  The word to her after listening to a piece of music that will be the introduction to this ceremony. There will be with us a young Belgian musician, Liav Kerbel, who will play a sarabande by Johan Sebastian Bach. Cellist's entrance.  A video shown on screens shows Mstislav Rostropovich playing Johann Sebastian's Sarabande at the Berlin Wall on November 11, 1989. The video ends when the musician starts playing.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Nothing has to stay as it is – on 9 November 1989, I realised what that meant. The will of my compatriots in the GDR was stronger than the Berlin Wall. Across Central and Eastern Europe, 30 years ago, citizens took their own hands. The transformative force that unfolded achieved what seemed incontrovertible for decades: the fall of the Berlin Wall, the tearing down of the Iron Curtain across Europe. Anyone who has witnessed this moment will never forget it. And anyone who sees the images of that time still feels the force of the feelings associated with them, this moment of happiness – a historical moment that stands for itself. \"We are flying into history\" – that is what the pilot of an American plane told his passengers before landing in Berlin that evening on 9 November. He couldn't keep the incredible news of the open felling trees to himself, and he had an idea of their dimension. The Germans in the GDR, the people of all Central and Eastern Europe, freed themselves from communist rule, from the claim to power of the Soviet Union. Nations found their way back – to actually be people's republics, because in them really determined the citizens. Democracy and the rule of law prevailed, human and civil rights were enshrined, the market economy replaced the planned economy – and although there was no master plan for it, the process of European unification brought together 500 million people in East and West together in peaceful development – for the good. Historically, this is unprecedented. So we keep an awareness of what is possible when people stand up for something together. Especially in a Parliament which serves the necessary dispute, but which should always also have the Common, the common good in mind. That is why, by your invitation – and I am happy to follow it – to speak to you about the fall of the Berlin Wall and the happy historic turning point for the whole of Europe, I am honoured – and gladly accepted it – about the courage of those who have not seen it. who then demonstrated in many places in the GDR, who exerted high personal risk on the frozen state and party leadership, who demanded reforms and freedoms – or who left everything behind for their freedom and fled in their thousands to the West and, last but not least, managed to keep this revolution peaceful in Germany, just as in most other neighbouring states, whether we remember it as a velvet or a singing revolution. The fact that it happened like this is something that you can only marvel at again and again. And it's really a reason to celebrate! During the Cold War, on the western side of the Iron Curtain, the sympathies of dissidents and opponents – Charter 77, Solidarity, and the other civil rights movements, in which the few brave first joined together. Their example encouraged others until it became the mass protests that swept away the old regimes in 1989-90. The West inaimably played a part in the fact that this could succeed – not least through the NATO double decision, which drove the weakened Soviet Union to divert and negotiate. The courage of the people of the East and this firm attitude of the West: both contributed to the fact that the Cold War was overcome 30 years ago. The opening of the wall came as a surprise, but it did not come without harbingers: the election of a Pole as Pope and his powerful visit to his homeland, the powerful Polish trade union movement, the luminous candle demonstration in Bratislava, the 650 km long human chain through the Baltics and last but not least the great humanitarian gesture of the Hungarians at Sopron in the summer of 1989, when they opened the border on their own – these and other signals point to change. Father Imre Kozma of the Hungarian Malteser Relief Service looked after refugees from the GDR at the time and summed up in words how people's attitudes changed in these eventful months: \"Those who have learned to fear were suddenly no longer afraid.\" Not even in the GDR. Incidentally, when the government in the GDR reacted to the mass protests on 9 November with the sudden opening of the border, hardly anyone was as close to the action as some Members of the European Parliament. The Committee on Legal Affairs – that is, the body responsible for citizens' rights of this Parliament! – met from 8 to 10 November 1989 in Berlin in the Reichstag building, directly on the Wall. Parliamentarians dealt with familiar-sounding issues: the legal protection of computer programs and the use of genetically modified microorganisms. They were as unprepared for an event that would change the world, nor were we all prepared. The Parliamentary Committee reacted, as has just Parliamentary committees react: it adopted an opinion. The announcement says soberly that we welcome the events in Berlin. What a contrast to the euphoria of the people! In the night and in the following days, hundreds of thousands of people cheered and marveled at the Berlin border crossings, the checkpoints between the GDR and the Federal Republic. Wild strangers lay in their arms 28 years after the construction of the wall, which was in fact a death strip. At least 140 people lost their lives here. We do not forget them! And we do not forget the suffering of their families and not the many other victims of decades of dictatorships in Eastern Europe. The fact that the members of the european parliament's committee were visibly restraining their joy may also have had to do with the fact that no one knew at the time whether the wall would finally be history. In our heads – our heads – were the images of the violent suppression of the protests: in 1953 in the GDR, in 1956 in Hungary and in 1968 in Czechoslovakia. Remembered were the tanks that were on display when martial law was imposed in Poland in 1981, and the violent end of the student protests in beijing's Tiananmen Square in the summer of 1989. Against this background, European events are once again shining in a particularly bright light. The courage that the people had taken, their vociferous demand for reforms, a voice or a change of power had shaken the foundations of the communist regimes. They knew the consequences of showing weakness. Some still believed that they had to prove strength through particular hardness. Others were no longer able to do so. As different as the civic movements were, and between them were the criticism of the ruling state party, its multi-voiced demands, and its expectations of political change – what united them all was the goal of overcoming the lack of freedom: to shake off permanent control, to get rid of arbitrary rule, to break the boundaries, to leave behind the impartialness of the trapped. Who among the young people in Europe can even imagine today that real freedom for generations was an unfulfillable dream? Today, as citizens of the European Union, in a large democratic area of justice, we are free to decide how we live, where we live, study, work, trade. Everyone is free to express their opinion, no matter how absurd. In a free, democratic Europe, one's own right to stand in the independent courts – united! A dream that has become a reality. We Germans know that without European unification, without the desire of Europeans to grow together in East and West, there would be no German unity. One was the prerequisite for the other, both are two sides of the same coin. The four victorious powers made the state unity of Germany possible by giving us what we could not claim: their trust. Just like our immediate neighbours and the members of the European Community, despite the wounds left on the continent by the Second World War unleashed by Germany. We Germans will never forget this proof of reconciliation! Thanks to the political change of 1989/90, the process of European unification has gained considerable momentum over the past 30 years – from the common internal market and the long-planned economic and monetary union to the euto- until the enlargement of the European Union to include the re-established democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. We share the same values that we have long hoped will be an undisputed victory. This has proved to be an illusion. Instead, our democracies are globally exposed to competition with authoritarian systems that promote themselves with a high promise of efficiency and prosperity, but without granting their citizens what we in the West take for granted: freedom and social justice, progress and sustainability, democracy, the rule of law, universal human rights – all that makes Europe worth living and, for many people around the world, a place of longing, which, incidentally, is still a place of longing for authoritarian rulers all over the world. Sometimes it feels as if we ourselves have the greatest doubt about it. Many people – especially those who once demanded freedom and a say on the streets – are not satisfied, not because they did not value freedom or democracy, but rather because the transitions from tyranny to democratic compromise are always chaotic, such as the British historian Timothy Garton Ash once remarked. Upheavals are associated with pain. What does the West have to offer us? This question was posed by the Polish poet Czeslaw Miosz long before the fall of the Iron Curtain. \"Freedom from something is a lot, but it's too little, it's much less than freedom to something,\" he wrote at the time. What is freedom to something? We must constantly renegotiate the answer to this question – especially since freedom as a value is not alone. Since the French Revolution, we have known about the triad: freedom demands equality and fraternity. That, too, is a European heritage! It meets the needs of the people of Europe. They do not live in a single space – they form a community with many different historical characteristics and national identities. In the West, few have any idea of what it means to have been exposed to dictatorship and foreign rule, sometimes even twice. What do we know about the faults in which people in all the states of the former Eastern Bloc had to prove themselves in the years of upheaval afterwards? For most people, the freedom gained in changing the system was associated with a deep incision, even with impositions. Where we talk intensively about immigration problems throughout Europe for good reason, people in the eastern parts of our continent are often much more concerned with the experience of emigration and its far-reaching consequences. Conversely, many sometimes lack an understanding of how diverse the originally old core Europe and the states that are rallying around it are. The West is more than just wealthy and saturated, spoiled for peace and accustomed to the seemingly self-evident democracy. The transition to a common Europe in East and West remains a major task for all of us, especially in view of the simultaneous rapid changes brought about by globalisation and digitalisation, global migration and climate change, and the dissolving of international liabilities. All of this causes new insecurity, including fear, for many people. However, the freedom that prevails in Europe today after the century of terrible wars and the loss of humanity in the dictatorships is not an imposition! At best, they are side effects, it is actually the freedom of others that causes discomfort and rejection. Liberal Europe is enormously diverse. But we still lack a common public, and there is a lack of platforms to talk across borders about what is common or divisive. Only through the exchange can we arrive at a real pan-European perspective. We can all learn from each other – especially since, by the way, East Germans and Eastern Europeans have something ahead of the people of the West, because they have 30 years of experience with processes of change. This is a valuable experience, especially since we realize that the impositions of globalisation and digitalisation do not stop at anyone. At the political level, we can only really make progress if we perceive and acknowledge each other's perspectives more strongly than before, not in order to make them uncritical, but to better understand each other – and to be able to take community decisions. We always tend to see our own attitude as the only right one. This is shaping many conflicts in Europe. Not only, but also between East and West, sometimes divides seem to deepen again. Therefore, let us not and never jeopardise the greatest achievement of the turn of the epoch of 1989 – that is the overcoming of the division of our continent! In this fundamentally changing world, we will all only play a role if we act together, if we adopt common positions that are shared or at least supported by the people of the Member States. We will only be able to set the tone and stand up for our values if we do justice to them ourselves. And we will only be taken seriously if we substantially step up our joint efforts to provide effective stability to the conflict-prone regions within Europe and in our closer neighbourhood. Freedom can only be defended by those who know and live them – and who not only summon swears them on holidays. Democracy is as important for the stability of society as prosperity and prosperity. Our values tame the delimited processes and provide balance in global competition. But even in our 21st century, they are by no means self-evident and certainly not unchallenged. Jacques Delors has left a warning legacy on this. In the light of the experiences of the violent 20th century, he feared the flare-up of a new Nationalism and an increasing individualism at the same time. Both, he saw it, threaten intra-European solidarity and social cohesion in the Member States of the Union, but above all the 'open universalism' and the capacity for tolerance that characterises our community of values – precisely the heritage of Europe. We should remember his words, Jacques Delors', 'if the EU fails, this legacy is in danger of being lost'. I think the warning remains up-to-date! (Applause) What Delors probably could not have imagined, certainly not wanting: the EU is losing one of its largest members in a torturous process. And our continent is experiencing the return of war and violent border shifts on the eastern border. Moreover, even security partners within NATO are behaving in a way that no critic of the alliance ever thought possible. The rules-based international order is under pressure – and in an increasingly intertwined world, where truth no longer counts and national egoisms are lived out, but where the most pressing questions – world food, migration, climate change, and security – can only be answered globally. This is the point of political reason: more cooperation is needed. This applies to the EU's external relations, but it also applies to intra-European coexistence. Europe can only act if the Member States cooperate. Cohesion is a prerequisite for Europe to become 'world-politically capable', as Jean-Claude Juncker has called it. We must overcome small-mindedness, self-centeredness and fear. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the 30 years that have passed since then show that nothing has to remain as it is. The most massive walls can fall, change is possible if we take them into our hands. It is up to us. Then Europe can learn from the grandiose change of the world of 1989/90: we are free to act courageously.

A young person who is allowed to experience a lot of new things every day. But when I saw the tears in the eyes of my parents, my acquaintances and my friends, and when I saw the pictures in the TV shows first of the Prague embassy at the time and then of the fall of the Wall, I felt that we were feeling: here we are experiencing history. It was wonderful when the first compatriots arrived with me – in my homeland in Lower Bavaria – with the so-called Trabbis. We intuitively sensed that what belongs together comes together here. As a German, I was deeply impressed when I saw the people of Leipzig, Dresden and East Berlin taking to the streets. I am deeply grateful to them for their courage, for their desire for unity in freedom, for their sense of citizenship. They created values that still shape us to this day. The citizens are the heroes of unity. Her voice was heard because strong allies did not let her down. One of my first key political experiences was when Ronald Reagan stood in front of the Brandenburg Gate two years before the fall of the Iron Curtain and asked Gorbachev to tear down the wall. The European Community, NATO and all its members have always been united on one point: the division of Europe must be overcome. The support that the Americans and Europeans had for the Germans 30 years ago was a real gift.  This advance of confidence was far from self-evident after two destructive world wars. We should always remember this confidence of our allies when, today – including in Germany – we sometimes discuss the future of Europe in a small and critical way. The friends of Germany did not paint the failure on the wall. They saw the future, they trusted, they were real statesmen and stateswomen in many areas. Dear Wolfgang Schäuble! The way in which you negotiated the German Unification Treaty has been historic and, more importantly, successful. My political generation owes an enormous amount to them, Theo Waigel and Helmut Kohl. Even then, there were many concerns. I read them in the newspapers, heard them at university, in the shop, while shopping. Not everyone was enthusiastic about the developments at the time. But you were not impressed by it, you showed leadership. Your actions, your foresight were formative. Thank you for that. We can also need this leadership today. No one doubts today: German and European unity are inextricably linked. Helmut Kohl was always a German patriot. But he never left any doubt: a united democratic Europe is our common mission. He was literally committed to the European project to the last gear. What an ardent European, what a great statesman Helmut Kohl was, everyone experienced at the end of his work when we said goodbye to him in the Strasbourg Chamber. The father of German unity said goodbye in the European Parliament. Helmut Kohl knew that the fall of the Berlin Wall was not a national, singular event, nor a national feat. We Germans owe unity in freedom to the courage of thousands of friends in Eastern Europe. Politicians such as Lech Wasa, Véclav Havel, and Jozsef Antall also fought not only for the freedom of their own country, but for the whole of Europe. We should uphold the spirit of peaceful revolution, the spirit of peaceful awakening, also in our generation. Today, a lot of small-scale people dominate everyday political life. Today, however, we are faced with major challenges. We can learn from the fall of the Wall: we can only create something great if we stand together in Europe. Europe is the key to a better future, a livable future, and for that it is necessary to work today on european awareness.  I love my homeland of Bavaria, I like to be German, and I am a European in my heart. We must not allow nationalists and populists to destroy this unity of identity. I like being European.

It was a moment of illusion, the illusion of hope. What happened that night changed the lives of European peoples forever; the images of the euphoric crowd above the wall, the queues of people and the cars crossing back and forth were an explosion of happiness.  The bipolar world in which Europe had lived for decades, which seemed eternal and immovable, had already collapsed, at a time of meaning, because it commemorated two of the darkest episodes in our history: on the one hand, the anniversary of Broken Crystal Night when, on November 9, 1938, the Nazis committed the first great slaughter against the Jews; and, on the other hand, in 1989 it was half a century from the beginning of World War II.  The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the triumph of liberal democracies in the face of the Soviet blockade, inaugurating a stage of hope in which We Europeans believe that nothing could stop the expansion of human rights, free elections and the rule of law. Within weeks, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, among others, got rid of their dictatorships to adopt the Western parliamentary democracy model.  But thirty years later, new walls separate Europeans. Now these walls are ideological—between nationalists and Europeanists—they are territorial—between the great cities and the rural world—or classes—between rich and impoverished workers. While support for democracy is widespread in much of the world and, of course, in Europe, populists are gaining ground, and this forces us to make a deep reflection to avoid returning to dark stages of our history.  1989 was a moment of hope and victory for the West and for the values we stand for. Getting it wasn't easy. Our biggest mistake is forgetting what it means to defend freedom.  Thirty years later, it is easy to forget that German reunification was riddled with uncertainties and misgivings. Some thought it would be such an immense economic and social effort for Germany that it would wipe out the European locomotive and, as a consequence, the European Community. Others warned of the danger of resurrecting an old enemy buried since World War II.  No one like Helmut Kohl knew how to pick up the feelings of European partners. In his memoirs, he recalled the lack of support and confessed: \"Among our European allies, there was only one who strongly supported us from the outing point: the Spanish President, Felipe González, who did not hesitate for a moment about what position he should take.\"  If in 1989 it was possible, we must now also be able to respond to the uncertainties that threaten our model of coexistence. The European Union is, above all, peace, freedom, progress. Let us walk with these values and make our Union the most advanced model of integration and social justice, and may this anniversary serve to restore hope.  In 1989 I was also a young woman, more than Mr. Weber. I was fifteen years old—almost as young as my country's democracy—but I was already beginning to build my political conscience and I was aware that this was an important day for Europe's history. But I could never imagine that today I would have the honour and pride of representing the Social Democratic family in this European Parliament. For me it is a pride, but above all a great responsibility, to take the witness of the men and women who built such an important moment for our political project and to guarantee peace, freedom and justice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Dacian Cioloş", "mepid": "197631", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew group. – Mr President, in November 1989 I was 20 years old. I was in my first year of college and i was living one of the toughest communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe – Ceaușescu's. About the fall of the Berlin Wall we heard only a few days after this happened, speaking on Radio Free Europe, the radio that allowed us to connect illegally, at that time, to the rest of the world.  On 9 November 1989, a wall separating Europe in two was destroyed, and with it began, at least in Europe, the end of a regime that survived only by limiting the freedoms and rights of citizens by the state.  The fall of the Berlin Wall had a domino effect. Only a month and a half later, Ceaușescu's communist national regime was over. Like other young people of my age, like other Romanians, like other central Europeans, we were thirsty for freedom, democracy and Europe, for on the streets of Timişoara, where movements began in Romania, or in Bucharest, demonstrators were already invoking Europe. The aim of the vast majority of those who were in the streets was to return to the values of European democracy and civilization, as the Timişoara Proclamation says.  If thirty years ago a wave of democratisation was felt in Europe, but also in other parts of the world, for more than ten years freedom and democracy have been losing ground worldwide. More than half of the world's citizens live in political regimes devoid of or partly devoid of fundamental freedoms, and in Europe the temptation to build walls again continues to threaten us. And those of my generation who lived with the wall and without the wall. We can't help but see this similarity.  Brexit, for example, means new barriers to trade and freedom of movement. I hope that British citizens who have always fought for a free Europe will think twice before building new frontiers. The reaction of some when it comes to Europe's migration challenges is to call on new walls. The walls have no place on this continent, we do not want to build a fortress Europe. Rather, we need to build bridges and close partnerships with the countries in Europe's neighbourhood.  Colleagues, walls are not only physical, they are also barriers imposed by fear to political freedom and prosperity. Political parties and leaders with authoritarian tendencies in Europe, who want their country or Europe to flirt again with the dictatorship of the past, must be stopped. European democracy and freedom must be defended by those who have no hesitation today in taking advantage of the benefits of membership of the European Union, but who reject its values. Thirty years after the fall of Berlin we have a responsibility to defend the ideals and values in whose name this wall has been destroyed: freedom, democracy, prosperity and the European Union.  In the coming months we will have to launch a European-wide conference on our common future, involving all the citizens of the European Union, in order to lay the foundations for a new European project that inspires confidence for years to come, because I, as a Romanian, cannot conceive of being Romanian without being European in the same sense, and I am convinced that all , regardless of the ideologies we have, we feel this. And then why not express these things naturally and convey this feeling, the European project that we support?", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, thirty years ago, the Wall did not just fall, it was brought down by very courageous people, people who took a very high and very concrete personal risk. They fought for fair and free elections, for the freedom of expression, for an end to being caged-in and under constant observation – all those things that we take for granted right now. But back then, those demands could get you into prison, they could get you tortured, lose your job and lose your social connections. But despite all of those risks, people took to the streets, organised already long before 1989, and never gave up. It is this courage that changed the world and it is this courage that’s still changing the world today. Also today, we need to be vigilant, not to forget the lessons from 1989. Democracy needs to be gained every day again and again, in every action that we do here in this House but also everywhere in Europe. Unfortunately, there are governments right now who are trying to dismantle democracy, bit by bit. This is a disgrace, especially given the sacrifices that the citizens in countries like Hungary made to free their country. Those who shut down universities, those who arrest civil society and build walls against refugees, they are betraying the demonstrators from 1989. (Applause) Freedom is something that needs to be expanded every day as well and too many people are still not free in this world, not free for who they are, whom they love or where they’re from. We are all citizens of this world, born free and born equal. Discrimination and hatred should not prevail. Freedom of expression is also being curbed when hatred and threats are being issued and used against people active in politics, active in their communities. When people there are faced with threats on an everyday level, then this is a problem for freedom of expression, as well as democracy. Constant observation is also becoming a trend again, but we should never forget what history teaches us – surveillance, a control state, does not lead to freedom or security. It ends both. We don’t know what the future will bring, and any law we do here always needs to work also when governments don’t mean well. Things have changed a lot over the past years, over the past 30 years especially. If you look at the border zone now that once divided Germany, where hundreds of people lost their lives trying to cross looking for freedom, often also being assisted by other people who helped them, this area is now a major production area, safeguarding climate and biodiversity for the future generations and becoming a symbol of hope. The borders that divided Europe have now become places where people meet, get to know each other. But let’s not forget, there are many walls still up today that need to be torn down. There are many people today, as back then, who are looking for freedom. Let us not turn our back on them. Let us not forget what it means to look for freedom, to not have it and then to gain it. Without the courageous people thirty years ago, I wouldn’t be here and many colleagues would not be either. Europe as we know it, only exists because the wall that divided us all finally was torn down. But 9 November 1989 is not a date where we should hold commemoratory speeches and just congratulate each other on how well it all worked back then. I believe it is an anniversary to remind us to be courageous, to tear down the walls that divide us and to be the change that we want to see in the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Jörg Meuthen", "mepid": "190518", "text": "  On behalf of the ID Group, I would like to make a i-see of the Mr President, President of the Bundestag, Dr Schäuble, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President of the Bundestag, Mr Schäuble, for the work he has done on this report. Thirty years ago, in one of the happiest hours in German history, the wall fell. Our compatriots in the former GDR took to the streets in a totalitarian and brutal system. They demonstrated that they risked their health, even their lives. This heroic and consistently peaceful operation eventually brought down the wall and imploded a socialist regime of injustice.  So far, so pleasing, really, so beautiful! But what was supposedly swept away by the peaceful revolution at that time is now back. Socialism and communism were not finally defeated at that time, as hoped. He is alive, he is just getting up in front of all of us. Today, even the Successors of the SED are deeply hypocritical lyrical, as are the Socialist Greens and the Social Democrats. At that time they all wanted to prevent German reunification at all costs!  Berlin itself is now governed by a deep-red Senate that seeks expropriations and destroys the price mechanism to prepare for just that. The Socialists and Communists sit in the German Bundestag, and they grin a blatant grin here in the plenary of the European Parliament, where they implement their freedom-destroying agenda every day: a planned economy instead of a market economy, correctness dictates instead of true freedom of expression. Is the lesson of history still not learned? Every kind of socialism always and without exception brings poverty, impoverishment, terrible injustice and violence. All of this, unfortunately, is undefeated. One last thing: if you look at the festivities of these days, you might think that people today were celebrating the European Union and not the atm in gaining German unity. The peaceful revolutionaries of 1989, however, did not chant \"EU, united fatherland\", but shouted \"Germany, united fatherland\". They fought for freedom, for identity, for democracy and – yes – for Germany's national sovereignty. They did not fight for socialism through the back door, nor did they fight for the European Union. Meanwhile, here you are working to overcome the nation states in favour of an identityless nothingness called the United States of Europe. You will see sooner or later that the freedom-loving citizens of Europe will also bring down this absurd tower in Babel, because that is why people did not take to the streets in 1989 and risked their heads and necks and their lives. If we do not return to a Europe of sovereign fatherlands, in which nations continue to exist peacefully and cooperate meaningfully with each other, the EU as a whole will one day implode, and Brexit will only have been the first beginning of this implosion.

More murderous, perhaps, than German national socialism. As somebody who, for many years, lived in a communist country, I feel it is my duty to repeat this truth over and over again. I’m afraid that what I’m going to say will be rather bitter and out of tune with what has been said before. The division between those who supported communism and those that opposed it, at that time, was far from clear. Let me remind you that in the 1970s and 1990s, the Soviet Union became a vital part of the international order. It was accepted as such. The West European governments conducted realpolitik towards the Soviet regime and accommodated its aspirations. For the same reason, those governments looked at the anti-communist movements within the Soviet bloc with suspicion, treating them as trouble- makers, courageous, politically naive yet jeopardising the international order. These movements disturbed the détente, they disturbed the Ost politik. They stood in the way of the policy of the majority of West European governments which were, or had been for a long time, openly pro-Soviet. The involvement of the Western elites in the legitimisation of communism had serious consequences. The communists continued their careers afterwards, after the system fell, and some of them joined the European Parliament, joined the European institutions, some are still here. They rebranded themselves as Social Democrats, jumped from the bandwagon called the Soviet system to another bandwagon, which is called the European Union and they were greeted heartily. Overnight, the apparatchiks, the Partiegenossen became enthusiastically European. Super-duper European. The communist system should have discredited the political Left in Europe. Unfortunately, it didn’t. In fact, the Left acquired a dominant position in Europe after the demise of the Soviet Union. The Christian Democratic, Conservative, Republican parties have capitulated to the Left agenda, which I find rather pathetic, and as a result, the spirit of communism lives on in Europe. It has been recycled, it has been garnished, has been updated, has been slightly civilised, remodelled, but it is there alright. The Left always had totalitarian temptations and no wonder they continue the policies which I remember very well from my young days living in a communist society. Today we are more and more in the grip of one correct ideology, with political correctness running wild. We had a sample of it here, right here at this session. We tend to create a new form of de facto one party system which is called political mainstream. Again, we had a sample of it this afternoon. We have militant, aggressive, secularist and barbaric social engineering. Again, these were the trademarks of the communist system. We have a neo-Marxists very much alive and kicking today. So all this considered, ladies and gentlemen, the anniversary is fine. We all remember those great days, but it is not the time for sentimental ruminations and it is not time for political self righteousness. it is time for a revision, and I mean it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Martin Schirdewan", "mepid": "190517", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Unfortunately, as far as the debate is at hand, it has to be said that not all the speakers have fulfilled the great task. But I would like to thank those who have expressed their views in a differentiated way. \"It's like someone has opened the windows. After all these years of stagnation. The intellectual, economic, political,\" Stefan Heym said at the large demonstration on Berlin's Alexanderplatz on November 4, 1989. With the wall that fell five days later, the Iron Curtain fell piece by piece, separating Eastern and Western Europe economically, militarily and not least ideologically. It is crucial to the merit of the East Germans, who for months demonstrated for democracy and freedoms that we can have this debate here today – 30 years later – in the European Parliament. Thank you for that, too. Mr President, I myself was born in East Berlin and i experienced the Wall as a child. This also gives me the opportunity to tell a more nuanced story than the previous two speakers. According to the german government's latest report on the state of German unity, the vast majority of East Germans are dissatisfied with the way German unity and the post-reunification period have gone – Mr Schäuble, you pointed this out. And why? I would like to give you an example, ladies and gentlemen. Today, East Germans still have to work more hours per week and at the same time earn less than their West German counterparts. East Germany has the largest low-wage sector in the whole of the European Union, measured by national values, of course. In other words, 30 years after the political change, we need a social change, not only for Germany, but for the whole of the European Union. But it is not only social and economic development that still draws boundaries that should have disappeared long ago. It is also the mistakes that have been made in the way we deal with East and West – by which I mean not only East Germany and West Germany, but also between East and Western Europe – in recent years. I will give you another example, that of the writer Stefan Heym, who I quoted at the beginning. He comes from a Jewish-German family. He fled the Nazis to the United States as an anti-fascist and returned to Germany as a soldier in the US Army to liberate Germany from Nazism. In 1952, when he is a US citizen, he decided – and he is already an internationally recognized writer – to settle in the GDR. In 1994 – a few years later, that is, after the fall of the Berlin Wall – he was elected to the Bundestag as a non-party member on my party's list and became president of the old age there, and unfortunately, my dear fellow Members, the conservative group left the Chamber closed when he was elected. Mr Schäuble, you will remember that. I think this is a major historical mistake. I think it was a cultural breach.  These are the stories of victories and defeats. These are life stories that must be told and heard today, also in order to stop the attempts of the extreme right to capture the history of German unity, the history of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the history of European unification, as we have unfortunately had to experience again today.  The people of Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and, not least, the GDR wanted a future in an open, peaceful, liberal Europe. They, on the other hand, represent a Europe of the past, nationalism and new walls. Anyone who wants to build walls on the external borders of the European Union again today, who is pursuing a policy that leads to people fleeing, instead of seeking help, has understood nothing, but nothing at all about the fall of the Berlin Wall and European unification.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Mislav Kolakušić (NI).", "mepid": "197438", "text": "   – Dear Chairman, the demolition of the Berlin Wall is one of the greatest events in Europe's modern history. The brave German citizens of East Germany, in that regime that was extremely oppressive, were not afraid to take to the streets and bring down the Berlin Wall united.  The demolition of the Berlin Wall made it possible to create a new, modern Europe. It has enabled many other states and peoples to become free and independent in their own states. Unfortunately, the independence of the Republic of Croatia was paid for with more than twenty thousand citizens killed. However, a great opportunity has been created to create a modern Europe in which we can all live with dignity. The European Union is a condition for creating a modern democratic Europe. However, we must be aware that even thirty years after the Berlin Wall was demolished, there are some new walls between member states.  On the borders of Croatia there is barbed wire installed by the other two members of the European Union, Slovenia and Hungary. That's something for every conviction. We have to protect the borders together. In addition to that barbed wire, we have another wall, and that is the Schengen wall. All Member States must be within the Schengen area.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. When I was born, it would have been a bold dream for us to decide on our common future in a European Parliament with Members from East and West. In my year of birth, the wall was built, which for me, as for many Europeans, is closely linked to personal history. When I was a young soldier, the Cold War was so icy that I was trained to fight against those with whom I am now united in a Union. In the year when the wall fell, our son Mark was born, and when Europe finally became one again with the eastward enlargement in 2004, our son Max was born. Our children, like a whole generation of young people, have the privilege of knowing Europe exclusively as a continent of peace, freedom and unity, and we owe this to the peaceful revolution of 1989. It is the most formative political event of our lives for me and all those who have been lucky enough to experience it. It is also the victory of European values, because the longing of the people for freedom was greater than the fear, their desire for democracy more powerful than the ideology and its cohesion more powerful than the regimes in East Germany, Central and Eastern Europe. It was the civil courage of these people that rewrote the history of our continent, and their civil courage was truly European. The spark of freedom was also ignited by the neighbours at that time: at the Polish Solidarity as well as at the Pan-European picnic on the Hungarian-Austrian border and at the Baltic Way. What belongs together is growing together, as Willy Brandt said, and he meant not only Germany, but the whole of Europe. We also owe this united Europe to the courageous actions of neighbours and partners who opened up to a reunited Germany in the heart of the continent. That was not self-evident at the time. This was not only a bold step for US President George Bush and ex-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, but was also important for France and Great Britain. It meant embedding Germany in Europe and daring a whole new dimension of Europe: a Europe that reunites its two halves, uniting Western, Central and Eastern Europe into a single continent. That is exactly what we have seen over the last 30 years. I remember well that before the fall of the Berlin Wall I could feel and see if I was in the west or in the east, and that was not only due to the special scent of the Trabbis and the GDR cigarettes. On the other hand, if I travel with my children in Eastern or Western Europe today, there are still cultural differences, because diversity is Europe's wealth, but you cannot see where people come from. They are interested in the same issues and have the same concerns and hopes and dreams. There is no longer the old and the new Europe in the traditional sense. Nor is it the case that the East has been added to the West. No, we have grown together into our Europe! One of the greatest successes after the fall of the Iron Curtain was, as Mr Havel aptly described it, that East and West are no longer moral names, but have become purely geographical terms. Democracy, freedom and human rights are the foundations of our Europe. The rule of law must govern in Europe. This was, is and remains the main mission of the peaceful revolution in 1989. Freedom and equal rights for all – unity and justice and freedom, I would say. It is the responsibility of all of us to respect and defend these values. They are the true achievement of Europe. Only in this way could Europe, united in solidarity, become a continental success. Our successful internal market creates jobs, guarantees access to education and health insurance and creates opportunities for everyone. We must therefore resolutely oppose all those who, in the so-called national interest, conjure up East Algie or WestAlgia or other unprecedented pasts in order to play East and West against each other in Germany as well as in Europe. There are still challenges in growing together. We are all aware of this. But that does not change the fact that the EU is the best that could happen to East and West. It must be clear to us that anyone who plays with Europe is playing the future. And anyone who really wants to act in the interests of their country is counting on Europe. Only together can we play our weight on the world stage and help shape the rules of the game. If we want to continue the mission of the people of 1989 today, then we must also show European courage, and that also means courage for Europe. This is because the challenges of We can only master the future – from climate change to the digital revolution – with united forces. At the award of the Nobel Prize in 1971, Willy Brandt said that peace was not a primal state, but that it had to be made again and again by men; Social justice is crucial for lasting peace. Because, according to Brandt, material hardship is concrete non-freedom. Our common European task remains to overcome this. Working on this is Europe's destiny. Dear Wolfgang Schäuble, thank you very much for showing us what we are fighting for. And dear Mr Meuthen, thank you very much for showing us what we are fighting against.

I do this not only in the capacity of the minister holding the rotating Presidency of the Council, but above all, I do it as a European citizen.  This task makes me very humble because, although I was very young, I very well remember the difficult times when Europe was divided. In the middle of Europe, Germany was split in two and the great city of Berlin was divided by the wall. The wall that, for decades, separated family members from one another. The wall that meant the final stop for fundamental rights and freedoms. The wall that ruthlessly ended the lives of many of those trying to get to the other side.  All of this happened in the heart of Europe. For younger generations, this may now seem someunwhat unreal and even very distant, but you do not have to look at European maps further back than the 1980s to understand that it was not so long ago when Europe looked very different to how it looks today. But, over time, the will of the people seeking freedom, seeking human rights and seeking prosperity, prevailed.  It all became real in Berlin. It literally tore down the wall. This was the wind of change that swept across Europe and resulted in the collapse of the Iron Curtain. In Europe this paved the way for the deepening of European integration and similarly it paved the way for the enlargement of the European Union, of our precious Union. Ladies and gentlemen! Despite this great change, which was achieved 30 years ago by the courageous and decisive action of the peoples on the then east side of the Iron Curtain, we are facing challenges in Europe. Some of the achievements in the European Union are perhaps too self-evident. Around the world, we are seeing tendencies to build new walls rather than tear them down.  We are seeing signs that genuine international cooperation is being called into question. In such a turbulent and unpredictable period, it is good to return to the basics and recall the fundamental values that led to a great change 30 years ago. That is why I am proud to say here in the European Parliament that democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights must be defended time and again, because they are the cornerstones of the European Union. I would like to make it quite clear that authoritarianism, totalitarianism or nationalism must never be our answer. Our choice should always be freedom. Our choice should always be democracy, and our choice should always be human rights.  Mr Schäuble, you said that we share the same values. That's right. But not only us, but the whole world. These values are the values of the whole world, recognized by the United Nations.  Ladies and gentlemen! \"Now what belongs together is growing together.\" When the Berlin Wall fell, these were the wise words of the former Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Willy Brandt, who was also formerly the mayor of West Berlin and had seen the European division in a very concrete way. I firmly believe that the message of unity is also the key to the success of the European Union. We can only be strong together, and we need a United Europe, not a Europe that divides.

This subject is very close to my heart. Thus I note with great pleasure the attention the European Parliament is giving to the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In Finland we will celebrate this special day with different events, among which children will take over the government and work together with Ministers, including myself, on 20 November. The European Union recognises every child as a right holder and seeks to promote the protection of the rights of the child throughout the world.  Children’s rights are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and they are the subject of particular attention when the application of the Charter is reviewed by the Council every year.  The Presidency conclusions of October 2018 addressed the rights of categories of children who are extremely vulnerable, such as Roma children and children in migration. Funding from the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, and the Justice Programme, allows Member States’ institutions, as well as actors from civil society, to bring forward important projects related to children’s rights. We are confident that this focus will be maintained also for the programmes to be agreed in the framework of the next multiannual financial framework.  At the same time, the European Union is committed to mainstreaming human rights, including children’s rights, across all policy sectors in the context of its external action, as reaffirmed in the global strategy. In all policies affecting children, the main principle should be to ensure the best interests of the child.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which we celebrate the 30th anniversary, is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history. All EU Member States are party to it. The Convention and its three optional protocols constitute the primary international standards in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child. The EU will continue to support and encourage partner countries to ratify and implement these instruments. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has been instrumental in improving children’s lives across the world ever since its adoption. Many challenges still remain.  Millions of children are on the move, uprooted from their homes as migrants, refugees, internally displaced, separated from their parents and care givers, raised in institutions or used as soldiers in armed conflict. They are trapped in forced labour and thus denied their rights to education and play.  Violence, abuse, poverty and discrimination, which children are exposed to, this particularly vulnerable group, also continue to persist. Determined to respond to all these challenges and to reconfirm its commitment to the rights of all children, in 2017 the EU updated its guidelines for the promotion and protection of the rights of the child.  The guidelines are grounded in a rights-based approach and their guiding principle is to leave no child behind, in line with the 2030 agenda on sustainable development.  The Council considers it important that these guidelines promote a systems—strengthening approach by identifying all the necessary measures, structures and actors which need to be in place to protect all the rights of all children, including, and especially, those in the most vulnerable and marginalised situations. In its conclusions of 2017 the Council reaffirmed the importance of promoting gender equality between all boys and girls by paying particular attention to addressing gender—based discrimination and violence, including sexual violence and ensuring the empowerment of girls, because it is often girls who are left furthest behind.  The EU is committed to fighting all forms of harmful practices to which girls are especially exposed, for instance child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.  The 30th anniversary of the United Nations Convention is an opportunity to celebrate the progress achieved, but also to look at what still needs to be done. It is time to get ready for the newly emerging challenges, such as the threat of bullying, online as well as offline, and the protection of children in situations of conflict and displacement due to the climate crisis.  In multilateral fora, the EU has been very active on children’s rights and is determined to keep the issue prominently on the international agenda. The European Union has had longstanding cooperation with a group of Latin—American and Caribbean countries. An example of this is the annual resolutions presented at the United Nations Human Rights Council and the United Nations General Assembly’s Third Committee. This year, during the March session of the Human Rights Council, the theme of the resolution was empowering children with disabilities for the enjoyment of their human rights, including through inclusive education. The topic of the resolution recently presented at the United Nations General Assembly Third Committee is children without parental care. Honourable President, honourable Members, as set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, children’s rights are universal. Universal is also the experience of being a child. In the words of Antoine De Saint—Exupéry, all grown—ups were once children. Those who are children today are also the leaders of tomorrow. If their full potential is realised, they can be the greatest agents of change and sustainable development in their communities and globally.  The European Union will continue to stand up for the rights of every child to reach their full potential, in line with the Convention and its optional protocols.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 43, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, this year we mark the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. We often speak about its revolutionary character, as it contributed to change in the way the world looked at children. They are not only seen as a group of people who need protection. They are also seen as rights-holders who can play an active role in society. We see this very strongly in the climate change protests and the marches all around the world. Children are making their voices heard and are demanding that world leaders act to tackle climate change. And in the EU we have made the protection and promotion of children’s rights a priority over the past years. All EU Member States are party to the Convention. The rights of the child are enshrined in the European Charter for Fundamental Rights, which binds the EU institutions in our work, and Member States when they are implementing EU law. We have a strong body of law in several areas of EU competence, which ensures the protection of children’s rights. For example, we have the Directive on Combating the Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children, the whole body of law in the area of asylum and we have the Victims’ Rights Directive and the Directive on procedural safeguards for children who are suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings. In addition to EU law, we have progressed significantly in putting children higher on the political agenda at EU level. We also have funding available for the protection of children’s rights under our Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, in addition to all EU funds, which can contribute to this objective, if confirmed. We published a communication on the protection of children in migration in 2017 and we monitor regularly how the Member States and EU agencies implement the actions proposed in it. However, we still have 25 million children living in poverty in the European Union. We have children who are victims of abuse, exploitation and trafficking in human beings. We have children who suffer from mental health problems, who are victims of bullies and who commit suicide. We still have a long way to go to make sure that all children, regardless of their origin, socio-economic background and migration status, can fully enjoy their rights. I very much welcome the attention that the European Parliament has consistently put on children’s rights. We have worked hand in hand for this objective over the past five years, and as you know, the incoming Commission is committed to continue working on the protection of children’s rights. Dubravka Šuica, the Vice-President-designate for Democracy and Demography, has been entrusted with the preparation of a new comprehensive strategy for the rights of the child and with the delivery of a child guarantee.

The Convention has contributed both to highlighting the exceptional importance of the rights of the child and to ensuring that Member States and their governments recognise their responsibilities in this area. Knowing precisely that children's rights are human rights, we have special obligations. We have a duty to promote and protect the rights of the child, both in our internal and external policies. First, children have the right to childhood, to physical and mental development in a safe and healthy environment. They have the right to education and services to help them become independent, happy and healthy adults. Children have the right to family life. Finally, they have the right to protection against all forms of violence, discrimination and exploitation.  Approaching the 30th anniversary of the Convention and appreciating all the progress made to uphold these rights, it is also time to reflect on what has not yet been achieved. According to Eurostat, children are still the age group most at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Violence against children remains a real threat, both offline and online, both in the social and family environment.  More needs to be done to ensure that judicial systems meet the specific needs of children and defend their interests in dealing with the law, treat them individually rather than objectically.

But today, what we are talking about is the clear advance we have made since the Convention, but also the huge challenges we have. I heard the Commissioner talking about the strong body of law that we currently have, and I believe that what we should be doing today, in honour of this anniversary and all of the many people from across society who have worked in this area, is to understand that this strong body of law on sexual abuse and exploitation, victims’ rights, procedural safeguards – I would add the Child Guarantee to fight child poverty – all of these things must come alive and they must mean something to the millions of children who face challenges. I would say, in the final seconds of my contribution, that just one example of this is that, globally, at least 30 million children have migrated across borders or have been forcibly displaced. One-third of the refugees and migrants who have arrived in Europe are children, some of them unaccompanied. We need to understand that the guidelines which were grounded in a rights-based approach must also address how they are being treated. There are 4 000 unaccompanied children in Greece right now, enduring unsafe and inhumane and degrading treatment. This is something that is a challenge for the whole of the European Union, both for our children, who are doing well in the European Union, but those who are not doing well.

I also think that we have achieved a great deal. But I would also like to point out today that we are still failing, because unfortunately we cannot yet say that the rights of the child are universal. Just look at the figures: one in three children under the age of five is malnourished, despite the right to food; almost one in five children lives in areas affected by violence and conflict, despite the right to a safe home; 262 million children do not go to school, despite the right to education. Every day, children are sexually exploited, despite the right to protection from exploitation. Children worldwide make up more than half of the refugees. Mrs Jourová, you know that I am making a point of this: more than 10 000 unaccompanied child asylum seekers are currently missing in Europe! Yesterday, a conference in this context was called a baffling figure. When we ask what happened to these children, Europol says (in 2019!): they are in another country without us knowing, or they are being sexually exploited, or they have ended up in child labour, or, finally, they are being killed for their organs. Let us use this 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to step up our commitment and to tackle these issues of asylum and migration.

Madam President, thirty years after its adoption, the International Convention on the Rights of the Child is a more widely ratified international text, since only two countries - the United States and Somalia - have not done so. This text is based on four fundamental principles: non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, the right to live, survive and develop, and respect for the views of the child. Thirty years to build a world fit for children. Have we done that? There is no denying the halving of child mortality for children under five, as well as the number of children without access to adequate food, and this is also due to the fieldwork that has been carried out and which should be welcomed. But, on the test of the facts, this binding text becomes a pipe dream, as has been pointed out. Violations of children's rights are legion in Europe as in the world: hotspots, detention of migrant children, 30,000 children from migration missing in Europe, non-compliance with the right to private and family life for LGBT children and families, responsibility for European children of foreign fighters, the deaths of one in four children due to environmental risks, the risk of poverty for one in four children, child labour - 150 million children are affected. In short, a world where discrimination related to LGBT gender, race, disability and other aspects prevents effective equality. Respecting the rights of the child enshrined in the Convention means enabling children to become critical, active, creative, responsible and supportive citizens.

I think that the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is a sign, which must certainly be emphasised. And the points that most countries around the world agreed on must also be emphasised. Most countries have also ratified it, or made a commitment to it. The first point says very clearly \"for the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being\" or every human being must be protected, including the lives of children. The European Court of Justice ruled a few years ago that human life begins from conception. This means that unborn children also have the right to life. There are now many countries in the European Union where, for example, 200 to 400 unborn children are taken from their lives compared to 1 000 live births, meaning that around one in three children do not have the right to life, which is certainly not in line with this convention and is certainly not in line with the European values that we are trying to defend here. The second and third points are interlinking, especially as regards children used in the human business. When we talk about surrogacy, which is common in so many countries that have ratified this convention, such as Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, the United States, children are being used for commercial purposes to sell to those who want to buy this child. Whether it's families who otherwise don't have children, or same-sex people who are just trying to satisfy their own shortcomings or their sense of misfortune. In Georgia, for example, there is a nice page like surrogacyforgay.com, and unfortunately these children do not have the right to choose the family they are sold to, and they also have no right to a mother-father, which should be the human right of every child.

Throughout the world, children and adolescents in different contexts suffer serious violations of their rights, for example through sexual and labour exploitation, or are involved in armed conflicts and migratory flows, and are forced not to attend or leave school, become victims of violence, abuse, age and gender discrimination. The situation worsens if you belong to particularly vulnerable social groups, as in the case of refugees and the disabled, and new threats also come from the web.  Intolerable situations are also occurring in the European Union, with millions of children living in low-income families, where living conditions are unacceptable. One in four European children is at risk of poverty or social exclusion.  The European Union is called upon to act with one voice in countering this reality.

A strong Union must concern itself first and foremost with the most vulnerable, and these are children in our society.

The situation is very serious when we consider that, in Japanese law, there is no shared custody of children. The abduction of children by a parent is not considered a crime and there is in fact no legal consequence against the foster parent who does not comply with the sentences. All this is done in defiance of the rights guaranteed to children in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Japan in 1994, and in violation of the right of parents to maintain a link with their children. In the face of this violation, we cannot, and cannot remain silent, all the more so when it directly affects the citizens of Europe. Many parents, mostly Italians, Germans and French, expect the problem to be recognised and discussed, they expect concrete action, in short, they expect support and help from the European Union.

Therefore, and as a father, I recognize the important role of society in supporting parents.

They must be heard and have a voice in decisions that concern them. We must take this into account in the development of our policy. Every child must be the norm for our political action.

A family, as a key part of society and a natural environment for the development and kindness of all its members, and especially children, must be shrouded in basic protection and support in order to fully fulfil its obligations in society. A child must be cultivated in a family environment, in an atmosphere dominated by happiness, love and understanding, for the full and harmonious development of his personality. The need to envelop the child in special custody was expressed even earlier, in the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1924 and in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which was adopted by the Joint Assembly on 20 November 1959. As stated in the Declaration on the Rights of the Child, \"a child, because of his physical and mental immaturity, requires special care and care, including adequate legal protection, as before, and after birth\".

First, let me say a few words on the trade defence measures for steel. Over the three-year period from 2013-16, the European steel industry suffered truly severe losses. This was due to the trade spillovers from Chinese overcapacity. But our policy response was swift and comprehensive. In March 2016 we issued a communication laying out a number of measures encompassing, crucially, trade policy. Over the years 2014-18, the EU imposed a really unprecedented number – 25 new measures covering steel products. The aim was to remove the injurious effects of dumped and subsidised imports and restore fair trading conditions. These measures significantly reduced dumped and subsidised imports and protected 216 000 jobs.  The EU took a number of steps to better protect the steel industry in the trade defence domain through import surveillance and accelerated investigations. The opening of the investigations was based on threat of injury, where justified, or the application of definite duties retroactively, where audited. These steps had a significant impact. Steel imports of products covered by measures adopted in the years 2014-17 fell by more than 95% on average compared with the volume of imports before the measures were imposed.  Despite signs of recovery for the steel sector, in part due to the imposition of trade defence measures, the EU steel industry continued to be vulnerable, and in 2018 the industry was confronted with yet another important challenge: the risk of injury stemming from the US Section 232 measures on steel products and the risk of trade diversion. The Commission again reacted swiftly to this challenge by opening a safeguard investigation. Earlier this year, the Commission and EU Member States agreed to put in place definitive safeguard measures, considering the risk of redirecting substantial amounts of imports from other countries, previously destined to the US market, into Europe.  When imposing definite measures, the Commission committed to reassess the situation by July 2019. This was to ensure that their functioning remained adapted to steel market developments and to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The measures consist of a tariff rate quota which de facto limits imports from all countries of origin to the average level of the years 2015-2017. A 25% duty is imposed beyond this and this is a lower level than the high 2018. These measures, imposed until July 2021, allow for imports to continue at their non-injurious level and all of those were largely supported by Member States and industries.  The Commission continues to monitor imports and will consider the need for another review in the future, in the case of changed circumstances, for example, Brexit. The Commission is also tackling the root causes of overcapacity by actively participating in the G20 global forum on steel excess capacity.  In addition, the European partnership on clean steel and low carbon steel making has been proposed under Horizon Europe. This will put additional private and public research and innovation investment to support the development of breakthrough technologies for the production of clean steel. The EU is also supporting the development of clean steel technologies with their research fund for coal and steel.  Let me also mention that under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), we’ll have Horizon Europe and investEU, both new sources for investment and research in the steel sector.  Through the Strategic Forum on important projects for common European interests, the Commission is identifying the business-critical strategic value chains and defining potential actions and investments from industry and public authorities. This strategic forum has prioritised six key strategic value chains, including the strategic value chain on low CO2 emission industries, and the final report has just been finalised on 6 November.  Finally, the Innovation Fund under the Emissions Trading System (ETS) post-2020 will support big demonstration projects employing breakthrough low carbon technologies and it will cover up to 60% of the relevant cost of the projects.  Let me now move to the labour market. The EU legal framework is there also to protect workers in case of industrial change and disruptions. Several EU directives set requirements for informing and consulting workers in cases of restructuring. It is the responsibility, of course, of the Member States’ authorities to ensure that the national legislation transposing EU directives is applied by the employers concerned. While the Commission has no power to interfere in specific company decisions regarding the restructuring plans, it urges companies to follow good practices on restructuring.  EU funding is also available to support workers. Let me mention, of course, the EU Social Fund, which is used to improve employment opportunities, promote education and lifelong learning and develop active inclusion policies. The very important tool that we have is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) – a key instrument providing support to workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes. The first step to mobilise the EGF is for the Member States concerned to submit an application and the EGF regulation provides for a minimum of 500 redundancies in an enterprise as one of the eligibility criteria to trigger the intervention. In the case of the small labour market or in some exceptional circumstances, derogation from this criteria is always possible.  As you can see, the European Commission has, for a long time, taken a very clear stance to support the competitiveness of the EU’s steel sector. We issued a communication dedicated to the EU steel sector, the so-called Steel Action Plan. We took steps to strengthen EU defence against unfair trading practices. In conclusion, let me underline that in our renewed industrial policy strategy, we stressed that a robust industrial base is essential for Europe’s economic growth, preservation of sustainable jobs and EU competitiveness in the global market.

The question of steel in the European steel industry is a huge issue. The steel pillar has been betrayed by many of the factors that characterise the somewhat casual approach to industrial policies that Europe has often had.  In addition, there has been the tragedy of American steel duties in general, which has led to the pouring into Europe of an enormous amount of steel at very low prices, particularly from Turkey.  The safeguard measures identified are not sufficient. They are not enough and the results show this: Turkish steel in 2017 was at 16 % in our market, today it is at 33 %.  We must take action to prevent these drifts and, on the other hand, by monitoring countries that do not always show attention to manufacturing tradition.

We have already mentioned the Turkish case and, as far as China is concerned, there is still a great deal to be done, many products come in with triangulations that need to be checked.

This means that with the duties you introduce, you will force these countries to meet the standards that our steelworks meet. And our steelworks didn't have to close because these countries produce over-production, and it has one single effect. We will always support steel.

Firstly, I have not said that everything is fine. Secondly, I don’t need to defend this Commission with words because in my quite long opening speech at the beginning, I said, very concretely, what this Commission has done and what we are doing, very swiftly and quite effectively, in the steel sector in Europe. We reacted swiftly. We did our utmost in the three major areas: trade policy, industrial policy and employment policy. All of them are, or were, a part of our steel action plan and we are implementing them quite swiftly. In trade policy, we have tightened our instruments and we are using them very actively, as much as we can, to protect our industry, to protect it from unfair imports; I showed you the numbers. On industrial policy, we are working with our international partners to reduce global steel over-capacity; we are also putting a lot of money with the new instruments, under the new MFF, but also in the current one, to innovate and for our steel sector to become more sustainable. As many of you mentioned workers and our employment policy: here we have primarily the European Social Fund (ESF), the globalisation funds available to re-train and to re-skill our workforce; to accompany the many structural changes that are ongoing in the steel industry. Of course the work is not done. I cannot comment on the new Commission. But definitely, in the last years, starting from 2014, we took a number of very active working measures to protect our steel market and especially our workers.

Loss of competitivity, little cutting edge innovation, overcapacity, and less than adaptive labour systems resulted in Europe. The recognition that the steel industry is a strategic sector existed in word, not in deed. The future of steel should not have been left to the markets’ mercy. It needed to be tightly regulated and planned, on a national and European basis. Planning needed backing funds to enable subsidies and flexible work arrangements, protection flexibly managed, plus consolidation over a bottom line to ensure that basic output in significant volumes would remain located in Europe. Current computing power allows for such centralised planning to be carried out in conformity with the rest of the European economy still acting according to market forces while responding autonomously to them.

It gives me a good opportunity to debrief you on the work we have done, not only on the Commission’s side but also on the Council’s side. Actually, last Monday we adopted in the Foreign Affairs Council a framework for restrictive measures in response to Turkey’s drilling in the eastern Mediterranean. This decision makes it now possible to sanction individuals and entities that are responsible for unauthorised drilling activities in Cyprus’ territorial sea, exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. You will remember how we got there. In early May, Turkey sent a first drill ship inside Cyprus’ exclusive economic zone and then another one in June. From the very beginning there was a common united European Union position on the matter. We acted first and foremost in full solidarity with Cyprus, including at the highest level, at the level of the European Council with the European Union heads of state and government. Then, in July the Council decided on a first response suspending our high-level dialogues with Turkey, the negotiations on the Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement and endorsing the Commission’s proposal to reduce the pre-accession assistance to Turkey for 2020. In July the Council also asked the Commission and the External Action Service to work on further options for targeted measures in case Turkey continued its illegal drilling activities. We’ve been constantly in contact with our Turkish counterparts at all levels, passing messages to the Turkish side on the need to de-escalate. And yet Turkey decided to continue its activities and even to move further, to move to Block 7, which is an area where Cyprus has given licenses to a consortium of EU companies. And this is how we arrived to this week’s framework for restrictive measures. As always, we’re taking a gradual approach, a scalable approach, meaning that sanctions can be scaled up or down, depending on developments on the ground, in this case let me say rather developments at sea. And, as always, these are targeted measures so they will only target individuals or entities that are responsible for, or involved in, unauthorised drillings. Our goal remains to defuse tension and to make clear that Cyprus’ sovereignty and sovereign rights should be respected in accordance with international law. At the same time, it is urgent to resume substantive settlement talks aimed at the reunification of the island and aimed at the united Cyprus inside the European Union, based on a bi-communal bi-zonal federation. The European Union fully supports the work done by the two Cypriot leaders and the United Nations in this respect. We look forward to the meeting that the UN Secretary-General has convened in Berlin on 25 November as a crucial opportunity to agree on the next steps towards a solution for the Cypriot issue. The European Union has always been accompanying these efforts, these steps, different stages, and will continue to do so with all the energy and the resources it can mobilise. So hoping and working, rather accompanying the UN work for a settlement, making clear that Cyprus’ sovereignty and sovereign rights have to be respected and that the European Union will always react in a united manner to defend them, and always inviting our Turkish counterparts to de-escalate and work in a different kind of environment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 134, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Λευτέρης Χριστοφόρου", "mepid": "26837", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group.

I believe that the measures taken by the European Union are correct; we are proud because we are a member of this great European family; I firmly believe that the European Union has the power but also that it is time to escalate the measures towards Turkey and force it to really apply the rules of law and the principles of the European Union.

This is primarily a matter of respect for international law, which these actions of Turkey clearly violate. I therefore support the economic framework for sanctions adopted by the Council this week. This will allow individuals or companies responsible or involved in unauthorised hydrocarbon drilling activities in the Eastern Mediterranean to be sanctioned. The sanctions are directed at anyone who directly implements this illegal decision, and even members of the Navy hired to oversee the entire operation. Also towards anyone found to be helping the whole process in any way.  These illegal acts have a negative impact on the full range of relations between the European Union and Turkey. Apart from the economic dimension, it is obvious that our political relations with Turkey are becoming more complex. As messages from President Erdogan and Trump meet, Russian patrols control the NATO border and Turkey announces the purchase of an S-400 missile system from Russia.  It is clear that traditional alliances are under increasingly serious pressures, which is why we need to think about redefining the role of the European Union on the global stage.

In 2004, Cyprus joined the European Union. Despite the efforts of all, a Member State of our Union is still divided today. In 2014, the European Council issued its first protest over Turkey's non-compliance with Cyprus' sovereignty over its territorial waters and its exclusive economic zone.

What is the European Council doing in 2014, when a candidate state is demonstrating vividly that it does not recognise the sovereignty of a Member State? He expressed deep concern and then continued accession negotiations with Turkey. For years, we have lined up words, speeches, and Turkey has not taken us seriously. For years, we have failed to express effective solidarity with one of our Member States, Cyprus.

This unity is needed because it is constantly tested from the outside and also, from time to time, from the inside. I believe it is a fundamental, key, vital element of our being together – the basic fact that if the rights, the sovereignty of one of our Member States is violated, as is the case in this moment with these Turkish drilling activities, the rest of the European Union has to come together and not only show solidarity but also act in solidarity with Cyprus. And this is why, for me, it has been key all over these months – I would say all over these years – to keep a constant contact and coordination with Cyprus itself, with one of our Member States, and design a way in which we could react and shape a common reaction together with Cyprus.  One question I would like to come back to, which is what next?  The framework is now established, which means that, now, Member States can – and I would expect that they would – present proposals for names, both of individuals and entities, that would then be analysed on the basis of a solid legal basis. You know that our sanction system is based on elements that need to resist the test of a court judgment in case they are appealed against. So Member States are now going to present proposals for names of individuals and entities, this is then going to be analysed by the Member States themselves through our Council procedures and, by unanimity, the Member States – the Council – is going to adopt further steps.  So this is what I would expect to happen next. This can go very fast or slower depending on different bodies and obviously also depending on the overall environment, because what I want to stress here is this – and I said it also in the beginning – sanctions, and the framework for introducing sanctions, is an instrument to put pressure and to try and provoke a change. The objective here is to change the attitude, stop the drillings and – I’m surprised that not many of you have underlined this – try to help the UN finding what would be the real solution, what would be the settlement of the Cyprus issue. A united Cyprus inside the European Union, this would be the game changer, not only for the drilling activities but also, and mainly, for Cyprus itself and for the European Union and for the entire region.  So this is why I referred to the upcoming meeting that Guterres has convened at the end of this month. It is, I believe, important for us to constantly stress this – the fact that, in this moment, the European Union is continuing to look at that solution, at that framework – at the UN framework – as the real solution for this issue and for the settlement as such, and that we are obviously ready to accompany this. We have discussed this with our Turkish counterparts several times, including in the recent months, including at my level – obviously this activity is going in the opposite direction, and this is an additional reason why we want to see them stopping. And first and foremost, let me stress it once again, to reaffirm that the European Union is united in defence of the sovereignty of one of our Member States.

Delicate moments like this require a firm rejection of violence and the highest level of statesmanship from all.  As you know, on 20 October, Bolivians voted in presidential elections that were marred by several irregularities. This has brought Bolivian citizens to the streets. It has led to violence and civil unrest across the country. Three people were killed, and more than 100 were injured. The current unrest follows months and years of tensions regarding the country’s political future.  As you all know, President Morales took the controversial decision to run for a fourth term in office, with the approval of the Constitutional Court but after failing to win a referendum to amend the Constitution itself. Tensions escalated around election day. When the polls closed, a preliminary results counting system showed that none of the candidates was likely to win enough votes in the first round and that a second round was the most plausible outcome. The system was then blocked for some 20 hours and, when it resumed, it registered a sharp change in the initial tendency. The Supreme Electoral Courts announced President Morales as the winner in the first round by a margin of just 0.5% of the votes. The Vice-President of the Court resigned during the counting process, in protest at the way the process was managed. As a consequence, demonstrations and violence broke out across the country. Five local election offices were set on fire and the most powerful civil society organisation called for a general strike. The Organisation of American States had deployed an election observation mission to Bolivia and it declared, in a preliminary report, that the best option would be for the two leading candidates to move on to the second round run-off. This assessment was endorsed by the European Union’s election expert mission that we had sent to the country, and by several EU Member States. We also expressed this position publicly on 24 October.  Given the widespread mistrust, the Bolivian government invited the Organisation of American States to carry out an electoral audit. The government agreed that the results of the audit would be binding. The audit was supported by some EU Member States with experts and also with some funding. The preliminary conclusions were announced last Monday. The audit identified a number of irregularities and concluded that the election results should be annulled and fresh elections should be held as soon as possible. In the following hours, the opposition asked President Morales to resign and so did the head of the Bolivian armed forces. President Morales, together with the Vice-President and a number of ministers, decided to step down and he has sought political asylum, as you know, in Mexico.  According to the Constitution, based on the absence and resignation of President, Vice-President and presidents and first vice-presidents of the Chambers, the Second Vice-President of the Senate would be next in line to assume the presidency in a caretaker role until new elections.  The European Union supports an institutional solution that allows for a caretaker interim leadership to prepare for new elections and to avoid a power vacuum which could have dire consequences for the entire country. In these very days and hours, we have been active – through our delegation in La Paz, whom I want to thank – in creating a space where government, opposition and civil society could meet and discuss a way out of this situation. We are actively supporting the mediation organised by the local Catholic church to help the Bolivian parties agree on a peaceful path that can lead to new elections. This mediation has already produced some first results in easing tensions partially and avoiding a worse escalation of violence.  At the Foreign Affairs Council last Monday, I updated the Foreign Ministers of the EU Member States on our work on the ground. We discussed how best to support Bolivia in preparation for the announced election. We are assessing the possibility of a new European Union mission to the country and of assistance in the election of a new Supreme Electoral Court.  Bolivia is a very important partner for the European Union. These years we have built a strong political cooperation and we have developed political dialogues where we discuss all issues, including those where we have disagreements or different views. We deployed an election expert mission to the country and we have several projects in support of Bolivia’s strong civil society.  In the last 14 years, Bolivia has certainly changed for the better. Poverty has dropped. Access to basic services has improved. Indigenous people have increasingly been included in the country’s public life. All these successes must be preserved, and this can only happen through a peaceful, political solution that respects the Constitution and the rule of law and that can bring the country to new, timely credible elections which faithfully reflect the will of the Bolivian people. Bolivia can come out of this crisis and consolidate its democratic institutions. It has all the potential to continue on a path of democracy, sustainable development and social inclusion. The coming weeks will be crucial. The European Union will continue to be at the side of the Bolivian people, as we have been throughout the years and, in particular, in this difficult moment in the country’s democratic life.

Finally, so many and so relevant that it was impossible to validate the electoral process and, as a result, the OAS has urged new elections. In the face of such events, President Evo Morales' resignation was absolutely obligatory.  Bolivia's political fragility is certainly enormous and needs to be avoided. From the European Parliament, we must call on the Bolivian authorities and people to bring the political situation back through peaceful, democratic and constitutional channels.

The electoral fraud found by the Organization of American States definitively broke the public's trust in the system; a bankruptcy that began with the maneuver to foster a new mandate from President Evo Morales, clearly unconstitutional. That's why only new elections and a neutral and trustworthy referee can drive the situation.  These elections must be developed in peace. There are no expressions of violence against people, threats against the media, clashes or assaults on public office, which we reject altogether. And they need an independent and credible arbitrator to shield the process from any attempt at fraud. The armed forces and the police must refrain from influencing political processes and undergoing civilian control. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has just recalled this. This agency denounces and rejects violence as a means of political coertion, calls for eradicating hate speech and calls for respect for plurality, with particular attention to that represented by indigenous communities.

The OAS, an organization not suspected of being Bolshevik or Bolivarian, has not called into question the victory of Evo Morales; what it has called into question is that it has achieved it by more than ten points difference.  Evo Morales assumed the recommendations of the OAS and called for new elections. However, far from reducing tension and seeking a peaceful way out, the coupist will of a racist and classist opposition is confirmed, to which what concerns him is not fraud, what he is concerned about is that the vote of an indigenous man is worth the same as that of a target. As persecutions have continued, looting of MAS leadership houses and repression of indigenous communities, and despite the resignation of President Evo Morales himself and all the senior officials of the country's most important institutions, trying to avoid a blood bath, we call on this Parliament to condemn the coup, call on the European Embassies to give refuge to the persecuted and join the request for free elections in which all the nominations that wish can take place and in which the decision of the Bolivian people is respected.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 177, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Ivan Vilibor Sinčić (NI).", "mepid": "197935", "text": "   – Dear Chairman, I will try to give a geopolitical view in my discussion of the situation in Bolivia. I want to say at the outset that I am against any foreign interventions and that we must, as in the case of Venezuela, give the people of Bolivia to solve this problem on its own and to find its own way.  Evo Morales has committed one mortal sin in his long-standing politics because he has ruled there since 2006, and that mortal sin is that he used, that is, he used the resources of his Bolivian state for the benefit of his Bolivian people. This is something that the imperialists, above all the American establishment who constantly, therefore, know what the U.S. policy towards Central and South America has been trying to undermine for decades. It is precisely in the service of this establishment that the jackals undermine sovereign states, these structures operate under the guise of democracy and will always have democracy, but they are not interested in democracy. They are interested in political influence and resource control. They use coups, invasions, sanctions, funding for radical groups.  However, it should be said why this is happening here and now, because of lithium. Litium is an element of the future. It is used in electronics, for batteries, for laptops, electric vehicles, etc. There is currently a struggle for dominance in the lithyne triangle. Thus, there is 50% of lithium production, 50-70% of the world's resources. The industrialization plan that Evo Morales had is to build fourteen factories by 2024, or forty by 2030.

The country has been shaken by a wave of protests and violent incidents. The government has declared curfews and a state of emergency. It deployed troops on the streets for the first time since Chile returned to democracy 30 years ago.  Both the curfews and the state of emergency were lifted; protests, mostly peaceful, continued throughout the country. On 25 October, they culminated in the biggest demonstration in Chile’s history, with over one million people marching to request profound social and economic changes. The mobilisation continues up to date and it has brought support from across all sectors of society.  The toll of the crisis is high. The National Institute for Human Rights, which is an independent state institution, has reported 22 deaths. Five of them have been directly attributed to the security forces. Two thousand people have been injured, over 5 000 have been detained, almost 300 judicial actions have been presented, including for homicides, sexual violence and cruel treatment. Human rights violations have mobilised constant demonstrations calling for justice over the abuses, while in the margins of peaceful protests, serious acts of violence occur. We call once again for a swift investigation of all crimes and human rights violations from all sides.  This is an important moment for Chile’s democracy, a strong democracy built after decades of dictatorship, a democracy that now needs a new social contract with a stronger focus on the fight against inequalities and on social inclusion.  The government has started to respond to protests with a series of important measures – the announcement of a social agenda, a cabinet reshuffle, the launching of a national citizens’ dialogue. Chile has announced that it will not host the APEC and COP summits, in order to focus on the domestic priorities, and last Monday a process leading to a new constitution was launched, addressing a long—standing aspiration of many Chileans as the current constitution still dates back to the times of the dictatorship.  We also highly appreciate the government’s invitation to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and to other human rights organisations to send experts.  It is essential to keep listening to the requests that are coming from the people of Chile and to address them. During these weeks, over 3.5 million Chileans have demonstrated peacefully in town hall meetings and local assemblies. They are showing their determination to build a society that is more inclusive and more just. Such a vibrant society is the foundation of the functioning of a strong democracy and this request for justice and equality must not, and, I believe, cannot, be overshadowed by the acts of violence committed by a minority in the margins of the demonstrations. In fact, the large majority of the citizens and all political parties have condemned violence as unacceptable from all sides.  Chile’s human rights institutions are playing a critical role in coordinating with the government, monitoring the rights of Chileans and working tirelessly to protect those rights. These institutions have all been shaped by the last 30 years of democracy and they now play a critical role in the protection of that same democracy. It is also important that the economic players and the private sector in its majority have affirmed they are ready to do their part in support of a new inclusive social pact.  We have condemned from the very beginning all acts of violence and called for respect for human rights and the due investigation of all violations. Our delegation in Santiago and the 19 Member States’ Ambassadors resident in Chile have passed exactly the same message, in a coordinated manner, at all levels and all our interlocutors in the government have expressed their absolute, irrevocable and irreversible commitment to respect for human rights in all circumstances.  We want to reconfirm our readiness to support the country and its people in this moment of transition. First of all, we have decided to maintain our cooperation programmes that were dedicated to COP25, to support Chile in its Presidency beyond the summit that will now be held in Spain. To address the protesters’ demand for social justice, it is also essential to tackle the impact of climate change and to make the green transition more sustainable.  But there is much more. The European Union is Chile’s third largest trade partner and its first foreign investor. Chile is the European Union’s oldest partner in Latin America and we are now negotiating the modernisation of our Association Agreements. Our countries have solid ties. Both Europe and Chile have experienced the tragedy of dictatorship and the return to freedom.  In the darkest moments of Chile’s history, we opened our doors to our brothers and sisters fleeing from persecution. I come myself from a country that experienced that, very closely. We are more than just friends, we are family and today we share the Chilean people’s aspiration to greater social justice and a more inclusive democracy. These values are at the core of our new Association Agreements which focus exactly on sustainable development, human rights and climate action.  Europe is ready to accompany Chile in this delicate moment of its history towards a new and a more inclusive social contract. We have full confidence that Chile’s democracy is strong enough to address its people’s demands and to use this moment as a step to grow even stronger and more inclusive.

Along with these demonstrations, a coordinated series of attacks on metro stations and shops broke out, shattering that rose to no less than nearly $2 billion, to which the Government had to resort to the state of emergency for ten days. At the same time, in the face of allegations of excessive use of force by the police, the Government expressly asked the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to send a mission to Chile to investigate this. Mr Piñera's Government is currently negotiating urgent social measures. Days earlier, the minimum wage was increased. He agreed to reduce the working day.

A crisis whose causes, of course, are complex—very complex—and have undoubtedly been managed over decades.  Chile has achieved, it is true, an intense reduction in extreme poverty, but at the same time, a huge - huge - middle class has grown, highly precarious and accumulates growing discontent, which has been fuelled by inequality and lower-than-expected economic growth and which had been Mr Piñera's electoral promise.

A political situation arising from a problem, a social outburst, the result of a political context to which Europe is no stranger. In Europe we also have problems of inequality. We also have problems of growing inequality because of an unfair and inefficient distribution. It is also true that there are demands for solving social problems, there are health problems, there are educational problems, there are pension problems, there is fear of the future.  And then why do we bring this debate here? Because this House is not a space where Chile's legitimate ideological and political debate is cloned or replicated. Why are you bringing him here? Well, I don't know, but there seems to be a strange collusion between the Socialists and the Eurochavistas, who are defenders of the human rights and democratic procedures of all those countries that are not led by the satrapies, of which they are partners and friends.

Then Europe has to be next to Chile, it is true, because its problems, I repeat, are no strangers to us. And it may be a good scenario where measures can be implemented that can serve to strengthen trust between citizens and their politicians. But we do not have to do so from a kind of false paternalism and disrespecting an ally and a partner who has been a guarantee of stability in the region and which some want to destabilize with spurous debates at a time of instability through the area as a whole.

Media freedom is an indispensable pillar of our democratic societies. Journalists are among the guardians of properly-functioning democracies. They act as public watchdogs, helping to inform and empower citizens. Where there is no freedom of speech there is no democracy. For this reason, freedom of expression, media freedom and pluralism are guaranteed in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Yet across the globe, journalists face risks and attacks simply for carrying out their work. Too often investigations into violence or threats of violence against journalists and media outlets are slow, incomplete and fail to bring the offenders to justice. 31 journalists have been killed worldwide in 2019 alone; more than 800 in the last decade. In 9 out of 10 cases, the killers go unpunished. Impunity is the key obstacle to ensuring journalists’ safety, resulting in self-censorship and a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression. The investigations and judicial proceedings following the horrific and unacceptable killings of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and Slovak journalist Ján Kuciak have to this day not been concluded. These crimes have shocked European public opinion. The European Parliament has made clear in its resolutions on media pluralism and media freedom in the European Union that we have a duty to guarantee the freedom of expression and of the press, including the safety and security of journalists. We note the call of this assembly on Member State authorities to ensure the protection of investigative journalists from any form of intimidation, defamation charges, threats or physical attacks, as well as to create a permanent financial scheme in support of independent investigative journalism. On behalf of the Council, I can say that we are aware of the responsibility our governments have to protect journalists and different media freedom. We will continue with all appropriate means possible to respect and protect freedom of expression. The Council held a dialogue on Media Pluralism and the Rule of Law in the Digital Age in November 2017. The related Presidency conclusions reflected the importance of the issue and repeated the commitment by the Council and the Member States to secure a safe working environment for journalists as part of their duty to uphold fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 210, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, this is an important opportunity to recall and mark this day, to recall its origins that have just been set out, and to underline what it stands for. We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that should apply for everyone, everywhere. An environment where journalists are free to report on any topic, on all platforms, without censoring themselves, is the key to media freedom. But today, journalists’ safety is not guaranteed, even – as we just heard – in Europe, as far too often journalists and media workers find themselves attacked, persecuted, harassed or intimidated for carrying out their work. Again, we’ve just heard some striking figures: in 2018 alone, 94 journalists and media staff were killed across the globe in work-related incidents, as reported by the International Federation of Journalists. Hundreds more have been subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention without ever having been tried in court. According to UNESCO, only 10% of the 930 cases of killings of journalists from 2006 to 2016 worldwide have as yet been resolved. Impunity for these crimes – getting away with these crimes – multiplies their impact. It erodes democratic societies by fuelling fear, mistrust and anxiety. So what are we trying to do about this? Respect for freedom of expression is integrated in all our policies and our development programmes. The EU provides support and legal assistance via the mechanism for human rights defenders, a network that delivers fast response for human rights defenders under threat, including covering journalists. The EU also supports the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom and the Media Pluralism Monitor. In 2019 a series of pilot projects will foster cooperation between journalists and self-regulatory bodies, fund cross-border investigative journalism and increase support for journalists who find themselves under threat. The Commission has proposed to include a dedicated budget in the next MFF as part of the Creative Europe programme. The Commission has also spearheaded work to counter online incitement to violence and hatred by means of the Code of Conduct on Combating Illegal Hate Speech. On this too, the EU is currently transposing new legislative provisions in the Directive on Audiovisual Media Services. In these and other ways, we consistently stand up for the themes symbolised by this day, and we oppose, in bilateral contacts with third countries, as well as in multilateral and regional discussions, any legislation, regulation or political pressure that does not respect international human rights standards on freedom of expression. Simply proclaiming the right to freedom of expression is not enough – it is not sufficient. States must also fulfil their obligation to protect freedom of expression and the safety of journalists by providing an enabling legal environment, by taking criminal threats against journalists seriously, and by vigorously prosecuting actual attacks. As has just been recalled, the recent assassinations of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and Ján Kuciak, and indeed of the Saudi national, Jamal Khashoggi, show, sadly, that no part of the world is immune to such crimes. The Commission recently highlighted the fundamental role of journalists and free and pluralistic media in promoting and upholding the rule of law in its Communication on strengthening the rule of law within the Union of July this year. And again, on the actual International Day, on 2 November, in her declaration, the High Representative paid tribute to all those who lost their lives and suffered attacks in the exercise of their freedom of expression online and offline. The EU firmly condemns the increase in crimes against journalists, both offline and online in cyberspace. The Commission, on the particular case that's already been raised, has called on the Maltese authorities, in the case of Mrs Caruana Galizia, to ensure that justice is done. After all, a functioning democracy cannot thrive without free, diverse and independent media.

The media is the gatekeeper, the body that separates fact from fiction.  So when shadowy multinationals, illicit banks and unscrupulous politicians implicated in serious money-laundering and corruption activities start to abuse the courts to go after our journalists, the attack is serious. When journalists are assassinated it is an attack on all of us. And it would be impossible, as we have just heard, to speak today without paying tribute to the courage and resolve of Daphne Caruana Galizia. Daphne was assassinated two years ago.  The masterminds behind her assassination remain at large. The subjects of her investigations remain protected from investigation at the highest political levels. It is not acceptable. This is outrageous! And specifically, we need to protect journalists – not only from physical harm, but from vexatious lawsuits. We need an EU anti-SLAPP law and we need to make EU funds available to media houses so that they can fight their corner.

In 2018 alone, the International Federation of Journalists counts 94 murders of journalists or people working in the media. These people were murdered for exercising a fundamental freedom guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19. While the European Union has also seen its own territory on its territory, the murder of journalists, it has been said, of Maltese, Slovak and Bulgarian journalists. What is the European Union's action plan to combat these crimes? Europe must also defend its values more vigorously abroad: what response has Europe given to Saudi Arabia, following the assassination of Mr Khashoggi?

Criminals remain at large, and uncomfortable journalists are constantly harassed with long and expensive lawsuits built by professional law firms. Daphne's family inherited nearly 30 such defamation lawsuits against her because she dared to tell the truth. We need to do much more for journalists, we need to support them with the anti-SLAPP law, with funding and rapid response mechanisms in case of threats or pressure.  Yes, journalists investigate politicians, but those who have no concern looking back into their past support freedom of the press and understand the importance of the right to information and protection of those who speak the truth with dignity, courage and honesty, independent journalists.

Thanks also to Europol and public pressure after the murder of Ján Kuciak and his girlfriend, the most people have taken to the streets in Slovakia since the Velvet Revolution. Thanks to this public pressure, we have murder suspects behind bars, but we have not yet won. Journalists in Slovakia continue to be the target of attacks. Before his death, Kuciak wrote that the mafia was in control of the entire state, police officers, prosecutors, judges and politicians alike. The judges handled their sentences, with politicians, with police officers and prosecutors investigating their own cases. The investigation into the murder case so far confirms that Kuciak was right. Ordinary people in Slovakia who today read how easily the mafia asserted their interests through the state apparatus are desperate, they have stopped believing in the rule of law. Slovakia is awaiting important parliamentary elections in a few months' time, which will decide whether to return to the path of democracy, where journalists will also feel safe, or follow in the footsteps of the mafia, which has been showing us for several months that it can also cooperate with fascists.

I really believe that it is the right moment to talk about Ebola in East Africa for two specific reasons: first because Ebola has resurged in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This is the tenth ever Ebola outbreak in the country. Its main characteristic is that it is happening in the most complex and fragile and insecure region of the eastern part of the DRC. The second reason is that despite the challenges on the ground, we have kept up the fight against Ebola. We are making steady steps of progress thanks to our relentless efforts with our partners in laboratories with experts and researchers, in meeting rooms with other donors and international organisations and on the ground together with patients, communities, local leaders and health workers. Since 1 August 2018, when the current outbreak started, more than 3 200 people were infected. More than 2 100 people have, unfortunately, lost their lives. At the same time, more than 1 000 lives were saved. When talking about Ebola, we should never forget the worst ever outbreak that hit West Africa five years ago. The European Union’s intervention at that time was critical in handling a situation which was completely out of control.  It was a very painful experience – including for me personally. I saw this first hand as soon as I took over my duties as European Commissioner and the EU Ebola coordinator in November 2014 when I visited, with my dear colleague Commissioner Andriukaitis, the three affected countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – at the peak of the crisis. I remember we talked a lot with my colleagues here and in Parliament and I always had your very crucial and very special support in this very difficult situation at that time.  But this crisis was also, five years ago, a milestone. It taught us important lessons that shape the way we responded to the Ebola epidemics that followed. The ninth Ebola outbreak in the DRC’s province of Équateur demonstrated that we took on board those lessons. That outbreak was declared in May and it ended in August 2018. We managed to contain the virus in three months. You can compare the situation with that of five years ago in West Africa.  I would like to mention four lessons that we learned and we now follow on the ground.  The first lesson and maybe the most important: act fast. Our response to the current outbreak in the eastern part of the DRC started on the same day the outbreak was declared. Already on day one, the European Union was transporting doctors and equipment to the affected areas.  The second lesson: be ready. This requires improved capacities. We are now able to do these things thanks to an excellent instrument – the European Medical Corps, which is part of the European Union civil protection mechanism. The European Medical Corps is Europe’s highly specialised medical teams ready to be deployed in health emergencies at very, very short notice. Our response capacities also include high-tech isolation units, in cooperation with Norway, and a mechanism for medical evacuation. I am talking about medevac: the medical evacuation of health and aid workers for treatment in the European Union, in cooperation with the World Health Organisation.  The third lesson, also extremely important: invest in prevention and cure – in vaccines, diagnostic tests and treatment. Since 2014, the European Union has invested more than EUR 231 million in vaccine development and research on Ebola treatments in diagnostic tests. One vaccine – with a second one in the pipeline – and two treatments are currently used in the DRC and in its neighbouring Uganda and Rwanda, and the results are very, very encouraging. On 31 October, as Commissioner, I announced together with my dear colleague, Commissioner Moedas, an additional EUR 6 million from the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme to support a new vaccination trial in the DRC. Thanks to Parliament’s support, we have managed to mobilise more than EUR 47 million since 2018 for the humanitarian response to Ebola in the DRC, together with another EUR 5 million for prevention and preparedness measures in the neighbouring countries most at risk: Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda and Burundi.  Last but not least, the final lesson: strengthen the local footprint. We help to address the critical problem of chronically weak national and local health infrastructure. We have mobilised EUR 180 million from the 11th European Development Fund, 2014-2020, to support the health sector in the DRC, and the health sectors in Burundi and South Sudan also received European development funds.  The response in the DRC in 2019 is not the same as in West Africa five years ago, in 2014. We have made significant progress in how we respond to Ebola. Despite the many challenges on the ground, and thanks to the dedication of epidemiologists and health workers, as I have already mentioned, more than 1 000 patients have recovered and more than 240 000 persons have been vaccinated, but it is also true that the reality on the ground sets the rules of the game. We must not forget that we are responding in a zone of active conflict where, unfortunately, access to clean water, food, basic healthcare and education is really a big challenge, with hundreds of thousands of cases of measles, malaria and cholera. And we have to respond on multiple fronts. This complicates our job and slows down our efforts, but it does not lessen our determination to save lives and help make Ebola history.  Thank you, my dear colleagues, for your attention. I tried to describe the situation not only in the DRC but also to compare five years ago in West Africa, and I look forward to your interventions and a very fruitful discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 245, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "Lukas Mandl", "mepid": "190713", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Commissioner, thank you for what you have said. And since this may be the last opportunity for the debate here in plenary with you, Commissioner, I would like to say thank you for your service to the European Union. In addition to all the challenges that are naturally always present between Parliament and the Commission, it is valuable for someone to do a service. I would therefore like to thank you for your service as Commissioner in the european Commission, which is already in office. This is a service which is so important in this area in particular, because we need a Europe with strength to the outside world. In the humanitarian field in particular, Europe is particularly strong and can show strength to be taken seriously in the world and also to make a difference in this world within the framework of European values. Ebola is a terrible disease, a heinous disease and an insidious disease. In West Africa, 11,000 people have died of Ebola, and Ebola has re-emerged in eastern Congo and is already spreading to neighbouring countries. Africa is in our neighbourhood. Many people at home in Austria ask me: What is special about the relationship with Africa? For us Europeans, the people of Africa are immediate neighbours. Unlike the US or China or other parts of the world, we are in close proximity, and we have a responsibility to people in the neighborhood. So it is important that the new vaccine, which can now be brought into action against Ebola, can actually be effective by showing strength as the European Union and making it possible for this vaccine to be rolled out to the general public.

The Commissioner explained, moreover, well: we must maintain a rapid response force, prepared to act in difficult conditions, learning from previous experiences, improving the coordination of means and communicating better to gain the confidence of the people. And in this dimension, the European Union's effort deserves to be highlighted. It has combined EUR 47 million in direct support for Congo and EUR 4 million from neighbouring countries and has sent - as you have said - adequate experts and means of action to the field. It is also important to highlight the decision taken yesterday by the European Commission, through our European Medicines Agency, to grant authorisation for the introduction of an Ebola vaccine, as part of a wider programme that already includes clinical trials in congo of a vaccine scheme funded by Horizon 2020. We invest, but we have results. The effectiveness and readiness possible in these emergency responses is also an incentive to include long-term investment in health, education, poverty-fighting and sustainable development.   Next week, in the neighbouring capital of Rwanda, the ACP/European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly holds its 38th plenary session. The issue of specific Ebola will not be up for debate, but issues and lines of action will be discussed which in the future could help prevent difficult-to-control epidemic situations.

That shows that, as an interconnected world, we have so far failed to learn and act on important lessons from that earlier epidemic.  Now, it is fantastic that Europe more quickly mobilised more effective humanitarian effort in response – worth EUR 47 million – since the outbreak started last year and spent on healthcare, on infection control, on contact tracing, on support for survivors and on community engagement. It’s great that the EU is working with private companies to tackle the problem that it’s more profitable to sell headache cures to rich people than to treat rare diseases that mainly kill the poor. It’s also great that scientific and medical partnerships like Horizon 2020 and the Innovative Medicines Initiative mean that 236 000 people have been vaccinated with one Ebola vaccine – and we’ve now heard a second is on the way – and it breaks my heart that Brexit could jeopardise British participation in programmes like this. But the scale of this outbreak – like the last – is not down to inadequate humanitarian response. It is because of systemic failures: poor health education that means many local people dismiss outbreaks as hoaxes and even attack or sometimes kill healthcare workers; poor health infrastructure, funded by inadequate domestic resources, with millions often lost to tax avoidance or simply destroyed by conflict; a global health workforce crisis that is worst in poor countries, fragile states and conflict zones and in which rich countries poach health workers from poor countries.  I’m pleased, as the Commissioner commented, that the EU’s Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO) is now investing in tackling some of these issues, but Europe needs to lead the world to do much more.

Of course, the vaccines certainly are a step forward, but the many Ebola outbreaks over the past decades have shown that the biggest problem is not the lack of a vaccine but the lack of functioning health systems, and we need strong health systems to protect Congolese people and people anywhere else in the world against Ebola. We need strong health systems to counter the many other health challenges which do not make it to western newspaper headlines, including, for instance, high maternal and child mortality. Humanitarian organisations even warn us that the international Ebola response is taking away staff and financial support to address these other challenges.

Yesterday, the European Commission, as we heard, approved the launch of the first Ebola vaccine, a breakthrough in the prevention of this deadly disease.  In my personal view, however, it is not just about financial resources, but about the lesson we need to learn in order to manage resources properly, while controlling a limited financial aspect. I fully support action to combat the disease, but regardless of the action rightly taken, I will be looking at the allocation process and will raise additional questions to the Commission if necessary, given that on 31 October the European Commission announced additional support of EUR 6 million for vaccination trials under Horizon 2020, and since 2014 alone more than EUR 230 million has been allocated for this purpose.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 250, "date": "2019-11-13.json", "name": "João Ferreira", "mepid": "96706", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Madam President, the current Ebola outbreak is the second largest ever recorded after the epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people between 2013 and 2016 and has already been declared an international public health emergency by the World Health Organisation. Marketing authorisation for a new vaccine is a hope for people at risk of contracting this disease, but it is important to ensure that this advance reaches at-risk populations as soon as possible universally and free of charge. It is necessary to learn all the lessons of the previous epidemic, and not to forget that the fragile health infrastructure in many countries was decisive in the inability to face the progression of the epidemic. In addition to the urgent emergency aid, it is necessary to support the construction of universal and free public health systems and the training of specialized personnel. It is necessary to combat the hegemony of pharmaceutical companies in the development of new drugs, the dictatorship of patents. It is necessary to cancel the external debt of these countries and to end the IMF and World Bank programmes that perpetuate backwardness and dependence.

If our goal is to end this outbreak, we must take a more holistic approach. The development of the vaccine, supported and funded by the European Union, is an important step forward. However, we must not divert attention from preventive measures. We need to address the fears and concerns of the community, relying— as the Commissioner rightly said, on local organizations. This outbreak will only end when communities are engaged in this struggle and this is led by a local response, for example, in terms of safe and dignified burials—the burial of corpses. Work should also be focused on women, as they are the most affected by Ebola, as they are often the main caregivers at risk.  This new outbreak highlights, once again, that there is no substitute for long-term health investment.

Of course, we need an emergency response, and I thank you for the humanitarian response you are doing. Information from the population, working with local communities, is important. Above all, however, there is a need to support a longer-term policy in the DRC, which makes access to health effective and accessible to all. As you know, we passed a conflict minerals law. Well! the corporate world has requested that this law be postponed to 2021, in terms of enforcement. What for? Because the corporate world doesn't want to pay for resources. Today, this country is a rich country and people are there, sitting on gold mines and at the same time they are dying.

At the time it was a tragic situation: 94 medical professionals had lost their lives and was only one doctor per hundred thousand inhabitants.  I believe that at the moment we need to ensure two essential things: on the one hand health education, because without those knowledge, skills, skills, and you know that Ebola also depends very much on compliance with hygiene rules and beyond, things will not be able to evolve favourably and that this health education should become a priority in schools in Europe , and on the other hand, the economic barrier for which you make considerable efforts.

Through this debate, I once again realise that we all agree that the Ebola crisis in West Africa was a test for the international community and it taught us that we cannot be complacent about Ebola. Five years after the largest Ebola crisis in our history, we learned important lessons, we adapted our response, we redefined our approach and now we know better what to expect and how to respond. In fact, we are ready before the alarm goes off. More staff is on the ground, there are now vaccines and treatments with effective results, and the overall support is much more coordinated than five years ago. In the European Union as a whole, and for me personally, until the end of my mandate (nobody knows when that will be), we will continue to be in close contact with the national authorities and local authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and neighbouring countries, but at the same time, with the global coordinator, the World Health Organisation, and our partners on the ground, the UN agencies and other international organisations, just to make sure that our response is really sufficient and adequate.  We have to give an effective response to Ebola to finally break the cycle of the epidemics. We should also start charting the post-Ebola phase. I totally agree with many of you already focused on the problem of the healthcare systems in many African countries, especially in the DRC. We must strengthen the national health systems and their capacities to respond to epidemics. Of course in the DRC and in the neighbouring countries, and as you know – this is one of my favourite expressions – we have to see stronger humanitarian—development nexus, which needs to be put in place in order to see sustainable health systems in these countries. I completely agree with this approach, but as you know, this is a medium- and long-term approach. At the same time, we have to focus on urgent needs, and this is our role as humanitarian actors. At the same time, we have to continue to advocate with our international partners for enough resources.  Frankly speaking, in some cases in Africa, we Europeans saw ourselves as alone. This is the hard reality on the ground.  But, finally, we must not forget that the scale of Ebola in eastern DRC follows decades of violence, totally absent state institutions, constant displacement, poverty and the multiple humanitarian needs for millions of Congolese in the region. We, together, already realise the root causes of this problem, but with Parliament’s commitment, we have to manage to scale up our response to Ebola, and I really sincerely thank you for this support – because I can compare the situation five years ago and now. I know well the situation on the ground and, at the same time, I can say that it was very important because we show people in practice that the European Union cares outside of Europe. The European Union – yes – is a union of solidarity and we are determined to continue to do our best to fully control the current Ebola epidemic as we did before and I’m sure, together, we will win in this very demanding battle.
