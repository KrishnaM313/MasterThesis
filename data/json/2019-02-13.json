Sustainable development starts and ends with people. It is about upholding our way of life and upgrading the well-being of our children and grandchildren. It’s about equality, a healthy natural environment and a thriving green and inclusive economy. Our starting point in moving towards a sustainable European future has to be the 17 comprehensive and interdependent sustainable development goals the world agreed upon and committed to in the United Nations in 2015. These goals offer the most comprehensive and universally accepted framework to guide our work for the years to come. Our core challenge for the next decade is to find a way to develop economically, continuously improving our living standards and well-being for the benefit of all, without depleting our natural resources, destroying and poisoning our environment and spurring climate change. What we need is an economy that grows within the limits of our planet and delivers prosperity to the many, not the few. To achieve these goals and to get there requires some fundamental changes in our production and consumption patterns. There are certain key game changing policy areas we in the EU have already started to deliver on and need to continue to prioritise. We need to move from a linear to a circular economy. We need to put our food system onto a fully sustainable path. We need to future proof our energy, buildings and mobility. But we will only truly be successful if we make these changes in a socially fair manner, putting strong social policies in place and making sure we leave no one behind. That’s the only way you can get everyone behind this policy. To do all that we also need to gear the so-called horizontal enablers towards a green and inclusive economic transition. These include education, science, research, innovation and digitisation, as well as finance, taxation, pricing, so that sustainable products and services become the most affordable ones, including responsible business conduct and fair trade policies. Good governance is key as the very foundations we build on are the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights. This is of course a global issue, especially now when others are questioning their commitment. We need to continue to be the strongest advocate for sustainable development in a multi-polar world, in a world based on multilateralism. This is also in our own competitive interest. The EU is at the origin of many of the most innovative and comprehensive sustainability solutions. We are best placed to be a first mover, blaze a trail for the rest of the world and reap the social and economic benefits of the sustainable transition while helping to shape global standards.

But the positive thing is that sustainability is anchored in the EU treaties. It’s part of our DNA. Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is not just a necessity, it is also a huge opportunity. It is about modernising our societies, about new forms of doing business and consuming, about reaping the benefits of new technologies and innovation. It’s about our future competitiveness. We already see that it is possible. The past years have shown that GDP growth is compatible with the reduction of CO2 emissions. It is not about lowering our living standards but about being smarter about our resources. Of course this requires a significant amount of investment. Here, the investment plan can play an important role in bringing the private sector on board. The action plan on sustainable finance will provide investors with comprehensive information on what is sustainable investment and create a new market for it. The circular economy is another area where we can create a new market. We have started to do so with plastic waste, other sectors should follow. To be successful, the transition needs to fulfil some conditions. First, we need to invest more in education and training to ensure equal opportunities and fairer societies. Second, we need to invest more in research, development and innovation, and also digitalisation, in particular in artificial intelligence. This has a huge potential, for example, in health or agriculture and Europe cannot lag behind in this field. Third, the rule of law and respect for fundamental values. We have recently seen worrying signs of leaders calling the very foundation of our democracies into question. The reflection paper is also a call to the rest of the world not to get tempted by easy solutions that may solve symptoms in the short term but that do not address the causes of our problems. We will continue contributing solutions, together with the rest of the world, in multilateral forums and through development cooperation, the external investment plan, as well as through open and rules-based trade. I am convinced that good cooperation between the Commission, Member States and the honourable Members of this House can provide and strengthen the leadership of Europe in sustainability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Francesc Gambús", "mepid": "125006", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission for attending the joint meeting of the Development and Environment Committees last Thursday to present the reflection paper entitled 'Towards a Sustainable Europe in 2030'. A document that comes to us significantly late, since we expected it at the end of last year and that we believe does not finish meeting the expectations that we had set in it because, in order to achieve the objectives, apart from reflection, we need action. In this sense, there are two options, and I want to give two clear examples. One, related to target number 6, over water. The Framework Directive lays down an obligation for the Commission to submit an evaluation report for the Directive by 20 December 2018. It's February 13, 2019 and we're still not news about it. The best regulation also goes so far as to comply with the Directives, both the Member States and the Commission. Another path, however, is that followed by Commissioner Arias Cañete, who put us in a leading position of Objective 4, to combat climate change, before, during and after COP 21 in Paris. And, more than ever, this leadership of the Union must be the world benchmark as the way forward for all countries on this planet, which, it is true, has no plan B. Rhetoric and aesthetics or action and commitment. It's two different paths. One gives headlines, the other gives results. Our institutions, which citizens choose in the May elections, will depend on the Union's path to comply with Horizon 2030.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Udo Bullmann", "mepid": "4267", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, even if the picture this morning doesn’t fully mirror the importance of the issue, yes this debate will be the dominant debate during the next five years. Even if perhaps not all sides have fully understood, this will be the decisive leadership debate for the next five years. Our group, the Socialists and Democrats, have understood. We are spearheading this discussion and we come forward with our own proposals and we are pretty much convinced that we will also be able to explain that to our partners and friends here in the House during the campaign and, finally, at the beginning of our next mandate. Yes, we recently saw thousands of people taking to the streets all over Europe calling on governments to act against climate change. Our planet is rapidly reaching its limits. The way we produce and consume depletes our fish stocks, pollutes our air, destroys our soil and damages our health. Among our citizens, particularly among the young, there is a broad awareness of the urgency to act now. At the same time, social uprisings like the yellow vests in France articulate a deep-seated frustration with the status quo and anger at social injustice. Something is fundamentally wrong with a system when, after 40 years of hard work, pensioners have to choose between paying their heating or buying food. Something is fundamentally wrong when workers slave away for 40 or more hours per week and still can’t make ends meet. And something is fundamentally wrong when young people, at a time when the future should lie wide open, to them become entrapped in a vicious circle of unemployment, unpaid traineeships and short-term contracts. How can we expect these people now to pick up the bill for transforming the ways we produce and consume to more sustainable patterns while digital giants pay almost zero taxes and the super-rich hide billions in tax havens? This system is broken. Our societies are in a deep crisis. Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, wir Sozialdemokratinnen und Sozialdemokraten denken deswegen, dass man diese beiden Krisen entschieden zusammen anpacken muss, die soziale wie die ökologische.  Wir kämpfen für einen gerechten Übergang zu einem nachhaltigen Wirtschaftsmodell, das Wohlstand für alle schafft, mit den Zielen der Vereinten Nationen für nachhaltige Entwicklung als unsere Wegweiser, weil wir wissen, dass unser Planet nicht überleben wird, wenn soziale Ungerechtigkeiten fortbestehen, und weil soziale Ungerechtigkeiten nicht auszurotten sind, ohne die Umweltkrise entschieden anzupacken. Deswegen, sehr verehrte Vizepräsidenten der Kommission: Es ist Zeit zu handeln! Ihr Papier macht einen Vorschlag, ein ambitioniertes Szenario 1 zu verfolgen. Wir unterstützen das. Wir wollen nicht mehr darüber diskutieren, welches Szenario das Richtige ist, wir wollen es umsetzen. Weil wir glauben, dass wir keine Zeit mehr haben, müssen wir jetzt die Konzepte setzen, Konzepte entschiedenen Handelns für das neue Mandat.  Alle unsere Bereiche in der Politik – ob wir über Regionalpolitik reden, ob wir über Forschungsförderung reden, ob wir über die Art und Weise der Handelsverträge reden, die wir abschließen – müssen sich an diesen Zielen orientieren. Wir müssen sie endlich in die Realität bringen, messen, Erfolge feiern und weiter vorangehen.

Thank you, Madam President. I too would like to thank the Commission for this excellent document and for its excellent contribution to this debate. This is one of the first documents in which the Commission indicates that urgent action is needed to address the multifaceted ecological crisis we are facing. Climate, biodiversity, raw materials and air quality: it all occurs in it. I really thank the Commission for that. Fortunately, as Mr Bullmann said, social inequality is also being addressed, because the two are indeed very much together. But then we come to the big question, the same question I also asked after the presentation of the long-term climate strategy. How are we going to turn this into concrete action, not only tomorrow, but also today? When I look at the proposal for the multiannual budget and see that we are setting out policy and money in it until 2027, it is seriously dated. That is old politics, if I compare it to these two excellent documents from the European Commission. Let's be, 2030 seems far away, but it's tomorrow. And we have very little time left to turn the tide. So, my specific question to the Commission is: when can we expect concrete proposals? And can we expect adjustments to the multiannual budget? Agricultural policy as it stands does not meet the criteria set out in this document. Why do we not green all public procurement so that we create a market of more than EUR 2 000 billion a year? The same applies to the Structural Funds as to agricultural policy: they do not meet the criteria we are now setting. And it is very nice that Commissioner Katainen referred to 'sustainable financing', but now it is almost just about transparency. The crucial question will ultimately be: how do we encourage green and socially just investment? And how do we discourage investments that are not? The Economist also says that the market cannot do this alone.

It explains that the European Union — and I quote verbatim — is well placed to be a world leader in the transition to sustainability, or that it has pioneered this field. But if we look at the proposal in more detail, we realize that the European Commission's first concern is economic growth, but understood as the benefits that transnationals will be able to draw from this economic reorientation. For example, let's talk about agriculture, the first thing the Commission says is that a new economic value of more than EUR 1.8 trillion can be created by 2030 and, if anything, contribute to the recovery of natural resources; but at no time is the use of large-scale pesticides being debated in this House questioned, for example, or the fact that the common agricultural policy favours large farms more than local and organic agriculture. Nor are insufficient energy targets questioned. In fact, with the data that Eurostat has recently put in hand, it does not seem so clear that we will reach the common target of 20% renewables by 2020. I do not know. As the Commission said at the beginning, either sells us a green motorbike or is selling us smoke. But the truth is that the root of the problem is not being attacked: a voracious and unsustainable economic system. The solution is to put the ecological transition under the umbrella of the interests of the people and the planet, and not the sacrosanct economic growth.

Madam President, Mr Timmermans proposes a discussion paper on the European Union's sustainable development objectives, in which he presents three scenarios. In fact, one of the scenarios is to do nothing more. Now we continue to analyse and consider strategies for the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, which the United Nations has already set in 2015. But isn't it time to react? To quote Greta Thunberg: \"I would like you to panic as if your house was burning\". Do we? We weigh the throes and cons, we meditate. Is this really what you do when your house burns down? Wouldn't you be running left and right to look for water, blankets, in short, reacting to put out the fire? So, unlike many policy makers, European youth have taken the measure of the issue. Today, we have the technical solutions to reduce our ecological footprint. Of course, we must continue to perfect it, we must have a fair approach: just at European level: it is not for the disadvantaged social classes to pay the cost of the ecological transition; and just on a global level: we can't make others suffer to have more clean air here. Now we need to set the right political priorities, we need to coordinate our actions for the climate, we need to establish an ambitious roadmap, with deadlines, with clearly defined objectives in the fields of energy, industry, mobility, agriculture. The ecological and solidarity transition can no longer wait. We managed to bring down the Berlin Wall, to go to the moon. That's why achieving our climate goals is possible, we can do it too.

Now, we all want to live in a better world. We all want good air quality. We all want to see ecologically sound moves. Everyone wants that. Nobody wants to live in a situation like the area that I came from originally, the Black Country in the UK, which around the 19th century, during the industrial revolution, was known as the Black Country because during the day it was black from the soot and smoke from the furnaces and at night it was red because of the foundries. People died because their lungs were being clogged up by this stuff. So we all would like to see a better environment to live in. But my suggestion, my proposal, my input into all this is that you can’t do it, and certainly not by 2030, which is, in terms of these kind of changes, tomorrow. You can’t do this from the top down, imposing and forcing. You’re ignoring human nature: the desire to create wealth to better their souls through trade. What needs to be done is to facilitate an environment where science develops better – maybe – tax breaks on these kind of things.

So it is just a matter of taking the initiative, so thank you to the Commission for the sustainable finance and circular economy packages. Yes, we need to line up the future, set out what are going to be the next steps, because we are seeing the exponential growth of the challenges. That means that we need to act now, and we need to act with the right level of ambition. I would have five suggestions.  Firstly, the monitoring platform. That is linked to sustainable finance, put it to work and harmonise the indicators and lifecycle analyses. Secondly, the renewable eco-design directives, so that it is horizontal. Thirdly, specific programmes on food, sustainable food, so this concerns the whole lifecycle, buildings – they are a major element – and textiles, there is going to be a growing challenge in the area.

We should be proud of that. But it's not enough to get the Paris agreement. With the same modesty, we must look at the sustainable development goals and implement them here with us.

I would now like to focus in particular on something that is usually not so much in focus in this debate, namely marine protection and the oceans. Oceans are hugely important for our climate. They produce oxygen, they bind CO2, but they are also very much destroyed by the climate, by climate change with in detriment or disadvantaged and disturbed, partially destroyed. It is essential that we do something to prevent this and to improve it. We have already achieved a great deal through the plastics strategy, through the appropriate single-use plastic legislation, through marine waste disposal in ports.

I would add one more topic, which has not been raised here and which I subjectively consider important and which relates to sustainable development and human relationship to the environment.

I am a member of the intergroup here, in the European Parliament, which is now supporting the initiative 'Banning cage time' to improve animal welfare in the EU and to ban cage farming.

'All profit', 'all growth' and GDP as the only indicator show that things need to change and that this model is not up to the ambitions of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals voted in 2015.

But we also need to look at the issue of allocation, because the distribution must be fair. A great wealth is produced in the European Union and worldwide, but unfortunately it is not distributed correctly, it is not distributed fairly.

First, I want to say it would be a mistake to think nothing has been done during this Commission’s term of office, and to see this just as a starting point, when we start doing something. I would like to give you a couple of examples, namely the Paris Agreement and our climate legislation, the circular economy package, the plastics strategy, the social dimension and the investment plan for Europe, to mention just a few concrete examples of measures already adopted which will have a significant impact on sustainability in the future. I have tried to take two different ways of looking at sustainability in Europe. The first concerns social sustainability. I have visited many of our Member States, and I have seen that there are those which are advanced in social dialogue between employees and employers about how to reskill people already in jobs; and there are those which, basically, have not done anything. I am afraid this issue may become a new dividing line in Europe. There are countries which understand that we have to pay more attention than before to re-skilling. There are also countries that pay more attention than others to the quality of teacher training and education internally. If Member States – our governments and the social partners – don’t take more seriously the challenge of skills and the quality of basic education, then we cannot be successful. This is my first message. I believe that education – training and reskilling people – is the most important social factor in relation to sustainability. Then, looking at the economic angle, I would like to mention the circular economy, including product-design policies and sustainable finance – those three concrete issues. They are the issues which, I believe, matter most with regard to improving sustainability. I had a discussion with several representatives of financial institutions, who are pleading with us to create a clear taxonomy and a classification of sustainable finance. They are saying that their clients are asking for more sustainable assets. And this is exactly what the Commission is working on at the moment. We have to let the financial sector act to change the world. They are willing to do it, because their clients, us, and consumers are asking them to do it. So, if we manage to create sustainable finance criteria and a taxonomy, I’m sure that hundreds of billions of euro will shift direction and this, honourable Members, will change the world, including through the circular economy. The private sector is leading the show here at moment, and this House has been extremely supportive and innovative, supporting too the developments in product-design policy because we, as consumers, are asking for more sustainable business models, more sustainable ways to consume and more durable and repairable products. So I am not worried at all about whether we can achieve the sustainable development goals, if we just manage to pick the right things to change and also, especially, if we keep the private sector onboard – because it’s not only us, as legislators or regulators, who can change the world. It’s also private operators. Our role is to create a better playing field, a more sustainable regulatory environment, which will enables us and other stakeholders to do the trick.  I believe we can combine social equality, social sustainability, environmental sustainability and sustainable economic growth in the future, and it should not be rocket science!", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 27, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  The debate is closed.

First of all, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mrs Krell, for the cooperation, all the colleagues on the Committee on Regional Development and its Chair, all the colleagues from budgets, transport who have joined this work. This was cooperation in the name of cohesion policy. This was cooperation in the name of all regions of the European Union – for the sake of the poorest, for the sake of the more developed, in the name of the mountainous, in the name of the coastal, for the sake of the outermost, for the sake of rural regions, for the sake of all. For too long, cohesion policy has been used as a bargaining chip. It was taken for granted by one and by others as a gift. Of course, neither is true. With its more than 30 years of history, cohesion policy has become a value, it has long gone beyond just programmes, funds, initiatives and instruments. She lined up alongside everything else that holds this Union together. Cohesion policy is the glue that holds Member States together in this European Union. That's why he needs our support.  And yes, that means more funding. And yes, that means we're going to push for $47 billion more. And yes, this means that the poorest regions have to pay less co-financing for this policy. And yes, that means we have to get behind it for very traditional investments. There are still regions in the European Union that need better roads, faster trains, larger ports and more airports. This is the world we live in. From now on, something very important lies ahead. I hear colleagues say \"This is going to be a clash between populism and traditional parties, between extremism and the more moderate ones.\" From now on, there are only two paths – up and down. This report means upwards. This report means a stronger European Union because it is a slap in the face to populism. It means Europe is visible. It means Europe gets to everyone. It means that Europe is measurable, that it is understandable. If there are people here who love the European Union, it means they must also love the farthest village in this European Union. If they care about him, it means they're holding on to the last person who lives worse than everyone else. And as long as there is such a village, as long as there is such a person, there must also be a cohesion policy.  From now on, dear colleagues, there is a huge challenge ahead. We were only able to get to this stage after ten months of work. It was extremely important because we have shown that this European Parliament thinks of the people who elected it from the outside. Because in just 100 days we will be judged on how well we have done, what we have done and what we have not been able to do. And we'il have answers. What and how much will the regions in the European Union receive, how much farmers will receive, how much will be received by rural regions, how much there will be for ecology, how much there will be for infrastructure, how much there will be for students, how much there will be for agriculture. Most of all, what will be the rules to which they will have to obey, what will be the conditions they must meet. Our central task was to get this job done and get it done in due course. That's why I'm glad we were able to do it. From now on, there is only one thing left – to communicate the end of this work in an understandable human language, because all these funds, all these initiatives exist for the sake of people. They exist for people, for business, for students, for farmers, for everyone else. That's why we have to tell it in their language, because Europe works for them, contrary to everything populists say.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 39, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Constanze Krehl", "mepid": "1854", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The rapporteurs presented a report on future cohesion policy in September. We worked on more than two and a half thousand amendments together with the shadow rapporteurs and the committee and voted on them on 22 January. Why have we put forward such a pace? We want to start negotiations on the future cohesion policy with the Council quickly, because I believe that we owe it to the citizens, the regions, the cities and the municipalities, that they have planning certainty, for which they can spend their money after 2020, and that they can start to implement their ideas. I think we are proposing a good compromise to the House to decide on this today. We are asking for EUR 378 billion for cohesion policy for all the regions in the European Union. And it is precisely after the previous debate on sustainability that I am pleased to say that we are proposing to you that 30% of regional policy's resources be used against climate change. I believe that this is a very important signal that we are sending out. We want the regions to continue to be divided into three categories: the less developed, the more developed and the transitional regions. I believe that this meets the needs of the regions. We want – and here we support the Commission – that the European Union should become smarter – which is always good – to become more social and greener, but also to be closer to the citizens and for us to be better connected, so that both the communication and digital infrastructure swell. We are following the Commission in the proposals for massive simplification of procedures. We support that. But we are also again committed to a very strong partnership principle: the involvement of the economic and social partners on the one hand, but also of local committed Members in county councils, in the city councils, and in the NGOs, which are actively active in the regions. We want the child guarantee to be included in the European Social Fund. We want the social pillar and national energy and climate plans to be included in the strategic planning of future operational programmes. The European Parliament has raised the co-financing rates of the European funds to the current level for the regions, and even a little more for the transitional categories, so that there are also sufficient opportunities to be able to provide the co-financing that must be made at national level. It is also important to say at this point that we do not forget the outermost regions, which sometimes seem so far away, but which are important for our European Union and which hope that the European Union will continue to support them in the future. Just as we demand that we have a safety net for regions that unexpectedly find their way into strange situations. Let me give you an example: a region is better divided in the current funding period, comes into a lower status of economic development and will receive even less money in the future. It cannot be! I believe that we must do something about this. I am very pleased that we are introducing an article that focuses on general horizontal conditions and criteria such as respect for human rights, gender equality, anti-discrimination, sustainability objectives and much more, including future cohesion policy. And I am very pleased that, with the European Social Fund (ESF+), we are taking up the fight against youth unemployment, the fight against poverty and social inclusion, and are making significantly more money available for it. For my group, two things are still particularly important: we do not want there to be a link between European regional policy and macroeconomic conditionality in the future. We do not think that is appropriate. And a second important point: I am very pleased that we can propose to the House that the rural development fund should be brought back a little more under the umbrella of cohesion policy. For us, the development of rural areas is more than just the promotion of farmers. We must make much greater efforts to take these regions with us and develop them further.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 40, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Corina Crețu", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I think today is a very important moment. We are talking about common provisions, regulation of the European Regional Development Fund and other European funds for seven years, from 2021-2027. It is a key milestone in our preparation for post-2020. I would like to thank all of you for your contribution. It’s very important that we are going to have a new regulation based on the lessons we have learned over the last years.  For simplification purposes, for the first time there is just one regulation to cover all shared seven management funds. You know very well that everywhere I have been since becoming Commissioner I have heard the same complaints, and I really was very sad to meet young people who had given up using our funds because of bureaucracy, because of complications and lending regulations. So now we have a handbook. We have this one regulation to cover all seven shared management funds and it is a milestone in terms of the quality of Parliament’s report. I would like to thank both Ms Krehl and Mr Novakov, all Members of the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) – Ms Mihaylova, the Chair, and the others – and all those who contributed to this report. You really deserve a high prize for the efficiency and quality of the work done in such a short time. I warmly welcome your support for key elements of the Commission proposal, and of course, I rely on you, I ask for your continued support to ensure that these elements are maintained and they are not watered down during the negotiations. For us, these elements include, very importantly, first a partnership agreement for all 27 Member States and for all seven funds. You know that in the COREPER there is this idea to have different standards for different countries and your report rightly placed great emphasis on strategies and coordination. We cannot accept double standards. We cannot accept coordination for some Member States but not others and we cannot accept coordination of some funds but not others. I really hope that I can count on your support on this.  The second key element is about new policy objectives. Here again, I wish to thank you for your support. We all want, as Ms Krehl said, a Europe that is smarter, greener, more connected, more social and closer to the citizens. Our five new policy objectives are a step in the right direction and, for us, it is very important to remain like this during the negotiations. A third key element is a meaningful midterm review. Here, of course, I know that this is not a unanimous approach but I would ask you to keep an open mind. I believe that five plus two programming is necessary for a meaningful review. Our experience shows that when funding is all programmed at the beginning, it is less flexible. During this programming period there were so many unexpected events – like migrants, like Caterpillar in Belgium, like earthquakes in Italy. So we need to be flexible. We have tried to respond to these new challenges. Deleting five plus two programming represents, in our view, a step backwards, a step away from flexibility. Our first key element is simplification. I started with this and I want to close with this. Thank you for your support on this. Thank you for the belief in our common efforts for simplification, because the many simplifications in our proposals are based on suggestions and ideas from all Member States and all families. In fact, as you know, we have a Simplification Handbook. We have simplified and streamlined programmes that have been set up. We have simplified payment claims. We have simplified the audit process. Your continued support here is crucial in both the short and long terms, ensuring that simplifications are not watered down, that they continue to strike the right balance. In conclusion, it is now time to open discussions from the trilogue. Beginning with this vote today we can start the trilogue. I want to thank you, because Parliament has already showed its readiness in terms of this report. Of course I also asked the Council to maintain the momentum into the trilogues, because we must maintain the momentum, and we must also maintain the quality of the proposals for an effective, dynamic, modern and cohesive policy.

From the Committee on Budget’s point of view, my mission was to make sure that Parliament’s position on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) is also part of this regulation and we demand two things. Firstly, that the amounts for cohesion policy stay at the same level or increase, because people in Europe expect more growth, more competitiveness, better infrastructure, and we cannot do more with less.

We work everywhere, including more visibility of greenery, growth and jobs. It's good that we're stopping the plethora of logos that are on all those signs, and that we're putting a lot more emphasis on what people achieve in those projects. Let the star shine. They are proud people in social projects, economic projects, etc. Let's give them the strength. Fortunately, we also set aside pennies for that. It is also good that we are increasing the synergy between different Union funds, such as Horizon Europe, and, where necessary, making transfers possible. An important point for the EPP is that it is not right for parts of Europe to depopulate. You just see a population flight in rural areas, while other parts of Europe are booming and developing rapidly. That's not good. That is not the image we have in mind with cohesion.

In particular, I would like to highlight the higher pre-financing rate of EU projects, greater flexibility and retention of N+3 rules. It is especially important to maintain the N+3 rule as it allows for a longer absorption period so that they are fully used where they are needed most.  When making such important decisions, we should take into account the context. There are still large differences in development between Member States, and within each of them we have inequality between different regions. This has always been and will be because we are not all the same, nor have we had the same development path, but it is our responsibility to mitigate these differences so that the Union develops evenly. Cohesion policy is extremely valuable in this regard and we must work to strengthen it, taking into account that the conditions for application, especially for centrally managed funds, are adapted to those most in need. Thus, less developed members with less administrative capacity and a lack of experience in absorption of European funds.

With this umbrella regulation, as a Parliament, we are securing a strong position of cohesion policy for the future and, as Constanze Krehl has already said, we want to enter into negotiations with the Council soon. We Greens, too, see cohesion policy as a visible sign of European solidarity. In some regions, the only public investment is the money spent on this. They are used to combat climate change, to combat poverty, and they create jobs. They are important for investment in research and development and for cross-border projects.  It was very important to us Greens in the negotiations that all regions continue to benefit from cohesion policy and that the partnership principle and the involvement of local and regional stakeholders, the social partners, but especially civil society, be strengthened.  We have paid particular attention to the preservation and also the development of horizontal principles. This means equality, not discrimination, sustainable development and respect for human rights.

The situation in France is a reminder that these territories need to be better considered.

It is also clear in the Commission's proposal to propose projects only in the framework of the country's recommendations, which I do not think is normal, plus macro-economic conditionality.

That's what I think is not normal for a Commissioner who is in charge of that area.

More co-financing is needed for countries that do not have the financial means to propose projects based on European funds. After all, the amount given by the European funds is the same.

În primul rând, vreau să vă mulțumesc tuturor pentru sprijinul dat și pentru această dezbatere atât de fructuoasă în legătură cu regulamentele comune privind Fondul de dezvoltare regională și alte fonduri europene. Bineînțeles, am primit și critici la adresa propunerilor Comisiei și apreciez acele critici constructive. Bineînțeles că nu apreciez acele critici care vin din partea unor oameni care, în mod clar, nu cunosc regulamentele, nu cunosc tratatele la care Uniunea Europeană este parte și este evident că, sigur, le luăm pe toate în considerare, dar cred că trebuie să pornim de la ideea de bază, aceea că Comisia face o propunere pe care dumneavoastră o aprobați sau nu și care se supune dezbaterii Parlamentului European și Consiliului ca și colegislatori. Vreau să vă amintesc, unora dintre dumneavoastră, de fapt doar unei doamne, că campania electorală începe pe 26 aprilie 2019 și nu suntem în campanie electorală.  În altă ordine de idei, aș vrea să le spun celor care critică bugetul acordat politicii de coeziune că, din cauza Brexitului, dumneavoastră știți poate chiar mai bine decât mine, avem o scădere, vom avea, din păcate, o scădere de 10 % pe an din bugetul Fondului de coeziune, iar toată bătălia noastră a fost de a menține această politică de coeziune care este politica cea mai vizibilă, cea mai tangibilă în viața de zi cu zi a oamenilor.  În ciuda faptului că suntem în fața acestui proces al Brexitului, în ciuda faptului că, pentru prima oară, Uniunea Europeană este chemată să adopte un fond de securitate, un fond de apărare, este pentru prima oară când Uniunea Europeană este chemată să acorde bani pentru securitatea frontierelor, în ciuda tuturor acestor aspecte, politica de coeziune, pentru prima dată în istoria Uniunii Europene, va avea un buget de 373 de miliarde de euro, cel mai mare buget din cadrul bugetului total, din care 80 %, mai mult decât în actuala perioadă de programare, se vor duce în regiunile cel mai puțin dezvoltate.  Deci, haideți să încetăm cu dezinformarea populației: peste 80 % din fondurile de coeziune se duc în regiunile cele mai sărace. Sunt țări, precum Spania, Grecia, Italia, România, Bulgaria, care, din cauză că nu au reușit să treacă peste criza economică și din cauza scăderii economice, vor avea creșteri economice, creșteri în alocări, iar alte state care au avut creșteri spectaculoase - suntem totuși după nouă ani de creștere continuă economică în Uniunea Europeană - vor avea scăderi în ceea ce privește alocările, iar aceste scăderi provin din faptul că GDP per capita - produsul intern brut pe cap de locuitor - este mai mare decât acum șapte ani. Deci, nu este vorba de nicio penalizare, nu este vorba de vreo scădere, este vorba doar despre recunoașterea creșterii economice care a avut loc în aceste state.  Aceasta a fost în legătură cu bugetul. În legătură cu vizibilitatea politicii noastre: sunt foarte de acord cu ceea ce s-a spus aici, mai ales cu ceea ce dragul nostru coleg, Derek Vaughan, a spus. Bineînțeles că suntem cu toții triști că Marea Britanie părăsește acest proiect european, dar este o lecție pe care trebuie să o învățăm, pentru că Uniunea Europeană a contribuit enorm la dezvoltarea inclusiv a acestei țări: metroul din Cardiff, extinderea metroului din Londra, de asemenea, Universitatea din Manchester, deci avem o mulțime de exemple de proiecte care nu sunt cunoscute. Asta pe lângă faptul că părintele fondator al acestei politici, primul comisar european pentru politică regională - se numea Lord Thomson -, este cel care a solicitat împreună cu Italia și cu guvernul Marii Britanii înființarea acestei politici de coeziune în semn de solidaritate atunci când minele din Țara Galilor au fost închise; dar, bineînțeles că, probabil, cei care au votat acum pentru Brexit în această regiune nu au știut că părinții și bunicii lor au avut locuri de muncă datorită acestor fonduri europene care au contribuit la dezvoltarea economică a regiunii lor. So I will pass now into English. I would like to thank warmly the rapporteurs – we are talking not about the Commission proposal, we are talking about your report. I would like to thank you, Ms Krehl and Mr Novakov, the Committee on Regional Development and all of you. Thank you very much for your high-quality work, for your hard work, for your efforts and, of course, you know very well that we count on you to move the legislative package forwards. Thank you very much for everything.  I think that our proposal lays the foundation for a quality and effective policy. You know very well that we have worked so much together to strengthen, modernise and simplify this policy, and now we are facing into new challenges, which are the trilogies. As you will vote on this report today, we can start the trilogues between Parliament and the Council as co-legislators – and, of course, I will represent the Commission. We must get the package through in a timely manner, while maintaining the quality of the proposals. You know very well that according to our studies, we would have liked to have this agreement before the European elections. It seems that it will not be possible during the Romanian Presidency, but I hope at least by the end of the year to have an agreement on the multiannual financial framework (MFF), on the budget because, according to our estimates, more than 100 000 projects from 27 Member States will not be able to be finished on time if we don’t have an agreement this year. As I said, unfortunately, it seems that it’s impossible to be ready before the elections, as we foresaw one year ago. So we have several challenges. The first challenge is maintaining a strong strategic focus, and partnership agreements are essential to this. Our new policy objectives are essential too, and thank you for all your support here. I would like to underline that, in the new partnership agreements that we will start to negotiate with each Member State in March, you will be able to raise your problems. For instance, the problem of decentralisation that was raised by MEPs Marinescu and Buşoi, and the problems of islands which were raised by the representative of the Balearic Islands. So it’s up to the Member States whether or not they include in the partnership agreement, and in the operational programmes, how to earmark the money and who will be the beneficiaries. For instance, I know that you referred to the three regional hospitals in Romania. We cannot decide from Brussels who will be the beneficiary of a project, it’s up to the government to decide. But bear in mind that we will start negotiations on the partnership agreement and operational programmes in March 2019 and I hope NGOs, Members of the European Parliament and everybody involved will have a strong dialogue with each government so that these local needs that you spoke about are kept in mind. On simplification: we are very keen on that, you are aware that I was in favour of radical simplification and, as you know, we have proposed 80 key simplifications. The challenge lies in both directions – maintaining the simplifications but resisting over-simplification. Simplification is not a goal in itself. Our goal is a quality, effective policy, making life easier for beneficiaries, of course, but we cannot allow over-simplification which reduces the project’s quality or value-added and I count on your support here too. Also we have to bear in mind realistic co-financing. Let’s remember, as I said, that today’s EU co-financing rates are exceptional because they were increased for the economic crisis. Moreover, our proposal for the co-financing rates means greater local ownership and in the end it also means greater total funding and a greater boost to development. The financial challenge we have is, as I said at the beginning, the budget. We have discussed various proposals to increase and protect the cohesion policy budget. I understand very much and I appreciate your support for the policy. In conclusion, we have a window of opportunity, an opportunity to make progress. The negotiators’ mandates for the trilogues cover substantial issues – strategy programming, management and control – together these make up more than one-third of the regulation and on these issues I see a convergence of interests, so I believe we can make significant progress. Remember that progress has no risk. We are all going to enter into the trilogues, the first one for cohesion policy will be on 19 March, knowing that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Progress on this issue, the issue of convergence, will provide clarity for managing authorities and beneficiaries. Let us seize this opportunity. Once again, thank you to all of you, but first of all to Ms Krehl and Mr Novakov.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 106, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Андрей Новаков", "mepid": "107212", "text": "   Rapporteur. – First of all, I thank everyone who took part in the debate. For almost two hours, we failed to understand in depth, to say everything we think about cohesion policy, which shows that it makes sense for it to continue to exist. It continues to excite all of us, no matter what part of the European Union we come from.  One thing I'm sure of everything I've heard – if cohesion policy disappears one day, it won't be because of those who attack it and disapprove of it. This would only happen for those who look idly by without doing anything about it. However, I will not be among these people, and I am glad that there are many others in this room who think like me. Because cohesion policy has no net payers and net beneficiaries. There are only one and they are net winners, because each one benefits from European politics – from the Black Sea coast to the Atlantic coast. Everyone can see the results of it.  There are few European policies that touch every single person and reach every single village, in small and large cities, to students, farmers, young scientists, entrepreneurs, businesses, all.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I would like to briefly comment on one aspect of the debate, namely the question of flexibility between the funds and other European Union programmes.

We suggest that the regions can work with InvestEU up to a certain limit. And we propose to you that we transfer an appropriate contribution, EUR 4 billion, to the Connecting Europe Facility. We also propose that we also have a balanced flexibility between the funds, which will enable the regions to invest precisely in projects.

For the current regulation of CPR in force, I have submitted a number of proposals, which have been built in, as the report officer of the EMPL Commission. I particularly welcome the fact that the new CPR has retained or extended these elements. The Structural Funds have long provided resources to increase the employment of persons with disabilities and to promote their inclusive education.

With my amendments to the draft, I have also sought to ensure that cohesion policy will continue to serve the cohesion of the Member States and regions of the Union. Continue to play a crucial role in the EU's balanced economic, social and territorial development. Face challenges such as globalisation and climate change. At the same time, do not forget about the outcasts, the poor, the children living in poverty – even if the governments of a Member State, such as the Orban regime, do not care about them.

Thank you very much to the rapporteurs for their successful work. The priorities in the EU budget must finally change. We need to move away from stubborn investment in cows to sustainable investment in the future. The Commission's proposals, together with the European Parliament's report, are important steps forward. Simplification and de-bureaucratisation are essential in the allocation of regional funding. European cohesion policy is a unique investment instrument for regions at EU level, for all regions! It is important to me that this principle should continue to apply! The cohesion funds aim to promote economic, social and territorial cohesion. Cohesion policy is therefore a strong and visible sign of solidarity on the part of the European Union. There are still serious differences in development in European regions, by which I mean the low-growth and low-income regions. We can reduce these differences with effective cohesion policy.

This is theft from hard-working people, pure and simple. From 1997 to 2017 the average company tax rate in Europe fell from over 35% to under 22%. Digital companies pay even less in taxes – only 9.5% on average according to the Commission’s figures. Internet giants – like Apple, Google and Facebook – pay practically zero tax on their European businesses. Apple famously paid only 0.005% in taxes, while Google and Facebook paid 0.82% and 0.03%. This is not only making a mockery of ordinary citizens and regular companies in Europe who are paying their fair taxes to contribute to society, but it is an existential threat to well-functioning welfare states, societal fairness and a sustainable transition in Europe.  We Socialists and Democrats want to stop international tax evasion and avoidance that also accelerates inequalities in the world today. We know that 26 people owe as much as EUR 3.8 billion – half  of the world’s population – according to new figures. We want tax justice and we want it now. We have put forward concrete solutions to achieve that and the EU needs to take the lead. We want a fair and urgent taxation of the internet giants who profit from European customers but pay almost no tax in Europe. We want an effective minimum corporate taxation in Europe to stop the harmful race to the bottom on corporate taxation. We also want a financial transaction tax to stop harmful speculation and to ensure much—needed taxes to fund public services. It is time for tax havens – even the European Council – to stop defending the broken tax system of yesterday. It’s time to stand up for fair taxation and demand that all companies, especially the largest and richest of them – the digital giants – contribute to society. We Social Democrats of course support the OECD solution to the problem of taxing digital companies, but we will not wait forever and we will not sit idle and silent while the richest and biggest companies in the world continue to pay less than 1% tax in Europe. We reject the false argument that EU Member States should not take the lead in stopping the non—taxation of digital giants. How on earth can opponents of the EU solution claim that 36 members of OECD and 128 members of the Inclusive Framework will reach a decision faster than the 28 Member States in the EU when they themselves are blocking progress in the European Council? The clock is ticking. We know that. France, Italy, Spain, the UK and Austria all have plans for national taxation of digital giants, as they should. Blocking an effective EU solution to the problem of the non-taxation of digital giants will not prevent uncoordinated action on this. It will actually ensure uncoordinated action. We have a workable EU solution to fairly tax digital giants on the table. We have stated clearly that if and when an OECD solution is adopted, this solution would immediately take its place. But, honestly, do you really think for a second that Donald Trump will fight for fair taxation of companies? Because he needs to support the OECD solution too. Do you trust a deal with the man who pulled out of the Paris Agreement and a G7 statement via tweets? This is a choice that the politicians of Europe must make now. Do we want to act and force internet giants to pay their fair tax in Europe or do we just want to wait and hope someone else will find a solution, while the countries of Europe are losing billions in taxes? We Socialists and Democrats have a clear message to the governments imposing fair taxation. Stop defending your richest companies who pay little tax.

A year ago the European Parliament had a topical debate on a similar question. This proves that we want, and we have to address tax issues on several occasions. While the EU needs to guarantee the prosperity and well-being of its citizens, collecting tax remains one of the key means through which governments are able to address poverty and inequality at national level. Some may say that the EU could do more in the area of taxation, but I’d like to recall the progress that has been achieved so far over the last few years in this area, and we assure you that the Romanian Presidency will continue work in this direction. Allow me to recall first of all the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, which is a major success in the EU, providing for a comprehensive framework of anti-abuse measures aimed at ensuring that taxation will occur where value is created. There were also four significant extensions of the scope of administrative cooperation in the area of direct and indirect taxation. Tax rulings issued to companies will not be a secret anymore. Tax authorities are now able to receive and exchange information on country-by-country reports. Administrative cooperation in the area of VAT was also reinforced. Fair taxation also depends on international cooperation. As you are aware, global cooperation is key to combating base erosion and profit-shifting. For the EU, the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions and the work at the OECD level on digital economy taxation are two examples of successful international cooperation that has been established and that is contributing to the objective of fair taxation. Firstly, on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. Aggressive tax planning through the offshore system is detrimental to fair taxation and to a just society. However, all countries are free to adopt the tax policy that suits their specific needs. Tax policy is one of the key elements of national economy policy and each country has the right to choose tax incentives to make its economy more attractive. But when tax incentives are harmful, others should be free to adopt appropriate counter-measures. The EU Member States operating through the Code of Conduct Group were able to have a contribution to changing the behaviour of most of the tax havens. The Council has always stated that listing countries is not an objective in itself, and that most fundamental is that jurisdictions which are key partners of the EU share the same standards of tax transparency and good tax governance. Most of the more than 90 jurisdictions which were invited for a dialogue, and which are important partners for the EU, are adhering to the standards common to EU Member States. I think this is a major achievement, and this work will continue. More jurisdictions will be invited to engage in a similar dialogue in the near future. Secondly, on the digital economy, EU Member States are working closely with the OECD to find a global and comprehensive solution to the challenges brought about by the digitalisation of the economy. A broad approach is needed, examining the key aspects relevant to combating base erosion and profit-shifting, such as where tax should be paid and how much. The EU is working hard on an interim solution. The digital services tax directive would fill the gap while the long-term solution is being negotiated. We are likewise acting in the domain of VAT, where major progress has been achieved. Besides significant improvements to the current system of VAT, the Council has now started its work on the definition system and on the definitive system. I am fully confident that Member States will agree on a compromise. Everyone agrees that the EU needs a better system of VAT but a lot of technical work is required. I could continue with many other examples of good and promising work that are ongoing in the area of taxation. To conclude, I will stress the need for an honest debate on tax issues, and I am glad that we have a contribution to that today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 146, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Pierre Moscovici", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, hello to all of us, I am very pleased with this opportunity to debate together again on a subject that is very dear to me, and which is dear to us, that of tax justice. Almost five years have passed since we took office and we are nearing the end of our mandate, both for Parliament and for the Commission. The time for proposals is coming to an end and the time has come to assess the progress we have made in tax justice in the European Union. I would like to start by thanking the European Parliament, thanking all of you for your support throughout this mandate. Our two institutions have become natural allies in the fight against fraud and tax optimisation. We have exchanged very regularly, here or in Brussels, in the context of hearings and various special committees (TAX and PANA), and the reports you have published have fuelled our discussions and reflections on tax justice. It was absolutely imperative that we take action to strengthen tax justice in the European Union. In recent years, repeated scandals have revealed the shortcomings of our tax rules, which are visibly unable to combat fraud and tax optimisation. In addition to the shortfall in our public finances, which are estimated at between 50 and 70 billion a year in the European Union for VAT alone, these scandals have created a legitimate sense of injustice among European citizens, who have asked us to react. We heard their appeal and put tax justice at the very top of the European agenda; I am convinced that we have put the European Union at the forefront of this fight. Since 2014, we have managed to get fourteen proposals passed, eight of which are against fraud and tax optimisation. Despite the lock of unanimity, this is more than in the last twenty years. Our action was based on three priorities. The first pillar for tax justice has been transparency. The lack of information is always, as you will have noted, at the heart of tax scandals. Fraudsters play on the culture of secrecy, the kind of grey area that surrounds tax practices, so I have acted to put an end to tax opacity in Europe. Perhaps our most emblematic proposal is the obligation of transparency for tax intermediaries. We are targeting banks, law firms or consulting firms, which are often the great architects of tax optimization and who sell their clients tax schemes sometimes at the borders of legality. This directive will require tax intermediaries, from 2020, to pass on their tax planning schemes to their national tax administrations. The aim is not to monitor to punish, but to give tax administrations the means to identify and correct loopholes in their legislation. Then we abolished the banking secrecy of the European Union. The various tax scandals, including the latest \"CumEx\" revelations, have shown that some companies, or some taxpayers, are taking advantage of the lack of coordination between tax administrations to evade tax, and it needed to be addressed. As of 2014, we have therefore generalised the exchange of information between tax administrations in Europe and it is now compulsory and automatic in the vast majority of cases: each Member State must pass on to all others the necessary information on accounts, on tax agreements between states and companies, and on the taxes paid by multinationals in each country. Finally, transparency requires the exchange of information, but also a strengthened dialogue between Member States on their tax practices and, as you know, the use of taxation as a means to attract the wealthiest businesses and taxpayers is not the preserve of a few islands here or there. Some COUNTRIES in the Union, let us not be afraid to say, are defending a tax framework in which tax competition is a tool for competitiveness. And if tax competition is legal, unfair competition is not, or rather it should not be. We have tackled this problem head-on. Last March, the Commission for the first time identified seven member countries whose tax systems are used in, say, aggressive tax optimisation schemes. It was a difficult process, but it was necessary because among friends, you have to tell each other everything. The aim is not to punish, it is not to stigmatize, but to contribute to the creation of a fiscal framework that is fair and modern, that ensures the Europe's global competitiveness, while protecting the interests of Europe's 500 million citizens. The second pillar of my work for tax justice has been the strengthening of international cooperation. We have long known that tax havens around the world are the indispensable drivers of fraud and tax optimisation. In response, the 28 finance ministers adopted, for the first time, a blacklist of tax havens around the world. Many were skeptical, many doubted the effectiveness and sometimes even the sincerity of our approach. However, a few months later, it is clear that the European voice has been heard. Almost all of the identified jurisdictions have made, and this was the objective, specific and credible commitments to get off the blacklist. The quality of a blacklist is not judged by its length, it is judged by the efforts made not to be included.  And I continue the discussion with third countries. I meet very regularly with many prime ministers and ministers who have never walked through the door of the Commission, simply because they fear the blacklisting process. It is terribly effective and we will present the results in detail. The European Union has also established itself as a world leader in good fiscal governance. It was the first to adopt the OECD measures known as BEPS. It has translated them into its legislation, in the ATAD 1 anti-tax evasion directives and also, above all, ATAD 2. We are involved in the work of the OECD and the G20. Today, I am particularly interested in the OECD working group's proposals, published at the end of January, on the revision of the rules on taxation of profits and the introduction, which I believe, of an effective minimum rate. We will have to move forward on this subject, we will have to follow these reflections very closely. The third and final pillar of my work for tax justice has been the modernisation of European tax rules. I realized very early on that the obsolescence of European tax rules led to situations of intolerable injustice and fiscal inequality. So I started a major project to modernise the European tax framework. The main components of this modernisation have been, on the one hand, the final VAT regime, which could, I repeat, put an end to cross-border tax evasion of fifty billion a year, and which would greatly simplify the lives of our businesses; and on the other hand, the consolidated common corporate tax base, which would allow companies to operate in the single market as simply as within a single country, is also a very big project. Another important element of my proposal is the taxation of digital activities. Today, the huge benefits of digital enterprises are little, if any, taxed in the European Union. This situation is obviously unacceptable, so I have put forward two proposals to ensure fair taxation of the digital economy in the European Union. The first is to modernize corporate tax rules by introducing the concept of digital presence. And it will become all the more important as the OECD has now embarked on the search for global standards. The second is the introduction of a temporary tax on the turnover generated by certain digital activities in the Union. It is now ten months since the Commission's proposal was on the table and if we were able to convince a large majority of Member States, namely 25 out of 28 countries, a handful of recalcitrants is still blocking, and I regret that. On the one hand, because our fellow citizens are waiting for us to put an end to this manifest injustice and, on the other hand, because some Member States, including France, Spain or the United Kingdom , which is still a member of the European Union - are starting to move forward on their own. And it is a risk to the integrity of our single market. I end with a consideration for the future. The so-called \"DigiTax\" dossier illustrates the limits of unanimity. I hope we have an agreement in March. The Romanian Presidency is working on it, I thank them, but I know it is complicated. If unanimity is surmountable when it comes to reactions to tax scandals and when public pressure is strong, it can paralyze when it comes to structural reforms (energy tax, climate change, DigiTax, financial transaction tax, consolidated common base, VAT). It is for this reason that I have proposed, here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the transition to qualified majority voting in tax matters, by means of the bridge clauses that allow to move the areas in which decisions are taken by Member States, unanimously, towards qualified majority. Very concretely, this would enable the European Union to react more quickly and effectively and it would, tomorrow, strengthen the democratic legitimacy of tax decisions taken in the European Union. Tomorrow, be aware, ladies and gentlemen, if the transition to qualified majority voting were decided, the European Parliament would be co-legislator and the interests of all Europeans would be better represented. This seems important to me, at a time when the desire for representation and the thirst for democracy of Europeans are so strong. That is why , I know that there are elections coming up , I would modestly suggest that the political parties look at this issue: if there were a very large majority tomorrow, here, on all benches, to demand this passage, it would be a game-changer. And some of the ministers I saw yesterday or at Ecofin, very reluctant, could not ignore it. Finally, it would broaden the scope of tax policy in Europe. We could pursue broader social objectives, such as environmental protection, through taxation of polluting activities or regulation of financial markets or taxation of financial transactions. I call on the European Parliament to take this proposal frankly, to bring the debate to life - it is not going to end now - because it is also a way for this institution to strengthen its authority. That, ladies and gentlemen, and, dare I say it, dear friends, taxation is a privileged instrument for strengthening justice in the European Union. I regret today that we are not using it fully, even though the need for justice is growing among many Europeans, with four months to go before elections of which we all know the importance, I call on the Member States to seize these subjects to send a strong signal to our fellow citizens and convince them, if need be, even more of the usefulness of Europe. But here we have a fine case of Europe's usefulness: without Europe, we cannot fight fraud and tax evasion, and Europe has shown that it can be an effective instrument. Let us continue in this direction, and thank you for your attention and support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 147, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Dariusz Rosati", "mepid": "28394", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, fair and effective taxation has been one of the key policy priorities for the EU over the last several years. We have adopted a series of legislative acts that target tax avoidance, tax evasion and tax fraud. We firmly believe that taxes have to be paid where the value is created and that they have to be paid promptly and in full. However, in spite of these efforts, the situation is still far from perfect. Globalisation and rapid technological change have opened ample ways for evading and avoiding taxes, especially for very large transnational companies, digital firms, and also when it comes to VAT on transactions in the EU. Revenue losses incurred by national budgets due to those tax abuses are estimated in hundreds of billions of euros annually. We must not tolerate this situation. Our citizens expect us to take decisive actions against these malpractices. First, we have to fully enforce the existing legislation on a mandatory and automatic country-by-country reporting. Second, we have to take a tough stance on non-cooperative tax jurisdictions, including tax havens, and intensify efforts at OECD level to come up with a global solution. Third, fair taxation of digital companies needs to be implemented. Fourth, I call on Parliament and the Council to urgently arrive at a common position on Common Corporate Tax Base (CCTB) and Common Consolidated Corporate Tax base (CCCTB) files. Finally, VAT fraud has to be effectively tackled with a combination of national and EU measures such as single electronic invoicing systems, split payments and automatic exchange of information.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 148, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Pervenche Berès", "mepid": "1985", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S and D. - Mr President, Commissioner, I believe this debate is timely. When one looks at the identity of a political whole, the way it treats tax justice speaks volumes about the nature of its project. Behind a tax system, political priorities are expressed, the possibility of financing public services, protection and guarantee of citizens, all of which are today at the heart of the concerns of our citizens. However, we now know that tax evasion is estimated at EUR 825 billion per year, while the EU's 2019 budget is less than EUR 150 billion. There is a gap here that we cannot accept. We need to fight for better identification and greater severity with regard to tax havens. Today, an increasing share of tax-related revenues comes from consumption taxes, while VAT accounts for between 15% and 25% of Member States' tax revenues, not to mention the fraud edcover, while it is a tax that does not ensure redistribution. We need to move towards this 21st century tax, the one we voted for, the one we adopted, with a consolidated tax base and a numerical presence identified as a legislative basis. It is in this sense that we will be able to move towards more just taxation at European level, it is a real priority. And it is in this sense that the Socialist Group is proposing an effective rate of 18% across Europe for this corporate tax.

And today they feel punished in many cases by the taxes that are already sky-high. Now I hear some colleagues calling for even more taxes in the name of justice. But you confuse justice with forced equality. You confuse giving more opportunities with imposing more redistribution. For me, justice means that everyone has the same opportunities to develop their talents to the full, without unfair rules that favour certain groups, and without a policy that only benefits certain lobbies.

A phrase that perfectly sums up what this means was put by the President of the Basque Government – the lehendakari – before the Community authorities in Bilbao: it is time to devote at least the same effort to rescuing people as we have dedicated to rescuing banks. The resources we need for this come from our tax systems. Clearly, the first condition for taxes to be put at the service of the redistribution of wealth that development creates is that they are fair and progressive. The second is to stimulate the real economy and penalize financial speculation. And, besides, make them efficient by collecting. Contributing to this from European level involves at least control, coordination and transparency between tax administrations. It is essential to stand up to tax fraud and aggressive tax avoidance and planning practices. And maintain a coherent attitude towards tax havens. It is also urgent to conclude with the harmonisation of corporate tax interest rates, and I would add that those who tax the estate. They are both tools that countries use to take care of taxpayers. They help to relocate taxation from where profits occur and undermine cohesion policies. But they also reduce tax revenue as a whole. They are the source, along with the depth of the crisis, of many of the cuts that have affected social spending across Europe. Subsidiarity also at the fiscal level. Bringing collection responsibility closer to the ability to spend is a great tool to prevent the deficit and stimulate the real economy. Because spending capacity is going to depend on collection. Proximity also prevents corruption and turns solidarity, as collective action, into a more consistent practice. This is demonstrated for decades by the Basque concert and the Navarrese convention, which could be an excellent laboratory for designing the operation of a European Ministry of Finance. Finally, the European institutions can do much to guide public spending on investments with social and European value. But they need more resources to make their operations of promoting and co-financing public works with European added value decisive; programmes to support the real economy or convergence and social cohesion.

We need high and effective EU-wide minimum taxes for businesses to prevent tax dumping, Europe-wide standards for the taxation of wealth and top incomes, a digital tax that has also earned its name, and a comprehensive financial transaction tax.

Across the political groups here in the European Parliament, we have driven the Commission, and the Commission has put forward more sensible proposals against financial crime and tax dumping than any Commission before. However, the truth is that, although many of these have been decided, some of the very big proposals – particularly on the harmonisation of corporate taxation, on digital taxation, on transparency on the tax payments of large companies and on measures against the 50 billion annual VAT frauds in Europe – have not yet been adopted. And the biggest obstacle is that we still have the principle of unanimity in the Council on tax issues. This is the brake block for tax justice in Europe.

We also have Christian Democrat governments that block tax cooperation in Europe, for example, from Ireland. And that, ladies and gentlemen, does not fit together.

And the fact is that a lot has happened in this parliamentary term in the fight for fairer corporate taxation.

The anti-BEPS action plan has been implemented, the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities has been extended – we should not trivialise this.

I do not believe in demands such as the introduction of an effective minimum tax rate for companies. I also find the excitement about the fact that the effective tax rates are generally lower than the nominal tax rates, because companies make use of statutory and intended deductions, for example for research support or provisions for occupational pensions. Do we want to abandon this by changing the tax code? Or have we not decided elsewhere to do the opposite? That is why we should simply be honest and continue to make these opportunities possible.

If we in Europe want to make progress in corporate taxation, and if we want to abolish a situation that Mr Bay of the ENF has just criticised, then we need a set of instruments at European level that simply makes it impossible for individual Member States or several Member States to prevent any meaningful further development here that makes it impossible for multinational companies to pay decent taxes here in this European Union. If, at European level, we want multinationals to pay their share of the overall tax burden in comparison with small and medium-sized enterprises, then this will only work if we can set the appropriate framework conditions at European level. And they will never come as long as individuals or the merger can block what they want at European level, because we have unanimity on taxes.  It is therefore the be-all and the end- and it is essential – if we want to take the decisive step towards greater tax justice here – that we move from unanimity to qualified majority solutions. If we do not manage to do this, if the conditions that we have at the moment are maintained, then what Mr Giegold outlined a moment ago will happen, namely that we will see a lack of public acceptance of the pan-European system at this point. And if we want to convince people that Europe is advocating tax justice between small and large companies, if we want to convince people that Europe is advocating tax justice between the normal wage-paying taxpayer and multinationalcorporations, then we must deliver here.

That is what I want to draw attention to.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 181, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Pierre Moscovici", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate which shows your interest in these subjects and also, beyond the differences in sensitivity, which are normal, since you are politicians, a certain convergence of views, at least what I see as a majority convergence of views, which I have seen since the beginning of my mandate and of our joint work. We have done a lot together and I think we should be proud of that. The mandate of this Commission and the mandate of this European Parliament will have been marked by absolutely decisive progress in the fight against tax evasion and evasion, which is totally unprecedented, and our citizens must be aware of this. I think that is part of the very strong achievements in this period where we sometimes fight Europe, where we criticise it, where we question it. But there is still a lot of work to be done and I will focus very quickly on three issues that I think are important. The first is the revision of the blacklist of tax havens. The challenge is to see- as I said , what commitments have been made and kept by third countries, to see if the overall system has been effective. I am sure that I know that many commitments have been made, member states will now have to stop the new lists, both the blacklist and the grey list. We will see - I believe - a lot of countries come out of the blacklists and grey, and others enter, because in truth absolutely spectacular movements will have been accomplished. I would like to say here that without the registration process of the Union, all this would not have been possible. The second is the tax on the digital giants. I am aware that it will be difficult to convince the few Member States that are opposed to it, but the debate will have to be sustained, the need to preserve the internal market, when more and more States are moving forward alone. I also believe that we must continue to campaign for this, the time for the Europeans is also important. Finally, I would like to add that discussions on digital taxation will have to continue, where the European Union will have to defend a clear and coordinated position. Progress is being made at the OECD and the topic will also be discussed at the G20 in Osaka. We must invite all our partners to take up this problem because a global response remains the most appropriate. The third is the passage of qualified majority voting. He has animated your debates and it does not completely surprise me, I find it quite natural. It is not a socialist who proposes it - I am a socialist - it is the Commission which has made a communication on this subject and you are well aware that the majority of the Commission is rather EPP than socialist, in truth. Why does she do it? Because it finds that the real problem for us is not the level of taxation, or the tax rates - we are not even proposing to go back to it, we do not have the competence - but rather the technology, the leaks, the loss of resources, those big multinationals that do not pay their taxes. Frankly, if we were able to recover all the fraud, for example at VAT, and make the multinationals pay for the internet, I take these two examples, so do you really think that our national sovereignty would come out weakened? I would add that qualified majority voting has become the rule in almost every area in the European Union. I take the example of judicial and police cooperation.  Who will make me believe that it is more complicated to do so in tax matters than in these matters, which are areas of sovereignty so dear to the States? But I do not want to pre-empt the debate; I know there will be no decision made in this mandate, but I wanted to start this debate. What for? Because this is a great citizen's debate and, I repeat, I hope that the next European Parliament will be made up of parliamentarians who will be attached to democracy and also to the powers of Parliament, to the control over the Council, and that they will urge ministers to go in that direction, because these are in fact rearguard battles. I do not know when it will happen, but it will happen, simply because that is the meaning of the story. Or we decide that Europe stops and that we are not able to have a real energy tax, a real taxation to fight climate change, a real taxation of digital, a real taxation of financial transactions and that we are powerless in a context where others - China and the United States, not to name them - are able to protect themselves , to be extremely offensive on the tax front.  That is why I think this debate is a healthy debate, that must be taken calmly and where true arguments must be exchanged. I am prepared to carry it to the end of my mandate, because I believe very strongly in this and because it was the right time to do so, when the citizens are going to debate these issues. I know that now the issues of combating tax fraud and evasion are at the very top of the European agenda. We will still have a lot to see together, a lot of fights to fight together, and I want to assure you that until the end of my mandate, until the end of the mandate of this Commission, I will be at your disposal to advance this cause to which I have really, since I am European Commissioner, devoted a great part of my time, a great deal of my energy because I think it is , quite simply, very useful, useful to Europe, useful to Europeans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 182, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "George Ciamba", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, thank you so much for inviting the Council to the debate.

The centrifugal forces in the Union that apply under eurozone, single market rules would continue to strengthen, reinforcing the divergences between regions that have emerged over the years. In reality, the only way by which the peripheral economies of the Union can reduce the lags between their economic performance and that of the ‘centre’ is by having recourse to tax flexibility. If even this is removed, then the only policy adjustment to reverse economic downturns will be a reinforced internal devaluation underpinned by austerity policies. That will become increasingly unacceptable to European citizens.

It is true that the European legislation on medicines developed since 1965, in the wake of the tydomidomid disaster, has contributed significantly to the improvement of health standards in the European Union and that we also believe today to have areas of improvement. The European Medicines Agency evaluates and authorises medicines on the basis of efficacy and safety, without taking into account quality in terms of effectiveness or added therapeutic value. Someone, like me, might even consider that it may not be ethical, as well as that it can bring sustainability to health systems. But the truth is that Parliament, echoing citizenship, wants to ensure access to medicines, to health technology. High prices in the context of the crisis were the trigger for these difficulties in access, but there is also a lack of adequacy between research and medical needs, and more quality is also needed. There is an excess of incremental research to the detriment of genuine innovations; some studies number them at 85%. Moreover, even high drug prices do not go hand in hand with the high therapeutic value added in many cases. In the case, in particular, of cancer medicines, which have seen their price multiply by more than ten, they have shown only 15% of them to show an increase in survival at age 5. Member States have been carrying out this quality assessment as part of the pricing and reimbursement process. Since 2003, the European Commission through EUnetHTA has funded collaboration between them to approximate criteria, methodology, improve and increase clinical evidence and establish the clinical value of health technology. In addition, advances in genetics, the latest medicines for ever smaller populations, advanced therapies or technology itself increasingly require more stringent clinical evidence, and sufficient in any case to be able to make decisions about it. However, despite the positive consideration by the Member States of this voluntary collaboration, they have not made use of it. The European Parliament also considers it necessary to deepen this collaboration and move on to a stability scenario, with a regulated and publicly funded procedure that improves access to health technology by European citizens, contributes to the sustainability of health systems and increases the quality of research, also aligning this research with patients' needs. The European Commission presented us with an HTA proposal, justifying it in the need to improve the functioning of the internal market and thereby the predictability of industry. While it is true that distortion may exist in the internal market, this cannot be the main objective of the proposal, since this distortion may in large part correspond to the conception of the medicine itself as one more consumer good and which is governed by market laws. However, this Regulation also does not have to oppose – and may be able to contribute – this improvement in the competitiveness of industry, stimulating quality innovation and improving research efficiency. Parliament's position has come to give an answer, in my view, to all these challenges which I have posed and, above all, seeking the necessary confidence in the process, ensuring independence, transparency, objectivity, scientific quality and external validation of the whole procedure. All this allowing for clear prominence and control by Member States through their national process evaluation agencies. And ultimately, ensuring that, although the clinical evaluation may be global, the decision is finally local. Member States may carry out their own re-evaluations to adapt them to their national contexts, within the national competences of the pricing and reimbursement system, which includes specific clinical criteria in addition to social, ethical and economic, away from doubts about possible negative effects on the sustainability of national health systems, as we have been shown. At the same time, it opens up new areas of collaboration in emerging health sectors such as precision medicine or the disinversion of outdated technology. In short,, as I said, a balanced, timely and guarantee proposal with patients and also with national health systems. So, in my own way of see, necessary. A constructive and dialogue position on the part of the Member States is now needed, to which this Parliament has always been open. The opposite may mean blocking the necessary discussion to improve access to health technology by patients in the European Union. A stubborn stance is not good, against and without dialogue or alternatives on the part of certain countries, which can only lead us to repeat previous experiences with other health dossiers that only end with the result that the only ones who end up losing are patients. This Parliament has worked hard and quickly to be able to close this dossier in this parliamentary term and send a very important message to European citizens, who have been asking us for improvements in access to medicines, health technology; which has health among its priorities, as the Eurobarometer repeatedly demonstrates, and which will assess us in the coming months at the ballot box. I therefore appeal to a constructive position on the part of the Member States in order to be able to close this dossier and give that answer requested by the European city.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 190, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the Commission proposal for a regulation on health technology assessment. Parliament has shown very active and constructive engagement on this file, which led to the adoption of the ENVI Committee report in Plenary on 3 October last. Once again, I would like to congratulate Ms Cabezón Ruiz for her excellent and timely work as rapporteur for this file. I also want to reiterate my thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Grossetete, Ms Meissner, Ms Konečná and others as well as the ENVI Committee, the Committee on Industry Research and Energy and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Regrettably, negotiations between the institutions have not yet commenced, but the adoption of Parliament’s formal first reading position would send a clear signal on the importance of continuing to work on this file as we move towards the end of this mandate and onwards into the next one. The Commission appreciates Parliament’s overall support for its proposal, including a clear and ambitious product scope on medicinal products and medical devices. While time does not allow me to comment in detail on all the various amendments, I want to echo some of the points made by the Commission in October. First, on the issue of the national use of European joint clinical assessments, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s strong support in ensuring that joint clinical assessments will be used by Member States and will not be repeated. The approach suggested by Parliament to add some qualification as to the meaning of non-duplication of European clinical assessments at national level has been helpful in the ongoing discussions in the Council. While the issue is still open, it needs further discussion. It takes a step towards addressing the concerns expressed by some Member States. Parliament has also added that the legislation should not prevent Member States from conducting complementary clinical assessments outside the scope of the joint clinical assessment. I am ready to support such an approach. Other amendments were aimed at further qualifying the proposal. They stress that Member States continue to be responsible for drawing their own conclusions on the added therapeutic value of health technologies in the context of their healthcare and cure systems. The second general area I would like to comment on concerns the respective roles of the Commission and the Member States in the cooperation process. In this area the amendments follow the spirit of the text as they aim to clarify the Members States’ responsibility for conducting the joint work and the supporting role of the Commission. The third important area relates to the quality and transparency of joint work produced through EU cooperation. The proposed amendment should ensure the submission of appropriate evidence by technology developers and provide for a high scientific quality, independence and transparency in the joint work. There were important objectives of the Commission’s proposal and I’m convinced that the real added value of strengthened cooperation on HTA at EU level lies in the quality of joint clinical assessments. Together we are all much stronger. Lastly, let me stress that the Commission has concerns when it comes to the removal of the harmonisation of national rules related to clinical assessment. This was one important element of our proposal, notably to improve the functioning of the internal market while contributing to a high level of human health protection. In proposing such harmonisation of national HTA methodologies, we had actually responded to the previous calls for action from Parliament. Among those calls I remember that your resolution on access to medicines called for the harmonisation of HTA tools and methodologies, and it’s clear. I would like to conclude by stressing that the Commission welcomes Parliament’s constructive proposals and stands ready to continue to discuss and explore solutions to outstanding issues with the co-legislators. The Commission is currently fully engaged in the discussions in the Council as these continue to progress and we welcome the Romanian Presidency’s commitment to move the discussion forward. The HTA proposal is expected to lead to a saving and benefits for all key actors. It will support Member States in their investment decisions to prioritising truly innovative technologies. National authorities will be able to pool their expertise and avoid duplication of efforts, making better use of human and financial resources. Industry will benefit from clearer rules and greater predictability for their business planning, as well as cost savings. The healthcare sector accounts for approximately 10% of European Union GDP or 1 300 billion per year. But, above all, this proposal is about European citizens, about European patients. Patients are at the heart of this proposal, which aims to deliver more efficient, transparent and effective European Union HTA. The new model of EU cooperation has a clear potential to facilitate better access to innovative health technologies. Yesterday we discussed issues about women and cancer, about possibilities to guarantee access to new treatments and HTA is a tool which can help us address these issues. I therefore call on you to help make this initiative a success. I look forward to hearing your views.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 191, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Lieve Wierinck", "mepid": "183022", "text": "  rapporteur for ITRE's opinion. Mr President, with this new legislation, we are taking a step in the right direction, for three reasons. Firstly, thanks to this European cooperation, patients with a rare cancer or a rare disease are more likely to have the availability of a medicinal product that works. Provided the necessary privacy protection, Member States will have access to large-scale research data. Secondly, the clinical evaluation of new health technology ensures that Member States are kept informed of market developments and whether these products work better than those already present on the market. By putting innovative developments in the spotlight, we are stimulating our health sector at European level. Thirdly, I am satisfied that flexibility remains, both for the Member State and for the coordination group that is compiling the evaluation. Member States shall decide whether to provide a reimbursement system for this new technology. The coordination group retains an overview of which new technologies are groundbreaking.

As the rapporteur in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I took particular interest in two main objectives of the proposal: to increase the level of human health protection and to ensure better functioning of the internal market. We amended the proposal so that health technology developers would have the possibility to request an update of the clinical  assessment where additional evidence from clinical practices became available, and we also asked for a flexible mechanism to introduce innovative technologies and treatments for patients.

Mr President, the treaties remind us that Europe's mission in health is to give everyone equal access to quality care. So how do we understand that the clinical added value of a drug allowed throughout Europe differs from country to country? How can patients be explained that the same treatment is considered innovative, useful and effective across the border, when it is considered to have less added value in their country? How do you tell a patient that they still have to wait to get this new drug that is already available in the neighbouring country? Let's make no mistake about it. It is not a question of talking about prices and reimbursement, but of jointly conducting a scientific assessment of the therapeutic added value of a new technology, compared to existing alternatives, in order to promote higher value-added treatments, to enable Member States' budgetary decisions and to speed up patients' access to medical innovations and then also to avoid duplication of work; this would cause all its added value to our common procedure to be lost. I regret that the reluctance of the Member States has not allowed us to move faster on this essential text.

The benefits of close cooperation between national and regional HTA bodies will ultimately benefit everyone: patients, pharmacists, doctors and health systems. The new platform will save Member States and their authorities time and money by avoiding unnecessary repetition of assessments already made by other countries. This is especially true for countries that have small HTA capacities.  Unfortunately, these arguments were not sufficient for the Member States in the Council.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. It is indeed the case that we have had very good cooperation on this legislation in Parliament, and I would like to express my sincere thanks. That was constructive, and it was really very important.  Because what have we achieved now is this: what have we achieved? That access to medicines for patients should be faster, because we want to have a decentry authorisation. It makes no sense at all that instead of just once, we should go through this up to 28 times – as it is at the moment. This is really not something we need. And, in principle, this simplification benefits both patients and public authorities, scientists – in fact, all, including manufacturers. Nevertheless, the scepticism of the Member States was very strong. In other words, large Member States such as mine – Germany – and Spain have protested and said: this is not something that is at EU level. I think they are completely wrong. It is important that everyone, including the small countries, which may not have so much research, can benefit from the fact that people throughout the EU can benefit from centraladmission. That is why I think it is perfectly good that we have this law now. It was important to me from the outset to see, on the one hand, where the Member States themselves might also need competences, and, on the other hand, to see what is happening with medical devices. I was rapporteur, as was Mrs Borzan, on the medical device regulation. And just a year ago, we adopted something that would give medical devices more safety standards, better requirements for performance, etc., regardless of their class. We also have the clinical added value in it. And I didn't see that we should make the same demands with THE HTA now that we are implementing it. I would therefore have preferred to have said that we are making a strong law on medicines here, and that medical devices will be considered later. That was not quite a compromise line. However, I think we have found a very good compromise in which we have very much narrowed the application to medical devices. I would like to mention something else that has not yet been mentioned, which was not included in the Commission's proposal: these were methods that can be outlined for the implementation of HTA. They are now in it. Some of these are already good practices, and I think that is good for the Member States and their experts who are supposed to work on them. Finally, it is also important that we have now taken account of national assessment systems, some of which are different. For example, there are different definitions of survival and quality of life in the basis of reimbursement. This is not equally weighted everywhere, and that is why we must also be able to carry out national criteria without duplication, of course.

We have also provided for an extremely long transitional period, during which Member States will not have to participate in the system at all. Our solution to joint medical device assessments essentially means a veiled removal of medical devices from the system. Apparently, too, this too will come to the Member States too little. I am beginning to wonder whether it makes sense to discuss this proposal further, because if it were further weakened by the Member States, it would probably be better to stay with the current voluntary cooperation in the end.  Meanwhile, European patients are desperately waiting for this new treatment and are also indignated by our postponed mandatory assessment by many years. Patient organisations quite rightly expect to be more involved in the evaluation process. The exceptions we have also adopted for faster access for patients to orphan drugs must be put into practice as quickly as possible, because the successful fight against rare diseases is a fundamentally cross-border matter.

The Treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces in Europe (INF), signed by Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987, is among the key international agreements which marked the end of the Cold War. While neither the European Union nor any of the EU Member States are parties to the INF, we do have a very high stake in the preservation and the implementation of this treaty. Due to the INF, some 3 000 missiles with nuclear and conventional warheads have been removed and have been destroyed. This happened under mutual supervision in the form of on-site inspections. The INF Treaty is also an important contribution to the disarmament obligation under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The EU and its Member States are united in their support for the NPT, which remains the cornerstone of the global nuclear non—proliferation regime, the essential foundation for nuclear disarmament and an important element in the future development of nuclear energy applications for peaceful purposes. The NPT has made a crucial contribution to international peace, security and stability over the last 30 years. Let me recall that all NPT states parties are committed to pursuing policies that are fully in line with the treaty and the objective of achieving a world without nuclear weapons. We, as the Union, stress the need for concrete progress towards the full implementation of Article 6 of the NPT, especially through an overall reduction in the global stockpile of nuclear weapons, taking into account the special responsibility of the states that possess the largest number of warheads, namely the Russian Federation and the United States. But the INF Treaty is not only about prohibition of intermediate-range nuclear-armed missiles, it is about an entire category of ballistic and cruise missiles, regardless of their warheads. In the view of the High Representative, the United States and the Russian Federation need to remain engaged in constructive dialogue to preserve the INF Treaty and ensure its full and verifiable implementation, which is crucial for Europe’s, and global, security. Obviously an arms control treaty which is not respected by all of its parties is not sustainable. The EU, our Member States and the United States have raised many times in Moscow our serious concerns regarding Russia’s compliance with the INF. These concerns have not been addressed so far, and the treaty now seems to be on its way to unravelling. The INF is not outdated and we, as Europeans, very much hope that the INF Treaty will still be saved. We do not want to return to a Cold War. We do not want another arms race in Europe or anywhere else in the world. We call on all parties to urgently engage in a dialogue on strategic stability with arms control at its core. Arms control is crucial to our collective security. The world does not need a new arms race that would benefit no one and, on the contrary, would being even more instability.

It is all the more regrettable that, unfortunately, we have had to find out that the Russian Federation has been violating this Treaty for a number of years – as the Obama administration has already noted.  In the long term, of course, a treaty that seems to be binding on only one side is not tenable. Nevertheless, it is not tolerable for us that both sides ultimately took the opportunity to withdraw from this Treaty. We therefore call for Russia and the United States to sit down again, and if we Europeans can be helpful in this, then we should do so. This is what we expect from our executive side. In this context, we should always bear in mind that the loss of this Treaty is also a bad omen for other categories of weapons, namely strategic weapons.

If I may, just a tiny bit of history. In 1977 the then Soviet Union began deployment of the SS20 mobile nuclear armed intermediate-range ballistic missile with the range to target all of western Europe. This had a political as well as a military objective. The political objective was to create dismay among Western European governments, to stimulate the so-called peace movement and to create division between the Europeans and the United States, whose territory was not directly affected at that time. NATO responded with an effective dual-track approach, and the tough stand taken by the West, led by President Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, and the desire by Gorbachev at the time to move forward, enabled the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) to be signed in 1987. It was a great achievement. Now, new forces are at work in Russia and once again, it would seem that opportunities are being seized to create dismay and divergence between Western allies. Over the past five years, we’ve observed development of a cruise-missile system, the 9M729 by Russia, which is in breach of the INF Treaty.

These developments indicate clearly that it is imperative to enhance cooperation between the Western countries, between NATO and the European Union – to demonstrate the unity of the Western world in response to Russia and others on this issue. While the end of the treaty should be avoided by means of negotiations, it also demonstrates that the more global approach is needed on this issue, since time has moved on and there are more players in the game, like China and others.

Today's press conference by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made it quite clear what lies behind this facade: the Allies do not want to react one-to-one, but they say: we will deploy an additional 30 battleships, 30 land battalions, 30 air force quadrilles within the next 30 days or just below. And as a result, an additional USD 41 billion will be invested in defence spending. In other words, the European continent is once again in danger of being the pawn of the arms race. We should not allow the games of nuclear weapons between the United States and the Russian Federation to be played on the backs of the People of Europe.

A period when the Cold War ended and we began to socialize with each other, when the borders were opened and trade between our countries increased. But now it looks different. The climate threat is the greatest threat to us humans on earth and not long after that comes the nuclear threat. Both can be avoided if the political will exists. If countries can agree on both the budget and the rules, we can cope with both climate change and peace. But instead of disarmament, we are seeing a rearmament around the world. More and more countries have acquired nuclear weapons. Development of unmanned weapons systems has been going on for a long time, now also a race over who first acquires lethal autonomous weapons. The fact that the US-Russia INF agreement is now crashing is extremely worrying. Nevertheless, the agreement scrapped over 3 000 missiles, and it has played a major role in reducing tensions in our part of the world. I also call on the parties to return to the agreement. We are now faced with a choice between taking part in the arms race or actually trying to maintain that war does not solve the world's problems and that we must do everything in our power to avoid them arising.

The end of the FNI treaty is the obsolescence of a treaty that has allowed, under pressure from environmental and pacifist activists, to massively reduce the number of nuclear missiles stationed in Europe. The end of the NIF Treaty threatens the entire architecture of non-proliferation treaties, including the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty), signed in 1968, which is the only universal treaty we have today. If European countries refuse to take in American weapons on their territory for longer, they will block President Trump's ambitions. We also need to review the concept of intermediate weapons, between 500 and 5,000 km, which is no longer adapted to the realities of the 21st century, with nearly a dozen nuclear powers and new vectors. So the European Union must quickly propose a mediation process between the United States and Russia. We must also propose a nuclear-free zone in Europe, the so-called ZEAN (nuclear-weapon-free zones), as there are six recognized in the world.

In my view, the real reason why the United States withdrew from the INF Treaty is as follows: Russia has developed missile systems in Syria and on its border with Ukraine that prohibit the infiltration of AMERICAN aircraft and ships into the areas protected by those systems. In order for the United States to react, it must attack these systems from a long distance. So they have to install long-range missiles on land, similar to the Tomahawk missiles launched from submarines and ships that have a range of 1,300 to 2,500 kilometers.

I will not respond to the last point that was raised. I am here representing the High Representative, so I think it makes no sense if you take into account whom I represent here. I would also like to refer to the fact that I think nobody here spoke as much as they should have about the allegation that the Russian Federation has begun producing and deploying new missiles, which could be aimed at Member States and which are not in compliance with Russia’s Treaty obligation. This deserved to be treated more seriously and needs to be resolved. This should happen through a responsible dialogue, including at the highest levels. The stakes are simply too high. Now we come to the allegations concerning the NATO capabilities in Romania or Poland. We made it very public and it was very transparent –which is not the case for any of the Russian missiles – that we know what we have in these places and we made it very clear that this is not a violation or a prohibition of the possession of missiles, if there really is a defensive factor. And I think it is not fair to say that the European Union is not doing enough to save the INF Treaty. The EU has a long record of speaking in support of INF Treaty preservation and implementation – both bilaterally in our contacts with the State parties and very publicly in multiple international fora like the United Nations General Assembly, the Conference of Disarmament in Geneva, the Review Conferences of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and on multiple other occasions. The most recent example was the agreed EU statement delivered on 18 October 2018 at the First Committee (Disarmament Intelligence and Security) of the UN General Assembly in New York, which included the following passage: ‘We call on the Russian Federation to address serious concerns regarding its compliance with the INF Treaty in a substantial and transparent way. We ask the United States and the Russian Federation to remain engaged in active dialogue to preserve the INF Treaty and ensure its full and verifiable implementation, which is crucial for Europe and other regions’ security.’ So this is what I wanted to say and I think I will thank you on behalf of the High Representative for being part of the discussion today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 251, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Πρόεδρος. –", "mepid": "28586", "text": "  I have received, in accordance with Rule 123(2) of the Rules of Procedure, six motions for resolutions.

When three member countries proposed the creation of a European investment filtering mechanism, the reception was frosty. When the EPP proposed a DOCUMENT from the Eu to the European Parliament on this mechanism, the reception was reserved. When President Juncker presented the proposed regulation here in September 2017, there was a majority of skepticism.  I would also like to congratulate here on the effectiveness of the services of the European Commission, which reacted very quickly with a regulation, from the very beginning skilful, particularly on the question of competences. I believe that we can all be congratulated for having taken into account both the context, the need and above all the interests of each one, thanks to the excellent joint work of the three institutions: an Austrian Presidency of the Council aware of political issues, a Commission listening to the proposals and a pragmatic European Parliament. I would also like to thank my colleagues and co-staff, with whom the work of reflection has been a strength. It was this trio that did it. So, as you said, Commissioner, this mechanism is a first. The first European mechanism will be a major complement to national filtering mechanisms. And to use the famous title of another Proust's novel, we were \"in search of lost time\". Our main partners already have a mechanism: the United States, together with CFIUS, has had expertise since 1975. This mechanism is therefore a symbol of Europeans' awareness that the world around us is not filled only with investors with benevolent objectives. You will agree that this vision was very naïve. From now on, Member States will no longer be able to turn a blind eye to foreign and strange investments in Europe and say 'we did not know'. We did not know that a whole European value chain was acquired by a single state or foreign company, we did not know that a dual-use technology, civil and military, was acquired by a foreign army, we did not know that the ultimate investor, who was hiding behind a conventional investor, was aiming to sabotage a European programme. Not knowing is a mistake, at a time when evidence of these fears is sometimes enshrined in the political planning of the economies of certain foreign powers. Of course, we remain open to foreign investment because we need it. Europe is a land of innovation and will remain competitive, also thanks to the free movement of capital. But freedom does not mean anarchy. Freedom does not mean impunity. Filtering does not mean banning. Filtering means retaining the best and the shackles of this filter, in this regulation, are up to the current stakes, and this thanks, too, to the European Parliament, which has played its part in strengthening the Commission's proposal, making this mechanism something other than a timid try. We have strengthened the collection and exchange of information, we have strengthened the anti-circumvention of national mechanisms, we have strengthened intra-European and also international cooperation. Above all, we have marked a step in replacing the law of silence with the law of dialogue. Finally, you know that I cannot fail to talk about the third scenario, this worst-case scenario for which I have fought, to the end, and which already allows us to anticipate the concerns of at least one third of the Member States about foreign investment. The Commission, at the heart of this scheme, will then have to give an opinion. This instrument is an opportunity that Member States must seize for public order and the safety of Europeans, because we are in the single market, but not just in a market. Europe, with this instrument, will be better able to protect itself from the butterfly effect of an investment, not to mention the investment race between the United States and China, which should not make Europe a supermarket. It must remain a showcase. So yes, we're coming back from afar.

By concluding this file we send a very strong message to our partners. We are open in the European Union to foreign investment. That is, and has been and will be fundamental to growth, jobs etc. But a condition for being open is to be able to trust that foreign investors will not threaten our security and our strategic interests. Increasingly, in an interconnected and interdependent world, we share opportunities but also threats, and this becomes even more important in the internal market where a foreign investment in one Member State might have an impact in another, or the whole Union. In September when we launched the proposal, this was, as was said by the two rapporteurs, a new policy area. Several Member States and some of our international partners, actually, most of them, were already experienced in this type of legislation, screening foreign direct investment. But the majority of our Member States did not have their own legislation or mechanism in place. This proposal has triggered a constructive debate at European and national level, and what we see is that several Member States are now in the course of reforming or even introducing their own screening mechanisms. This regulation will help set a common framework, increase cooperation and information sharing and building on efficient practices. Thanks to the new regulation, Member States and the Commission will have a much better overview of foreign investment in the EU. Moreover, for the first time, they would have the possibility to collectively assess potential risks to their security and public order. I welcome Parliament’s and the Member States’ understanding of the need for a key role for the Commission here as well in this mechanism, when security and public order in several Member States could be at risk or with projects of the Union’s interest, like Galileo or Horizon 2020, fundamental for our future. In its initial position and in the course of the negotiations, Parliament has made it clear that it was supporting this proposal and it has sought further improvement, and they have largely passed into the final compromise. The cooperation mechanism has been reinforced in many aspects. For instance, with the possibility for a Member State to proactively seek opinions or comments, the strengthened provisions on anti-circumvention or an increased scrutiny by the Commission when a third of Member States issue concerns on a specific foreign investment. Furthermore, you have proposed reporting with the yearly public report on the implementation of the regulation. International cooperation with like-minded third countries is also encouraged, and I would like to thank you for these improvements. Tomorrow’s vote will be an important milestone. As we will be shifting towards implementation, we will use the transition phase to ensure that Member States and the Commission can swiftly put in place the necessary arrangements for this new mechanism. I think we can all salute this moment and hope for a very strong vote tomorrow because we know that this is of concern to our Member States, to our companies, to our citizens, and we will have delivered by then.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 256, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Geoffrey Van Orden", "mepid": "4513", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her remarks. The interest in this foreign direct investment (FDI) screenings framework arose, of course, from concerns about external investors buying technologies in our European countries which could be used for their own strategic objectives, while they themselves maintain barriers for investments from European countries. We’re pleased that the draft regulation agreed in trilogue recognises that it is the sole responsibility of Member States to safeguard their national security. It’s important, therefore, that individual Member States retain responsibility for setting up screening mechanisms for FDI on grounds of security and to cover critical infrastructure and sensitive technologies. These now specifically include, among other categories, aerospace and defence facilities and nano and bio technologies. There is also a need to consider whether a foreign investor is directly or indirectly controlled by government or its state bodies or armed forces, including through the ownership structure. So this is a difficult and complex area and I might just – somewhat mischievously and separately – remark that while today we’re considering only FDI into the Union, some of the considerations should also perhaps apply to activities within the Union, particularly investment in assets in one Member State by state-controlled assets in another.

But before we discuss investment review, I think we need to start at the right end, by establishing some important truths. The first is that investment, including foreign ones, is good. They create jobs and growth, and we need more of that in Europe – jobs, growth and investment. This was clearly visible not least after the euro and financial crisis. The second, the major problem we have in Europe today, is unfortunately still investment protectionism, that countries want to protect their crown jewels from international or foreign ownership. Sometimes French who want to protect themselves from Italian, sometimes Italian from French, sometimes Dutch people who do not want to sell Akzo Nobel to Americans. But it is not just investment protectionism that is the problem, and it is not just too few investments that are the problem. After all, we have too many trading partners making investments other than commercial interests. Not all of our trading partners have good intentions, and then we must have the tools to meet them. Sometimes it's about security policy. Sometimes it is a question of stealing technology or sabotaging technological development in Europe. Then we have to have a full toolbox to meet it. This initiative should be followed up by wider initiatives, for example in the borderland between trade and security policy to protect our cybersecurity. What we see today with Huawei and ZTE worries me – that I cannot call home from Brussels to Sweden without doing it over Chinese switches. This should be a lesson for Sweden too, because Sweden belongs to one of the few countries in Europe that does not have this kind of investment write.

However, Europe should not put a stop to foreign investment, because many of these investments also contribute positively to employment, to innovation and thus to our economic growth.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The ECR would also like to thank Mr Proust, not only for the constructive atmosphere, but also for the pleasant atmosphere you have created. Protection against foreign takeovers and investments on grounds of security and public order is legitimate. It also makes sense to exchange information between EU countries. However, the use of this instrument must remain strictly limited, as Mr Fjellner pointed out; it must not deter the vast majority of legitimate interests. Investment and legal certainty must not be called into question. The ECR attaches great importance to the fact that this instrument is not introduced or applied for protectionist reasons, because the EU benefits from investments from outside the EU like no other location. This danger was present in the original report. The politicization of screening under the influence of third parties would have brought aspects beyond security and public order to the fore. This would have encouraged protectionism. That is why the ECR was the only group to initially vote against Parliament's report. In the trilogue agreement, crucial aspects have been changed for us – for the better. Parliament's influence on the individual decision has not been realised. The final decision in each investment case rests with the Member States, in other words the principle of subsidiarity.

For instance, if we had this regulation in place today, we could have come up with a more coordinated approach to some of the Chinese companies, Huawei for instance. Personally, I value in this legislation the exchange of information between respective stakeholders in the Member States. Some of the potentially problematic investments could come to several countries, and it would be beneficial to share information on them. It remains on a voluntary basis to set up a screening mechanism at a national level, but there is no doubt that there are good reasons to control investments coming to very sensitive areas such as critical infrastructure, defence and the security industry, but also the media or – very topical now – telecommunications and new digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence. The EU needs to remain open to foreign investment. It has always been a source of our economic growth. Through the process of negotiating this regulation, I emphasise that this is by no means a protectionist tool, but a guarantee for the EU to face those investments where economic goals are not a primary consideration, a sort of warning in the same way that we need trade, defence or anti-dumping legislation.

That in the presence of neoliberal extremism, which very often strongly obliges or induces privatisation – and certainly austerity policies have acted in this direction – with a policy that favours competition, even prohibiting the possibility of State aid, if not publicising and nationalising strategic sectors, investment screening can be reduced to an instrument for defining hierarchies between Member States of the European Union.

Just this afternoon, most Members applauded one of the new free trade treaties that organise the unfair competition of our companies with those from all over the world. For 40 years, the Commission, the majority of Members and our governments have been complicit in the policies that have led to our deindustrialization. They have also allowed many strategic companies to be acquired by foreign interests.

And, it should be remembered, foreign investment is important to the European economy and is even more important for European countries that lack the equity to invest. I therefore welcome the two fundamental rules that have been enshrined: the fact that the new procedure for exchanging information and analysing investments is exceptional and reserved for security and public order, and the fact that the final decision on investments belongs to the sovereign states.

Because in trying to intervene there, we have taken on board some protectionist elements. I believe that in some places we are overshooting the mark.

Worse still, its representative, Mrs Jamet, had even voted against the text in the INTA committee.

The current legal framework of the European Union, as you know, concerning the electronic collection of tolls, has not guaranteed the achievement of these objectives, in particular because service providers face enormous difficulties in accessing the market and have to meet requirements that are normally considered excessive and unworkable. It is difficult to enforce the payment of tolls on owners of vehicles registered in different States of the Union, as there is no legal basis for the exchange of information in this area.  The proposed amendment that we have tabled and which refers to the proposal presented by the Commission immediately achieved a considerable consensus, both because the Commission's proposal is considered by us rapporteurs, here in Parliament, to be a good proposal, and because we have found a very shared position on this in the negotiations in Parliament. The result obtained is a very full text, I have to say, compared with the initial proposal, in which we find most of the provisions of interest to all the delegations concerned.  As far as the scope is concerned, the agreement reached provides that only for the exchange of information to solve the problem of non-payments should the tolls of the so-called UARs, ZTLs, low-urban emission zones, and tolls collected manually be included. This is an attempt to prosecute more infringements. However, this inclusion does not concern the part that most closely refers to the interoperability system. We have applied simplification here.  Another major subject which is very complex and which has required considerable discussion concerns the list of technologies. With regard to this list – let us remember, we have satellite systems, mobile communication systems, we have 5.5 gigahertz technology – we can say that since the beginning of the negotiations there has been a clear alignment between the Council and Parliament to bring this list back into the body of the directive. This has made it possible to establish a stable framework, a framework which, with regard to the debate on the list of technologies, is constantly subject to codecision. A clarification on this issue: we have discussed the technology of reading ANPR number plates and this technology will try to introduce it when it is more mature, in order to guarantee the collection of tolls. As I said, Article 4 on interoperability contains all the elements concerning the requirements for service providers, the obligations of the service providers themselves, the obligations for tax collectors, the issue of payments, conciliation procedures, a number of issues that were previously in the decision have now been included in the directive. Articles 5 and 6 provide for all procedures related to the legal framework on the exchange of information and Article 8 seeks to ensure adequate data protection. Here too, by acquiring the elements resulting from the opinion of the LIBE Committee, we have tried to provide the necessary guarantees.  Well, it is useful to remember that we have done a lot of work and electronic electronic easing is the first text of the mobility package that comes to an end.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Salini, and the other members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for their constructive approach throughout the negotiations, enabling such an agreement to be reached so smoothly and swiftly. Tolling is a precious instrument for making the ‘users and polluters pay’ principle a reality for road infrastructure. But it has to be used in a way which is efficient, which does not create barriers to the flow of traffic and which protects the data that is being collected. The text you will be asked to vote on tomorrow addresses the fundamental problems in the field of electronic tolling. Let me recall just its two main objectives. First, regarding the rights and obligations of market actors, it will clarify the grey zones which, so far, have been hampering the commercial deployment of the European electronic toll service (ETS) in certain Member States. More balanced and realistic requirements will lead to more competition on the ETS market and more efficient operations. This will mean savings for road users, savings for toll chargers and additional revenues for Member States. Life will also be made easier for road users, in particular transport companies. They should ultimately be able to pay tolls, wherever they go in Europe, with a single on-board unit. They should have to sign only one toll-service contract and should receive a single invoice at the end of the month. Second, the agreed text will introduce a mechanism to facilitate the cross-border enforcement of toll payment. Today, Member States have no effective instruments in place to identify the owners of a foreign-registered vehicle for the purpose of toll collection. It is already possible for national authorities to go after those who commit a road-safety-related traffic offence but those who evade toll payments can escape fines. We have calculated that this leads to a revenue leakage of around EUR 300 million per year. Clearly, toll evasion is one of the main obstacles to a wider deployment of barrier-free tolls in the Union. In addition, the agreed text extends the scope of application of the directive to tolling systems using automated number-plate recognition as the main technology. This is important to keep pace with the technological development on the ground, as stressed by the rapporteur. Lastly, the co-legislators have extended the scope of application of cross-border enforcement. It will apply to all types of road fees, both electronic and manual. The Commission can only support this extension. This initiative will help in the transition from traditional vignette schemes, and tolls with barriers, to modern and smart, free-flow tolling systems, the kind of systems we need in order to shape more sustainable mobility in the future.

At the same time, we are currently seeing a proliferation of toll systems in the Member States of the European Union.

With the EETS directive, we are taking an important step towards better aligning the different electronic tolling systems. For EETS providers, the market to offer services becomes more interesting. This allows us to drive through all European countries with less red tape, with one EETS provider, one interpreter box and one invoice. Countries are not obliged to levy tolls. But if they do it eventually, payment and enforcement across borders will become easier. It is also important that automatic number plate recognition is included in the new regulations as a possible technology in tolling. This technique is reliable and is already widely used in Europe.

And those who earn the most – and for the work they have done, I would really like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs, but also all the members who have spoken, and in particular the Commissioner for the debate that has taken place – from a harmonious system of movement, it is first and foremost the weakest groups, that is to say, all those who find it most difficult to bear the cost of non-Europe.

We have already done the technical part, we have dealt with it properly in the negotiation phase. To talk about Europe, as Mrs De Monte said, is to talk about things like this, that is to say, to talk about instruments which, by answering real questions and needs, make something useful and inexpensive and immediately verifiable available to the most fragile citizens. Not to mention the usefulness that companies will have from a system such as this, because the movement of goods and people has as its first recipient the weakest groups and as the second privileged recipient the most enterprising groups of civil society, that is, those who create value on a daily basis, those who need a hospitable environment so that their energies can be released.

The European market accounts for up to a sixth of all world trade in goods, generating around 25% of the European Union's GDP and 75% of intra-Union trade. It is therefore necessary to continue to promote the free movement of goods and services between Member States, as well as to create favourable conditions for trade with third countries, since the single market and the free movement of products are one of the attributes for the successful functioning of the Union. However, there are not always common rules between member states and the principle of mutual recognition does not always apply.  Which means, in practice, that in the absence of specific Union legislation, Member States are free to set national rules determining the requirements that products must meet. Such national requirements may coexist in different Member States, but if they differ from one another, they may create barriers to trade within the Union. According to the principle of mutual recognition, goods marketed in accordance with the law in another State are not required to be prohibited in another State unless the other State has reasonable grounds to prohibit or restrict their sale. Mutual recognition covers products which are not or are only partially subject to harmonised Union legislation, such as a wide range of consumer products such as textiles, footwear, childcare articles, jewellery, tableware or furniture.  These goods represent around 20 % of the market. However, since mutual recognition has not always been found to work, the new Regulation on the mutual recognition of goods aims to improve the functioning of this principle and to ensure compliance with existing rights and obligations arising from the principle of mutual recognition. The adoption of this Regulation is also a response to the lack of application of the principle of mutual recognition in the field of goods due to a lack of awareness of this principle, legal uncertainty in its application and a lack of administrative cooperation between national authorities. In practice, this means that Member States continue to have the possibility to protect their legitimate national public objectives and to restrict the marketing of products, even if the market elsewhere is compliant, unless the decision is justified and proportionate. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to work as rapporteur on this important proposal to improve the functioning of the single market. I am also very pleased that, together with my fellow citizens, the Council and the Commission, we have managed to find common ground in the trilogues on the text of the regulation, thus improving the functioning of this principle. I consider as key points, firstly, greater use of the principle of mutual recognition of goods, secondly, an increase in legal certainty for small and medium-sized enterprises, which will lead to simplified procedures vis-à-vis national authorities, through an established declaration of mutual recognition; Together, solutions will be sought to contentious issues relating to the mutual recognition of goods as well as cross-border cooperation. Last but not least, it is an improvement in solving problems using the already functioning SOLVIT system. This mechanism provides new effective remedies for restoring trust in the mutual recognition of goods.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 309, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, it is a pleasure to be here ahead of the final vote on the proposal for mutual recognition of goods. As you know, this is a very important proposal for the Commission. Let me first recall why we felt it was necessary to act. Mutual recognition is essential for the proper functioning of the single market for goods. it is about cutting red tape and making things simpler. Where no specific EU legislation is in place, Member States are free to set national rules that lay down requirements to be met by products. Such national requirements can coexist in various Member States. A product that can sell in one Member State, you should also be allowed to sell in any other Member State. That is a mutual recognition principle but evidence suggests that neither businesses nor national authorities make sufficient use of it. Many businesses do not even know about mutual recognition and just take national technical rules for granted. Many of those who know about it prefer not to rely on it as they find it rather unpredictable. Those who try to invoke mutual recognition to sell their products on other markets are often faced with denials or restrictions. Their only choice is to go to the national court procedures – very long and costly. As a consequence, businesses prefer to adapt their products to national applicable requirements or give up entering the market and authorities find it difficult to apply. National authorities are often cautious in accepting products marketed in another Member State. The lack of trust in rules that differ from their own makes them apply their own national requirements and deny mutual recognition. This is still one of the biggest remaining barriers to the single market for goods. Today, cardigans, shoes, notebooks, tableware, different goods, lawfully sold in one Member State can still, unjustifiably, be rejected in another Member State. Businesses lose market opportunities and consumers don’t benefit from increased choice and lower prices. With this new regulation we are moving to meet business and consumer expectations, and we are hoping to prevent further missed opportunities. By removing the remaining barriers to the functioning of the single market for goods, intra-EU trade could increase by more than EUR 100 billion per year. So I welcome the cooperation and support in the negotiations and I would like to particularly thank the rapporteur, Mr Štefanec, and shadow rapporteurs for the great work on this file. The negotiations were very constructive. This is why they were also speedy. We reached agreement in just under a year. This shows that we are all aware of why this is important. I welcome the compromise that we have reached. It will transfer mutual recognition in a reliable and efficient tool for businesses wanting to trade in a single market and it will benefit national authorities. The voluntary mutual recognition declaration will make it easier for economic operators to demonstrate that their products are lawfully marketed in another Member State and will make it easier to solve problems, building on solid foundations. It will offer economic operators a business-friendly alternative to long and costly court proceedings. Businesses will be more easily able to fight unjustified market access restrictions by using the problem-solving procedure and defend their right to mutual recognition. The Commission will intervene in this procedure, providing the expertise to assist solid centres in solving the case. We will put in place stronger administrative cooperation to facilitate the application of the mutual recognition principle, especially in sectors where the application is problematic. I welcome the importance Parliament attaches to strong administrative cooperation in this area. National authorities can discuss common problems and their chosen solutions. It is only by creating trust amongst them that we will have a true culture of mutual recognition. In addition, the Commission will implement an action plan on mutual recognition to complement this proposal. We will focus on raising awareness for businesses and authorities alike and emphasise the role of mutual recognition. And we will give special attention to sectors where the use of mutual recognition is economically advantageous but has been problematic or insufficient to date.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 310, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Andreas Schwab", "mepid": "28223", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ivan Etefanec, for his excellent work. It is precisely the fact that there are still a whole range of goods in the European internal market for which there are no harmonisation rules. And in the field of these goods, the old principle of the past applies that a product legally manufactured in one Member State should actually be lawfully marketed in all other Member States. Unfortunately, this is often a principle that is not applied everywhere. In the United Kingdom, for example, there are special rules on the fire safety of furniture which do not apply in any other Member State of the European Union. And with that, of course, protectionism can be pursued to a little extent. This is the the sit-in in many Member States, but also in those who always claim to be not using such measures. That is why it has been a good thing that Mr Etefanec, together with the other Members, has attached great importance to the fact that these obstacles can and must be removed piece by piece. The Member States do not always like this, but the truth is that if the Member States want to avoid harmonisation, they will actually have to apply the principle of mutual recognition in full. And there are procedural rules that the Commissioner has mentioned. SOLVIT is certainly a method that can help. However, all Member States would also have to invest human resources in the same way, so that the institutions can really communicate with each other. It is not enough for one Member State to provide many people, another Member State that has problems but has only one person, then it does not work. So there is still a lot to improve, but the step that is being taken with this regulation now is really great.

In this way, it is possible to clarify and simplify the procedures that companies and national authorities are required to follow, as well as to improve the functioning of these principles with regard to mutual recognition.  As we know, free movement is not complete, the single market in goods needs integration. Mutual recognition fills this gap. The significant improvement in the application of the principle of mutual recognition will make it possible to give a blank cheque to companies. We will make life easier for businesses across Europe, while ensuring that Member State authorities have the opportunity to exclude unsafe products from their markets. In this way, we will be able to facilitate the recognition of safe and legitimately marketed goods and facilitate their placing on the market in any other Member State.  Superiority of the general public interest is also guaranteed. Member States may object to the marketing of certain goods where a legitimate and proportionate public interest is at stake. We have defined ways of improving administrative cooperation between national authorities, which will lead to a reduction in administrative burdens.

Of course, the aim is to facilitate smoother trade – a noble goal, and one which I think we all share and would all like to see. Even those of us who will hopefully be outside the EU soon still hope to see a smooth flow of trade. After all, without trade, business and growth, the people are poorer – and no one wants to see that. However, in the form that this has been discussed tonight, it is yet another attempt to buck the market. Why shouldn’t different nations require different standards? Why shouldn’t they? Why can one nation and its people not say ‘we require a better level’? It seems to me that if you seek to make a mutual set of standards and bring everyone together, there is a danger that you are forcing some nations to accept a lower quality of product. This is not the marketplace. This is not good capitalism. This is not good trade. Why not allow businesses and business bodies to work on international standards, to come together and say ‘this is the kind of standard level that we’re aiming for’, and let them make proposals to put forward for international trade. After all, they are the experts. They’re the people who understand the market. They’re the people who understand production. President Reagan once said ‘government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem’, and I think that unintentionally – certainly unintentionally – this is another example of that. Government should be removed from the process of trade, and the whole thing should be depoliticised. The proposal in front of us will cost billions in new regulations and training. The eurozone is declining in industrial output, by 0.9% month on month. This suggests that there is something being done wrong here. This proposal, as was mentioned by one of our colleagues earlier, could facilitate a serious lowering of standards – the UK fire safety standards were mentioned earlier on. Well, if a certain nation – be it the UK or any other nation – wants a level of standards on safety or anything else, they should be allowed to do it and businesses should be able to say ‘hang on a minute, this is what these guys need. We want to sell into this market, so let’s tailor our marketing and our production to fit that’.  Before I came to this place, I had a 20-year career in steel sales and exotic metals, and we would buy and sell all around the world. It was clear to us that in some places you needed a higher quality, a higher standard, and when you sell to those places you work out how you’re going to do it. Frankly, if they want a higher quality and standard, it’s a business opportunity because you can sell it for a higher price. Quality is a great driver of price. It should be a profit motive. Why not, if people want a higher quality? Allow market freedom. Allow people to look into this. Allow businesses to see where one nation might be able to accept something of a certain level, which is perfectly acceptable but can be done a lot cheaper and more competitively, and then look at the ones who are demanding higher standards, because that’s what the people and the customers there want and say ‘OK, we’ll do that for you, but by God you’re going to pay us for it’. When it comes to trade and business, there are always possibilities. There are always chances to make money and to do trade as long as government and politicians, regardless of their good intentions, step back a little and allow the market to do its job. Where there is demand, supply will find it. And when supply and demand come together, we get what we all want: business, profit and taxation for services, and everyone is better off.

The freedom of movement of goods is not, and never will be, a fundamental freedom; it remains an economic facilitation, the result of trade, customs and international agreements, and that is it. Considering Europeans as consumers and Europe as a market will never solve the european Union's deep lack of credibility and legitimacy. To persist in this way, leads us to a dead end. The total free movement of goods is not an end in itself. It can be an effective development tool, only if it is strictly in line with national interests. Restricting the scope of Member States' action is a mistake and a reversal of economic common sense. The rigidity of this materialistic and ultraliberal vision of Europe brings only economic and social imbalances detrimental to consumer safety and respect for national specificities.

Dear Colleagues, I would like to thank you for your excellent work. The European single market has been in place for 30 years. It is the object of our pride. We say that this is the greatest achievement of European integration. In theory, there is also a principle of mutual recognition, but in practice this principle is not respected. Around a quarter of products traded on the European single market are not covered by harmonisation rules and are regulated by individual Member States in terms of standards, technical standards, packaging, appearance, composition and so on. Unfortunately, this means that the European single market is not so single at all and that, in fact, we are dealing with fragmentation of markets. If we wonder why Europe has not developed great world champions, big corporations, one of the main reasons is that the markets are simply very divided and it is difficult to spread the wings of European companies. We should therefore remove all these barriers, which is why I wanted to thank Mr Štefanec, who prepared this report, because this report goes in the right direction. We should remove barriers to the movement of goods because this will make European companies more internationally competitive.

We can't let it all go without a rule. We are talking here, in this proposal for a regulation, of a principle: mutual recognition. Obviously, if we have well-established, very clear rules at Member State level and we also have harmonised rules, it is much simpler for the economic operator, for the producer, and it is even safer for the consumer. I am surprised by the position of some colleagues who believe that we should leave everything without any supervision. The proposal for a regulation makes it very clear that both national authorities and economic operators must provide for very clear, non-interpretable technical rules, precisely so that there is no problem when it appears by sampling, perhaps, the verification of a product; because yes, there is a possibility in the Regulation for the economic operator to make a declaration, but this does not exclude the possibility for the Member State to verify whether the declaration of liability and coincides, whether the product coincides with the declaration on its own responsibility.  I do not see a barrier in the fact that we want to harmonise and apply this principle. On the contrary, I see an increase in the movement of goods in the internal market, an increase in safety for the consumer and, we must say, an efficiency of economic activity, with this clarification: the Commission must update the list of products covered by this regulation online because it must be known which products fall under this regulation. Then, of course, we need to have clear rules for the recognition of legally traded goods, because we need to understand that the marketing of illegal products also occurs.

We welcome Parliament’s strong commitment to deepening the single market for retail financial services and payments, and to making the most of the euro, the EU’s common currency – for the benefit of citizens and businesses outside as well as inside the euro area. Today, only euro-area citizens enjoy the benefits of cheap euro transactions. Around 150 million Europeans who live in EU countries using other currencies do not. In fact, they sometimes have to pay very high and disproportionate fees for such transactions, particularly in cross-border situations. Let me give you an example. Imagine that you live in Italy and you wish to send EUR 50 to Finland. Because these countries are both in the euro area, EU rules prevent banks from charging more for this transaction than they would for sending money, say, from Rome to Milan. Now, imagine instead that you are living in Bulgaria and you want to transfer the same EUR 50 to Finland. Because domestic payments in euro in Bulgaria are generally expensive, the equivalent cross-border transaction is also very expensive. For a Bulgarian citizen this means he or she could end up paying as much as EUR 24 for this kind of transfer. The revised Cross-border Payments Regulation will remove this unequal treatment by extending the benefits of low-cost euro transactions across the whole EU. The regulation will ensure that, by 15 December this year, all European citizens and businesses will have the right to make cross-border payments in euros for the same price as domestic payments in their national currency. The Cross-border Payments Regulation will positively affect the vast majority – around 80% – of cross-border transactions originating from non-euro Member States and made in euros. Putting an end to high fees linked to cross-border euro payments will enable consumers and businesses in non-euro Member States to save around EUR 900 million every year. This will also contribute to our common objective of strengthening the international role of the euro as a payments currency. The revised Cross-border Payments Regulation will also increase the transparency of currency conversion services. This is especially important for several million Europeans who travel within the EU every year, either for business or for pleasure. Often, when paying by card or withdrawing cash at an ATM in a country that uses a different currency from the euro, it is very difficult to know exactly how much it will cost. It is equally difficult for consumers to choose the most convenient option when they are given the choice, on the spot, between paying in their own currency or in the local currency, for example when paying a hotel bill. By harmonising the disclosure of currency conversion costs, the regulation will allow European consumers to check and compare the currency conversion charges applied by their bank or by merchants. Consumers will be able to compare charges when shopping abroad with their cards, when withdrawing cash at an ATM abroad and when sending money, from their own country’s banking platforms, to a Member State using a different EU currency. This will boost competition between providers in such currency conversion services and should thus lower the cost of transactions between Member States in different currencies. Honourable Members, the European project is quite often perceived as distant from the lives of European citizens. This legislative initiative is a good opportunity to demonstrate how Europe can bring tangible benefits to its citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 325, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Othmar Karas", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, Rapporteur Maydell, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on the work she has said. Following this afternoon's debate on tax justice and fairness, where unanimity in the Council is constantly blocking us in implementing our proposals, the new wire transfer regulation is an example of the European Union's ability to act. It could be said that, just as we have abolished roaming costs for international calls, this regulation is now abolishing roaming charges for money transfers, in and out of Member States that are not yet at home in the euro area. For all euro payments outside the euro area, but within the EU, the same fee must now be charged as for domestic payments. That is a good thing. This strengthens the internal market, creates cheaper transfers, leads to greater transparency, creates more competitiveness for all payment service providers in the European Union and can be implemented by 150 million citizens and six million entrepreneurs in the EU who benefit from it. In doing so, we have shown that we are constantly developing the internal market. Following the abolition of roaming charges for telephone calls, there is now an abolition of roaming charges for money transfers in Europe, but outside the euro area.

In the long term, however, all EU currencies need to be covered by the regulation. There is no reason in EU legislation to discriminate against countries outside the euro area. New transparency rules are being introduced for cross-border transfers, which I think is positive and also positive for consumers. With regard to rules on currency exchange fees for purchases and withdrawals abroad, it will continue to be very difficult for consumers to compare the costs of the various services. It is almost always cheaper to pay in the local currency of the countries in which you are located. However, the new rules will not allow real-time price comparison between costs for the bank's services and dynamic currency conversion services. Consumers need to be better informed about dynamic currency conversion and how expensive it really is. This could be a surcharge of 8-12%. It is a nuisance that deceives consumers of large sums of money every year. Unfortunately, the Council was not willing to meet Parliament on this issue.

It achieved its objective of equating cross-border charges in euro with domestic transfer fees, thereby further favouring the role of the euro as the default currency for cross-border money transfers across the Union. Another win is the European banking system, which, it can be said, has escaped from a kind of guillotine, i.e. avoided having to apply the same transparency criteria for foreign exchange transactions as providers of so-called dynamic currency conversion. However, the consumer who usually uses a bank transaction for card payments abroad and does not receive information about the fees charged in a transparent manner, as it should be, never wins here. Well, that is the stubbornness of the Council, already mentioned by its predecessor. Perhaps this is not the stage yet. However, at least a gradual improvement in the transparency of transaction fees should be appreciated.

The regulation ensures that the costs for cross-border payments in euro from one EU country to another are the same as an equivalent domestic payment, regardless of whether the countries are in the eurozone or not. Furthermore, customers in the EU withdrawing money from an ATM in a foreign currency will have much more clarity on the cost of their payment options. Following pressure from Parliament, the charges associated with credit transfers will also be made clear to consumers. From Parliament’s perspective, full comparability is the ultimate goal. That means that customers should always be informed of the cost of their payments in a foreign currency within the EU. The final text of this regulation takes a significant step towards full comparability but, in my view, more can be done. Therefore, I welcome the review that the Commission will undertake three years after the regulation enters into force. The review should explore how costs to consumers can be reduced further and should ensure full comparability of payment options.

The proposal to limit bank charges on cross-border payments is a gift to our small and medium-sized enterprises. It is the roaming charge of the banks that we are now doing. Companies in non-euro area countries have been worse off than their competitors in the euro area. In Denmark, it typically costs a company between 15 and 50 kroner to complete a transfer in euros to another EU country. For countries in the euro zone, it currently costs the same as a domestic transfer. After all, this is not fair to those companies that are outside the euro zone. And in Denmark, it is actually small and medium-sized enterprises that pay the highest price because they have rarely had the resources to negotiate a lower price. I would like to give one example from the real world: a Danish small or medium-sized company producing designer furniture exports 75% of its products to other Member States. It costs 5 euros each time the company makes a foreign transfer. In today's Denmark it runs to 7000 euros a year. 7000 euros that the company can spend on staff, savings or investments. This is something that will benefit the European economy. My hope is that the next Parliament and the next Commission will work to extend the regulation so that it also eliminates unnecessary fees on payments between EU countries outside the euro zone.

In the case of the euro, we have already created the infrastructure, and what we can do, with the regulation, is basically to make sure that banks are passing on the efficiency of this infrastructure to the consumers. But we do not have it for all currencies in all cross-border situations.

Commissioner, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for her excellent work. With regard to this proposal, which we will be debing today, I must say that the original Commission proposal was oriented - and still remains in the report of the Committee on Transport - that the market for bus and coach passenger transport in Europe should also be opened within one Member State to a company in another Member State, as it is currently only open to international transport as part of the service. The Commission's original proposal also included eliminating discrimination, creating independent dispute resolution bodies or regulators in each of the Member States in order to have a level playing field for all companies.  In the Committee on Transport, we assessed more than thirty compromises and found a solution that we believe leads to understanding and balancing these views. We partly departed from these good liberalisation objectives and left it to the Member States to allow non-full authorisation of transport operations that are over a hundred kilometres away, making it possible for Member States to justify that a public service contract is affected or that the public interest is affected and to prevent another participant from entering.  We also found a good solution to the independence of the regulatory body, which must be found in each Member State and which also provides additional safeguards in relation to it if a Member State considers that a entrant creates unfair conditions on this market.  On the availability of bus and coach facilities: if there was initially the possibility that access to any new entrant on the market at bus and coach ing facilities could be rejected only because of the capacity criterion, we created additional criteria as a compromise that could allow for actually limiting the availability of bus and coach ing, which was also a step towards those who did not want to open up the market.  Finally, we also created a situation where, even companies which register in the Member State concerned and obtain authorisation, after obtaining this authorisation, all the conditions that exist in that Member State, including the social conditions that exist in that Member State, in order to be able to operate on the passenger market, must be fulfilled.  I would like to switch to English now to make some final remarks on political issues. I would like to thank all my shadow rapporteurs, who worked very constructively. As I described, we did not get 100% of what most of us expected but we got a good balance in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. And I am relying very much on the plenary tomorrow as well. At the same time, I am surprised that some of our colleagues are trying to keep this Coach and Bus Regulation as a hostage for Mobility Package I, with the aim of changing the mobility package in their own policy direction. In my political experience, it's not good politics to try to succeed on one issue by drawing in unrelated issues. I would remind you that all the social issues for drivers and companies working in road transport are in Mobility Package I, not in my report. There was nothing in the initial Commission proposal and there is nothing now about social conditions. So, while I fully understand the political will here, I would ask all my colleagues to be serious – in these final months before the European elections and a new parliamentary term – in seeking to finalise this proposal at first reading and to create a good opportunity for discussing it in the future with the Council, when the Council is ready.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 341, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, buses and coaches provide an affordable and clean public transport service. Those services can be complementary and not in competition with rail services, linking regions and cities which are not well connected by railways. In this context, the proposal presented by the Commission as part of its second mobility package aims at improving the mobility of EU citizens within Member States, while increasing the sustainability of national transport systems, offering an attractive collective transport alternative to the use of private cars. The proposal will lead to an increased offer of domestic services that are more responsive to citizens’ needs, in particular for those on lower incomes. It will also bring economic and social benefits, with increased investment and job creation in this sector. Let me recall some key figures and benefits associated with the proposal by 2030: cumulative CO2 emissions savings of EUR 183 million, accumulated administrative savings of EUR 1560 million, an increase of about 11% in coach transport activity and 85 000 new jobs.

It is indeed very important to have a strong regulator in all Member States to carry out the necessary economic equilibrium tests and to deal with possible appeals. Likewise, it is essential that we find the right articulation between public services and those provided on a commercial basis. I believe that Mr Zīle has managed to get the balance right – to protect public service contracts adequately while at the same time allowing commercial offers to flourish. On certain points, such as on the administrative burden on operators and on the definition of bus terminals, we fully understand the good intentions behind the compromise amendments, but we believe more work is needed.

The bus, ladies and gentlemen, is the most social mode of transport. It makes it possible that citizens of any corner are not isolated. This proposal is intended to facilitate non-resident carriers' access to the market in another European Union country to provide intercity coach services there. At the same time, carriers offering domestic intercity routes are guaranteed to benefit from further liberalization of the European bus market. This is a good balance between liberalisation and protection of existing public service contracts. It has allowed, I believe, a clear majority of this House to be encouraged. International liberalization brings us to a more integrated European Union and will also lead us to a fairer and more competitive market. But, in turn, public service contracts that work efficiently in some countries are not ignored, as recognized by fulfilling a degree of satisfaction recognized by all surveys. Interestingly, some who oppose accuse the dossier of excessively liberalizing and of not contemplating public services, and others say it falls short. Ladies and gentlemen, not one thing or another. It is a balanced text that allows systems as different as German, French or Irish to coexist.

I never understood why we had to go in two areas of transport in totally different directions, namely stopping the liberalisation of heavy goods truck transport and liberalisation in transport by buses.  However, let me really congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Zille, who has managed to strike a balance so that we do not apply the German model in Spain, nor the Spanish model in Germany. And so we can really apply this model, which applies both in Spain, for example, and in my country, where too many cities, already large cities, located, for example, on the Black Sea coast, cannot afford to have a transport between cities. Or you can imagine what is happening inside the country and in the increasingly dwindling villages and small towns in countries such as Bulgaria, and in many other countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

Passenger transport by bus and coach is the most common and cheapest means of public transport. In many areas, especially rural areas, it is sometimes the only means of public transport. Opening up this sector to cross-border competition is an important and necessary step that will have a positive impact on the quality, access and prices of such services. Of course, it is necessary to safeguard the public interest by ensuring proper control over public transport for national and local authorities, which will be able to react at a time when the rules of free competition are being infringed to the detriment of passengers. I believe that the Zīle report balances well the potential benefits and risks of opening up the market for coach and bus services. This is also an appropriate step in the context of our discussion on the future of road freight.

That principle applies in my Member State for the granting of bus transport licences. It is a practical embossing of collaboration between the public and the private.

If, on behalf of the single market, they had already opened the door to concentration in the sector for the benefit of large multinationals, now the Commission and this Parliament want to go further. They opened the doors of national markets by imposing on Member States a set of rules for the operation of their own road passenger transport services. They illuminate restrictions on access to long-distance markets to facilitate multinationals' entry into this market and, as has happened on the railway, to guarantee them access to terminals, in what will eventually be another element of privatisation of the sector. This further liberalisation of national markets will facilitate the assault of large European companies on the transport network in the States, with predictable and verified consequences. Apart from the resulting phenomenon of concentration in the sector is expected the degradation of transport services provided to the population, the degradation of infrastructure and terminals and the degradation of the working conditions of workers in the sector. At the same time, it removes member states' instruments for the defence of their transport strategies, in particular by compromising the safeguarding and development of the public transport sector, and on increasing the supply of public transport to the detriment of the population.

For the Commission, Germany has always been a successful example. After the liberalisation in 2013, many long-distance bus companies were initially on the market there, today virtually only one, a monopoly. That is why Germany is not a model of success.  In addition, working conditions are completely excluded. Drivers often have to stay on their buses, or prepare the bus before and after the trip, check tickets and provide information. None of this has to be counted as travel time, i.e. paid. In this way, unfair competition with environmentally friendly railways becomes even more unfair because no train driver is obliged to do so.  Long-distance buses will also remain exempt from tolls, while every locomotive will have to pay a toll on every kilometre of the route across the EU. A means of transport that is cheap through price dumping must not be subsidised in addition. Unfortunately, our amendments were all rejected in committee.

More and more consumers have been given the opportunity to travel cheaply over longer distances and by safe and environmentally friendly bus. The increasing number of bus passengers, especially from rural areas, speaks for itself. This must finally be possible in cross-border transport. I am glad that this text has succeeded, on the one hand, in making the market a little fairer and opening up throughout Europe, and, on the other, of respecting the subsidiarity of the Member States. Since it must be guaranteed that access to the terminals is non-discriminatory, this means that applications for access should be rejected not only when there is no capacity available, but also if, for example, the bus company continuously refuses to pay or violates the house rules. I am pleased that these points have been included in the text. By the way: cabotage is not a problem in long-distance bus services, as the route is always approved by the host Member State before it can be operated. This means that timetables with specific journey times and routes will be predetermined and approved. In contrast to truck journeys, long-distance bus journeys are therefore really controllable.

In particular, the environmental objectives faced by terminal operators, in relation to tackling congestion and pollution, should have been specifically acknowledged and protected. Equally, there is significant evidence, from surveys of bus drivers and trade union reports, that, as others have said, the liberalisation already in place in many Member States has impacted negatively on drivers’ terms and conditions of work. Therefore, we should not be liberalising further at this stage.

And the whole point of bus services is that, and the great advantage is that they allow easy contact with even the most feared regions.

We always talk about the fact that, in the context of decarbonisation of transport, we have to see that we have more means of transport, where a collective number of people can travel with us. The bus is clearly such a means. We already have some of the municipal buses that make public transport; that should definitely continue. We have railways, but we do not have them everywhere. That has already been said. I come from Germany, we have a good rail network. But this is far from the case in all countries. That is why we need an opportunity to be transported collectively to several, and buses are a good option, because there are more roads than rail in Europe. That is one thing.  I therefore think that this liberalisation of long-distance buses is really good.

I very much welcome the broad support expressed tonight and I took note of certain concerns that were raised, so allow me to respond to the main points. First, a general comment on public services. Commercial services carrying passengers over distances of 100km or more will concern only a small proportion of public-service contracts throughout the EU because many routes operated as part of public-service contracts are under 100km long, and passenger journeys on them are implicitly shorter. In addition, public services – and not only those with exclusive rights – can remain protected. I hope that clarifies the first point that was raised. Let me also stress again that this proposal does not affect the social conditions applicable to bus and coach drivers. As rightly mentioned by Mr Zīle, those social conditions are regulated in another piece of legislation, which is being revised under Mobility Package I. And, in its proposal on rest and driving time, the Commission does not propose to change the rules which apply specifically to bus drivers. On the environmental requirements, I would like to clarify that the authorisation procedures proposed by the Commission, which are mentioned in Mr Zīle’s report, provide a clear possibility for Member States to impose environmental performance requirements and to control them – provided, of course, that those requirements are imposed on all operators on a non—discriminatory basis. On the fourth point, regarding charging rules applicable to bus transport, Mr Cramer, let me also underline that the Commission has proposed, in Mobility Package I, new rules contributing to a level playing field for different modes of transport. So I’m inviting everyone, please, to support Mobility Package I because it resolves many issues that honourable Members find challenging in the current situation. I hope, Mr Cramer, that your concerns too can be addressed through the mobility package. Allow me also to make one last comment on the proposed motion of rejection that has been tabled. This would be a big missed opportunity for the sector and for citizens. If the proposal were rejected the sector would not be able to benefit from common rules across the EU. And you know what such rules mean: a bigger market, better salaries, more competition, better service. So, it would not be able to benefit from common rules across the EU, and instead would be faced with different national rules, as is the case today, and that is what is preventing the sector from expanding. And I’ll tell you who would lose most: low—income groups and those living in remote areas. We want every single village to be connected. Honourable Members will know that, in the next Commission programme, we have also proposed ‘smart villages’, and mobility is an essential part of that new concept because we do not want any part of the EU to be excluded from development. We want all parts to be connected and fully engaged with modern European Union opportunities.

I think even if we are very close to elections we will not lose our joint aim, which is to create a really pure single market, go step by step, but make transport efficient and environmentally friendly.

Of course some of the statements show that liberalisation is like some monster coming from other Member States that would like to do bad things to other Member States and destroy everything, but it’s really not true and we know that in other modes of transport – like aviation – it’s not the case. Why are we speaking today about this new legislation on bus and coach market opening? What is actually the main aim?

As a member of the European Parliament in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, since the beginning of my mandate I have supported the creation of a genuine single market for road passenger transport in the European Union for a single European transport area. This would certainly benefit road passenger companies, and I believe that the liberalisation of road transport of persons provides a natural balance of the European transport market, while ensuring economic and social harmonisation within the EU.

I would like to thank Parliament for its effort to tackle this untapped potential by tabling this resolution on NAIADES II, calling for a follow—up programme for post—2020 and the related financial support to implement the programme. This resolution will support the conclusion of the mid—term progress report of the current NAIADES II programme and the Digital Inland Waterway Area (DINA) report, mapping digital initiatives. These reports emphasise the need to continue working to put inland waterways transport in the place it deserves in terms of a reduction of the overall environmental impact of transport. For the inland waterways transport sector, it is crucial to be part of the fundamental transformation that the big game changers – which are of course digitalisation, decarbonisation, investments, innovation, and people – are bringing to transport and logistics. The EU’s position in relation to inland waterways transport is that of strong support. A key objective of EU transport policy is multimodality, and – as you may recall – I spent a lot of time and energy in 2018 in promoting multimodality. We even called 2018 the ‘Year of Multimodality’. The Commission considers it important to increase the integration of inland waterways transport into the overall transport system. That is why we proposed the revision of the Combined Transport Directive, which would allow further support for the combined transport operations, making use of inland waterways on the non-road leg. In my final year as Transport Commissioner, the smooth implementation of the directive on technical standards and on professional qualification for inland waterways is a priority. We will also continue to look at how best we can bring digitalisation to the sector and link it better into the whole logistic network, especially considering its fragmented character and primarily family-run businesses. Apart from that, we will continue our efforts related to the completion of the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). A more committed effort aimed at improving European waterways and their connectivity is needed at a governance level. Your call to reinforce financial support for inland waterways through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and Horizon Europe was indeed proposed by the Commission for the next financial period. It is now under discussion between Member States and Parliament, and I hope that the outcome of these discussions will be beneficial for the sector. This is why I am pleased that the follow-up programme you propose in your resolution will reinforce the Commission’s activities in this field. The European group of NAIADES, set up by the Commission and to which Member States and the Members of the European Parliament are invited, will already start to reflect and analyse the content of Parliament’s resolution and its proposed follow-up programme from next month. I do, however, have to stress that the adoption and implementation of this programme will, of course, be subject to the orientation of the next Commission.

Madam President, where are my colleagues? If we are talking about Mr Putin, about distant countries or about sexual issues, the room is full. Now that we are talking about inland navigation, one of the cleanest, forward-looking modes of transport, the turnout is significantly lower. In addition, the Committee on Transport always gets speaking time after 22 hours on Wednesday evenings. Perhaps you can take into account the fact that we also sometimes want to speak on Tuesday or Wednesday mornings. But seriously now. In 2011 we agreed the so-called \"modal shift\": less road and air transport, and more transport by rail and waterways. Inland navigation is the most underestimated form of transport in the European Union at the moment. I am extremely pleased with the European Commission's action programme, and in particular Mrs Bulc, to re-focus on inland navigation in the broad sense. It's supposedly a boring, technical subject. But when it comes to digitisation, self-sailing ships and sustainability, inland navigation is the most forward-looking form of transport. We need major infrastructure investments. Many locks are too small and too old. The major TEN—T projects, such as the Seine-Scheldt connection, are taking too long.

The future of inland waterway transport in the European Union depends primarily on the amount of investment that will be allocated in the coming years. We need modern infrastructure that combines the potential of inland waterway transport and other modes of transport. The future is multimodality, especially ports and transhipment terminals, where goods transported by waterways can be picked up and transported further and in other ways. I would like one of these multimodal terminals to be built in Bydgoszcz, which is located at the crossroads of the E40 and E70 international waterways, as well as in the immediate vicinity of the Baltic-Adriatic and North Sea-Baltic corridors. However, in addition to the cooperation of national authorities and the private sector, such an investment will require appropriate support from the European Union. Precisely in order to carry out such modern and ambitious projects, the Commission should provide adequate funding for the continuation of the NAIADES project.

He is only from the Netherlands, and I come from Germany. There are many rivers and canals. This is not everywhere in Europe. But where there is – Inés, you were talking about the ebro, for example – you can use the river, and that is necessary. Most people forget that. People are always talking about this: we want to go from road to rail. Nothing is said about road or rail to inland waterway transport. And we cannot build new rails as quickly as we can use rivers more. And that's what we need. NAIADES shows us how we can digitise river shipping, make it more modern, make it more environmentally friendly, even more environmentally friendly with liquefied natural gas, for example, how we can have good qualifications in this area – we have just recently achieved harmonisation for qualification. In other words, this area has a huge future. We can also lift a bridge with much less money, for example, so that double containers can then be transported than we can build rails at the same time. We need both transport routes, or all three, but we certainly need not only rail, but also more inland waterways, compared to road transport.

Inland waterway transport is also essential to further reduce the negative impacts of transport through more efficient use of land, energy, as well as, of course, noise reduction and accidents. Modernising the inland waterway fleet and adapting it to technical progress would give it a competitive advantage in multimodal transport, as the Commissioner has already emphasised here, and I am also joining in this.

I agree with the rapporteur that water transport options are indeed underestimated and are certainly higher, but require more investment. For this reason, I would like to ask the Commission whether the NAIADES II action programme and, where appropriate, of course, NAIADES III, should receive more adequate funding precisely to achieve its objectives, so that it is well supported by a structured policy strategy with achievable short- and medium-term objectives and a concrete plan setting out, inter alia, the resources for its implementation.

In order to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement, our transport sector needs to decarbonise significantly.

That is why we need to support inland navigation, including CEF II, by eliminating bottlenecks.

As you are aware, the European Council also attaches great importance to security and technology. Last year, both in June and October, it addressed questions of internal security, especially regarding cybersecurity.  The Romanian Council Presidency has also made cybersecurity part of a broader package that deals with hybrid threats to the European elections, and one of the main issues that we have to address, as mentioned, is to gather information on this.  Cybersecurity is indeed one of the main challenges we are facing as attacks are capable of causing serious economic damage and of violating privacy and fundamental rights. Recent cybersecurity events in some Member States are not a new trend but just the latest example of the most negative downside of the internet.  However, no economic growth can be achieved without a stable and secure environment. During the last year cybersecurity has become a matter of highest political priority and a constant topic on the agenda. The ambitious cybersecurity package presented by the Commission in September 2017 was followed the by a set of Council conclusions and an action plan for their implementation. These emphasised the need to enhance the EU’s capacity to prevent, deter and respond to cyber—attacks.  The Cyber Security Act – an important part of the package – will be formally adopted in the coming weeks. This will create a strong and permanent mandate for the European Union Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) and will enhance cybersecurity certification.  The Council is also making progress in the discussions on the proposal for a regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial Technology and Research Centre and network of coordination centres. It is the Presidency’s intention to reach a general approach on this important file in the coming weeks.  Furthermore, the EU has stepped up its response by adopting a cyber—diplomacy toolbox. This framework offers the full use of measures within the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including, if needed, restrictive measures.  As regards China, the EU is committed to opening trading relations with this country. We should not forget that China is the EU’s second biggest trading partner, after the US. However, access to the Chinese markets for EU companies remains highly restricted and China ranks among the least open economies to foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow, in particular in certain key sectors.  In contrast, the European market is fully open to Chinese investment, despite the lack of reciprocity. China is not only becoming a more prominent international investor but is increasingly focusing on high—tech sectors as targets for its acquisitions. The EU is also addressing forced technology transfers in China. In particular, in June 2018, the EU filed a dispute settlement case in the World Trade Organization, supplemented in December 2018, against Chinese practices that force European companies to give up sensitive technology and know—how as a precondition for investing in China.  We are strengthening our tools for responding to the possible risks that certain investments could pose to our security or essential interests of the Union. In this regard, this House will be voting this week on a very important piece of legislation – the Investment Screening Regulation. The regulation will establish a framework for screening by the Member States and for a mechanism for cooperation in the exchange of information about investments from third countries.  The regulation is country—neutral and is not directed at China. It will be applied towards foreign direct investment from all third countries, without differentiating, and is fully in line with the EU’s and Member States’ international commitments. The framework is strictly focused on security and public order, which the EU interprets in a narrow sense. As such, it is not intended to discourage foreign investments but, on the contrary, to enable such investments in sensitive areas by addressing and mitigating risks relating to security and public order.  We welcome the excellent cooperation of the European Parliament in this file, which will lead to its adoption in the coming months. I look forward to listening to this debate and I want once more to repeat that the Romanian Council Presidency is fully committed towards fighting for cybersecurity and fighting against interference from abroad and, at the same time, for doing more investments but having in mind as well how we protect our fundamental rights and freedoms in Europe.

It’s not a question to be left to the next Parliament. It’s not even a question for next week. Cyber and cyber—enabled threats already pose a significant challenge to our European Union. This is not going to change any time soon, and with the emergence of new technologies – which will change our entire connected lives – we need to be thinking right now about our digital security requirements.  It’s no surprise that the resilience of critical digital infrastructures, including in relation to the imminent rollout of 5G technology, has aroused healthy debate in Member States around the role of third-country technology providers, not least in the light of the 2017 Chinese National Intelligence Law. To those who have questioned why we are discussing this, and to those who have tried to warn us off, I want to say this: it’s absolutely right that we should be discussing this. It’s entirely legitimate, and indeed necessary. 5G infrastructure will be the backbone of our digital economy, providing mission-critical services, not only for consumer services, but for a myriad of other sectors – transport, energy, health, defence and the security sector – and it will not be easy to replace once it is installed. Securing this critical digital infrastructure is necessary to protect our government, our industry, our democratic institutions, our personal information, and indeed, our core values, such as the protection of fundamental rights and data protection. Driving this urgent work forward and building stronger coordination among Member States will be essential to our joint efforts to increase our collective digital resilience.  There are, as has already been mentioned, a number of instruments in place which can be used to boost that resilience. For a start, while 5G standards are global, theoretically allowing suppliers from anywhere in the world to do business here in Europe, anyone who wants to access the EU market needs to comply with our rules. Member States have the right to take measures against companies, for reasons of national security. The regulation on screening of foreign direct investments (FDI) into the EU, as has just been underlined, will allow the Commission and Member States to cooperate in their assessment of potential security risks, including cyber—related threats posed by foreign investments. The regulation will establish a mechanism enabling Member States and the Commission to assist each other where a foreign investment in critical technology infrastructure, as in other sectors, could affect the security or public order interests of other Member States or of the Union itself. The Commission will also be able to issue opinions – in particular when Union projects and programmes are potentially at risk. In this way, the regulation will help ensure Member States have the information they need when making key decisions on their critical digital infrastructures. As my colleague Commissioner Malmström said to this Chamber a little earlier today, by concluding the work on the FDI screening regulation, the Union is sending a strong message to its partners. We are open to foreign investment, but a condition of being open is to be able to trust that foreign investors will not threaten our security and our strategic interests.  As well as who is supplying our infrastructure, we also need to consider how cyber-secure it will be once it’s in place, once we’re using it. Again, there are measures in place to boost cybersecurity at EU level. For example, most Member States have already transposed into national law the Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive. That was the first EU—wide legislation in this area, and for any Member States who have not yet transposed this, I think they would be well advised to do so. The Directive seeks to develop national cybersecurity capabilities, increase EU—level cooperation and ensure that operators of essential services, including certain digital service providers, adopt appropriate risk management measures and report significant incidents to their national authorities.  Again, as has been underlined, the Cybersecurity Act that we reached agreement on last December will soon be adopted and published. It reinforces the mandate of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), creating a genuine European cybersecurity agency, better to support Member States in tackling cyber threats and attacks. The Act also establishes an EU framework for cybersecurity certification, boosting the cybersecurity of online services and consumer devices. I think that we can expect 5G infrastructure to be an important element of the Agency’s work. Finally, negotiations are underway on the proposal for a European cybersecurity research and competence centre and network, which will stimulate the development and deployment of cybersecurity technology and complement the capacity-building efforts in this area at EU— and national levels. These various measures create the right kind of incentives to enhance cybersecurity products and services in the EU, both for business and consumers, and along supply chains. But we need to work together – the institutions, our agencies and the Member States – to make use of the various provisions and powers. Together, we need to demonstrate the necessary political will to better assure our digital security, and it’s vital that we remain vigilant to all the cyber and cyber—enabled threats, including those to our digital infrastructure, given that they will continue to evolve and they will continue to be cross-border. For our part, the Commission is committed to continue working with Member States and the other European institutions on these issues. Thank you for organising this debate this evening.

I must say, Commissioner, that I have listened with interest to your speech, which was interesting but, in my opinion, very general. The point we are dealing with here relates directly to companies that are linked to China, to a particular country. And we do not address this point here by accident, because in the last few months there have simply been problems in some EU Member States related to the security risks of specific Chinese companies.  I am from the Czech Republic, where this problem concerns two Chinese companies, and I want to say, I do not know if you have this information, that on 17 December 2018 the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Office issued a clear warning about two Chinese companies, namely Huawei and ZTE. The Czech Republic is not the only EU country currently dealing with these problems on its territory. It's a current problem, our government is dealing with it in a certain way, in my opinion, rather alibiically. Regardless of what the Czech President notes, which more or less greatly downplays the warnings of this professional office.  I therefore believe that the European institutions, the European Commission, should respond to these problems at the moment. Possibly within the framework of their legislation, or at least by leading a debate between Member States, that there will be an attempt to coordinate some common action in order to protect European security. I would very much like the Commission's initiative to be here if we were able to make some kind of joint, strong response, as the US did in August last year, or as New Zealand or Australia did, for example.

Here, for example, gdpr is an excellent example, a pioneer in legislation that many, even American companies, have said they will apply around the world.  We just passed the Cybersecurity Act. There, for example, the possibility of certification schemes was created. Here is an excellent job for ENISA. Let me set up a certification scheme for 5G equipment to be implemented throughout the European Union, and I think such a certification scheme can also be proposed worldwide. Let ENISA use its double budget, which has just been confirmed by the European Parliament, precisely so that European citizens can feel safer in this new 5G technology.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 389, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Pavel Telička", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, I will exceptionally speak in my mother language, so please do use your headphones. Madam President, first of all, I would like to commend what Commissioner King said. In recent months, I and my fellow information officers have dealt in quite detail with the cybersecurity legislation proposed by the European Commission. I think this is a substantial shift, and it is a pity that this issue has not caused more interest across the political spectrum in this Parliament, but particularly in the Member States.  What we have been referring to is that in the Member States, the thinking of what we call mindset has not yet changed. I remember hearing in the trilogue how difficult it was to persuade the Member States, albeit to make partial shifts. I mean, the legislative infrastructure that we're building right now, I think that's a key step. And what do we need? We have to be able to fill it. We must have the will to transpose it quickly, to build institutional infrastructure. I am glad that we have it in the Czech Republic, it may not yet be at the level of Germany, Britain, France, but it is of high quality. But what really lags behind is awareness at the political level in the Member States, but also the ability to think about the risks that lie here. This is not just a question of espionage, it is a question perhaps more serious in the future. So I think that this is a step that we have to take, and it is a pity, as has already been said here, that the Czech political representation not only torpedoes this, but is practically on the other side of the table.  Last comment, I appreciate what the Minister said. At the moment, we also need to be able to protect our market, but at the same time to penetrate foreign markets, i.e. here in this respect there is an absolute imbalance and reciprocity must be our primary principle.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 390, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Helmut Scholz", "mepid": "96646", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

China is a space nation. The country has produced world-class technology and mobility companies. You will probably test the care during processing and assembly on a daily basis with your phone or computer. In the future technologies artificial intelligence and electromobility, Chinese manufacturers are now ahead of their European competitors. This gap also applies between Silicon Valley and, in my view, the Huawei Group when we talk about 5G technology. I believe that we simply need to agree on this once again.  We do not need exclusion or helpless attempts at containment. We need cooperation to deal with issues, including digital security. In the EU, more than 180,000 people are already working for this largest Chinese technology company – a private company, by the way, no matter how loudly the media reports it. However, cooperation also creates prospects for employees, and this is also the case for many other global companies from other countries. We also need cooperation to design the necessary regulation for the new technologies from China with China and multilaterally. Only in this way can we prevent the misuse and cases of data theft – by whomever, this is really a real issue – that technological development will make possible.

The hottest topic in terms of China's technical presence in Europe is certainly the topic of 5G. And the Huawei company, which has just been mentioned by Mr Scholz, plays a special role in this. You, Commissioner, have already referred to the Chinese National Intelligence Act. Let me put it explicitly: we should learn from Australia. It has drawn the conclusion that I think is right for us: we cannot trust a company that is obliged by the laws of its own country to make data of its customers available to the authorities of that country upon request and to conceal this data transfer from customers. Such a company cannot be part of the core of our 5G infrastructure. And we should find a common European solution, because this debate is now taking place in many different European countries. Overall, however, I believe that the issue is much broader. And many keywords have been mentioned, from investment screening to cyber security, technology exports could be called.

But post-Brexit neighbourly cooperation remains important. We know that the Chinese Government is particularly sensitive about suggestions that there could be any security risks regarding the introduction of 5G technology, and indeed they even went so far as to take out a full-page advertisement in the Daily Telegraph to attempt to assuage those concerns. And perhaps one of the biggest difficulties for me – or indeed for anyone watching this debate – is to assess the nature of evidence which isn’t in the public domain. For example, the director of the FBI claims that Huawei smartphones can conduct undetected espionage and maliciously modify or steal information, but to what extent can this be done? What the hard evidence is remains something of a mystery.  Likewise, the arrest of Meng Wanzhou in Canada at the request of the American Government raises concerns. And if it were just the United States, then it would be tempting to impute an ulterior motive – to suggest that it could simply be a US response to a free market challenge to the US’s decades of tech dominance. But it’s not just the USA; there are concerns from Australia, from Japan, from a number of other European nations closer to home. The British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said that he has very deep concerns about Chinese involvement in 5G networks. And if there is a risk, then it must be a very big one. Why? Because every government – every government – has an interest in raising billions through 5G auctions, and the Chinese companies are bound to be the leading competitors in those auctions. And it’s a big risk for another reason: because security matters; because, ultimately, it’s a matter of national protection, national defence and national sovereignty.  Our response to this kind of situation demands the careful consideration of all the evidence, and I believe that the UK’s response needs to be dependent on three fundamental questions. Firstly, what is the level of risk of back-door routes being installed, potentially at the direction of the Chinese Government, which would enable industrial espionage to take place? Secondly, what is the level of risk that the Chinese Government could mandate the disclosure of information held by Chinese tech companies in the UK, potentially even putting Chinese citizens at risk? Thirdly, to what extent will countries become over-reliant on the 5G networks; a situation which, bluntly – if we find out later that we’ve made a mistake –would be difficult to correct.  Any response at all bears the danger of being overly cautious, overly protectionist, to the extent that we ultimately find ourselves excluding technology from overseas, but that has to be balanced against broader security questions, and to me the question of risk management is essentially very similar to the question of the precautionary principle. What is the level of evidence needed for us to act? I don’t see this is a question of proof beyond reasonable doubt – maybe not a question of proof at all, but a question of protection. If we have a lack of absolute scientific certainty, on which side should we bear the risk? It’s a philosophical question as much as a practical one, but I believe that to make practical judgments we need  a little bit better information as to the level and nature of the risk.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 393, "date": "2019-02-13.json", "name": "Gilles Lebreton", "mepid": "124738", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group. Madam President, it is dangerous to use the mobile phones of the Chinese company Huawei. They are, most likely, a huge source of intelligence for the Chinese government's spy services. The capture of this information seems to have already enabled China to steal Western technologies. Several democratic states have already expressed concern about this issue, such as Canada, Australia, Poland and Belgium. And on January 28, the U.S. Justice Department officially accused Huawei of stealing U.S. technology. As for the Czech Republic, it has just excluded it from a tender.

There is an international competition. And backdoors are available in software, in hardware, they are often offered on all continents. That is why I believe it is important to concentrate on confidence-building measures and, in particular, to redesign the tenders accordingly, that a company and institution design the architecture of the system accordingly, that a second company then installs the production for the hardware and software and that a third company ensures maintenance and operation. Then you have three different companies or institutions that need to know in detail how the system works. Then you also have security. And if one of these companies still has its headquarters in Europe, then we have two international suppliers on which we can also rely, who are certified and where you can reliably see how this works.

Therefore, the European Union, for its own reasons, imposes restrictions on investment, however much it does not want to admit it. These restrictions may be imposed on grounds of public policy and public security. The United States has already done so for its part. So that is something that we discussed in the previous debate.

I would even have welcomed this debate slightly earlier in the day, with the opportunity to have slightly more people in the Chamber, because while we may be discussing technology that is not yet part of our everyday lives, it soon will be. And the fact that it will form the backbone infrastructure connecting everything means that we now have to think very seriously about how to get security right from the outset, from the start. Although 5G has, for understandable reasons, attracted the most attention in recent weeks, it’s not the only thing we need to be thinking about. Storing data in the cloud and artificial intelligence open up huge opportunities to make use of, or to abuse, huge volumes of personal data, to give just one other example. These issues raise challenges around national and EU—level decision—making, which won’t – let’s be frank – necessarily be easy to resolve.  Trying to protect everything won’t work. We need to decide what really matters, what is core in terms of the digital ecosystem, and whether greater transparency around suppliers, supply chains and foreign investment is enough to offset the security risks. It may be that some pieces of backbone digital infrastructure are simply too critical for us to risk. These issues are also inherently geopolitical. So I think the solutions need to reflect our – Europe’s – particular perspective based around keeping markets open and trade fair. Security concerns are not an excuse for arbitrary protectionism but, equally, we can’t ignore those concerns. We need to think strategically around these issues of security.
