The Customs Union is not talked about enough but remains one of the successes of the European Union. We should not take it for granted, and we should not think there is no room for improvement. An important piece of the Customs Union is, for instance, missing: we have the same rules but we handle matters in a completely different way when companies or individuals break these common rules.  It might not have been such a big problem before, because some Member States have big ports while some other countries have smaller trade flows and less resources to control. But the modernised Customs Code brought about a trade facilitation measure with the Authorised Economic Operator status, which can be lost if a company commits a serious repeated infringement. A company might lose its status in country A, while still working in country B. This will create distortion of the market and unfair competition. In addition, in the digital age, we have to have the objective of creating new opportunities for small and medium—sized enterprises.  My goal in this report was quite different from the approach taken by the Commission as my focus was on improving compliance businesses with sometimes very complex rules, so that the system leads to fewer infringements and not more. Sanctions are the last resort when there is a lack of compliance, but the starting point cannot be that all companies are intending to break the rules. We need to treat the companies as partners. Circumstances matter and need to be acknowledged. So this has to be taken into account while determining the sanction.  I am really against the strict liability regime that is in place in several countries; it simply deters compliance. A strict liability regime also means that no degree of guilt needs to be determined, which raises a serious question of whether it respects the presumption of innocence. There should be a mix of non-criminal and criminal sanctions when it comes to infringements of customs law and there should be a greater effort by the Member States and the Commission to improve compliance, improve businesses’ knowledge of customs legislation. Last, but not least, it is very important to make sure that the system is fair and proportionate. It is not a fair system if you are a small company trading high—value goods and the sanctions kill your business because of your type of trade. Sanctions need to be about the consequences of the infringement and not strictly about the value of the goods.  I am very happy that Parliament has decided to take this file seriously. It is a very different matter in the Council, where they refuse convergence of a sanction system as a principle. Therefore, I hope that the Council will be a bit more constructive and will decide to work on this important pillar of the Customs Union, that is in compliance with European Union law.

I am happy to note that the Commission and Parliament share common objectives. These objectives are to ensure a proper enforcement of EU customs law and to provide a level playing field for our economic operators. Since the internal market was set up, EU customs legislation has been fully harmonised in a single legal act. However, the consequences of violating the common rules vary across the Customs Union. They depend on the 28 different legal orders and the administrative or judicial traditions of the Member States. In the absence of a common approach, there is a patchwork of responses to those who break the rules. Currently, Member States have widely different definitions for customs infringements and apply different types and levels of sanctions. Sanctions for certain infringements range from small fines in some Member States to imprisonment in others. The financial threshold for deciding whether an infringement is criminal or not ranges from EUR 266 to EUR 50 000, according to the country where it occurs. National time limits for sanctioning customs offences also vary widely – from one to 30 years – while some Member States have no time limit at all. This results in a lack of legal certainty for businesses, possible competitive distortions in the internal market and unfair advantages for those who breach the law where sanctions are the lowest. This in turn impacts negatively on revenues and the enforcement of policies, such as consumer protection or agriculture, when goods are imported or exported. It also raises questions about the uniformity of the Customs Union, which is a key obligation of the EU as a WTO member. The legislative proposal follows the adoption of the Union’s custom code, which came into force last May and which streamlines and modernises European customs rules and procedures. It is about building a common understanding among all Member States on how customs laws should be enforced. It is about trust and cooperation among EU Member States’ customs administrations with different administrative cultures and legal orders but the same mission. This is why we need an effective, proportionate and decisive system for customs infringements and sanctions in the European Union. For such a system to be efficient and credible, there needs to be a common framework established at EU level. Nevertheless, this is politically sensitive for some Member States, as it touches upon their national competences. Therefore I must express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mrs Kallas, who, together with the shadow rapporteurs, came up with the proposal for amendments, which in many cases actually improve the text proposed by the Commission. I also understand that the first reading has not yet been completed. I am happy to say that the Commission finds many of the proposed amendments acceptable, although there is certainly room for discussion around the exact wording needed to ensure legal clarity and consistency in this complex field. Nevertheless, there are some issues of concern, and I will briefly mention some of them. For example, in the view of amendments proposed by IMCO to limit the scope of the directive to non-criminal offences, the definition of the scope and the links to criminal law should be further clarified to ensure legal certainty. In addition, this Directive may not be the best instrument to impose reporting obligations on the Commission on aspects of customs enforcement that do not stem from this directive. However, at this stage I wish to reiterate the Commission’s flexibility and availability to discuss the improvements, as long as they maintain the objectives of, and add value to, the proposal. I would like to thank once again Parliament, and especially Mrs Kallas and IMCO, for the constructive approach to the proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Franck Proust", "mepid": "108080", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. Madam President, Commissioner, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I am pleased that we have been able to participate in the examination of customs issues usually reserved for the IMCO committee. This approach has been both effective and complementary. It is important to take into account the place of the internal market in a global context, because our partners have already pointed out the inconsistencies in our internal market. We can learn from it. Although the customs union is seen as the backbone of the single market, there is still no integrated approach. Wanting to bring together definitions and penalties for customs offences, what a good idea! Especially in 2016. We should say, \"It's about time!\"! However, the subject is caught between the exclusive competence of the European Union in customs matters and the principle of subsidiarity of judicial or administrative sanctions of states. This balance must therefore be preserved. However, the lack of vision of some politicians in Europe, which do not understand the issues we face today, is staggering. Only the European Union can develop a common approach to implement customs legislation, mr Magnette says, and perhaps seeks to complicate the facilitation of trade that we are putting in place. More seriously, we need to put in place a great strategy that gives a direction, a course to the economic world of the European Union. This type of initiative is useful in bringing coherence to both the internal market and our foreign trade. Our customs are doing a great job. They must be able to count on a flexible structure and a rigorous framework, which is not uniform in Europe.

I believe that significant improvements have been made to the text that Mrs Kallas has achieved for Parliament in the committee responsible for the Internal Market, in cooperation with Franc Proust from the Committee on International Trade. The principles that Mr Proust has just set out - simplification, harmonisation and less bureaucracy - are principles to which we can fully commit ourselves. What we had to criticise, however, in the Commission's original text was the risk that, in the end, customs legislation would not become a harmonised simplified solution box for entrepreneurs who want to conquer global markets, but a bureaucratic monster that, in the end, significantly increased the risk of criminal sanctions. We have achieved the necessary changes in committee here. I thank everyone for that, and I hope that we can also get a broad majority for this.  Secondly, I believe that it was also important from the point of view of bureaucracy that we were able to agree that minimum penalty limits should not be imposed for minor infringements. In our view, this too is absolutely in line with the WTO decision, which was the basis for the european Commission's drafting and whose need in principle we in Parliament also expressly recognise. With regard to the implementation of the directive on customs infringements and sanctions, we must now bear in mind that the currently very different customs systems in the Member States, the harmonisation of which is in any case due to the continued implementation of the Union Customs Code, can be a hurdle. I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission once again to develop an overall strategy in which all Member States also assume their responsibilities in accordance with their customs obligations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 16, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Virginie Rozière", "mepid": "103845", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs with whom the work on this issue has been very effective and very fruitful. It was all the more difficult because it was a very technical subject on which compromises were sometimes difficult to achieve, but we really worked in a very constructive frame of mind. I think we can look forward to the result.  We welcomed the Commission's proposal because the customs union is the backbone of the internal market, the other side of the internal market. This is one of the first harmonised policies of the European Union and the adoption of the customs code is a signal of further integration in this area. However, even though it is a very integrated policy of the European Union, inconsistencies remain, particularly with regard to sanctions. Because we are faced with the following paradox: the rules can be the same, but depending on the country in which you carry out your customs procedures, you can, if you break the rules, incur penalties that range from a simple fine in one Member State to a prison sentence in another Member State. It is clear that this situation of inconsistency and disparity leads to opportunities for customs competition between states not at the level of the rules but the sanctions associated with them. Therefore, in order to prevent this circumvention of the common rules of the internal market, which results in several hundred million euros in loss of revenue due to fraud, we believe it is absolutely necessary to harmonize sanctions. In this respect, we have therefore obtained, in my opinion, a very good compromise which avoids this unfair competition between the Member States. We have clarified and strengthened the legal basis. We have clarified definitions, particularly the notions of negligence or the intentional nature of the fault. We have also clarified a number of points on the nature of sanctions. We have ruled out criminal sanctions which remain the exclusive competence of the Member States, which can introduce them if they wish. Finally, we have aligned sanctions and thresholds with the directive on the protection of financial interests in the European Union. This harmonization is, in my view, welcome.  As for the way in which the amount of sanctions is determined, I also think that the compromise we have reached is satisfactory, with a floor for serious offences and a method of calculation based on the amount of duties to ensure proportionality of the penalty. But I think we could have gone a little further on this point, specifying certain criteria to ensure the deterrent side of the instrument.  We also support the possibility of Member States introducing sanctions other than fines, such as suspending the status of an economic operator or revoking an import authorisation.  In addition, the Commission's proposal was reinforced by the introduction of a difference between major and minor infringement, based on objective and contextual factors in order to be able to preserve SMEs, whose infringements would be unintentional due to a lack of knowledge of customs rules. Finally, we welcome the introduction of an amicable settlement procedure and the continuation of the four-year statute of limitations. The harmonisation of customs sanctions is clearly essential to better combat fraud, to better ensure compliance with European rules and also to better feed the EU budget for which tariffs are one of the few resources of their own.   In this context, it is regrettable that the work has not begun in the Council. This dossier is, as such, unfortunately emblematic of the all-too-frequent contradictions between the speech of the Member States, in general, and the positions taken in the Council. In the case of customs sanctions, as in the case of other policies, namely tax or social policies, it is clear that the lack of harmonisation that leads to a situation of competition between states is harmful, undermines the application of common rules and deprives citizens of legitimate resources.  Parliament now has a strong position, a coherent position which I believe is a good basis for work. It is now up to the Council to take responsibility and move forward towards harmonising customs sanctions.

I know she has put a lot of work in and she has made the proposal better, especially in areas where it was inflexible and legally indefensible, like the presumption of innocence. However, despite her efforts, the ECR cannot support it.  The proposal seeks to do two things. One: to set a common approach for defining what a customs infringement is; two: to set common sanctions for those infringements. Now my Group can see the benefit of a common understanding and the need to reduce the complexity of different customs rules, but we disagree that this necessitates a mandatory set of harmonised Union sanctions.  This is a major infringement on subsidiarity, especially as there is little justification for such a move. I have yet to see a viable reason for the proposal. There is no evidence that importers calculate which Member State is the least onerous in terms of sanctions before they import into it. Even Parliament’s Research Services’ appraisal of the Commission impact assessment was unable to find any evidence of this.  However, when we look at the details of the proposal they are even more problematic. The Commission wants to treat a small or medium-sized company, or a home business, with no experience of customs rules, that accidently infringes those rules just as harshly as a multinational corporation with decades of knowledge and hundreds of staff. That is wrong. It risks killing the rapidly growing online cross-border trade and runs directly contrary to the Commission’s aims in creating the digital single market.  At its heart, the original proposal was too prescriptive and inflexible, giving customs regimes no room to use common sense and to examine intent and capabilities when assessing infringement. This should be up to the Member States. Now on customs sanctions, my Group cannot therefore agree with the rapporteur where she has gone beyond the Commission in some respects, particularly in Articles 11 and 12, with specific figures for specific infringements.  However, to conclude: greater consistency of custom rules for ease of trade, yes; prescriptive one-size-fits-all sanctions that infringe national sovereignty and Member States’ legal systems and risk killing the digital single market, no, and therefore the ECR Group cannot support it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 18, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Merja Kyllönen", "mepid": "124736", "text": "  On behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, thank you all for their very constructive cooperation on this important issue.

When there is a common way of interpreting what a customs infringement is, as well as a uniform penal penalty procedure, I believe that it will increase the transparency and efficiency of imports and exports, including in the European Union, and put companies of all sizes a little better on the same footing.

That is why it is important for European customs to apply similar procedures, controls and sanctions. Parliament is about to adopt by a large majority a directive to harmonise precisely the framework for customs sanctions.  At present, those who do not comply with the rules have to pay a fine and if this fine varies depending on the country, of course, they will let in the goods where they pay the least in case they are \"pinched\". Sanctions must therefore be harmonised: Parliament is almost unanimous in this, but some Eastern European states led by Germany and the Netherlands are blocking them because they do not intend to change things, or rather, because they do not want to change.  However, the issue of customs is not just a question of sanctions, controls and procedures should also be harmonised, which is why I will be rapporteur in the INTA Committee for a great process of reflection on the future of European customs, and I believe that the unblocking of this dossier is essential if we are to be able to continue.

In other words, it is a matter of harmonizing the national applications of customs legislation in order to complete the implementation of the customs union. National disparities in the implementation of this customs union do have an impact on the equality of the conditions of competition, in that they provide an advantage to those who do not comply with the law in a Member State whose customs sanctions regime is more lenient. The risk to offenders is therefore not the same depending on the door to the single internal market.

Customs law is a European competence, and yet we still have small-scale government in this area. This is something that is actually intolerable.

The ineffectiveness of customs controls at key entry points of the single market is now conducive to the movement of non-law-compliant goods throughout the Union. Some of Europe's important seaports are, for example, too easy a landing place for counterfeit goods. The creation of a genuine customs union is hampered by the fragmentation and heterogeneity of rules and standards that prevent the proper functioning of the European single market and put citizens and consumers at risk. In this respect, we welcome the fact that the determination of penalties is linked, where possible, to the principle of the duty evaded to ensure greater correspondence with the seriousness of the infringement. The future of the European economy will depend very much on how our continent manages to establish trade relations with other parts of the world.

I stand by the principle of subsidiarity, but I must say that in this case I believe that the adoption of legislation makes sense.  At a time when we have a single customs territory, where there is a single customs substantive law, where the Customs Code applies here, then, in my opinion, it makes sense that there should also be one adjustment to the sanctions that will apply throughout the EU. In short, a specific offence should be the same sanction throughout the EU, if possible. It is a fundamental principle of the rule of law. There should be a similar penalty for a similar offence. So that is why I support the amendment, why I agree with the idea, even though I am generally reticent about new European legislation. If we look at the concrete implementation, then I must say that the proposal put forward by the Commission is unfortunately not very good, and here, like my pre-chairmen, I commend the work of the IMCO rapporteur in particular, who I think has been able to eliminate a number of legal problems. I agree with the text that came out of the IMCO committee.

I do not think that we can talk about a customs union when we have fully harmonised legislation throughout the European Union, but the application and, whatever, the verification of compliance with customs rules and the imposition of sanctions is a matter for each state. And we now know concretely that we have differences - and big differences, not very small. This, in my view, disadvantages the small ones, small and medium-sized enterprises, first and foremost. The same formalities, the same documents are completed, the economic operator must take the same steps, but when it goes through one customs or another, the penalty is different if at a check things are not right. That is why I support the principle of taking action aimed at leading to a certain level of alignment in the twenty-eight States, because that is why we have a single market, to have procedures, sure, national, but to harmonise the level of penalties for customs infringements.  I believe that this provides legal certainty for businesses and could create a fairer conditions that encourage businesses, especially SMEs, to invest in all Member States and stimulate economic growth. Personally, I have also made amendments, and I hope that this report will be voted on and we will take steps, because I do not think that we are finishing with the customs union alone with this report. And I also believe, at the same time, that the Member States must, and it is also the role of the Commission, adopt greater transparency and see better application of customs legislation.

That creates inconsistency within Member States and can generate uncertainty for businesses. I am happy with the text that we are going to vote on this week. First of all, there will be no fixed minimum sanction for minor infringements, and secondly, for both minor and serious infringements, the financial fine should be imposed as a percentage of the duties evaded.

One of the most serious and dangerous differences is precisely that, which still remains, but which we are trying to overcome, of the differences in the detection of customs infringements and then of the sanctions that each country decides to apply as it wishes. The progress we are proposing is therefore extremely important.  I would like to point out that sanctions have two positive effects. The first is the ethical one: those who make mistakes have to pay and have to pay in proportion to the mistake they make or the violation that they skilfully put in place. On the other hand, the sanction has a deterrent value: those who are oriented to hurt know that they have to pay, for this reason the direction sometimes changes.

The establishment of a legal framework for customs infringements and sanctions is essential to improve the convergence of Member States' approaches to the application of EU customs legislation.

However, I point out that in the Commission’s proposal the Member States could do whatever they wanted, so that was not clear either. In my report we do clarify that we need a harmonised approach towards the non-criminal sanctions, and we only leave room for the criminal sanctions if they need to be dissuasive. We certainly need to support the Commission in the discussions with the Council to ensure that the criminal sanctions are not used for anything else than serious infringements. Regarding the ECR’s comments: they raised the issue that the bureaucracy is a problem. Of course we agree, but don’t you think that having 28 sets of different rules is a bigger problem for the micro-businesses than to have one set of rules?

It is an important signal that nuclear non-proliferation is possible in our world. The EU strategy which followed, fully supported by my report, is about Europe fully upholding our obligations under that agreement. To do so, I support the opening of an EU delegation in Tehran and cooperation on maritime security in the Persian Gulf as a concrete step towards a new regional security structure for the whole region; setting the aim for a partnership and cooperation agreement for a bilateral investment treaty and of Iran joining the World Trade Organisation. Supporting the major deal for Airbus and efforts for banks themselves to support the lifting of sanctions; to restore our own interparliamentary dialogue with the Majlis. Colleagues, this is a balanced and inclusive report incorporating 22 compromise paragraphs from no less than 139 amendments from different Members of this Parliament. I thank the shadows, and Mr Brok in particular, for their cooperation.  On human rights: the human rights NGO Reprieve called the language of my report ‘excellent’. Human Rights Watch said: it is ‘good language’. The words ‘human rights’ actually appears 34 times in my report. By focusing on ending the death penalty for children and for all drug offenses I am supporting efforts which are already under way in Iranian society itself and that I dearly hope will actually be agreed. Those who say that my report ‘is not human rights enough’ simply impugn my own integrity and contradict the human rights organisations themselves. They knowingly imperil the leverage that we do have with Iran and make the improvements in human rights, which they say you want, less, not more, likely. They should examine your own conscience before you repeat that claim.  My report clearly called for non-interference in other countries and an end to support for armed groups. It specifically supports respect for peace and security for Israel and for Palestinians. It suggests that Europe can play a greater role in de-escalating tension between Tehran and Riyadh, and that this is the essential part of bringing to an end the terrible conflicts which afflict Iran’s neighbours. There are those in this Chamber who want greater one-sided criticism of Iran’s regional role. They say they are against proxy wars but you yourselves are acting as proxies; don’t do it. For those that are using this debate to wage these arguments, but who do so actually seeking to oppose the nuclear agreement: be honest in saying so. I will be honest with you about the consequences of the agreement’s collapse: a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, heightened security fears, undermining reformists and shifting power to hardliners here and there, a return to sanctions in which ordinary innocent people in Iran are impoverished and lose hope, a potentially fatal attack on diplomatic attempts to end suffering, death and destruction in the bloody civil wars in Syria and in Yemen. Indeed, an attack on the very principle that diplomacy and negotiated agreement itself could be successful in our troubled world. My report stands for peace, an active diplomatic role for Europe, and a belief that by identifying common interest where it exists, that it is possible to build on it. I ask for your support.

This is a timely debate falling almost precisely on the first anniversary of the adoption of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which took place on 18 October 2015. It is important to recall that day, because it was one of the milestones of the nuclear agreement and an important step in restoring trust with Iran. The implementation day which occurred a few days later, after the IAEA confirmed Iran’s compliance with its nuclear commitments, triggered the lifting of sanctions and effectively opened up the possibility to begin a new chapter in our bilateral relations. In this context, I thank Mr Richard Howitt for his work on the report on the EU strategy towards Iran after the nuclear agreement, which I see as a valuable contribution in this latest stage of the European Union’s relations with Iran. This Parliament has shown a strong interest and active support throughout the negotiations of the nuclear deal with Iran. Today, one year after the JCPOA was adopted, I also welcome the broad support you are giving to our policy of balance and incremental engagement with Iran. We believe that this approach reflects the new state of European Union-Iran relations after the nuclear deal, as the title of Parliament’s report that will be voted on tomorrow aptly points out. The European Union has played a crucial role in the context of the JCPOA. We were perceived by all sides as an honest broker throughout the whole of the negotiations, and the High Representative and her representatives were entrusted with the role of coordinator of the Joint Commission which today oversees the implementation of the agreement. This is of value in itself, and we need to fulfil this role effectively, because our interests are also at stake, in particular the sustainability of the JCPOA. Sustainability is crucial for the deal to hold, but sustainability can only be ensured if all sides properly implement the JCPOA and if the Iranian people, who strongly backed the deal, can feel its economic benefits and reconnect with the international community. The good news is that the implementation is on track. Iran has been delivering on its nuclear commitments and, since implementation day, the IAEA has issued three positive reports confirming this. But as I said, sustainability requires firm and longstanding adherence throughout the lifetime of the agreement. The European Union has delivered on all its commitments. We have lifted the agreed economic and financial nuclear-related sanctions. We have gone beyond that and conducted an extensive outreach to our economic operators, informing them about and clarifying the new regulatory framework. The initial reluctance by the financial and banking sector and wider business community to re—engage is a natural phenomenon, given that companies need to feel comfortable and confident to come back and invest in Iran again. The remaining United States primary sanctions – and we had a debate on this in July – and the poor business environment in Iran, are additional factors for hesitation. Iran also needs to do its part in terms of increasing transparency in its financial system and improving its efforts as regards anti-money laundering and counter—financing of terrorism framework and institutions. Iran’s commitment to take the necessary measures to comply with the Action Plan or the Financial Action Task Force is a step in the right direction. The European Union stands ready to share expertise with the Iranian authorities on this matter. The nuclear deal has opened the door for renewed bilateral European Union-Iran cooperation. In fact we are already using the opportunities and have started working together in some areas of mutual interest. Commissioner Stylianides is in Iran, as we speak, to address the issue of Afghan refugees and access to humanitarian relief in the countries of the region affected by conflict. Commissioner Bieńkowska was in Tehran last week with European Union business representatives and launched a European Union-Iran industrial dialogue. Just a few weeks ago, we received a high-level visit from Iran on the environment, and we agreed to launch cooperation on environmental protection. I know these are important issues for some of you. On trade-related issues, our commercial exchanges went up by 42%, compared with the same period last year. And we have also been supportive of Iran’s accession to the WTO, because we see a clear advantage in having Iran playing along with internationally-agreed rules. The European Union has established cooperation also in other areas such as energy and nuclear safety, but also in education, culture and research. Indeed, our engagement allows us to foster people-to-people contacts. The young people of Iran are Iran’s wealth, and investing in them means investing in the future of the country. We have therefore increased exchanges of students through Erasmus+ and of scientists and researchers in Horizon 2020. Let me stress again that, while we proceed with this level of engagement, we do not lose sight of the issues where we do not see eye to eye. On the contrary, engagement in areas of mutual interest allows us to open channels of communication to address areas where we have differences. Human rights remain an obvious area of concern. The high number of executions and the restrictions to civil freedoms are worrying, and regular public statements are released in this respect. This is why when we negotiated a joint statement with Iran on the future of our relations, adopted last April during the visit of the High Representative to Iran, we said very clearly that human rights have to be an integral part of it, and this is materialising. A dedicated delegation from the Iranian judiciary system will come to Brussels in early November, in the framework of the political dialogue, to hold exploratory talks on human rights. This will happen for the first time in more than 10 years. We also have differences with Iran on some regional issues where Iran’s behaviour has not changed and remains problematic. We have been clear in calling for tangible steps that can lead to more constructive regional relations, in particular in the case of Syria. High Representative Mogherini has been in regular touch with Foreign Minister Zarif on the European Union’s humanitarian initiative and with a view to laying the ground for the resumption of an inclusive and Syrian-led political process under the auspices of the United Nations.  At the same time, we need to be aware of the domestic and political scene in Iran. The situation remains polarised, and a return to a period of confrontation with the international community is still favoured by some forces. Parliament’s report on the European Union strategy towards Iran after the nuclear deal also needs to be seen in this light. It should be a contribution to our renewed balanced engagement. I should not end without mentioning the important role that parliamentary contacts can play in fostering closer relations and conveying a message on these different issues. We now have a new Majlis in Iran after the February parliamentary elections. Engagement with parliamentarians is an important complement to the official diplomatic channels. When the High Representative visited Iran in April with a group of Commissioners, she framed our future relation as the ‘Four Cs’ dialogue: comprehensive in scope; cooperative where there is mutual interest; critical when we disagree, but constructive in nature. I am glad that the current text of the European Parliament resolution is endorsing this approach.

But both the Iranian people and EU companies learned that doing business, in practice, in Iran is not only a matter of lifting sanctions, and it is not as easy as it seems. The high levels of corruption, the grey economy, as well as terror financing but also the lack of a truly private sector, with up to 70% state-controlled, make it difficult to do business, and trade and investment must of course be done according to the law and benefit the population, which has suffered enough and continues to suffer.

The main reason for this agreement is that it does not have any more nuclear-weapon states. I believe that this has been achieved, and the European Union, with Federica Mogherini and Helga Schmid, in particular has played a major role in ensuring that this has been achieved. The entire world community wants this agreement. The United Nations Security Council unanimously supported this. We should integrate into the world community on this issue so that the Non-Proliferation Pact really has credibility. If Iran gets nuclear weapons, there will be no stopping. That, I believe, is our ultimate responsibility. Moreover, this treaty can be terminated if Iran does not comply with the rules, and sanctions can be reintroduced. All of this is regulated by the Treaty, so we do not need to worry about that either. Of course, it is important that Iran also fulfils certain conditions over time. That is why I am Mr Howitt – for whom this is obviously the last report in this House because he is leaving the House. I regret that you made your decision in this way. I would have liked to continue working with you. – grateful that this report, certainly after long debates between the political groups, has now included the issues of human rights, the issues of unacceptable death, the issues of arrests, which take place for political and other reasons, the disadvantage of religious minorities. It has also been made clear that we are calling on Iran and Saudi Arabia to stop their proxy war and not to promote terrorist organisations – Hezbollah has been specifically mentioned – and also to stop the financial cycles in this area accordingly. I think it is important that it should also be made clear on this issue that Israel's security is an essential issue for us. This can certainly be strengthened. In any case, this is an important point that makes it clear that we are not abandoning our values. We do not want nuclear weapons. That's why the deal is important. We want to take advantage of the economic opportunities of this agreement, and that is what we want to work on. There are still many drawbacks that Mrs Schaake has mentioned.

The EU played an important role in this success. I trust the deal can be beneficial for all parties involved. This is significant progress for the security, stability and development of the entire region, but it still remains extremely important for it to be implemented thoroughly and in good faith by all partners as soon as possible. We should not forget that this deal goes beyond its technical details. It has already been celebrated by the Iranian people, who consider that this could represent a step forward in improving their living standards. It is essential for both sides to deliver on that. Only a successful implementation will allow us to show the benefits of multilateral diplomacy over the policy of obstructionism and confrontation. One of our main worries is the fact that, in spite of the partial lifting of sanctions, EU companies are still facing great difficulty in accessing the Iranian market. This is mostly due to the fact that many American financial sanctions are still in place and have an extraterritorial impact. As far as I am aware of them, I share some of the concerns of my colleagues towards Iran, notably the ones linked to the use of ballistic missiles and human rights abuses and violations, including the use of the death penalty in Iran. It is important to use all channels, in cooperation with the United States, to find and address at least a temporary solution to the difficulties faced by our companies. It is important to engage Iran in order to work together towards improving the environment for human rights and equally to win more regional stability and prosperity. Having said this, I will conclude with an important call on Iran to stop its interference in other countries in the region and to refrain from supporting armed groups, in particular its support for the Syrian regime, Hamas, al-Nusra and Hezbollah, and to play a more positive and constructive role in bringing back peace to the Middle East.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 43, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, reaching an agreement with Iran last summer regarding its nuclear ambitions was a major diplomatic success for the European Union and US foreign—policy interests. The combined sanctions regime proved very effective in putting pressure on the economy and resulted in bringing the Tehran regime, and its electorate, to the conclusion that the country needed to reform and a government that was willing to be able to engage with the West and negotiate a deal. The Iranian Government is not one that we in Europe share common values with. I too condemn its atrocious human rights abuses, including internationally banned juvenile executions, its sectarian politics, its development of a ballistic missile system, its interventionist regional policies in Syria, Yemen, Bahrain and Lebanon that are often counterproductive. These are differences that we should and will continue to voice our disapproval of and to argue that the peoples of Iran deserve and are capable of better. Such concerns, however, should not dictate a policy of total disengagement. The negotiations were a final attempt to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and in turn hastening an inevitable nuclear arms race in the Persian Gulf region, without the use of force. Many have argued that a military solution was, and remains, the one and only solution in the long term. The military experts have made it clear that such a policy would be hugely difficult to achieve without paying a huge personal price. This is nothing to say of the subsequent fallout which, I have no doubt, would be very damaging politically in an already volatile region. This deal is only welcomed as a pragmatic one and its rejection would play right into the hands of regime hardliners. It does not mean that we have reached the end of the road. Close scrutiny that the terms are being adhered to and the will to reimpose sanctions at the slightest of violations are of utmost importance. It is unknown where this deal will take us over the next decade but I personally remain hopeful that it can build trust and allow time for a new political landscape to develop from that ancient Persian culture and to emerge from that.

Our Group welcomes the successful lead by the High Representative/Vice President and her team – consisting mostly of females – and the success of EU common diplomacy and international cooperation at times when this is more necessary but most rare. I have shared my thoughts on trade and investment and the possibilities offered when the deal is implemented. So now let us focus with equal resolve on the many remaining problems in our relationship: human rights and fundamental freedoms, from the high levels of executions – even of minors – to the torture in Iran’s notorious prisons. Witness the lack of a fair trial for suspects and the general absence of equal rights for women, ethnic and religious minorities, and LGTBIs – and the list goes on, extending to the lack of free expression for journalists, academics, artists, people in general and politicians with critical views. Instead of making the lives of Iranian people better, the regime spends billions on supporting the Assad regime in its cowardice, murder and bombing of innocent people.  Focusing on our shared objective of fighting Daesh cannot hide the real differences between us. The EU lists the military wing of Hezbollah as a terror group; Iran supports it.  President, excuse me, it’s my understanding that I have 2.5 minutes. Am I wrong?  Thank you, President.  The EU lists the military wing of Hezbollah as a terror group. Iran supports it. The emphasis on these key topics was lacking in the report, and we found it important to strongly and unequivocally condemn human rights violations and the damaging role that the Islamic Republic plays in the region.  Now this is not, Mr Howitt, an attack on the nuclear deal, its implementation or you personally. It is merely a matter of differences of opinion and priorities, which I think is entirely normal in a democracy.  My Group calls on Iran to be a part of the solution to the war in Syria and – as we are also asking of Saudi Arabia – to halt interference in the affairs of neighbouring partners,  recognise Israel and stop denying the Holocaust. We should work together where possible on the basis of clear benchmarks, and we need an EU delegation on the ground.  Our Group sees opportunity to cooperate on environmental protection, on which what little civil society remains in Iran is bravely pushing for more action. We believe that people-to-people contact through exchanges is key, but people must be able to return safely to Iran when they have dual nationality. People-to-people connections also take place online. Therefore, the emergence of a free and open Internet in Iran, one that is not nationally and centrally monitored and censored, is key for young people likewise to come out of isolation.  I want to stress that it is time for a real step out of the dark, out of isolation, and that includes free and fair elections.

We expect Iran to make constructive use of its important role, not only in the Middle East but globally, contributing to peace, stability and development. In this respect, Iran's involvement in resolving conflicts and political crises is necessary and constantly judged.  The European Union must develop with Iran an open, honest, ambitious, multi-level, cross-sectoral dialogue in a climate of building mutual trust and respect, on the basis of an assessment of common interests and differences, in a way that benefits both the Iranian people and the peoples of Europe.

We have a duty to put at the heart of our dialogue and cooperation issues relating to the security and well-being of our peoples, to deepen an honest and productive dialogue on human rights, to support efforts for greater control over arms trafficking, legal and non-legal, in order to put an end to the increasing militarisation of the region.

The report is a U-turn in politics: away from a policy of isolation, towards a policy of dialogue and rapprochement. The nuclear agreement is a glimmer of hope for many Iranians who are eagerly awaiting the opening of their country and, above all, for an improvement in their social, social and economic situation.  I should simply remind you that there is high unemployment in Iran and that parts of the population are living in a very poor economic situation. It is often said to me that improving these things is the sole responsibility of the respective governments. I do not have this opinion, because we know from our own history that political dialogue and the resulting practical and economic cooperation can deliver much better results than a policy of isolation. The Iranian Government has shown, by concluding and complying with this agreement, that it is willing to cooperate with us. As it turned out in a conversation with the Deputy Foreign Minister, it has taken Iran a great deal of overcoming to accept those parts of the nuclear treaty that do not relate to the military use of nuclear energy, but to commercial use. Here, too, the Iranian Government has given in and complied with our demands.  Now it is our turn. We must recognise and promote what is reflected in Iran in positive and somewhat more liberal development. Nevertheless, it is clear that we are far from having ideal conditions in Iran itself. That is why the report has a whole series of demands which are very clear, very clear. I would just like to pick out some of the things that are particularly important to me personally.  We call for the release as soon as possible of all political prisoners, especially, of course, those who have dual citizenship. We call for respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and, above all, for international labour, social and environmental standards. This is something that social standards in particular are often not respected, which must be emphasised. We call on the Iranian judiciary to ensure the right to fair and due trial. We call for environmental protection and the promotion of environmentally sustainable development, including, if possible, European cooperation. In this context, I would like to draw attention to the environmental disaster around Lake Urmia, a disaster that has an impact far beyond Iran's borders. Then, as has been mentioned many times, we call on Iran to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty. Iran is the country with the highest rate of executions in the world, in terms of population.

Whilst the full repercussions of the nuclear agreement, as well as whether all sides can stick to it, remain to be seen, what is beyond doubt is that the agreement gives us further grounds to continue dialogue and continue building up mutual trust and respect.  If this is to prove fruitful, it must be done through existing international institutions and multilateral and bilateral dialogue. In this report, however, I must especially  question its aim of an EU strategy. Once again the EU is showing its immaturity when it comes to diplomacy. I believe that the too much, too quickly approach taken in this report may actually prove to be counterproductive in the long term. As we all know, trust can take decades to build but be broken far more quickly.  I believe that the comments in this report on Syria are pointless. Middle Eastern diplomacy is – to make an obvious understatement – complex, with the multifaceted interests of major players globally and regionally. All parties represent legitimate national concerns, and it is only by coming to a reasonable accommodation that a lasting peace can be found. In short, I would suggest that we build slowly on the success of the dialogue before the nuclear deal. Let us agree where we can agree and agree to discuss differences where we can. However, whilst my own concerns over the Iranian stance towards Israel remain relevant and topical in this context, let us not pressure Iran with an all-encompassing agreement that we know would be doomed to failure.

Madam President, there is no doubt that the European Union's agreement with Iran on the country's nuclear programme is a major success of the European Union's foreign policy and has freed up the scope of cooperation between the two sides in various areas. Iran is the second largest economic power in the Middle East and a major player in the energy trade because it is the second country in the world in natural gas reserves and the fourth in oil. Consequently, the European Union's cooperation with Iran in various fields, such as trade, industry and energy, is in the interests of the countries of the European Union, so that they do not depend on a supplier in the energy sector.  From a political point of view this agreement is important and has been reached, because, at last, the European Union has decided to differentiate itself in foreign policy from that of the United States. Thus, after the nuclear agreement, it lifted sanctions against Iran, which the United States did not do, so that, in conjunction with the fact that trade with Iran takes place in dollars, there is a problem in the European Union's trade with Iran to be done in euros.

The good news was not just the \"deal\" itself, but the implementation process, which was a process of building trust between partners. The merit of the External Action Service is undisputed. All the knowledge I have accumulated as head of the Delegation for Iran in the European Parliament tells me that there is no better way to support the forces that we call reformers than to open Iran up to the world and cooperate in as wide a field as possible. There is no better option. This is also attested to by the new composition of the 'match list', that is to say, the European Parliament, which was formed after the agreement was concluded. Now it is important that the average person, \"man in the street\", in Tehran will feel the effects of this opening in his living standards.  Of course, it is not easy to find a point of balance between geopolitical, economic and defence interests of values that we will never give up. Mr Howitt's report is a search for this balance. It points to the fields of cooperation – that is, the economy with the name of the bottleneck, which is banking services, environmental protection, energy, the fight against drug smuggling – but it also speaks of differences and calls them by name: the number of death sentences, the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, Iran's unsatisfactory role as a stabiliser of the region.

A position of the European Parliament that supports the valuable work of the High Representative Federica Mogherini who defined the nuclear agreement, of which this report is somehow the daughter, a sign of hope for the world at a time when hope seems to be in crisis. That agreement is based on respect for the rules that must be closely monitored. But that is not enough, we must now create a climate of mutual trust between Iran and the European Union. Relations must be developed through a dialogue at several levels involving political, diplomatic, economic, academic, technical and interpersonal contacts, including civil society actors, NGOs and human rights defenders. A dialogue, it was said, wide-ranging, open, frank, critical, when necessary. We have common economic interests, I am thinking in particular of the fight against climate change. Iran ranks second in the world for gas reserves, fourth for oil. Energy cooperation can play a significant role in diversifying sources of supply for the European Union. The Eu ropean Union can support Iran in its various environmental challenges, including water scarcity and the fight against desertification.  We invest confidently in young Europeans and Iranians to bring societies and cultures closer together, increasing exchanges between students and researchers. Finally, I would like to read out the European Parliament's call in the report: 'calls on Iran to respect, protect and comply with its commitments under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, respecting freedom of expression, opinion, association, thought and freedom of expression. , of conscience, religion without ethnic or social discrimination or sexual orientation\".

I do not intend to give my approval to a report if it can be used in the hands of a theocratic regime in Iran and become a propaganda tool.  We have been negotiating the nuclear agreement for years and in the meantime we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of executions in Iran. According to the United Nations, some 1 000 people were hanged last year alone. That's the highest number of executions per capita in the world.  Iran is also the record holder in the number of executions of minors. Yes, under pressure from the European Union's tough sanctions, Iran was forced to scale back its nuclear ambitions and accept the nuclear agreement, which is necessary. But let's not be naïve. This does not mean that we are now suddenly faced with a more moderate regime. The daily reality proves otherwise.  An example? The same officials who executed 30 000 political prisoners in 1988, and thus committed one of the most serious crimes against humanity, still occupy top positions in the current regime. One is the current Minister of Justice. He even recently stated that he is proud of the role he played in the massacre!  We also see Iran's destructive role in the region's conflicts. Iran provides the financial resources, the weapons and the militiamen for its proxy wars in Syria, in Iraq, in Yemen, in Lebanon and elsewhere.

With the lifting of economic and financial sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme, Europe has sought to seize the opportunities that a market of 80 million people represents, even if it has to turn a blind eye to the constant human rights violations of the dictatorial regime of the Ayatolas.  But if it is true that Europe does everything to benefit from these opportunities, it is no less true that the expansion of institutional and trade relations must be strictly conditional on iran's progress in the field of human rights.  I therefore believe that the motion for a resolution on Iran which was voted this month by the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament does not reflect this conditionality and maintains an unacceptable business stance as usual in the face of an oppressive regime that systematically manipulates the democratic process, holds a sad record of human rights violations, is the world leader in per capita executions and under-18s , and is a repressive of women and religious minorities.  For all this, Mr Howitt, I believe that it is our duty to make this resolution not a mere instrument of political propaganda for the theocratic regime in Tehran, which, as a regime that needs this level of violence to repress its own citizens, shows great weaknesses in order to become a genuine credible and reliable diplomatic and economic partner for the European Union.

It must be understood that this is not just about nuclear weapons. As we increase cooperation, we must consistently demand respect for human rights. Cooperation will only benefit everyone if it is done from the right starting points. We must not abandon the Iranian people in order to enter the country's huge market. Not even if some other countries act differently. Money must not take precedence over democracy and human rights.  We must remember that the power of religious ultra-conservatives is cemented in the Iranian system and democratic reforms cannot be pushed through without its approval.

I understand that in politics it is sometimes necessary to show goodwill despite reservations, but even then we must not cross the red line that separates politics and diplomacy from faceless cynicism. That line is called human dignity. A state that does not respect human dignity can hardly become a trusted partner.

A first, to congratulate me on the signing of this agreement. This action plan may represent a very important milestone on the road to the political stabilization of a region that has been marked by instability and also by the existence of numerous conflicts that insist on maintaining and causing a high level of suffering to various peoples of this broad territory. Secondly, I would like to remind all those who reject gradual approaches, in which change and solidarity are being built step by step and to the extent of concrete achievements and the establishment of bonds of trust, understanding and mutual acceptance, that our European Union was designed exactly in this way by the founding fathers, stating this very well Robert Schuman in his well-known statement. And that is why i believe that change operates more easily, more quickly and more solidly through approximation and not through blind conditionality, pure imposition, absolute denial of paternalism and cultural prejudices, which I generally agree with the position adopted by the AFET Commission. Before I finish, I would like to stress that there are universal principles on which we cannot compromise and the death penalty is one of them. I have made several amendments to this effect and that is why I insist in plenary, although it is already written in the resolution, asking once again to iranian officials to, as a demonstration of their commitment to this rapprochement between our peoples, immediately impose a moratorium on the execution of death sentences in their country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Adam Szejnfeld (PPE).", "mepid": "124890", "text": "   – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by We are discussing a report today which deals with a very difficult issue. On the one hand, of course, it is the result of an agreement with Iran signed a year ago in Vienna, with the result that we are eliminating, I hope, one of the countries that can possess nuclear weapons and threaten others.  On the other hand, this agreement – and a lot of time has been devoted to it – offers an opportunity to increase economic cooperation between the European Union and Iran. This is extremely important for both sides, including the Iranian people and the peoples of our Member States. Both need to diversify energy sources: gas, oil. This agreement offers great opportunities for mutual investment, which may go not in the hundreds of billions of euros, but even in trillions. On the other hand, there are values that are more important than economic development and even than new jobs, and peace is undoubtedly the highest value. However, Iran is not a country that has so far created security, on the contrary, it has been a country that has threatened security in the region and in the world.  I therefore believe that it is necessary to pursue this agreement and to increase economic exchanges, trade, investment, but also to examine the state of implementation on the Iranian side.

Iran has joined the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, under which it has the obligation to stop the execution of juvenile offenders. So this is what it must do: stop executing children. Iran also has to release all political prisoners and others that are unjustly detained. The harassment of journalists and the prosecution of Iranian dual nationals has to stop. It is important to guarantee access to fair trial, access to a lawyer and that there will be an end to the systematic torture in prisons. The abolition of the death penalty is a key objective of EU human rights and foreign policy, and we cannot forget that in our relations with Iran. Iran has an important influence in the region, so it can – and should – play a stabilising role in the region.

The European External Action Service must work productively, with a view to fully restoring relations, impartially and solely in the interests of citizens. It must emphasise the priorities for public and small and medium-sized enterprises, not only in the energy sector but also in other sectors. In particular, the possibilities for cooperation in the construction sector need to be considered, because Iran is a country with rapid growth, while, on the other hand, in countries such as Greece, it is the construction industry that has been hardest hit by the economic crisis and austerity policies.

I appreciate it. Thank you to Mr Buchner and others who have mentioned the issue of dual nationals.

To my friends in the ALDE Group and with greatest respect to Ms Schaake, you say you support the nuclear agreement and the High Representative, yet you submit amendments that you know will undermine it. You have even rejected the compromise that I have offered you on the Holocaust, and you should think again about that.  You say that my report is lacking on human rights and on ending support for Hezbollah. There are 34 references to human rights. In reality, is there any number which would be high enough for you? Ending support for Hezbollah is there in paragraph 34. You cite free and fair elections, the justice system and the treatment of women, yet it is all there: paragraphs 39, 46 and 49. The truth is that I believe you are against the agreement and, if your Group votes against the report, I have to say that I believe it is you who are being illiberal, not me. To Mr Preda, my report is strictly balanced in seeking to reject sectarianism and to support reconciliation between Tehran and Riyadh. For you to suggest that my Group is itself sectarian is beneath you. As fellow direct colleagues in this Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, you know that I support human rights benchmarks, but choose to say otherwise. Look at my support for a return to a human rights dialogue and also for assessing investment according to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. When Mr Adaktusson says that my original draft did not have human rights at all – it is just wholly false. I have asked you to examine your consciences and you should do so before saying that. To Mr Belder, sovereignty for Israel as well as other countries in the Middle East is there – in paragraphs 34 and 35 – and you should remember that I personally was author of the written declaration on responsibility for the Holocaust. To many Members, I am interested in how often the words ‘propaganda for a theocratic regime’ have been repeated across this debate. It does point to the lobbying interest behind many of the criticisms aired. To my friend, Ms Ries, the step-by-step process I describe in paragraph 4 is hardly what you called normalisation.  Mr Kelam paid me a compliment, for which I thank him, but he and others who referred to ISIS-Daesh must recognise that they are just as much an enemy of Iran as to us. To Mr Ruas and all who referred to the death penalty, I reiterate that my report clearly states that Iran has the highest per capita execution rate, that we oppose the death penalty and call for an immediate moratorium. I understand that you want to be associated with these calls, but this report hardly needs amendment to achieve them.  Finally, I remember sitting in an Embassy of a Member State in the Middle East, being told that the bombing of Iran was more likely than not. Another Middle East war with all the consequences. European diplomacy has helped avert that terrible fate and we should be very careful in this Parliament about acting irresponsibly in a way that could jeopardise it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is taking a significant step forward today. In order to combat the spread of corruption and organised crime effectively, a debate had to be established at European level aimed at introducing common laws and law enforcement measures in all Member States. This Europe has, in fact, been seriously to blame: it has relegated the fight against corruption and organised crime, including mafia-style crime, to strictly national borders. The lack of awareness of the transnational scope of this phenomenon has thus guaranteed easy play for the Mafia and, more generally, for criminal organisations which, also using corruption, have identified new businesses by infiltrating the management of migrant reception centres or by hoarding tenders financed from European funds or investing in the main financial centres, thus benefiting from the lack of recognition of the danger of the phenomenon of associations in some Member States.  All this requires urgent and incisive regulatory action at European level to stop the spread of criminal organisations on the continent, to combat the crimes most commonly committed by mafias and to prevent associations from infiltrating the legal economy. The European Parliament is playing its part with great commitment and conviction, amid a thousand difficulties that arise above all from cultural and legal differences, from existing prejudices against the different forms of criminal organisations rooted in the Member States. During the last parliamentary term, the path we are completing today was opened up, not only to introduce a common concept of a crime of association with mafia-type crimes, but above all to adopt a shared and effective strategy to combat organised crime, corruption and money laundering.  The hope is that the other European institutions will also fully understand the real danger of these now transnational phenomena, that they will not only focus on fine crime but that they will become aware of the danger that comes from membership of the association. These phenomena do not only affect the legal economy, but affect the entire civil coexistence on which the European Union is founded.  Ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and for the interesting and productive discussions that have taken place throughout the meetings. Allow me also to thank the European Parliament's Research Centre for its study of the costs of the European Union's failure to act in the fight against corruption and organised crime, which has been instrumental in finding us some ideas and objective bases for the drafting of this report. Thanks go to Eurojust, which replied to the questionnaire we sent by providing us with important information on how to improve cooperation and the exchange of information between Member States. Another thanks goes to Europol for the many comparisons that have taken place and for the valuable information it has provided, in particular on the more practical aspects of coordination between the different procedures of the individual countries and on how to overcome the difficulties encountered. Thanks go to the European Commission, which has always been available for discussions and debates on the fight against corruption and organised crime.  Thanks go to those citizens who contributed to the drafting of the report on the Internet and in particular on the Rousseau portal of the 5 Star Movement, thus taking an interest in the first person and providing us with important suggestions. I would also like to thank all my fellow Members who have tabled many amendments to the report, which also proves that the subject is extremely much felt at transnational level and is not a national phenomenon.

A prime example is Greece. Multinationals operating in the country manage to avoid paying taxes, resort to tax havens such as Luxembourg, while at the same time small and medium-sized enterprises close one after the other, since lenders now impose unbearable taxation.  In addition, OLAF's role should be redefined in order to make tax evasion and avoidance more effective and to be hit.

It was a source of inspiration for the Commission’s European agenda on security last year. The Agenda on Security identifies three priorities: the fight against terrorism and radicalisation, the fight against organised crime, and the fight against cybercrime. We must continue to move ahead on all three priorities of the Agenda on Security, and your report points up some of the key actions. The Commission, together with Parliament and the Council, have made significant progress on key files relevant for the important areas covered by the report. To name but a few: the adoption of the European Union PNR Directive and adoption of the new European Union Data Protection Package in April earlier this year; the new Europol regulation adopted in May; and the new CEPOL regulation providing for better opportunities to train law enforcement that entered into force in July 2016. Good progress has been made on the Commission’s proposal of last year for a directive on combatting terrorism, and we should be able to reach an agreement before the end of this year. The Action Plan on Wildlife Trafficking adopted in February this year and, last but not least, advancing negotiations on a European Public Prosecutor’s Office to defend the financial interests of the European Union, which will enable Eurojust to focus on the fight against terrorist threats or other serious organised crimes. There is not enough time to comment on each recommendation of the report at hand. Therefore, let me stress the ongoing and planned work in support of some of them. On money laundering: the fight against terrorist financing and money laundering is a high priority for the Commission. A new proposal to reinforce the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive was tabled on 5 July 2016. As announced in the Action Plan on Strengthening the Fight against Terrorist Financing, we would propose by the end of the year a number of legislative proposals, such as a proposal for a directive on criminal offences and sanctions for money laundering, a proposal on illegal cash movement, a proposal on mutual recognition of confiscation and freezing orders of criminal assets to ensure efficient cross-border cooperation. On the links between organised crime and terrorism, the Commission Action Plan on Terrorist Financing, adopted on 2 February 2016, acknowledges the close link between terrorist financing and organised crime. It announces a wide range of measures to cut terrorists off from their sources of revenue and to trace them through financial activities. On the call for the European Union framework on corruption, the Commission takes very seriously the fight against corruption and will continue to work with Member States’ authorities, including on experience-sharing in relation to integrity policies. This goes in parallel with our work in the framework of the European Semester of Economic Governance. At this stage the Commission is working with Member States to follow up and take forward the conclusions of the first anti—corruption report and will inform Parliament by the end of the year how the Commission sees this work progressing.

Criminal organisations often have a lot of money at their disposal, which they can channel, for example, towards funding election campaigns by prominent politicians. If the same donors often act as donors to the election campaigns of the same politicians, there will automatically be a debt of gratitude to the recipients of the money towards their supporters. Election campaign funders may expect back favors from the political parties they support and the candidates they have passed. In return, the services may be the preparation of preferred legislation, sectoral tax breaks, effective town planes, special interests, the best trading venues, etc. It is therefore very important that all political election funding is as transparent as possible.  In Finland, the Electoral Finance Act was reformed a few years ago. It did not become complete, as numerous major election campaigns are still completely in the dark. For example, only the 13 elected MEPs and the 7 candidates remaining in the reserve are submitted to the authorities of the election funding notification for the 2014 European Elections. In Finland, this means that of the 251 candidates, only 20 submit an election funding declaration. At the same time, large-time election campaigns are completely obscured by the publicity, in which, according to press reports, more than EUR 100 000 is spent. As a rule, the financiers of election campaigns remain a secret. The same problem also applies to parliamentary elections. In this context, it should be borne in mind that candidates with long political careers usually stand as candidates in the European Parliament and parliamentary elections.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank in particular the shadow rapporteurs who accompanied me on this report, their assistants and advisers to the groups, as well as Marion, my own colleague, without whom this report could not have been done. We have been working on it for almost a year, their support has been invaluable to me despite the vicissitudes we have been through, the worst of which has been what I would call the test of languages. In the DROI sub-committee, translations are partly entrusted to external services, which must be relatively expensive; we should expect a service that has been up to the task. But it was a horror. We discovered that some of them were automatic translations. That is why, Mr President, I urge the ad hoc bodies of the European Parliament to investigate this matter.  This report deals with human rights and migration in third countries and therefore does not deal with eu migration policies. Our Parliament has reported on this subject, that of Mrs Metsola and Mrs Kyenge, which was adopted by a large majority, and is drawing up another report on external policies. We therefore focused on the situation in third countries, with the desire to put migration in its global context.  The report highlights the evolution of migration policies, which are increasingly globalised but also regionalised, and their increasingly complex and complex causes: 244 million international migrants, or 3.3% of the world's population compared to 2.9% in 1990; 80% of movements are now taking place between countries with common borders, and increasingly South-South. Most of the world's countries today are countries of origin, transit and destination, including in Europe. These migrations are increasingly affecting women and children, particularly isolated minors and, therefore, vulnerable people who are entitled to special protection on the increasingly dangerous migration routes. They are also increasingly graduates: already 59 million in 2010, and Africa is paying the heaviest price for this brain drain. The issue of refugees has a special place in this report. The number of uprooted, refugee and displaced persons now stands at 65 million according to the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, with a 10% increase in one year, mainly in the number of displaced people.  In our proposals, we wanted to start from respect for human rights, as they are recognised and protected by international conventions, and to see how the European Union, in its policies of partnership with third countries, can act for better respect for human rights, including by setting an example on its territory and by enforcing ad hoc international conventions.  The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Family Members has not been signed by any EU Member State. All migrants have rights, regardless of their situation, as the UN Special Rapporteur on Migrants regularly says. Leaving respect for human rights means, for example, refusing forced readmissions of migrants to countries where they are at risk of ill-treatment and torture; refuse collective expulsions and refoulements that are contrary to international law; respect the right to family reunification and the right to leave a country, including its own, and to be able to return to it in all countries of the world.  These are just a few examples. Such a wish may seem wishful thinking. Some here say that this report would be too progressive. We have taken the majority of the view in the Committee on Foreign Affairs that the European Union should do more in this area, working with its main partners to implement legislation that respects the rights of migrants, starting with the right to asylum.  It seems to us that the IEDDH is a good instrument for moving forward and that it is time to adopt specific guidelines for migrants' rights. We all know that migration issues are becoming increasingly important in the European Union's dialogues with third countries. We also know that a growing proportion of these policies are beyond The control of Parliament. This is why this report proposes, among other things, to evaluate and monitor all agreements and funds in this area, starting with the EU-Turkey agreement and the Khartoum and Rabat processes. Many other topics are covered in this report, I cannot elaborate on them and I regret it.

It is essential to improve the exchange of good practice with third countries by providing training for humanitarian workers, so that they can more effectively identify the peculiarities, backgrounds and various experiences of migrants, in particular the most vulnerable.

That is why the ineffective and unfair Dublin III rules must be changed here and now.

No state or organisation can escape from its obligations under international human rights law to protect and ensure respect for the human rights of migrants, irrespective of their status. We live in a world of seven billion people, with dramatic demographic imbalances, where inequalities are still growing. Migration is here to stay. Migration is the new normal and is now an integral part of our political dialogue with partners, very much in line with the global strategy.  It took a while before Europe accepted its responsibilities, but we are finally doing so. Since 2015 our vessels have saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the Mediterranean. Operation Sophia is disrupting the traffickers’ networks and bringing the smugglers to justice.  In Turkey, in Lebanon and in Jordan we are helping over half a million Syrian children go back to school. The protection of the most vulnerable – the women and children – is at the core of our action in each and every initiative we take. We remain the largest development donor and humanitarian actor. We are, despite criticism, leading by example.  Faced with so much human suffering, we need to respond and we are responding. But we know there is no quick fix to the issue of migration. Our new Partnership Framework (PF) approach reflects just this fact. It is an ambitious and innovative comprehensive approach, fully embedding migration in our overall foreign policy. It is not, as some wrongly believe, only about return or readmission. It is also about countering migrant smuggling and, not least, addressing the root causes of migration. The approach, being tailor-made and holistic, uses all our high-level instruments and leverage to achieve our goals. In fact it represents a new methodology based on genuine partnership.  The partnership addresses everything from security, return, readmission, resilience and job creation to infrastructure, investments and border management. First of all the PF approach, well received by our partners, has created a positive momentum in our dialogue with the countries in question. They do not see it either as us imposing a unilateral agenda; they do not see it as return becoming the only objective of our cooperation; and, rightly so, because the PF approach is indeed about mutually beneficial partnership and it marks a new way of engaging with our partner countries. The results we see are twofold, both in terms of better understanding European Union priorities and willingness to cooperate in practice and in terms of the specific tangible outcomes as you will have seen in the report of the EUCO.  Of course we do not operate in a political vacuum and European Union action must be seen as part of the bigger picture. The United Nations migration-related events during the UN General Assembly gave high visibility and great political momentum to the migration dossier. The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted at the United Nations Summit on 19 September 2016 by all 193 United Nations Member States, forms an important step in providing for a global political framework to address large movements of refugees and migrants in all aspects. We are pleased to see the notion of responsibility-sharing and the importance of international cooperation in response to migration and refugee flows reflected in the outcome. The establishment of a global compact for refugees and a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration in the coming two years will be an important next step in moving this important agenda forward. The outcome documents closely reflect the European Union priorities and policies. We reaffirm our commitment to ensuring effective implementation of the political declaration and reaffirm our engagement in the upcoming negotiation of the global compact for migration, to be concluded by 2018.  The European Union was able to transmit a positive narrative and show in New York that it has done more than anyone else to address migratory challenges, as well as to demonstrate its commitment towards the principle of global responsibility-sharing through the partnership framework approach, supported by the new innovative European External Investment Plan. We shall now capitalise on this positive momentum and continue to show a strong, united European Union position also in the follow-up and the shaping of the future two global United Nations compacts. All Member States therein also expressed their intention to expand the number and ranges of legal powers available for refugees to be admitted to or resettled in their territory. The Union Resettlement Framework the Commission proposed could facilitate this. This is about developing a harmonised approach to resettlement at European Union level, to provide safe pathways to Europe for people in need of protection, replacing irregular and dangerous migrant crossings and preventing the smugglers from taking advantage of the most vulnerable.  The contributions of each Member State under the annual Union resettlement plan will depend on Member States’ contribution and engagement in the committee. We need the full support of Member States on this. We also need a robust asylum system that will be able to face, not only the challenges of today, but also those in the years to come. Keeping the status quo of our asylum system was not an option. The Commission has put all the elements on the table to reform it. Now it is time for the co-legislators to show their commitment to finding a long-term sustainable solution. The inclusion of migration in the recently adopted 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda is therefore an important milestone. In this context the European Union continues to promote a development-oriented approach towards forced displacement. We want to increase the self-reliance and resilience of refugees in their host communities with the aim of ending dependence on humanitarian aid. Facilitating migration and improving migration policies, as called for in the 2013 Sustainable Development Goals, will allow livelihoods to be improved and will enhance access for refugees to education, job markets, health and housing.  As set out in the European Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019 and in line with the global approach to migration and mobility in the European Agenda on Migration, the European Union and its Member States are committed to enhancing human rights safeguards in all migration and mobility dialogues and cooperation frameworks with third countries and migration-related agreements, processes and programmes.  In line with the European Union Action Plan, the European Union also continues to address the issue of statelessness in relations with priority countries, namely speaking out on situations of statelessness that manifest an immediate and human rights problem and supports the UNHCR’s mandate and activities. Migration and the fight against terrorism remain overwhelmingly the main priorities for European Union action, as confirmed at the informal GAC of 24-25 July this year.  The updated European Union Syria/Iraq regional strategy includes important projects in the fields of humanitarian aid, resilience and stabilisation. It calls for the respect of human rights and accountability, peace-building, gender and minority issues and condemns violations of international humanitarian law, the atrocities, killings and human rights abuses that Daesh is perpetrating.  Within the Gender Action Plan GAP II in European Union external relations for the period 2016-2020, gender is placed at the centre of all forms of European Union external relations. It commits the European Union to implementing actions ensuring girls’ and women’s physical and psychological integrity, promoting their economic and social rights. Together with like-minded partners, the European Union will work for the elimination of all forms of violence against women, including sexual and gender-based violence in conflict and for ending impunity. All perpetrators must be brought to justice. As Ms Vergiat rightly pointed out, access to effective remedies for victims of migration-related human rights abuses is an issue on which further progress is still required. In this context, I would like to point out that the right to effective remedy is one of the issues dealt with in the new regulation on the European Border and Coast Guard. This regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Articles 2 and 3 of the TEU and reflected in the Charter. In particular, it seeks to ensure full respect for human dignity, liberty and security. Return of irregular migrants who do not have the right to stay in the European Union to their home countries in full respect of the principle of non-refoulement is an essential part of the European Union’s comprehensive efforts to address migration.  In the implementation of the European Union Action Plan on return, the European Union seeks to be compliant with international human rights standards, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol.  A holistic approach to migration and the cross-cutting principle of non-discrimination are the conditions for the effective respect of the human rights of migrants. Our community needs to be based on integration and diversity and on the inclusion of social, cultural, linguistic and religious minorities. Xenophobia, discrimination, violence and hate speech have no place. Let me thank the honourable Members once again for this important contribution to the debate on human rights and migration in third countries and for your excellent report.

Thus, the rapporteur actually calls for the EU to invite as many migrants to its territories as it wants to come here, and to provide them with social care, education and work.  The ECR Group cannot sign off on such prudence.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, with this report, the European Parliament is called upon to take a position on an urgent issue and to initiate a regulatory process leading to concrete and effective responses in this area. The issue of corporate responsibility for serious human rights violations in third countries, still governed by ineffective rules, touches on many of the many fundamental human rights, such as the protection of health and the environment or the rights of workers, children and women.  One of the main objectives we have set ourselves in this report is to ensure that urgent, coherent, continuous and effective action is taken at all levels, effectively addressing the legal problems arising from the multinational dimension of companies and their work. This is due, among other things, to the frequent uncertainty about the allocation of responsibility for human rights violations, and it is precisely from this that impunity for the perpetrators of these violations all too often descends. The report that I am presenting to the House today and which has seen me engaged over the last year is calling loudly for the introduction of binding rules that reaffirm the duty of companies to respect human rights everywhere and in any case. It calls for the introduction of rules reaffirming the obligation for States to protect, within their own jurisdiction, natural persons who have suffered or may suffer human rights violations, even when they are carried out outside their territory. We therefore call on the Member States to establish clear rules to ensure that companies domiciled on their territory, which in any case operate within their jurisdiction, respect human rights in all their activities and in every country and context in which they operate.  We strongly reiterate that, where serious human rights violations are complained of, Member States must guarantee victims access to effective redress, as called for several times by all NGOs and all representatives of civil and academic society that we have involved during the preparatory phase of the report. We also call for the creation of minimum criminal rules defining cases and sanctions for cases of human rights violations by companies with a transnational dimension. Finally, I would like to highlight one of the many measures at no cost, but extremely effective, proposed in the report signed by me. I am referring to the creation of a European 'abuse free' label which could represent a major change in corporate culture. A trade mark granted to undertakings which voluntarily request it and which therefore decide to undergo effective and stringent controls carried out by independent bodies. In this way, consumers will be able to make a conscious choice.  All these issues have been the focus of a long, constructive and passionate debate between the political parties. I am proud that a report on a potentially divisive subject was adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Almost unanimously. In this regard, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs once again for their valuable contribution and for their willingness in recent months to participate in the drafting of a good parliamentary report on such an important subject.  Finally, I would like to thank all the activists of the 5-star Movement for all the citizens who wanted to participate in the drafting of this report. Thanks to the Rousseau operating system, a system that allows members to participate in political life on the net, many citizens have had the opportunity to get to know this draft report and to express their opinion. All their comments received have been carefully examined and some of them have been transformed into amendments signed by me and have been incorporated into the text voted on in committee. It is direct democracy, the citizen who becomes an institution and participates in the construction of a law or an own-initiative report.

More and more companies are moving their factories to third countries, taking advantage of cheap labour and non-existent labour rights. Respect for human rights is a moral duty and legal obligation of companies and their management, regardless of their place of activity. There are few phenomena where international companies pride themselves on so-called corporate social responsibility, while at the same time profiting from low operating costs due to the exploitation of child labour.  The protection of human rights must be a priority for all Member States and the Union. However, we note that, despite the communication from the Committee on Corporate Social Responsibility since 2011, several Member States have not yet established national policy frameworks to promote corporate responsibility or published their plans for business and human rights. If the European Union wants more corporate responsibility, it must stop maintaining corporate irresponsibility and hide behind its finger.

As the Council Conclusions of June 2016 show, business and human rights is a priority for the European Union. This year the Council also adopted Conclusions on Responsible Global Value Chains. As set out in the European Union Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2015 – 2019, the European Union’s Member States are committed to make an advance on business and human rights. Corporate respect for human rights is indispensable. As you do in your report, we consistently call on all business enterprises, both transnational and domestic, to integrate human rights due diligence into their operations, to better identify, prevent, and mitigate human rights risks. The European Union supports the United Nations Guiding Principles. The proper implementation is good for the European Union and good for business. The European Union Member States have taken the lead internationally on developing and adopting national action plans to implement the Guiding Principles. As you rightly point out, Mr Corrao, access to effective remedies for victims of business-related human rights abuses is an issue on which further progress is still required. In this context, I am pleased that the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency is currently working on an expert opinion on how to lower barriers for access to remedy at the European Union level. I also welcome the recent adoption of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers’ Recommendations on Human Rights and Business with a particular focus on access to remedy. The European institutions and Member States need to implement these recommendations. Furthermore, the European Union welcomes the initiative on enhancing accountability and access to remedy of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This may provide best practices that can be implemented at the European Union and Member State level, including on improved cooperation between states in cross-border cases. As regards our external policy, in line with the Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, the EEAS and the Member States will continue to raise business and human rights in their contacts with third countries. This also includes human rights dialogues, as well as dedicated seminars and financial support aimed at the development of the national action plans on business and human rights. Also important is the need to build capacity, both within European Union delegations and Member States’ embassies, to work effectively on business and human rights issues, including providing support to human rights defenders working on corporate accountability. As regards the legally-binding instrument on business and human rights, the European Union has followed carefully the preparation of the Intergovernmental Working Group in Geneva. Since the start, we made our participation in the working group dependent on two principled conditions: first, ensuring that the scope of the discussion is not limited to transnational corporations, and second, making sure that the implementation of UNGPs is not undermined. This position was supported by a range of countries across different regions and by a number of civil society organisations. In the run-up to the next meeting of the Intergovernmental Working Group on 24 October, the European Union has been actively engaged with the Chair-rapporteur and with all regional political groups with a view to addressing these issues and finding a solution that would entitle the European Union to provide a more active contribution to the works of the group. I am pleased to inform the honourable Members that the European Union requests have been met by the Chair-rapporteur. The European Union therefore took the decision to participate in the Intergovernmental Working Group. The debate is now now open, and your contributions on how to improve the international legal framework for the protection of human rights in the context of corporate activities are all the more precious. There was a direct question from Ms Hautala. What I can tell you is that the preparation of a paper on the Commission policy document on corporate social responsibility is currently ongoing.

Allow me to present to you the report on liquefied natural gas and storage, in full of my reporting obligation. I am proud to say that, together with the shadow reporters, we have succeeded in developing a comprehensive framework that will be able to move the development of European gas markets forward in the long term and support security of supply.  This strategy is not standing on its own, but is integrated into the system built up by parliament's previous decisions. It is in line with the objectives of the Energy Union package and takes into account the other reports of the Gas Winter Package. I believe that such work should only be done in compliance with these frameworks, and we have acted accordingly.  When preparing this report, we had the following objectives in mind: to stimulate competition in the market to drive down consumer prices, to support security of supply by increasing diversification, and, last but not least, to always keep sustainability in mind.  The report goes around a number of important issues, but allow me to highlight those which I believe are the most important of them: first of all, of course, the situation in the vulnerable Member States must be sorted out. It is essential that we show solidarity with Member States that do not have alternative options and are only able to source natural gas from one place. Adequate reservoir capacity can help these countries over time, but the long-term solution can only be source diversification, of which liquefied natural gas can be an excellent tool.  The second major issue is infrastructure. In order to improve the utilization of existing devices, we must first connect isolated networks. The list of priority projects of the European Commission includes investments that would be able to establish these links and resolve the most serious constrictions. In conclusion, in order to really take advantage of existing investments, we must first carry out those that have been missed.  Thirdly, it should be pointed out that the physical infrastructure, the hardware itself, is insufficient without the software. In this case, the software is tariffs, standards, procedures. Their coordination is as important as physical connectivity.  In addition to these issues, we also addressed the role of liquefied natural gas in transport and decarbonisation and the opportunities of the European Union as an active player in the international gas market.  To conclude, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all those who have contributed to this report, in particular the shadow notiers. I believe that without the cooperation of the factions, we would not have been able to achieve so much.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your support. I believe that this report is worth supporting, because the text draws on the motions of all political factions – and including the thought world of each of them, so we can say that this is a real compromise – which is also another sure step towards a common goal, the Energy Union.

Mr President, I really must congratulate and pay fair praise to the rapporteur for this truly comprehensive, effective and holistic report on energy, to my dear colleague, András Gyürk, who has essentially touched not only on the issue of gas, but also more broadly on the issues of the European Union's energy strategy and on the issue of the Energy Union. I adopt and support this report not only because in its energy plans it includes my own country, Cyprus, but also the Mediterranean, which is a very important player today, in order to be able to complete the issue of energy self-sufficiency, energy supply and energy support of the European Union, but, at the same time, because it also proposes solutions with regard to the liquefied natural gas terminal. , as essentially a small country like Cyprus cannot in itself invest and build such a large project and, for this reason, it is addressed to the European Fund for Strategic Investments, which is important to use for these projects.  Addressing the Commissioner present here, I would like to point out that now is the opportunity to use the European Fund for Strategic Investments for the European Union's energy self-sufficiency. And the Eastern Mediterranean, like other regions, is offered in this direction. At the same time, in conclusion, I would like to welcome the reference made in the report that the European Union can become a leader in renewable energy sources, make use of 100% of renewable energy sources, fight energy poverty and effectively safeguard this basic human right, that is, energy to be the property of every European citizen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 131, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Miriam Dalli (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124970", "text": "   – Mr President, thank you, Commissioner. From a small country to another small country – Malta. I would speak from the point of view of Malta because, yes, we do understand that, to reach the EU’s energy and climate targets by 2030 (but most of all provide affordable energy), liquefied natural gas should be considered as an alternative fuel solution, particularly for certain Member States. LNG not only cuts down radically CO2 emissions but is also a transitory link between the current fuel-based system and the futures’ low carbon energy and transport scenarios, including also for vehicles and maritime vessels. Coming from Malta, I believe that there is a clear potential for synergies – which are yet to be exploited – between the gas-rich North African region and the European Union. It is positive that this strategy acknowledges that LNG and gas storage will contribute towards ending energy isolation, which affects Member States, including Malta – more so since it is a key objective of the EU’s Energy Union that all Member States have access to liquid gas markets.

Mr President, it is time to assess the losses that have been created and initiated by the European Union's ideological policy on the gas market. There are more than 20 terminals, many of which were financed with taxpayers' money, but in the end only 20% of the capacity of these stations is used and some of them do not even work. This is for a very simple reason: liquefied natural gas remains more expensive than other alternatives. The only solution to sufficiently reduce prices could be the massive increase in gas imports from North America, but this is contrary to the ecological values established in the European Union, since the gas comes from the destructive activity of fracking.  Gentlemen of the Commission, you must finally recognise that the primary objective of the development of liquefied natural gas has been and remains geopolitical. This is also the reason for the initial failure of European Union policy. The development of liquefied natural gas infrastructure can be efficient, as long as the European Union abandons its neoliberal ideologies and geopolitical blinders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 133, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Ivan Jakovčić (ALDE).", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   – Mr. President, I am convinced that finally the only correct solution is the Energy Union, and in this context of course solidarity with countries that have energy problems.

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur András Gyürk on the work he has done. The LNG strategy should contribute to reducing dependence on pipelines and diversifying sources and supply routes to combat energy poverty primarily, but also to enhance energy security. To achieve this, however, it is important to exploit domestic energy sources. We therefore welcome the report's reference to the need to support the exploitation of deposits in the Cyprus Exclusive Economic Zone and more broadly in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as the creation of an LNG terminal in Cyprus. It is necessary for this proposal to be heard. And it is necessary, Commissioner, for the Union to give immediate financial and technical support for the implementation of the necessary infrastructures. Equally important is to support countries that are energy islands, such as Cyprus and Malta, in order to lift their energy out of isolation.  Unfortunately, however, the positive proposals in the report are cancelled by the measures being promoted to impose a common energy policy that limits the sovereignty and flexibility of states and makes energy a tool to serve market needs through TTIP agreements.

It is essential to create a network of supply and storage infrastructure, but not to exclude seaports from the islands, as referred to in the Alternative Fuels Directive.  The solution also involves the construction of small-scale infrastructure and the use of regular cabotage vessels. That is why, as mentioned in this report too, I have proposed the creation of a joint project, blue LNG corridors for the islands, for the outermost regions of the Atlantic, in particular for Madeira and the Azores, and so that ports can be adapted, maritime links work and ships reconversion.

Mr President, energy security, energy efficiency and the lowest price for consumers are indeed the pillars for which we must work. But we must also be realistic. In many Member States, such as my home country of Greece, we are dependent on a single supplier for natural gas and so it is necessary to have greater access to liquefied natural gas. It is also an opportunity to give consumers access to cheap energy as, due to the oversupply of LNG, its price has fallen significantly. At the same time, however, we must immediately create and strengthen supporting pipeline infrastructures that combine all forms of natural gas. One such example, and I would like you to hear it, ladies and gentlemen, is the work of DEPA for Central and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace; a project that can provide natural gas to county capitals, smaller cities, industrial zones, one of the poorest energy regions in Greece and Europe; a 1,128 km project that will expand Greece's energy market by 0.4 billion cubic centimeters and attract investors.

It is also important to set up a gas liquefaction terminal in Cyprus. Finally, Cyprus provides the possibility of synergies with Israel, Lebanon and Egypt.

For example, I do not agree with the report's recommendation that the Union should provide the necessary infrastructure. To give you an example: Hungary, my country, where I come from, at the moment the Orban government has a sentence summarizing its energy policy: buying natural gas from Russians and buying Russian nuclear power plants from Russians on Russian credit. Now this goes against European strategies in a far-reaching way, and as long as the energy mix is referred to as a kind of sacred cow, these strategies have relatively little meaning and effectiveness.

The Commission is fully in line with these conclusions and is ready to act upon the specific challenges highlighted in the report. As the report rightly outlines, this study can have a transformative effect on reinforcing our energy security and boosting our competitiveness by providing access to liquid hubs and a diverse range of gas sources. But before I go into some of the detail, I think it is worth recalling some of the principles which underpin our strategy. First, the diversification of the natural gas supply is a strategic objective of the European Union as domestic production declines further down the road. The Commission’s LNG and gas storage strategy aims to exploit the potential of liquefied natural gas and gas storage to make the European Union gas system more diverse and flexible, thus contributing to the key Energy Union objective of a secure, resilient and competitive gas supply. LNG can also bring benefits in terms of competitiveness as gas markets become exposed to more competition from international suppliers. In some cases the impact can be significant, as in the case of Lithuania. Furthermore, LNG also has the potential in some cases to reduce environmental impacts, especially in the transport sector. Let me reiterate: the European Union’s LNG strategy was conceived with our Paris climate commitments in mind. The truth is that natural gas is likely to remain an important source for our energy mix as one possible solution for a flexible energy system which includes responsive generation, demand response, grids and storage. As we work on decarbonising our economy, renewables will become more prominent in the European Union’s energy mix, while gas will maintain its role with around 24-25%, pushing out other more polluting fossil fuels. That is why achieving our goals on diversity of gas supplies in every European Union Member State or liquid competitive markets and in meeting the needs of citizens and industry is of cardinal importance. We pursue this diversification objective on three priority axes: opening the southern gas corridor, developing an east Mediterranean gas hub, and taking the opportunity provided by the positive developments of the global LNG market. These axes together will considerably contribute to increased competition and a downward pressure on European gas prices. We believe that a functioning and fully-integrated liquid market is the best way to achieve our gas security objectives by making the European Union attractive for suppliers and keeping prices under control through enhanced competition. That is why this strategy focuses on completing the internal gas market, both in terms of infrastructure as well as market rules, in order to provide diversification to the most vulnerable regions of the European Union. Now on to some of the specific points raised in the report. We welcome that Mr Gyürk’s report also acknowledges the importance of the established regional high-level groups in these vulnerable regions. It is only through targeted action and cooperation that we can best meet the needs of each region. These same groups are also best placed to discuss the prioritisation of infrastructure projects that can address the particular challenges. There is a successful CESEC high-level group that brings together Member States and Energy Community Countries in central and south-east Europe, has identified six key priority projects and already approve an action plan of regulatory solutions that we propose in our LNG strategy to make them happen. The BEMIP high-level group is working on a similar action plan that we will deliver before the end of the year, but I could also mention the work of the South-West High Level Group in the Iberian Peninslua.  On stranded assets, let me say that we are fully aware of the risks here, given today’s constantly changing environment. We need to be mindful of which infrastructure investment we follow through and should focus on only delivering those infrastructure projects that are absolutely essential to security of supply. This is also what we propose in this strategy. A limited number of key infrastructure mainly aiming at connecting to existing import terminals and a storage capacity and one LNG terminal in south-east Europe that will serve the whole region. Here we rely on the results of existing regional cooperation. The projects put forward in the strategy have all been agreed beforehand under the three high-level groups I mentioned before. On climate and sustainability, I fully support the report’s conclusions. We need to look at both the opportunities and challenges in the LNG value chain. On this point, let me stress that the Commission will work closely with international partners to reduce methane slip in the overall LNG chain. This is absolutely crucial to ensure that the positive aspects of using LNG will not be compromised by the adverse effects of methane slip. As mentioned in the report, we should also highlight the potential of renewable sources of gas, also in the form of liquefied biogas. These sources can often utilise existing infrastructure, extending their useful lifetime further into the future. The strategy also recognises the great potential of LNG in the transport sector, in particular in maritime and heavy road transport, where it can replace more polluting fuels. Mr Gyürk’s report also highlights the potential of small-scale LNG for local industry in islands, where gas can replace oil as a fuel for power generation or feedstock. On storage, let me say that it needs to be able to compete on a level playing field. Operators should be able to easily develop the more flexible products to match market needs. Barriers to cross-border access should be eliminated and real cooperation on the efficient use for both business user and possibility of supply purposes should be stressed. In this regard you will be happy to hear that discussions on the gas tariff network codes have finished and the special role of LNG in the European Union market is well reflected in them. Finally, let me turn to the international aspects rightly given prominence in the report. The study, which foresees the European Union as the second largest LNG importer in the world, will play a proactive role in the international efforts to promote a liquid and transparent global LNG market. We will work with our international partners to promote gas trading rules that lead to more flexibility and the convergence of global gas markets. LNG trade is already a subject in our energy dialogues with important consumers such as Japan and current and future suppliers such as the Gulf countries, the United States and Canada, and this will be a step up in the future. Honourable Members, allow me to finish by once again by thanking the rapporteur and by stressing the importance the Commission attaches to this strategy. It can have a significant impact across all five dimensions of the Energy Union, and I look forward to working with the European Parliament to make that happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 145, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   The debate is closed.

I would like to stress that one of the most important challenges facing the European Union under the common energy policy is to ensure that all citizens and economic operators have continuous and competitive access to energy, including natural gas. For years we have been struggling with the problem of differences in gas prices in the various markets of the European Union. In Central Europe, gas prices are up to 23% higher and the market in these countries is too weakly interconnected internally. We cannot talk about energy security when many Member States are dependent on a single supplier, while experiencing problems such as price discrimination or supply disruptions. The key issue solving these problems is the diversification of m.in. gas supply through the use of LNG, as well as the development of transmission and storage infrastructure. I would like to point out that energy security depends not only on market competition, but also on legislation at European Union level and strategic agreements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 147, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Carolina Punset (ALDE)", "mepid": "90110", "text": "  in writing. – The European strategy for natural gas and LNG should not be based on a replacement of coal with another fossil fuel that continues to emit CO2 and above all methane, more than 80 times worse than CO2 for global warming. The Commission has long sought to impose the use of gas across Europe, as a simple change of fuel, by inflating consumption predictions without taking into account improved energy efficiency or renewable penetration. This has resulted in over-investment in used facilities at 25% of its capacity in Europe. Countries such as Spain have plants that were closed on the same day as their opening. The important climate agreements, ratified by the Union, must be the basis of any energy strategy, where energy efficiency and the use of clean energy must be put before any development of fossil fuel energy sources. Natural gas could be a transitional support for the entry of renewables into Europe's energy mixes, but it will become an impediment to the development of clean energy if it is promoted short-term as a reduction in C02 emissions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 148, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Indrek Tarand (Verts/ALE)", "mepid": "97136", "text": "  in writing. – Having an adequate strategy for liquefied natural gas and gas storage is of key importance to Europe’s energy security.

Russia has demonstrated on countless occasions that it is not a reliable partner to the EU and does not hesitate to wield energy as a political weapon. It would be extremely irresponsible to jeopardise our citizens’ wellbeing by subjecting their energy security to the whims of the Kremlin. We must therefore strongly oppose the doubling of the North Stream pipeline. The current pipeline is used in only half of its capacity; therefore, the only reason to double it is to divert all gas transit away from Ukraine in order to further destabilise the country. Furthermore, we currently lack sufficient interconnections for that gas to make its way back to our eastern Member States; North Stream 2 would therefore put them in a much more precarious position.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on the docks of fishing ports, information is spreading faster than on the airwaves, either to criticise the latest regulations or to comment on the prices of the day's fishing. Listening to the docks often identifies possible policy dysfunctions. However, for several years now, and regardless of the country of the European Union, the same story has been heard everywhere on the docks: the one that says that fisheries control would be less severe in neighbours than at home. While a rumour never meant that there was a substance of truth, its persistence merited further study. I therefore conducted the inquiry with the support of my colleagues in Parliament's Fisheries Committee and prepared an initiative report on that basis. Indeed, this sense of unfairness due to the differentiated application of the regulation according to the country raises the question not only of the effectiveness but also of the credibility of the European Union. The regulation is supposed to apply to everyone and it is not acceptable that it is not the same. Compliance with the rule, however, determines the results of sustainability and modernity of fishing activity. In this report, I wanted to analyze the flaws in regulation and its application, which lead to this sense of injustice. The second purpose of this report is to propose solutions to harmonize the control of the common fisheries policy, which I recall is supposed to be one of the most integrated policies in Europe. I am, of course, delighted by the constructive work carried out in committee, where everyone's contribution has provided an almost complete picture of the situation of control in Europe. I would, of course, particularly thank the shadow rapporteurs. This report emphasizes the chameleon nature of the \"control\" regulation in the sense that, depending on the colour of the country, it applies differently, whether it is the scope of the control regulation or the procedures and strategies. The report also reveals that each Member State sets up its own monitoring grounds for controllers, that fishermen's training is disparate and that there is not always monitoring training.  The overly limited mandate of the fisheries control agency, whose main role should be, precisely, to harmonize practices, is also highlighted. It therefore seems appropriate to create a European training of controllers and to develop a single benchmark for control.  Training for fishermen should also be strengthened. Procedures should also be Europeanised and the role of the Vigo agency strengthened by increasing its resources and broadening its scope.  It also seems to me urgent that the control procedures be transparent and standardised, and that the different control bodies coordinate within the same geographical area.  But the most serious dysfunction is that Member States can transpose regulation differently because of a large number of optional provisions within the 'control' regulation and the inapplicability of some of them, which can lead to a subjective interpretation of the controllers.  It will therefore be essential to remove the optional mentions and clarify but also to simplify the existing EU legislation at the next revision of the 'control' regulation. Jurisdictional procedures and sanctions are also different across the Union. For the same offence, the penalty may be administrative or criminal in nature. It seems legitimate to implement a regulation in the future where the same sanction will be applied for the same offence and to introduce incentives.  Moreover, the instruments, tools and financial means used to carry out the controls also vary from one Member State to another. In fact, the most urgent point, according to the controllers we have heard from all countries, is the data and the compatibility of the instruments.  The databases used by Member States are not always shared, which is essential for risk assessment and control strategy. I will end with the issue of boating, which will be put to the test during this week's votes. If we are to achieve the adequacy between fishing rights and the state of the fishing resource, it is essential that this activity is also controlled. Let us remember that we are a few steps away from the revision of the Fisheries Control Regulation announced by the Commission.

Training is different for inspectors across Europe; training is different for fishermen; the penalties are different. Now, for what is called a common fisheries policy, that makes absolutely no sense. But it does explain the fact that, in my country at least, many of the fishing communities feel that the inspectorates especially go overboard and that these issues are probably gold-plated at national level. So there is need for harmonisation across Europe, and I think she has put her finger on the exact difficulty we have, and if we do that, then we can have a better and more equal system.

In addition to harmonisation at national level, there are other instruments that could partially mitigate this problem. For example, it is necessary to establish formative proposals based on the European Agenda for Fisheries Control to be used by national and regional pensions.

Mr President, ensuring effective control of fishing activities is a prerequisite for ensuring a sustainable exploitation of marine resources, but also for a level playing field between the Union's fleets. In order to ensure this competition and to ensure equality in the treatment of fishermen, the European Union proposes to regulate a common fisheries control regulation.  However, in countries such as Greece, where fishermen are experiencing the consequences of the troika's agricultural memorandum, the Union is far from strengthening the fisheries sector. The tax policies, Mr Vella, imposed by the Commission through the troika are driving coastal fishermen to decline, while the primary sector is increasingly affected. It is therefore necessary for the Union to emphasise the strengthening of the blue economy, the increase in funding in the fisheries sector, and in relation to Greece, Mr Vella, we must finally put a stop to the tax policy which affects the incomes and interests of fishermen and has made them poor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Ivan Jakovčić (ALDE).", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   Mr. President, I've been hearing about each other accusing each other in the Adriatic for decades.

That is why I support this report because it speaks of these problems in a very clear and open way, on delicate topics, because fishermen are, of course, our big concern and I am definitely sure that a single fishing policy, and on the other hand what we want to do when we talk about fisheries control, is the right way.

There are certain categories of our fishermen who are threatened by this one common solution because it actually represents their livelihood, that is, the existence of their families.

In some Member States there are controls from vessel to table, in others only a few links in the chain are checked, excluding, for example, the transport of catches or catering. There are too many provisions on the control of fishing activities, to the extent that some of them are even contradictory, just as there are too many derogations and exceptions. It would therefore be desirable to simplify and review Regulation 1224, in order to establish a Community control system to ensure compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy and to improve the implementation of the rules in the various Member States, first and foremost by promoting greater harmonisation of the rules.

Consumers have the right to information on the origin of food.

Effective fisheries control is indispensable if we want to improve the governance of the oceans and we, the European Union, can only make a credible case for effective controls outside the EU if our own record is clean. Therefore the Commission is now evaluating the regulation on control of fisheries for assessing its implementation and the impact on the common fisheries policy five years after its entry into force. This makes the report very well timed and useful, as it complements the work carried out by the Commission. The findings and recommendations of the report will feed into our own work and will be taken into consideration in conceiving the next actions needed for improving the current system of control of fisheries. The regulation on control of fisheries, which entered into force in 2010, changed significantly the previous control system, introducing the use of new technologies, a new management system and new principles and obligations. Thanks to this reform, the fishery control system has improved, and this has led to an overall increase in compliance with the common fisheries policy. However, if some good results have been achieved, still more should be done. Preliminary assessment of the regulation on control of fisheries shows that, while there is a good legal framework, improvements can be made, particularly on its implementation by the Member States. In brief, the report stresses that the different implementation in the Member States and their diverse commitment in its application hinder – as was said by a number of speakers – the level playing field among operators and therefore their confidence in the system and respect of the rules. The implementation by Member States greatly differs in the sanctioning system and control procedures and methods in the management of control, the training of inspectors, technologies and tools used, IT development and data sharing and exchange. All these have been noted. The principles embedded in the report go very much in the same direction as the Commission’s policy. We all recognise that having a uniform and harmonised control system of fisheries contributes to ensuring a level playing field of operators across Europe. This is important, not only in terms of treatment, but in the very end fundamental for ensuring sustainable fishing. Compliance with the common fisheries policy (CFP) cannot be achieved without awareness and support from fishermen and, in order to achieve this, we need to have their trust and cooperation. We agree with the report on the importance of continuing to fight illegal fishing and to strengthen the quality, completeness and reliability of catch data. We also agree on the underlying need to strengthen collaboration between Member States themselves and also between Member States, the Commission and the European Fisheries Control Agency, including the need to share control data in real time. The contribution of the European Fisheries Control Agency to the level playing field in the control of fisheries is critical. Their activities and operational coordination, development of standards and training are greatly appreciated by all stakeholders. Compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy is improving. Its enforcement relies on a comprehensive and sound control system with dissuasive, proportionate and effective sanctions applied by Member States.

That not only proves that European regulations make sense but also are crucial in combating degradation of our environment. There is one point I truly want to underline: controls should not be intended as a measure where fishers are treated as criminals. The prime function of controls should be to increase compliance to agreed management measures by increasing deterrence and voluntary compliance and thus decreasing violations. A balance between enforcement and voluntary compliance should be achieved for each fishery.

I am very pleased, I am very pleased that today, here in the European Parliament, I can present a report on increasing the communication accessibility of Central and Eastern Europe. I think that everyone, as we are sitting here in this House, will agree that if, in recent years, there has been no doubt, political integration in the European Union, then this integration at transport level still requires a great deal of effort and leaves a great deal to be desired. This report deals precisely with this, positions, and points out the most strategic transport links: road, rail, air, which in the coming years the European Union and the Member States on its eastern flank should build and in which European funds should be invested.  But someone will ask the question, what should be the main idea of this EU project, what directions should be taken into account in a special way? Well, in my opinion, the eastern flank requires a strong investment in transport in the north-south directions. This is a strategic direction on which we should focus in a special way. Because what is it about increasing communication accessibility? I think that each of you knows – research, various analyses, reports – that it is an increase in competitiveness, that it is an influx of foreign investment, that it is an increase, dear you, a sense of security, as the Commissioners of the European Union have also mentioned very often in my discussions. Yes, a sense of security on the eastern flank of the European Union, because a better connected, well-organised network of connections, a well-connected eastern Europe is a safer Europe. What are the most important transport routes we should invest in in the coming years, and I have allowed myself to be presented in my report? Without a doubt, dear ones, it is the Rail Baltica and Via Baltica route, connecting the Baltic States, through Poland, with the south-west of Europe. Certainly Via Carpatia – a project that both I and many of my colleagues have been seeking over the last years. This is a key project for the people of the eastern flank of the European Union, a project that has the potential to accelerate its development, a project that has the potential to give a sense of security to the people of Eastern Europe, including Polish, including my region of Subcarpathia. Residents of Rzeszów, Niska, Stalowa Wola, Barwinka, Krosna are waiting for this road. Without this path, it will not be possible to level the playing field – we will not come, we will not join western Europe without this road, without the Via Carpatia road.  But in my report, I also point out important, important river connections, the clearing of connections between the Elbe, the Oder and the Danube, between the Danube and the Rhine, and I point out the important, important, future freight directions needed for investment: the Amber Route, the eleventh route, which has every opportunity to improve development and development, trade between Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. These are, dear ones, those provisions that are included in this report and which, as I said, are strategic and such a very, very, thoughtful format agreed in large part also between the political groups and with the European Commission.

Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Poręba, on his proposal. Transport is a key pillar of our economy, contributing EUR 548 billion and securing more than 11 million jobs. At the same time, however, transport accounts for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, with more than 70% coming from road transport. For this reason, the European Union is now being driven by alternative transport, public transport and in particular rail.

According to the latest statistics, more than 26,000 people died on Europe's roads last year, an increase for the first time since 2001.

The Commission has continuously promoted the improvement of physical connections between the Member States. They are crucial for fostering cohesion, for the proper functioning of the internal market and for generating economic growth and employment. This is the cornerstone of the TEN-T policy framework renewed in 2013. The TEN-T policy and its corridors take into consideration the specific needs of Central and Eastern European states to improve their connection with the rest of Europe.  I would just mention the North Sea-Baltic Corridor that integrates the Rail Baltica project or the Rhine—Danube Corridor that emphasises the development of the Danube. We welcome the report, acknowledging the hard work of the European coordinators in developing their corridors and strongly supporting their efforts. The Commission will continue to concentrate its efforts on the effective delivery of the priorities identified in the TEN-T framework. The process of reviewing this policy framework will start in 2023 only, to allow the stability needed for the corridors to be completed. As experience shows, there is still an unequal development of transport infrastructure across the individual modes, with great priority still being given to roads when allocating national and local public funds. The Commission will therefore continue to prioritise sustainable modes of transport in line with the objectives of our Transport White Paper and our commitment to combating climate change. We acknowledge the need to continue providing funding support for the development of rail or inland waterways infrastructure in Central and Eastern European Member States. The European Union will continue to support relevant investments through the European Fund for Strategic Investments (ESIF) and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The CEF uptake in the cohesion Member States has been exemplary after the second call. Several national envelopes have already been entirely used. The third call, launched on 13 October, will be an occasion for the other cohesion Member States to fully absorb their respective allocations.  However, since the pipeline of projects is well beyond the possibilities offered by the CEF budget, we welcome the report’s call to mobilise further the key players to find additional sources of funding for key projects. We need to keep mobilising Central and Eastern European countries to fully use the potential of the opportunities offered by the Investment Plan for Europe. This is the new way forward for financing the infrastructure projects. We will thus continue to work closely with the EIB on the appropriate geographical coverage of the EFSI.  Finally, the Commission acknowledges the high complexity of the regulatory, administrative and permitting procedures entailed by the implementation of the transport projects. This particularly impacts infrastructure projects with a cross-border dimension. The Commission is therefore currently working on identifying solutions to streamline procedures and facilitate project implementation, thus generating more investment in the transport sector.

The court objected to the inadmissibility of the action for lack of interest and active legitimacy, challenging the occasional nature of the association and the fact that it does not appear representative of the local community. This approach takes on a rather stringent jurisprudential orientation. However, it omits any reference to the requirements of Italian law that associations must meet in order to obtain a standing before the Court. Therefore, I wonder, and I ask you, Commissioner, what space do we give to the environmental bodies that come from below and access to environmental justice in Europe is really guaranteed, because obviously in Italy, this is not the case today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 192, "date": "2016-10-24.json", "name": "Michaela Šojdrová (PPE).", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   – Mr President, in the flood of breaking news, we should not forget the long-term challenges, so I would like to remind you that in two days, 27 October, is a day dedicated to audiovisual cultural heritage by UNESCO. This heritage is of great value to us both artistic in the case of films and historical in the case of records of the events of the 20th century. However, these materials are perishable and their protection, archiving and quality digitisation should therefore be an important priority for us. We should not forget to protect them.  We are currently in the European Parliament discussing the revision of the Audiovisual Services Directive, in which we also deal with the promotion of European works. We want to increase the representation of European production for audiovisual service providers also on demand, not just for radio and television. From 10% to 20%.

The main causes of this sad phenomenon are the huge spread of childhood obesity, environmental emergencies and poor investments in health care, often linked to economic inequalities between the various Italian regions. But campania also has the lowest per capita health expenditure in Italy because of an absurd criterion for allocating the national health fund based on the average age of the regional population, which rewards regions with a higher average age and severely penalises Campania, the youngest region in Italy. A real paradox.

Mr President, the situation in the 'hotspots' of the Aegean islands has reached the limit. Conflicts between refugees and illegal immigrants are now on the agenda. More than 14,000 refugees and illegal immigrants are currently stranded on the Aegean islands. At the same time, Turkey is supporting the operation of slave trade circuits that bring refugees not only to the Aegean islands but also to Evros, Thrace. At the recent European Council there was a complete failure to find a solution to the refugee crisis and to rid Greece of the burden of the thousands of refugees flooding every corner of the country. Of the 66,400 refugee relocations supposed to take place from Greece to European Union countries, only 5,200 have been made in the past year. Where's this going to go? When will the 6,000 relocations begin monthly?

The only thing that was agreed is the statement from the Council, which regrets this referendum. Regret! Like it's a detail. A misstatement.

It is potentially breaking up from inside out.  The Good Friday Agreement was voted overwhelmingly by 90% of the people of Ireland in two referendums. The Irish Government repealed Articles 2 and 3 of its Constitution, letting go of its territorial right to the north of Ireland, and the British Government fully repealed the Government of Ireland Act, which was the Act that had partitioned Ireland. As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the two Member States – the two governments – built into the Good Friday Agreement the principle of consent.

Fifty-six percent of the people voted to remain and the British Government is telling us that is going to lead the process of negotiations, that it will be between it and the EU and no one else, and the rest of us will do as we are bid.

These are people, most of whom have lived in these countries throughout their lives and even were born there.  For a quarter of a century, almost 15% of latvia's population and 8% of the Estonian population do not have the right to vote, including in elections to the European Parliament. The petition calls for an end to the injustices against these people by allowing them to vote at least in elections to the European Parliament.

I talked to bereaved mothers in Nusaybin whose sons and daughters had perished because of the state’s attacks on its own citizens, their bodies torn apart, impossible to identify. Many are still missing. I met the distraught families of teachers whose loved ones have been sacked, intimidated and imprisoned for attending union meetings. I met democratically elected politicians – many of them women like myself – but who have been stripped of office due to trumped up charges because of their Kurdish identity and their political affiliation. I met Yazidi refugees cared for, not by the state, but by the Kurdish community, all wondering when the world will remember them.  Independent media is being silenced and shut down in Turkey, and journalists and academics arrested, tried and imprisoned. The country is in the grip of a terrible dictatorial man.
