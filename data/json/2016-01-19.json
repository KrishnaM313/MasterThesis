Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to present you with a brief and short assessment of the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council. As you know, this presidency took place in a particularly difficult and often dramatic context.  The Union is facing unprecedented challenges, including finding answers to the financial and economic crisis, where things are getting better, but where caution remains, the growing instability at its borders and the temptations to retreat to the national square, which are taking on worrying dimensions in Europe. As if that were not enough, two particular phenomena were added, in an already very difficult context, namely: the migration crisis and the rise of terrorism in the world, but also particularly in Europe, during the attacks in Paris last year. On these two issues, the Presidency has endeavoured to react quickly and concretely.  With regard to the migration crisis, I will not go here in detail to the various measures taken both on the responsibility of the Member States and on the aspect of solidarity between the Member States, knowing that it was appropriate and that it will still be necessary to ensure a dignified reception for refugees in need of international protection. These measures cover the resettlement and relocation of refugees, the establishment of a new return and readmission policy and a reception mechanism through hotspots, the definition of a new framework and, finally, the strengthening of our Union's external borders. All of these measures have been put in place as a whole as a whole as a whole as a whole. Some are only starting to produce their effects now; they are the indispensable part of a reform of our migration policy, which is certainly not complete. In this regard, we also welcome the proposals made by the Commission in December 2015.  That said, the spring migration campaign is likely to resume with the same magnitude this year as last year. It is absolutely necessary to implement the measures already decided, because, even with the best will of the co-legislators, we can only weigh in favour of a reduction in flows if what has already been decided is also actually implemented. As we all know, the integrity of the Schengen area is at stake; it will only work if the rules governing it are respected. From this point of view, we have called as early as November 2015 for a communitisation of the introduction of internal border controls, as long as it is necessary and that Member States are not left with the initiative or last resort of national and disorderly reintroduction of controls. Not all the instruments offered by the Schengen Code have been used and this will probably have to be done quickly. For the time being, the priority is certainly to do everything possible to substantially reduce the flow of refugees at the risk of losing our public opinion if we do not. It is also high time to operationalise relocation, and all Member States must participate without delay. If real progress has been made in this context, more needs to be done and everyone must live up to their commitments and responsibilities. It is also a question of solidarity between the Member States, a solidarity that is expressed at the political level and not legally. Solidarity is not, in the history of our Union, only one-way solidarity: we must know how to give and not expect to receive. This solidarity must also be extended with the partner states of the Balkans and Turkey. The Balkan Road Conference and the Action Plan with Turkey are leading the way, even if the realities on the ground are not yet up to each other's legitimate expectations. We must not forget Lebanon and Jordan either.  The Paris attacks in 2015 were the most dramatic moment in a security situation severely degraded by terrorism in Europe and beyond. The confusion between migration and terrorism must be avoided. We must also ensure that these amalgams cannot be made too easily. We have, on the Presidency side, tried to implement a whole series of measures already taken in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, but the Union may not have been quick enough to react at first. We should also welcome the fact that, after three years of discussions, the PNR directive has finally been adopted by the co-legislators. In this extremely difficult context where action has been taken in an accelerated fashion, I must say that that we have always been able to count on the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. More generally, the european Union has been able to move forward, thanks to the support and constructive approach of the European Parliament. I would therefore like to take this opportunity today to thank you, not only for this excellent cooperation over the last six months, but also for making a decisive contribution to moving the Union forward on a range of key issues at the very heart of the Presidency's programme. Of the 36 cases concluded in codecision, let me mention above all the agreement on the 2016 budget, an agreement on the reform of the European Court of Justice, the establishment of a European passenger data collection system, the directive on strengthening the presumption of innocence, the simplification of the circulation of certain public documents, an agreement on the proposed regulation on benchmarks or the agreement on the data protection.  The Luxembourg Presidency organised the first political dialogue on respecting and promoting the rule of law in our Union. The discussions of the last few months, and especially weeks, the events of the last weeks, even the last days, demonstrate the relevance of this process. This dialogue is only in its infancy, it needs to be deepened in the coming months. It is not only in the area of home affairs that we have had to resolve to hold extraordinary meetings; this has also been the case in dealing with the crisis in the dairy and pork sectors, as well as the difficulties faced by the European steel industry due to unfair trade policies in third countries.  As far as trade is concerned, some progress has been made: it has been possible to make progress on the mechanism for the settlement of investor-state disputes, the future TTIP agreement, and I would also like to thank President Schulz for the meeting we organised together in Brussels with the social partners to discuss this TTIP. We have put the social partners of the 28 European countries around the table, because for us TTIP must not be an agreement that sells off the values and trust that citizens have entrusted to us through all these years, but it must also be seen as an opportunity and it is therefore important to conduct the necessary negotiations in a transparent manner.  While the WTO Ministerial Conference in Nairobi marks the end of the Doha Round, some progress has also been made at the multilateral level. We wanted to modernise the working methods of competitiveness and to focus our work on putting in place a stable regulatory framework that favours investment in line with the Juncker plan. It is with the aim of mobilising investment financing that we have also adopted, in record time, a general approach by the Council on securitisation as the first brick of the capital markets union. It was also in a very short period of time that the Council was able to agree on the directive on the exchange of information on tax rulings. This agreement is a strong signal to the rest of the world on tax transparency. Also on tax matters, the Council adopted important conclusions on the OECD's BEPS initiative to combat base erosion and profit shifting.  The deepening of the social dimension of the Union and the establishment of genuine social governance, as is done in economic and financial matters, has been and remains a goal of Luxembourg. We have been able to move in this direction over the last six months, although much remains to be done. I also believe that we have made progress on sustainable development by coordinating European efforts towards the 2030 agenda, but also, of course, through the contribution of our Union, in close cooperation with our French friends, at COP 21 in Paris: a first universal and binding agreement on combating climate change. We have also worked to establish reliable, transparent and robust governance of the energy union and to promote a sustainable energy transition. We have completed some projects, such as the two important components of the fourth rail package, namely the one that deals with the liberalisation of passenger rail services and the one that aims to strengthen the governance of rail infrastructure.  We started the huge the project of the Digital Single Market initiated by the Commission. The establishment of the latter is a condition for the completion of the internal market, a completion which will also require a wider application of the principle of mutual recognition. Let me also mention a small personal satisfaction, as Minister of Telecommunications of my country, namely the agreement reached between the co-legislators on the proposal for an NIS directive that will strengthen the security of computer networks in the Union. There is still a lot of work to be done at this level. It is sad to see that the European Union is in fact caught between the United States and Asia, and that our young talents who want to be successful are often forced to leave our continent - which imposes 28 different regulations on young people who want to get started - in order to gain recognition.  Mr President, I have said above how good cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament has been under our Presidency. We finalized the budget reconciliation five days before the deadline; as far as we can remember, it's a record. I believe that we, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, have also put in place the conditions for a more harmonious functioning of the institutional triangle through the inter-institutional agreement 'Better Legislation' of December, a political agreement at this stage, but which we hope will come into force soon after your assembly has spoken before the beginning of spring. With this agreement, it is also a question of modernising European legislative and regulatory processes in the direction of greater transparency, but also of reducing the administrative and budgetary burden on what constitutes the heart of the European economy, namely small and medium-sized enterprises.  In these times of crisis, it is a good idea to denigrate the European project, and even for the most enthusiastic, to question the way forward. Let us not forget, and especially for the younger generations, to recall the peace project that we have been living on a daily basis since 1957. I was lucky enough to be Luxembourgish, to study in France, to do an Erasmus in Greece, to have discovered things that I would not have known if I had been born later. As a student in Thessaloniki, take the car to go to Skopje, to go to Bulgaria, to go to Turkey, to have closed borders, to have to disinfect the car, to have to stop at a customs, to have customs closed: things that young people today do not know. To have known the bureaux de change, to have to exchange. We complain, but we forget to remind our young people of what Europe is also: rights, freedoms, the chance to fall in love with someone who does not have the same passport, to be able to be cared for, to be defended. It is very important to remember all this on a daily basis, especially to the younger generations, and to stop denigrating all this project we are fighting for.  From my country's point of view, there is an urgent need to continue the path of European integration, because that is where the solutions to the crises that Europe must face are. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is certainly more to say, but time is running out. My country is pleased to have been able to chair the Council of the Union for the twelfth time. He has been able to count on your support, I thank you and let me also thank all the civil servants, whether they are at your side, on the side of the Commission or on the Luxembourg side, for the work done. I am making this speech today, but they are the ones who have worked masterfully over the last six months and let me thank them on behalf of all of us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Commission President. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, since we last saw each other, further atrocities have been committed in Istanbul and Jakarta. Our democracy, represented by this Parliament, and the values that underpin it are stronger than terrorist threats. Such acts will never dictate our course of action, and the terror that awaits us will certainly not intimidate us. We will continue to work to preserve our freedoms, our way of life, our way of being together, in short, the whole of humanity. With regard to the Luxembourg Presidency, Mr President, I would once again like, and in a very pronounced way, to sing the praises of the Luxembourg Government, its Prime Minister and all the ministers who accompanied it. His Presidency has done a very good job and has demonstrated - for the rest, in the case of Luxembourg, this is always true - that the main thing is not in quantity but in quality, certainly perfectable, but nevertheless in the remarkable quality that was that of the Luxembourg Presidency. This has always been the case throughout history. Remember, in 1985, the Luxembourg Presidency was able to conclude the Single European Act that gave birth to the internal market. The Luxembourg Presidency in 1991 led the first part of the Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union. In 1997, it was the great decision on enlargement that allowed the two lungs of Europe to breathe together, and so on. The tradition was therefore strongly established, and the government that exercised the presidency proved worthy of the rich past it inherited. The Presidency had to be exercised under particularly difficult conditions. It has succeeded on the issue of migration by bringing about a constructive dialogue between 28 different and often diametrically opposed national realities. It also concluded key files that had been stalled for too long, whether on the subject of air passenger files or data protection. And I could, Prime Minister, continue the enumeration: the intergovernmental agreement that you mentioned and whose importance and scope are underestimated, the elegance with which the Luxembourg government was able to lead the work at the climate conference in Paris; all performances that we do not often mention but which are part of the recent history of the European Union. With regard to the refugee crisis, under the expert and often enlightened authority of Minister Asselborn, and with the support of your Parliament, agreements were quickly reached on the Commission's proposals for the relocation and resettlement of refugees - agreements, alas!, adopted by the Council but not yet translated into reality. We have also made progress, albeit too little and too slowly to the liking of some, on other points: the operational implementation of the first \"hotspots\", better coordination between countries on the Balkan route, or in terms of an action plan with Turkey, and we have been able, through the Presidency, to establish greater virtuous, necessary and useful cooperation with our African partners. Today, ladies and gentlemen, we have new tools to deal more effectively and effectively with the urgency of migratory pressure. Other innovative tools, including those relating to common external borders, will still need to be put in place, with European agreements, border guards and coastguards. But let us not be fooled: better management of migration in all its aspects is a long-term work. We must not give up and we must continue the work that the Luxembourg Presidency has usefully begun. \"Hotspots\", relocation, European coastguard and border guard corps: all these elements go together. They are inseparable from each other. It is all of these measures that will enable us to reduce the flow of migrants and thus to remove the risks to the Schengen area, because there are very great risks, even risks of survival, in this area. Today, we are happily reintroducing border controls. Tomorrow we will find that the economic cost is considerable and, the day after tomorrow, we will ask ourselves why we have a single currency, when we no longer have freedom of movement or the internal market. Therefore, the European Union is threatened, in some respects, in its foundations and in its extensions, which could have gone much further than what we are seeing today. Trotz go dieser Schwierigkeiten, trotz go dieser Probleme hat die luxemburgische Presidentschaft ihren Vorsitz im Rat mit Bravour gemeistert, auch, weil sie nie das groe Ganze aus den Augen verloren hat. Sie hat manchen gordischen Knoten durchtrennen kunnnen, mit sehr viel Verhandlungsgeschick und mit der Hilfe vieler Hànde und vieler Kàpfe. Die Fluggastdatenspeicherung ist ein Beispiel, die neue european datenschschutzgrundverordnung ist ein anderes Beispiel. Aus dieser Datenschutzgrundverordnung ist im 'brigen ein schuns rundes luxemburgisches Ei geworden. Frau Reding hat die Datenschutzverordnung 2012 vorgeschlagen, die Kommission hat dies in ihre programmatischen Priorit-ten aufgenommen, und die luxemburgische Regierung hat die Datenschutzgrundverordnung zum Fliegen gebracht. Das ist also eine exemplarische, fast patriotische Leistung der Luxemburger, wofàr ich mich im Namen der Kommission sehr herzlich bei Premierminister Bettel bedanken mechte. Alles in Allem: Dieser Ratsvorsitz war ein voller Erfolg Es gibt nicht einen einzigen Abstrich zu machen, und die luxemburgische Regierung plus die vielen Hànde, die ihr zugearbeitet haben, kunnnen stolz sein auf das Erreichte.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, small countries are capable of making good presidencies. Luxembourg has just given proof of this once again, with decades of institutional experience.  Of course, the character of the presidencies has changed a lot since the Lisbon Treaty, which replaced the rotating presidencies with the permanence of the President of the European Council and the Presidency of the Foreign Affairs Council. But there is still the European legislation, proposed by the Commission, which must then be negotiated, patiently, article by article, and there, the solid work of Luxembourg civil servants has been able to advance dozens of issues. I am thinking, among other things, of the reform of the European Court of Justice, of the inter-institutional agreement, of the railway package, of data protection, of the PNR dossier, and so on. It was a perfectly mastered work, executed with know-how, with commitment, carried out in the interest of Europe. That the Luxembourg civil servants and those who assisted them - there were many of them - should be thanked.  The government has been able to manage the files. Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn was on all fronts. His commitment was noticed and appreciated, as was that of the Minister for European Affairs, Nico Schmit, who was at the disposal of the European Parliament. Let us also note COP 21, where the Luxembourg Presidency was supporting the excellent work done by France, by ensuring that Europe speaks with one voice. A big thank you to all. For the rest, they were unprecedented and endless crises. Greece's has almost been overshadowed by refugees and terrorism. In many Member States we have seen the rise of nationalist populism, selfishness and a clear lack of accountability for the common future of our continent. In the face of these serious problems, presidencies can do little. They pass, but crises remain. May 2016 produce a change of course in line with the founding texts of the Union.

As an MEP, I would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for the past six months. At a time when the Union was and still faces enormous challenges, we had to respond to the crises that threaten our European values and the cohesion of the Union. This was done with panache by Luxembourg Ministers Jean Asselborn, a tireless traveller for peace and for our freedoms, and Nicolas Schmit, who spent his nights here in the European Parliament. It was done well. But I especially appreciated the work that has been done on the less spectacular issues. I will not list all the files that could have been concluded, but they were spent for months or even years. The work and collaboration between the Council, represented by the Presidency, and the European Parliament have been exemplary. This is probably due to the commitment of the Luxembourg Government, but so much, and perhaps more so, to the commitment of the civil servants, those who worked in Luxembourg and those who have been at work here in Brussels, to the permanent representation, which I would particularly like to thank. All that remains is for me to hope that the following presidencies will show the same availability, the same commitment and the same spirit of solidarity in the interests of the European Union, which is in great need of it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Helga Stevens", "mepid": "125105", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Luxembourg had placed the security issue high on the agenda when he took office and the result may be there. For example, an agreement was reached in the long-standing EU-PNR dossier and, in concrete terms, the intelligence services will be able to use passenger data, which is important in the fight against terror.  In addition, there will be an anti-terrorism cell within Europol that will be able to detect and have jihadist content removed on the Internet, among other things. However, the privacy of the citizen is not forgotten. This is evidenced by the compromise text on the Data Protection Directive on police matters. In terms of migration, the result is meageny. The pilot project on the redistribution of asylum seekers among European countries is the only tangible result and even undermined by the refusal of Eastern European countries to assume their responsibility. Europe's inability to effectively guard Europe's external borders has made it difficult to deal with the migration crisis. That is why I hope that a systematic push-back policy can be implemented under the Dutch Presidency. We must stop the unbridled influx by systematically returning smuggling boats at sea. Moreover, asylum seekers who have already received de facto protection in a transit country are no longer allowed to receive asylum in Europe. Of course, Europe must do its part, but Europe cannot solve all the problems. That is why we need to set a maximum number of asylum seekers to be taken in, after which only the most vulnerable can come to Europe through resettlement. That's how we take out people smugglers.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council of the Union, when you presented the priorities of your Presidency, many of us told you that the six months of work of the Luxembourg Presidency would coincide with a precarious internal situation and an extremely difficult external situation.  At the end of your presidency, we see that the crises already in place in July have become existential for the European Union. They remain existential because our Member States are not prepared to equip the European Union with the powers and means to solve them. It is all the more comforting to see how successful your presidency has been in meeting the significant challenges. One example is the 2016 budget, which was unanimously adopted in record time. Nor should we forget the successful efforts in the areas of home affairs and justice. The Presidency has also helped to change the issue of combating climate change; the same is true of the agricultural and social issues.  Your great merit, however, will have been to show that you can move the lines, even if the results are not acquired in advance. It is true that, despite the efforts and progress mentioned, some of our Member States are holding back when it comes to solidarity in the face of major crises such as refugees. The indifference, if not the refusal, of many of our Member States increases the burden on those who are prepared to assume their responsibilities for taking in refugees. We are ashamed to see many Member States questioning important achievements such as Schengen. There are no words to describe the homeopathic contributions of some in search of a solution to the problem of asylum seekers. While Germany is hosting 24,000 refugees in one weekend, others of roughly comparable size say they want to take in the same number of refugees over a two-year period.  The real crisis at the beginning of 2016 is a crisis of solidarity. The inability to distribute efforts equitably among the 28 does not bode well. The end of the presidency of a country known for its European commitment will not end, I am sure, its commitment to a more united and united Union.  We rely on you, on your talent, on the competence of your employees, whom no one is questioning, on the experience of the Member State you represent, on to move Europe forward and to give it a more federalist imprint. The future is sufficiently mortgaged by the inability to overcome the intergovernmental, with its crippling effect in which sovereignists and nationalists of all stripes recognize themselves above all.  Our old continent deserves better. It deserves a free, strong, united and effective European Union.

The Luxembourg Presidency has tried, but now we are counting the Council's results after six months and the figures and events call for concern, alertness, responsibility and not complacency. In September you decided to relocate 160,000 refugees with a proportional distribution across Europe. What's the report? How far have the decisions been implemented? A few hundred people relocated, not even 1%. You left Greece alone and virtually helpless to lift the burden of 85% of refugee flows. You signed a framework agreement with Turkey, but Mr Timmermans says that nothing has changed in terms of reducing refugee flows because the Turkish authorities are waiting for the money without implementing the commitments they have made. And in this environment of egos, nationalisms, xenophobia, the cries are growing: 'It is Schengen's fault!'

Your presidency, Prime Minister, was, like any, made up of plans and events.  You are not solely responsible for the implementation of the plans – not in the case of events anyway. You could now compare what you had set out to do and what was done. There are at least a few points where you have not been particularly successful: for example, the new necessary balance sheet between European trade policy and industrial policy or the small buisness act or the greening of the European semester.  For me, however, the positive achievements of the Presidency outweigh the positive achievements of the Presidency. The two I would like to highlight in particular are the General Data Protection Regulation, which has brought you to a conclusion, and the contribution of your Presidency – your personal and also that of your Minister, Mr Dieschbourg, to the Paris climate conference. So thank you very much for this presidency. At the same time – and this is now the view of the great picture that has been mentioned – it can be said that we are experiencing a new normal in Europe. This is characterised by many overlapping challenges and crises, and this state of affairs will not change them so quickly. We have to prepare for this new normal, with much more headwinds than we were used to. This leads to fears among citizens of the loss of security and stability. If we do not want the policy of fear to grow in this situation, then we must oppose a successful policy of hope. But this is not just a rhetorical challenge. Talking about hope and change so often does not mean that we have the services that we need. We are judged by this whether we are putting these solutions in place.  You said at the beginning of your presidency: we must listen to the citizens. I believe that this is a very central principle. But that also means that we must listen to the citizens where they may not say what we want to hear. If you say today, Mr Bettel, that TTIP must be treated as an opportunity, then it does not mean to listen to the fact that, according to Eurostat, the citizens are increasingly criticising and saying that they are not doing so. Listening to the citizens means making a difference here. You said that solidarity is crucial. I share that, but solidarity is not only where we demand something, but also where others demand something. Expecting solidarity from Poland on refugees also means showing solidarity with Poland, for example, in Nord Stream.  Thirdly, you said that we must not hide into the national. In this new situation, we need to re-measure the balance between the national, between the Union of States, and the common, the Union of Citizens, that is at the heart of the Brexit debate.  And with regard to refugee policy, however, one thing is clear: there is an incompatible European strategy and a national strategy. So far, the possibility of a European solution has essentially been defended by the German position.

I am thinking, for example, of the directive on the automatic exchange of information for tax agreements, the so-called tax rulings. Why is it not said that the agreement reached in October in the Council is extremely limited and lacking in relation to the proposal of the Commission and this Parliament? We will then have to talk about the Fiat affair, where the European Commission itself has established that Luxembourg has given us unlawful State aid. Well, because of the paradox of the absurd state aid rules, Luxembourg will be the country that Fiat will have to compensate and not, for example, Italy and the other European countries to which it has taken the resources away. Gramegna spoke on this matter and promptly said that the Brussels decision should be criticised for, in his opinion, creating uncertainty for businesses, thus showing what the real face of Luxembourg is. So you can keep telling us all the fairy tales you want, but that's your reality, the reality of a country that for years has thrived on the shoulders of its European partners, subtracting billions of legitimate taxes that multinationals would have to pay.

Mr President, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Members, this Luxembourg Presidency has started under the fire of the LuxLeaks revelations, this tax evasion knowingly organised by Luxembourg in favour of multinationals and to the detriment of other European countries. We will know little more about this scandalous case, since MEPs have decided to bury it by refusing any parliamentary committee of inquiry. Silence, we cheat, we strip. European countries are stripped of their tax matters. All honest taxpayers - SMEs and individuals - have to pay more taxes and compensate for this looting organised by Luxembourg and other tax havens, while this sad European Union is doing nothing to stop this. This presidency is coming to an end, at a time when the influx of migrants is dramatic and is on a considerable scale; considerable by the frightening number of people marching towards Europe, also considerable by the terrible shock caused by the sexual assaults of 200 German women in the centre of Cologne. These acts of sexual predation mark a regression of our civilization. We must all defend the freedom of women to move without fear in our cities. The arrival of millions of people from radically different cultures will lead to violent shocks and conflicts within our societies. It is time to stop this madness. My country has suffered too much this year from conflicts and tragedies. Organized Islamist terrorist attacks have been repeated relentlessly.

Both constitute the backbone not only of cybersecurity, but also for the further integration of a digital Europe. Secondly, I am satisfied that, under the Luxembourg Presidency, sanctions to counter Russia’s aggressive activities were maintained, despite what is happening with ISIS in Syria. I think it is crucial for EU credibility to maintain these sanctions until the Minsk agreements have been fully met. Thirdly, it is very good that the Council has supported the simplification of European structural and investment funds, facilitating access, especially for SMEs.  There were also attempts to simplify of the common agricultural policy rules. However, the major challenge the following Presidency continued to face is the fact that there is still no common agricultural policy in the true sense of that word.

Finally, I believe that the work done to make the issue of refugees and migrants common is essential, and the July agreements were a fundamental step towards having a common policy in this area, which the next Presidency will, however, have to implement.

A compromise that was not easy, because we have, of course, together – Council and Parliament – significantly improved the Commission's proposal. I have to say that the President of the Commission was not jean-Claude Juncker at the time. And we have succeeded in creating a genuine European proposal that adds value to European rules for cross-border infrastructure in the digital age. It was not easy, i thank you for that. Secondly, the issue of tax policy has already been raised on several occasions. In fact, the Luxembourg Presidency has been somewhat overshadowed by this. The conclusion we must draw is that we must look at how we can combine Member States' competence for tax policy with a need for European solidarity. All those who have now strongly criticised the Luxembourg Presidency and Luxembourg in this House must be careful, because they do not know whether the European Commission will not discover their country any distant day and classify fiscal independence not as independence, but as non-solidarity behaviour.

It's a real problem, a real subject and we're not really moving forward. It would seem that the secret services are so secretive that we cannot see their way and their mode of cooperation. Already in 2001, at the time of the events in New York and Washington, a European Council - under the presidency of Guy Verhofstadt - had concluded that there was a much needed enhanced cooperation between the secret services of the Alliance member countries and the Member States of the European Union. Nothing has been done, or very little, and we find day after day, as a result of the discoveries that are being made and the revelations that are coming to us, that there have been shortcomings in cooperation between the secret services, as well as between the police, and it is obvious that we must make an extra effort on this point.

This is not within the competence of the six-year presidency, and it is up to President Tusk to continue negotiations with the British government. It is therefore normal that I did not insist on this subject. Mr Papadimoulis, you have talked about migration problems, as have a number of other Greek colleagues. I agree that solidarity is not one-way, and the commitments that have been made by both must also be respected. Today, we have the impression that only Greece is the one that is coming up with the costs. We have taken the example of Germany today, each final country also has a very significant cost to cover. So we can't just talk about a country. But it is important today to say that we see that \"hotspots\" do not work ideally and that we must also help Greek colleagues to make it work more effectively. We have not left Greece alone, and Greece and the other countries concerned also know that the Luxembourg Presidency, for example, has asked the European Commission to see, with regard to the Stability Pact, whether there is a possibility for migration expenditure which could also be discussed. Ms. Le Pen arrived at 9:25 a.m., left at 9:47 a.m., so she did not hear my speech. I will make a copy of it, but I cannot answer it, because it is not there now. With regard to tax rulings, the Luxembourg Presidency could have gone further, in particular by taking into account all tax rulings, including exclusively national ones. For the terms that have been used for Luxembourg, I will not comment on them, it does not deserve it. Ms. Bérès, you asked a question about the financing of terrorism. I fully agree that this must be a priority for 2016, and Luxembourg fully supports it as well. As far as the PNR is concerned, President Juncker has just said that cooperation between the intelligence services must exist and must work. We're talking about it. It would be important to move forward. Finally, with regard to the question of THE Member of Parliament, Mr. Lopez Aguilar: yes, VAT fraud should be criminalised. Mr. Speaker, let me just say that I want to thank you for the praise that has been given to the government and to the public servants. Of course, some would have preferred us to go further, while others felt that we had gone too far.

If the rules are no longer fit for purpose, then we have to let them go and simply review them.  I am happy that this report gives strong support to the sharing economy, but it also expresses concerns at the existing barriers that are created by Member States, hindering its growth instead of adapting their existing framework to ensure competition. We must keep in mind that the big multinational companies have the tools to comply with the different sets of rules, but Europe’s economy is based on small- and medium-sized companies, and these are the companies that are hurt the most by the barriers. I expect the Commission to be proactive in keeping the integrity of the single market. This is not only needed for the sharing economy, but also for the next wave of innovation, such as big data and the internet of things. If Europe does not have a plan for this, if we fail to have a joint approach on standardisation, cyber-security and also the free flow of data, then we will miss out on its potential. It is vital for growth and competitiveness.  I also expect the Commission to work hard to preserve the internet as an open and neutral platform for innovation and communication. By clearly backing the limited liability of the intermediaries, we state that internet providers should not do the work of law enforcement agents. It is crucial to prevent censorship and also to protect freedom of expression, but everything relies on the empowered users, which is also an important aspect of this report.  We need to make sure that citizens have better control over the use of their data and that switching between service providers is facilitated, but also that users are pushed to have basic levels of security such as end-to-end encryption and software updates. It is our responsibility to empower citizens, but it is certainly not our responsibility to tell people how they should live their lives, what to do and which services they should use. This is why our Group is strongly against paragraph 8, and I hope that colleagues can support our Amendment 24, because at the end of the day it is the individual who decides when to put down their phone. Instead, we should focus on how to make life easier for the citizens, and e-government is a good example of that. The principle of providing information to the public authorities only once is a good example of this. It is so important that Parliament is asking for it to be applied.  There is so much to tell on such a broad report, but I will stop here. Thank you again. I look forward to the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 37, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Evelyne Gebhardt", "mepid": "1913", "text": "   Rapporteur. Mr President, I would like to thank the Thank you for the good cooperation to Mrs Kallas. I also find it remarkable that the sharing economy has now taken on such a great importance in her speech, when she did not want to talk about it at the beginning. It turns out, then, that discussions are always very good. I would also like to start with this. This is a subject area that is totally absent from the European Commission's communication. And in this area, labour law, social law – when we think of crowdworking and so on – is an issue that we must not neglect, in which we really need to move forward. Ladies and gentlemen, it is very important that we establish this digital single market very well and very Europeanly, because this internal market is simply boundless. When it comes to purchases, we say very clearly: yes, we think it is good that the European Commission made proposals on 9 December on how we can move forward in this area. However, and we will decide this afterwards, this does not mean that we will accept that there are different rights for offline and online purchases. This is only a cause for confusion for consumers and, above all, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which we want to support in these areas. Here, too, we cannot proceed as the European Commission imagines. We will have to work very this once again. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Where we agree with the European Commission, where we would also like to thank Mr Ansip very much, is that we must combat geo-blocking. It is absolutely unacceptable for citizens to be prevented from using the internal market because they have the wrong address, because they have the wrong nationality, or because their credit card has been issued in the wrong country. This is not the Europe of citizens, the Europe of freedom of movement that we need and that we want to take forward. Here, too, we will have to work very closely together in order to be able to move forward with everything that is possible. In the area of digital content, too, the fragmentation of the law that we have is unacceptable. That is why we must ensure that some of the business models that we currently have lead to monopolies, because there can be no competition at European level. And we also want citizens to be able to use it throughout the European Union simply and simply, if they have bought a subscription somewhere. Otherwise, we will not have a European Union, no freedom of movement, which is so important to us and which we always say must be taken forward. Another area – I cannot mention all of us in four minutes, but I am counting on my fellow Members: there was also a point of contention in our discussions, that was the principle of electronic administration, of public services. We must ensure that we really take forward the simplifications that the digital world brings us. However, the once-only principle is a principle that needs to be reconsidered very carefully, because it is also a matter of data protection. There will also be constitutional problems in some states, and we will then have to proceed very, very carefully in these areas. Yes to simplification, but in such a way that the data protection and the constitutions of the Member States in these areas are still genuinely respected. We still have a lot of work to do. Unfortunately, my time is already over. We would have had much more to say about this report. However, I would like to thank you once again for the good cooperation with all the rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and the staff who have also brought their customs.

We have focused on a number of key issues such as ensuring equal access; ensuring that governance systems around Europe and services to citizens are primarily digital according to a policy we have called digital first; ensuring tax harmonisation, which is certainly a priority if we really want a normal trend in business location and e-commerce growth; ensure that the delay in the development of digital skills, which are so important both on the fruition side and on the production side of digital services, is overcome. We have focused on supporting innovation, on innovators who then have a responsibility to create new businesses in Europe or to grow them, some possibly at important levels, capable of being a beacon, even visible in the global market.

It is clear that digital change is not sustainable, but it is manifold. However, clear analyses must also be carried out. What are the implications for the work of the future, as well as for future social systems? The Commission still has a lot of homework to do.

I believe that it will make day-to-day transport and logistics smoother, safer, more resource-efficient and more sustainable. Although the transport sector has been improving the collection and usability of traffic data for a long time, this decade is an unprecedented redefinition of mobility, supply and demand as various mobility services based on digital platforms and traffic automation arrive.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The profound change caused by digitalisation can also be observed well in radio and television and is far from over.  Mobile phones and the Internet have pushed young people's television use into third place in the preferred media. Audiovisual content is more in demand than ever, has gained in suggestion and opinion-forming power, but is increasingly being disseminated via the Internet.  If we want public and private and television providers to continue to be relevant to public opinion, to contribute to the promotion of freedom of expression and media pluralism, we must further open up access to the non-linear online world.  That is why the revision of the audiovisual media services directive is essential and overdue. Our important key points in this report are laid down by a large majority.  But we also need to ensure that digitalisation is a success for the diverse cultural and creative industries. The key to this is copyright, which properly and fairly enshrines the change in value creation and strikes a fair balance between users, intermediaries and authors.

It means that we have not achieved the real turning point, to say that we need stronger solutions, more harmonised in some areas, as decisions on 5G spectrum development and text and data mining development have been scarce. On the other hand, however, we have made progress in the right direction, have begun working faster on the e—Privacy Directive and have established equilibrium between privacy protection, security needs and business opportunities in the era of big data.

We need to ensure European people, consumers, companies and industry can benefit from a truly functioning Digital Single Market. This is a top priority of this Commission. It is also an area where Europe and the European project have many positive stories to tell. That is why working closely and early enough with the co-legislators is key for success. I would like to thank the rapporteurs and all other Members of the European Parliament involved in this report. The Digital Single Market strategy identifies 16 key initiatives. In December 2015, we already presented a Communication on copyright with a legislative proposal on cross-border portability. This means that we want to ensure that subscribers to online content services can access what they have paid for while temporarily present in another Member State.  The copyright communication sets out political objectives and areas of action, with concrete measures and a timeline. We have also made legislative proposals for new rules to improve protection for consumers who buy digital content or goods online across the European Union and to help businesses to expand their online sales. As you can see, we are already delivering important elements of the Digital Single Market. This will continue through 2016. In addition to a common and comprehensive solution to geo-blocking, we want to simplify VAT payments for companies and also promote efficient and affordable parcel delivery. Geo-blocking goes against the very idea of a single market, without borders or discrimination based on nationality or place of residence. Beyond consumers, start-ups and SMEs, we also want to support European industry in embracing digital transformation. This is key for growth and jobs. Industry is a pillar of the European economy. It is also important to focus on the skills of the workforce. In the next month, we will review the rules which apply to telecoms, audiovisual and e-privacy. We will improve cybersecurity, leverage cloud computing activities, support the development of a European Science Cloud and enable free flow of data.

We are worryingly losing out on Asia and the USA in the digital economy. Europe needs more investment in high-speed networks. We must ensure that new digital services are on the same page as traditional products and services. This applies, for example, to electronic books. They must be taxed in the same way as a traditional book.  We must also create a regulatory environment that encourages the development of new innovations and services in Europe. We must ensure that we do not create too much regulation, but that we are agile and flexible enough to take advantage of all these new opportunities that the Internet brings. I am particularly pleased that Parliament, in its own report, wants to get rid of unjustified geo-blocking, that is, the use of land restrictions. It is important for consumers and businesses that digital services should also move across borders in Europe, just like other services.

Where is Europe growing from? Where do Europeans get jobs? Where are the more functional public services? And where do European young people believe in the future?  In the midst of these challenges, opportunities must be seizened, and here we have one possibility. For the S&amp;D Group, it is an opportunity to create new jobs and growth through the digital market. Over the past few years, the digital economy has grown clearly faster than many other sectors. High-quality jobs have been created in the digital sector. In this respect, the Commission's priorities are in line. The position now taken by the committees sees the digital single market strategy as an opportunity to create a fairer and safe digital society. We can bridge the digital divide that has already emerged - be it infrastructure or the skills of citizens. All citizens must have access to the digital service – both public and private services must be available. We must ensure that digitalisation does not become a new area of social exclusion; Europe must climb back to the forefront of digitalisation with the fifth generation of 5G telecommunications networks. Sensible solutions must aim to make Europe the most advanced and secure infrastructure in the world. The package now being adopted supports the emergence of European innovation, the construction of critical infrastructure in Europe and the guarantee of a secure and open Internet for citizens and businesses.  European funds play an important role, both in research and development and in accelerating investment in infrastructure where the market does not cover connectivity. European solutions are needed, because what good is the internal market or digital services if they are always at the borders of countries. European content must be made available to Europeans, and we believe that fair value added distribution can also be found through new applications.  The potential of digitalisation must also be exploited in industry. Investments in high-speed networks lay the foundations as the industrial internet and the Internet of Things bring new solutions to production and everyday life. In order to succeed in international competition, existing European industry must also become digitalised. According to the Commission's research, companies doing so are moving fewer jobs abroad or letting people go.  As an engineer, I could only talk about technological change, but digitalisation is first and foremost a change in society that requires strong political leadership.  Parliament is heavily involved in the creation of digital society rules through a number of new legislative projects. And what is important to us in the S&amp;D Group is that digitalisation is a natural new beginning for growth, health services, education, the development of peripheral regions, forms of energy efficiency services and so on.

Traditional distinctions between businesses and consumers and between market incumbents and new entrants are evolving and mutating. This brings new challenges, but any rules we set must help underpin the digital economy, not undermine it. We should work with existing rules where possible, address the risks and not put a handbrake on the innovators or add more costs. Most of Parliament’s report follows this positive tone, which I support. Unfortunately, some of the Commission’s recent actions are not quite so sensible. Their proposal for digital purchases creates a two—tier structure between online and offline sales and, just at a time when we wanted to build consumer trust, this risks creating confusion.

It is not an easy report, but I wonder whether the Commission's plans are really sufficient to ensure equal access to the Digital Single Market for all.

I believe that this must be felt everywhere if we really want to develop the internal market fairly for all those involved. Three things are important to us. Firstly, we believe that the dinosaur geoblocking belongs in the museum, and completely. We believe that this does not, for example, ensure cultural diversity, but on the contrary prevents it when we think, for example, of minorities and access to TV channels. Geoblocking leads to the end of illegal downloads being made – which is another reason why it has to go. Secondly, we have been committed to free software from the very beginning. Unfortunately, this has not been reflected. However, it would be important to promote this, to promote it more, because it will be associated with greater control, including for users.

It is to empower people and to ensure that the technological projects of globalisation benefit all, and not just the few. Parliament recalls in this report that is not just the market and profit-seeking enterprises that can provide solutions. The strategy will not be comprehensive if it does not take into account solutions based on the commons. There is open-source software that improves interoperability, security and control over technology. Community WiFi projects provide connectivity, even in remote areas, and crowd-funding allows communities to fund innovation without the dependence on big investors. Finally, net neutrality and universal internet access are the basis for the Digital Single Market to function, so some regulation of the market is necessary to ensure that new technologies in commercial undertakings safeguard fundamental rights. But it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel when dealing with online intermediaries. In many areas, such as liability, we already have functioning legislation. We must recognise that the internet is more than just a big shopping centre. The successful digital strategy emphasises the strength of the internet: the free exchange of knowledge and collaboration.

Secondly, there is the impact on tax law, on the world of work, and, of course, on the question: 'What is innovation?' I would like to make it quite clear here that, of course, innovation is also linked to disruption, i.e. the demolition of existing markets, but disruption alone is not yet innovation.

If we ask ourselves today why digital Europe has long lagged behind the United States and, more recently, Asia, the answer is that we have not trusted our citizens enough and have given our businesses too little freedom.

The convergence of the media has led to major changes in the entire media landscape. It is important to create a fair framework for all, because in the field of audiovisual media, a distinction between linear and non-linear media services has become obsolete.

Data is essential in the development of the digital economy; massive data analysis: Big Data. Data exchange is the cornerstone, the cornerstone, to the point that the profession of data analyst is now the most in demand in the world – according to a study from the World Economic Forum a few weeks ago.  In this sense, that being the case, it is necessary to take into account the transport of data: the data is transported, circulated, arrives through networks; networks that are the infrastructure of the digital economy. Transport used to be by road, it was by air, it was by sea. In the digital economy, transport is carried out through networks that rely on a radio spectrum and priority must be given to the entire development of mobile networks through pro-innovation, pro-investment policies, in a context of competitive markets.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Olga Sehnalová (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "96718", "text": "   – Mr President, I am speaking as shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.

Digitization means greater security and comfort of travel, it has its place in the field of more efficient logistics or tourism. The challenges of education and staff requirements, as well as those related to the availability of new technologies, are also current in the transport sector, as is the requirement that we do not create new barriers instead of facilitating life.

That is really important, but so are accessibility and affordability. We have seen that and heard about that, and about equality. On skills: we must make sure that the digital skills gap does not become a digital chasm. We must ensure that our citizens have ICT. Let me give an example, 55 000 job vacancies exist in the UK just now in ICT, and that is set to grow to 171 000 vacancies by 2020. We must ensure that our citizens have the skills and mind-set.

Digitisation must be and remain a priority in 2016. We need to create the framework to fully exploit the potential of the European Digital Single Market. We know there is still a massive need to catch up. If I can say on my own that 44% of households do not have access to fast Internet, that means that we still have massive catching up to do, especially in terms of infrastructure development. Only 14% of SMEs sell over the Internet because there are barriers to the market and market barriers. We need to dismantle them. Colleagues had raised the issue of geo-blocking. Tax legislation is important. We need more coordination, especially in the area of VAT payments, which we must simplify. We also need to make it easier to make payments where possible. In other words, the relevant directive, the Payment Services Directive, must be implemented quickly. But it is equally important – a second comment – that we create an ecosystem for start-ups and venture capitalists. We are currently running the DLD conference in Munich. This is one of the major international conferences dealing with trends and developments and the digital lifestyle. We must – and I keep hearing this from the conference and those who are there – give young creative minds the chance to realise their ideas here in Europe and prevent them from migrating to the United States.

However, it will serve as a useful guide to the Commission's future legislative proposals under its digital strategy.   The main objective of the new legislation must be the merging offline and online markets. It is especially important that consumers have the same rights and protections when buying their things on the Internet or in traditional stores.   Unfortunately, this priority is not advocated in the Commission's first legislative proposals. I believe that increasing consumer confidence in online services and online stores will also increase confidence in digitalisation in general. This will allow Europe to innovate and impose eGovernment systems and applications, internet of things, eHealth. As MEPs, we have expressed our commitment to a digital Europe and now I think it is also the turn for national governments to promote trust in member states.

In this context, the revision of the copyright directives, the AVMS Directive, will be decisive in order to clarify some important aspects. The definition of unjustified geo-blocking, the compatibility between portability and territorial licences for the financing of cinematographic works, a balanced review of copyright and exceptions, the overcoming in the AVMS Directive of the distinction between linear and non-linear services, the clear difference between platforms and the provision of providers of online media and audiovisual platforms and user interfaces to be brought under the AVMS Directive if it is an audiovisual media service in order to preserve European cultural diversity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 94, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Carlos Coelho (PPE).", "mepid": "1892", "text": "   – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indisputable that the rapid evolution of the Internet and communications has changed the way we communicate, how we do business and how we consume within the internal market.

As well as the fact that digitalisation and the sharing economy present opportunities, they also present challenges. The boundaries between workers and contractors are blurring. As a result, labour law and collective agreements are becoming more difficult to apply. It may be very unclear what really applies.

In Europe we were able to create a single market in a physical sense. We were able to tear down all those barriers dividing our Member States. But a digital single market does not exist. Our economy is becoming more and more digital every day, so we can see how those barriers are coming back. Those barriers get higher and higher every day.  There is a sense of urgency here in Parliament and in the Commission. We made our first two proposals in December. We have to give legal access to digital content to our people, and that is why we have made the portability proposal. The second proposal concerned digital contract rules. Instead of having potentially 56 different rules, we proposed establishing two different rules dealing with online sales of tangible goods and online sales of digital content.   We will make our next proposal on 700 MHz in February. I hope that in March we will be able to make our first proposal about industries. We will propose our industrial package, which will also deal with the usual cloud communication and ICT priority standards. In April, I hope that we will propose a new e-government action plan, and in May, the regulation on consumer protection cooperation, including the e-commerce package, measures in the area of parcel delivery, and geo-blocking. In June, we will make a second copyright proposal on improving cross—border access to digital content, but we will also deal with libraries, educational exceptions, disabled people and of course text and data mining. We will also make a proposal in June on the review of the Satellite and Cable Directive, the review of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and on the ‘follow the money’ principle, which will be part of our copyright reform, as well as on the role of platforms in the market, including illegal content on the internet. In June and July, there will be proposals about the Cybersecurity PPP (Public—Private Partnership) and the reform of telecom rules. This will also be about infrastructure. In November, there will be proposals on the free flow of data, the review of the e-Privacy Directive, and VAT regimes. I hope in that in December we will not make any new proposals on the basis of the Digital Single Market strategy.  I am looking forward to having really fruitful cooperation with you in creating a Digital Single Market for Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 112, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Kaja Kallas", "mepid": "124697", "text": "   rapporteur. – Mr President, I think it is very important that so many Committees have been involved in drafting this report and giving their opinions and that so many Members have been involved in voicing their concerns. I would like to reflect on a few issues that were touched upon here.  First of all, I think we should all understand that the internet is not just a big shopping centre. It has so many layers regarding cultural diversity, innovation and research. E-commerce is also important, but it is not all about that. Some Members have complained that some topics are not emphasised enough in the report. I think what is important is that we have achieved a balance; all the topics are covered and they strike a balance in the report.  Some have voiced concerns about the once-only principle in regard to data protection. Actually, I think it has a positive effect on data protection because data is not kept in one single big database but similar small databases communicating with each other, so that is important. This is how things should work in the digital age: people should be in charge of their data when they talk to the public authorities.  Also, I think, what is very important is that the user and the citizen is at the heart of the system and they have the control. On the sharing economy, it changes employment rules, that is for certain, but we have to see the positive effects as well. It increases autonomy for people, people are not working under control of somebody but for themselves. So this is a positive thing which we should also embrace.

I think that we are here at the beginning of a work on the Digital Single Market – we still have a great deal ahead of us. I would also like to thank the European Commission for informing us of the steps that are to be taken, and that is right and proper. We must be clear about one thing time and again: we do not want the Digital Single Market to be an end in itself, but we want an internal market that is there for the people, for the citizens. Whether they are cultural workers, consumers, workers or service providers. We must always focus on this: to make the best of it, to make the most of it, to succeed, to really seize the opportunities that we need in global competition with the digital market, so that we really have good and sensible growth and, in fact, the creation of good jobs in the European Union. That is what we have to achieve, what we have to achieve. That is why we must be ambitious, much more ambitious than the European Commission. Some of my fellow Members have already done so. We will all work together to ensure that this is the case. Finally, I would like to make one more comment, so that no false impression is given.

As a result, many companies have decided not to sell through the network in the Canary Islands, despite the obligation of European and Spanish legislation to do so throughout the national territory for any company that trades within the EU.

Existing collective agreements must apply the same to digital workers. Member States must ensure this and, where appropriate, adapt national labour and social rights. We want to avoid that Work 4.0 does not become a family 4.0. The right to unreachability and rest periods must apply to every EU citizen. The explosion of atypical employment contracts and precarious employment must be avoided, minimum wages (where available), rules for participation, health and protection at work must be guaranteed. Employee data protection needs to be further developed.

A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas.

A side effect of this trend is a reduction in tuna stocks in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, so this problem directly affects the European Union. The main countries involved in tuna fishing are Spain, France, Italy, Croatia, Greece, Portugal, Malta and Cyprus. Overfishing has led to a drastic reduction in the abundance of this species in the ecosystem.  In 2006, the first long-term, 15-year plan was established to protect stocks and increase the tuna population. According to scientific research, the tuna population first increased in 2015.

Applying to them the logic used to regulate corporations is wrong. Such a logic makes traditional fisheries appear not to be viable, when they are. Speaking from the experience of Malta, this has needlessly disrupted the work of fishing communities and weakened the social fabric that kept them cohesive. In recent years, the traditional fishing community has been decimated. Quotas, new licences and rules were applied on its operations according to Union directives. Aquaculture as a source of additional fish supplies is welcome. But economically and socially, it offers no compensation for the loss of traditional fishing.

On the other hand, there is a real democracy, where there is civilisation, and where a competitive policy is maintained and enforced by the state, where entrepreneurs have equal opportunities, regardless of the circles of friends and networks they belong to.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 508, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Andrejs Mamikins (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124746", "text": "   – Mr President, i would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur The European Union's competition policy is, to some extent, one of the crucial sectors at Community level.

Companies must be prevented from sending their profits to tax havens and must be obliged to keep it in the country or countries where they made this profit, precisely so that they can be taxed.

In addition, it is suggested that the fight against tax evasion should be accompanied by a European mechanism. In addition to these good intentions, the report supports strengthening the European Parliament's involvement through the codecision procedure.  However, all of these proposals are only elements of a strategy to strengthen the European single market which is the basis of the European deregulation as we know it.

THE EU's competition policy does not prevent the concentration of economic and financial power in the hands of the few. On the contrary, this is the dynamics of the whole process of integration, given its capitalist nature. Subjecting most public services and strategic sectors of the economy to EU competition policy and its single market has served the objectives of large private economic groups wishing to take ownership of these services and sectors, making them subject to the logic of the incessant demand for maximum profit and minimum cost. Under the false pretext of unfair competition or distortions of competition, this policy has resulted in legislation aimed at preventing public and democratic control of the strategic sectors of the economy and promoting universal, free and quality public services. We support the call to put an end to social dumping, but it is all EU policy that runs counter.

A good knowledge of cultural realities, with a full understanding of their diversity, is an element enabling crisis prevention and an extremely effective tool in resolving conflicts and bringing about peace. An important element to achieve this will be the education of skills by including relevant content in educational programmes, providing training and workshops. However, effective intercultural dialogue also requires financial support. I would therefore like to recall once again the importance of equipping existing, excellent examples of promoting cultural exchanges and intercultural dialogue with appropriate funds, within the framework of EU programmes such as Erasmus+ and the Urban Partnership funded by the Europe for Citizens programme.

Such are, for example, the Commission's capital markets union initiative and the investment package, which will have to be based on the financial markets regime to be established to this day.  The upgraded regulation should also be friendly to SMEs, key generators of economic growth in the EU, and resources to finance real sector projects should be greatly strengthened. This is the only one that will allow growth to continue and unemployment will be reduced.  Lastly, regulation of financial markets must also be strengthened, which must not in turn lead to additional costs for the real economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 983, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Simona Bonafè (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124814", "text": "  in writing. \\u2012 The revision of the financial services regulation gives us the opportunity to take stock of the situation and to propose improvements in an area which, as the financial crisis has shown, has an increasing impact on the real economy.

With a view to creating a Capital Markets Union, too, we need clearer and more effective legislation, but also more transparent and coherent legislation, capable of creating a more investment-friendly environment, and also providing for the creation of new channels of access to credit, from which small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups in particular can benefit.

The transposition of financial regulation and reforms into national legislation needs to be accelerated, as it is an effective and effective framework for financial services, both at national and EU level, a guarantee of financial stability and a precondition for increasing investment and boosting growth in a competitive European economy. In doing so, it is important to take into account that the number and complexity of the rules is not exaggerated, which could cause problems in the form of their different interpretations by individual Member States or the unevenness with EU regulation. The solution imposed in this regard is a comprehensive approach to the regulation of financial services in the Union.  Building more functional financial markets that respond to the financial needs of the real economy is particularly necessary because of the stability of financial services provision, thus contributing to their better availability to SMEs and start-ups which, in my opinion, must remain the focus of the Union as the main generators of economic growth and the reduction of unemployment.

This solution struck a good balance between the three fundamental objectives in overseeing financial regulation: protecting consumers and investors, creating new credit channels for the real economy (especially SMEs), and identifying barriers that persist in trade in financial services.  In particular, I welcome the requirement for regular checks on proportionality, consistency and coherence with a view to simplifying existing regulation of financial services in order to make them simpler and more in line with the needs of SMEs. In Croatia, for example, there are major problems with the illiquidity of small and medium-sized enterprises, capital constraints and often with poor level of information of those embarking on an entrepreneurial venture. From this perspective, an important part of the text also relates to identifying a key role in the search for alternative sources of financing for SMEs, in particular in the form of venture capital use.

The still ongoing crisis has led to unprecedented negative consequences, especially for the real economy and taxpayers' money.  It is therefore of utmost impact to develop an effective and effective financial services framework that guarantees financial stability, as this is a precondition for increasing long-term investment and boosting growth in a competitive European economy. Care should be taken to ensure that effective and effective financial services rules in the EU are harmonised, consistent (including on a cross-sectoral basis), proportionate, should not be duplicated, deprived of unnecessary complexity and such as not leading to legal uncertainty, regulatory arbitrage and high transaction costs.

The European Union must promote policies that eliminate inequality and the pay gap; that truly facilitate family reconciliation, building a utility network, helping women develop their full human and labour potential, whatever they want to devote themselves to, and not through incentives to cover economic sectors, as the economy is interested in at the time.  The austerity policies implemented in recent years by the Union and by many of its Member States have severely punished the living conditions of many citizens and women bear the brunt in the family, at work and in poverty rates.  It is time for the idea that women, through their effort, dedication and submission, are the wild card that serves to patch this unjust society economically and socially and that only brings us the growth of inequality in society, and we are seeing it every day. Therefore, female entrepreneurship, yes; and help for whoever wants it and all the necessary support, too; but exploitation of women, no.

Colleagues have pointed out some of the reasons, but one of them is confidence, and I that is something that has been ingrained over the years. Therefore, we have to change the circumstances; we have to remove the hurdles, as they are called in this report, so that males and females can become entrepreneurs on equal standing. The same applies to access to finance. Again, there is a perception that maybe the female entrepreneurs are not getting the same opportunities to get finance as males do when they want to start up, and this obviously has to change.

The potential of female entrepreneurship is great, but there are also major obstacles that women face in trying to start their own business.

It should not be assumed that women do not want to be entrepreneurs, but rather that they are discouraged from doing so by external circumstances.

Moreover, as the report points out, it would be a good idea to promote social entrepreneurship.  Available data show that women are much more likely to choose to set up social enterprises because they are better suited to their sense of vulnerability and investment strategy. In turn, the experience gained in this sector of the economy will help some of them move to the traditional economy sector.

An entrepreneurial person is an ambitious, confident and effective man striving to achieve his goals. In the labour sector, entrepreneurship usually means doing your own business – company, company, company – as opposed to being employed by an employer.  Eurobarometer data show that the entrepreneurship rate in the European Union (12%) is still half as low as in China or the US (27% and 21% respectively) despite raising entrepreneurship to a political priority. Moreover, among Europeans who own a business, only a third are women. At the same time, it is women who are more likely than men to set up businesses – this can be explained by the desire to reconcile work and private life, after all, self-employment is usually more flexible in terms of working hours, holidays or opportunities to work from home. The obstacles faced by enterprising women should therefore be eliminated, as stereotypes such as less skills or less resilience to pressure among women result in a lack of confidence in certain entities, e.g. banks refusing to grant investment credit.

Effective gender equality is achieved only through the effective fight against stereotypical perceptions, violence and inequality in the workplace and in job opportunities, since the majority of people who flood part-time jobs and flexible forms of work are women.

At the same time, there are 2 million people who are in the eu-25. Vacancies. This situation poses a serious threat to the EU's social cohesion and economic development. When discussing this situation, the following factors should be taken into account: globalisation, demographic change, economic crises, new technologies and changes in work organisation. Business creation and self-employment are also an opportunity to participate in the labour market. Skill building is a multifaceted process that requires a holistic approach and a cross-border shift in sectoral policies. Changes in the labour market require more flexible education systems that enable them to complement and develop knowledge and skills at all stages of their professional careers. Access to the labour market and work continues to consist of two types of skills: general skills (adaptability, learning to learn, initiative and entrepreneurship, communication skills) and specific skills related to specific positions or work.

However, unfortunately, what we are seeing is too slow, especially in the youth unemployment, which is still extremely high and worrying. There are still almost five million young people out of work from the EU. Solutions to reduce youth unemployment will not come overnight, as the causes of this are multifaceted and complex. One of the reasons is education systems, which are quite rigid in many Member States and do not reflect the labour market situation.  In Slovenia, this is undoubtedly the case, as is reflected in the problem highlighted by the report - on the one hand, high youth unemployment, on the other hand, vacancies. Therefore, in my opinion, it is crucial to tackle youth unemployment properly in reforming education systems and adapting them to a dynamic environment. We need more interdisciplinary skills, the transfer of entrepreneurial skills, the acquisition of practical experience during schooling, etc. At the same time, educational institutions also need to be more quickly linked to the economic sector, especially in countries with less developed vocational education systems.

The current crisis is also closely linked to European education systems, which are often far removed from the economic sector. We therefore need an education policy capable of reforming university institutions, making them closer to the needs of the production system. To this end, a link between higher education institutions and companies, including in the field of economic support, could certainly facilitate a more efficient placement of young people in the labour market.

Whereas the lack of skills relevant to the available jobs and the inadequate learning and training are important factors causing unemployment among young people and whereas, without the creation of quality, sustainable and efficient jobs in Europe, it is not possible to solve the youth employment crisis, it is then of great importance to strengthen European efforts to create mechanisms to promote young employment in Europe.  In this regard, I believe that it is essential to create policies that better adapt existing qualifications to the needs of the labour market; create quality jobs and support education and training systems, which are regarded as fundamental rights.

As a socialist, I am particularly pleased with the request we sent to the Commission to seriously consider working conditions in the sharing economy and the parcel sector, as we cannot accept low levels of protection for workers.

It also has more cross-cutting objectives, such as when it asks the Commission to launch a study on the side effects of digitisation (i.e. on the development of children's cognitive abilities).  But it dismisses the most controversial issues, such as the impossibility of reconciling the principle of territoriality of copyrights and the end of geographical blockage.

Digital services and their impact on global competitiveness can only be compared at the beginning of the industrial age. Countries that were unable to respond to or encourage the development of industrial production in the 18th and 19th centuries were late in the industrial age and therefore had to struggle to catch more insight. And no natural physical sizes, such as the size of the territory, rich culture or long history, could compensate for the fact that the state was unable to start industrialization in time.  Exactly the same applies to the digital market. If we do not manage to create conditions for the development of digital businesses, the conditions that allow it is for European companies to become leaders in the global digital market, we will lose the digital race. And no sizes, such as the territory of the EU, cultural heritage or current prosperity, will help us. I therefore welcome this own-initiative document by Parliament, which highlights the main challenges of creating a digital market. In this, we not only call for administrative restrictions on business to be reduced, but we note another important element: the quality of governance.

The report responds to the Communication from the European Commission within the broader initiative, which sees the creation of a digital single market, which aims to give concrete form to the concept of European citizenship also at digital level. I think it is particularly important that Parliament has decided to plan the future development of the digital single market on the basis of three fundamental concepts such as equality, participation and trust, around which the very nature of 'digital citizenship' must be built if it is to be stable and to work. European citizens will only learn to exploit the potential of the digital single market if they feel that they are adequately protected and if we can ensure that the same rights apply to consumers, and in particular buyers, as they can in the daily life of trade. For these reasons, I voted in favour.  The Commission document paves the way for a comprehensive set of subsequent legislative initiatives.

I am pleased that, by the end of the current year, the European Commission aims to complete all 16 Digital Single Market initiatives. We must remove the barriers that prevent companies from exploiting the entire European market and thus offer consumers more choice. This is how the European economy and consumers win. If we want the Digital Single Market to have a chance of success, we need to start trusting citizens and businesses in the digital economy. Investments in the infrastructure of the next generation of ICT and the expansion of existing ones such as 4G and the fibre network are also key. Making high-speed Internet connections at competitive prices is key to the development of the digital market. The removal of obstacles to the cross-border development of e-commerce is essential.

Whether it was the refugee and migration crisis, EMU reform or Brexit, in all of these discussions we made some progress but for sure not enough. Let us have no doubt that 2016 will also be overshadowed by these challenges. Our community is experiencing a stress test. And what is most challenging is that we are being tested on all possible fronts at the same time. Today, let me say it loud and clear. I will not rest until we work out solutions to all these challenges. Our strength comes from our unity. Therefore, keeping European unity will continue to be my main goal in 2016. Let me start with the migration and refugee crisis, an existential challenge for the EU. As you remember, I have emphasised for months, in fact from the very beginning of the migration crisis, that there is no good alternative to border protection. This is a conditio sine qua non of any effective migration policy. Unless we can guard Europe’s external border properly, we will fail as a political community. After the December European Council, we can be a bit more optimistic. The leaders’ discussion concentrated on ways and means of strengthening external border control. All leaders acknowledge that protecting Schengen requires difficult decisions. In this context, we agreed to rapidly examine the Commission’s proposal of strengthening the EU’s external borders, including the idea of the European Border Guard. This is a priority for the Dutch Presidency and we should have political agreement in the Council by June. The agreement by Greece to accept a Rapid Border Intervention Team from Frontex already in December is another indication that we have started to move in the right direction when it comes to guarding the external border. Despite political progress, I have to admit that there is a clear delivery deficit on many fronts, from hotspots and security screening in frontline countries to relocation and returns. The action plan with Turkey, although promising, is still to bear fruit. I share the sentiment expressed by Prime Minister Rutte that we have no more than two months to get things under control. The statistics over the Christmas period are not encouraging, with over 2 000 arrivals in the EU per day, according to Frontex. The March European Council will be the last moment to see if our strategy works. If it does not, we will face grave consequences such as the collapse of Schengen. For sure, this kind of alternative to our strategy is not pleasant, and so I appeal that Member States implement the strategy in full. Let me turn to the UK. In December, leaders had a substantive and constructive discussion on the UK question. Prime Minister Cameron set out his position in detail, in particular regarding benefits and free movement. He explained his request for a model based on four years and reiterated the openness to alternative solutions, but only if they achieve the same objective. Leaders voiced their concerns on specific issues, but also demonstrated willingness to look for compromises. Building on this positive debate, we agreed to work together to find solutions in all four baskets raised by Prime Minister Cameron: relations with the euro area, sovereignty, competitiveness, and on benefits and free movement. Hard work on all these baskets is progressing and, as we speak, my people are working with the Commission to bring us closer to the solution. In the run-up to the February European Council, I will table a concrete proposal for a deal with the UK to all EU leaders. Let me stress again that from the very beginning of these negotiations I have been very clear. There will be no compromise on fundamental values like non-discrimination and free movement. At the same time, I will do everything in my power to find a satisfactory solution, also for the British side. As of today, the result of the referendum is more unpredictable than ever before. Time is of the essence here, and this is why I will work hard to strike a deal already in February. It will not be easy but it is still possible. The European Council also discussed counter-terrorism in the light of the Paris tragedy. These outrageous acts have only strengthened Europe’s resolve to fight terrorism. Leaders agreed to operationalise our policies, including systematically sharing information on foreign fighters through Schengen and Europol, as well as between Member States’ authorities. Security services should conduct a joint threat analysis if it can prevent future attacks. Europol has already reported a significant rise in information exchange on foreign fighters through its new Counter-Terrorism Centre with almost every Member State contributing data. Without vigilance and real cooperation, we cannot defeat this threat and the likelihood of further attacks remains very high. I urge all States to cooperate fully. The European Council was an opportunity for the leaders to assess the state of play in building the Energy Union. There is significant progress in the level of interconnections between states on the gas and electricity markets, including the parts of Europe that have been isolated until now. When I proposed the Energy Union concept as Polish Prime Minister, this was one of my major goals. I am happy to see clear progress, but still we need more. The European Council asked for all relevant legislation to be brought forward, including on strengthening the transparency on the gas market. Talking about the Energy Union, leaders had an exchange on the Nord Stream II project. Some of them were very critical, and we also discussed the conditions that need to be met by major energy infrastructure projects. We reiterated that any new infrastructure should be fully in line with the Energy Union objectives, not to mention the obvious obligation that all projects have to comply with all EU laws, including the third Energy Package. These are clear conditions for receiving support from the EU institutions or any Member State – political, legal or financial. Now the ball is in the court of the Commission, but the political message of the European Council is clear and goes in a similar direction to the position expressed by the European Parliament. Leaders praised President Hollande and congratulated him on the successful hosting of the COP21 and on the agreement of the first ever, legally-binding global climate deal. We have asked the Commission and the Council to assess fully what the Paris Agreement implies for our own energy and climate policy mix. Last, but certainly not least, the European Council addressed economic challenges. Leaders confirmed their commitment to work towards completing EMU further, based on the Five Presidents’ report. Even if Europe is overwhelmed by the migration crisis, we cannot afford to wait with the necessary EMU reforms for better days. In this spirit, ministers were asked to advance their work rapidly on a number of areas, including the Banking Union. The European Council also emphasised the importance of deepening the single market in key areas. Delivering a digital single market and building a capital markets union is our top priority. Finally, I want to warn against the increasingly alarmist rhetoric on the future of Europe. Neither naivety nor excessive pessimism will get Europe the results it needs. As Europeans, we have to be both realistic and confident about our values and beliefs. I am reminded of Arnold Toynbee’s famous remark that civilisations die from suicide, not by murder. Europe is stronger than some may think, and we still have the power and the public mandate to do what is necessary. (Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1914, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Commission President. Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, after the words of the President of the European Council, if I were to sum up in two words the conclusions of the last European Council - from migration to terrorism, from economic and monetary union to the United Kingdom, through external relations - I would say that they are the perfect reflection of a Europe in 'polycrise'. We have talked a lot in recent months about the Greek crisis, the refugee crisis and other crises, but Europe is actually facing a combination of multiple, complex, \"multi-strategic\" crises, coming from outside or inside the European Union, all of which are all occurring at the same time. We are clearly in a difficult situation, which calls for overcoming national selfishness and regaining the pioneering spirit of European integration, its momentum and solidarity. We can, if we wish, provide a responsible and united European response to the multiple crises we face. We can and must do so, because only more European solidarity will enable each of our countries to overcome these crises. This is essential if we are to preserve what we have benefited so far, for example our internal market or the Schengen area, and if we also want to bring elements that are still lacking to perfect European integration. Mr President, the Commission has already presented all the necessary elements to effectively manage the urgency of the refugee crisis. If they had already been implemented by the Member States, we would be in a much better situation today. That is why, when I hear that there is no European response to the refugee crisis, it is both false and true. That is not true, because the Commission, working in good intelligence with Parliament, has brought all the elements of a European response. That is true, because this response will only be effective and will have concrete results when all Member States move from words to action. Some, often very quick to criticise the Union and Brussels, as they say, must look in the mirror and see that, yes, Brussels is also them, the Member States and their governments. The lack of action by the Union is also due to the lack of implementation of the commitments made collectively on behalf of the Union. As the Council has pointed out, it is up to The Member States to accelerate our efforts to ensure that 'hotspots', relocation and resettlement are not empty concepts, but become genuine effective instruments for an orderly takeover of European migration management. I call once again on this Parliament to move forward with all the speed necessary in setting up a European border and coastguard corps.  At common borders, common management: if we do not understand this, Schengen will not survive. A Europe with internal borders is a time that today's young people did not know in their lifetime, and that is very well. That must not be changed. Internal borders, the Erasmus generation and the internet, these are things that do not go together. I am also not sure that the 1.7 million or so border workers who cross our borders on a daily basis would welcome the end of the Schengen area, nor that transport companies would like to suffer financial losses as a result of the reintroduction of borders. There are 24 million business trips to Europe a year, there are 57 million cross-border road transport a year, all of which costs money. The cost of non-Schengen is very high. It is not a program for growth and jobs, it is an anti-growth and employment agenda. Everything will have to be done to save this space, knowing that this requires a well-controlled European policy of legal migration. This is why the Commission will shortly present its proposals on legal migration and also a revision of the Dublin rules for asylum seekers. Herr President! Wenn es um den Schutz unserer Grenzen geht, dann reicht es nicht, sie nur von unserer Seite aus zu betrachten. Man muss die Grenzen der anderen, die Grenzen, die wir mit anderen teilen, auch mit deren Augen betrachten. Dann reichen nicht nur Gipfel - so wichtig diese auch sind.  Es braucht auch hartn-ckige, tagt-gliche Kleinarbeit. Nicht Arbeit an Absichtserkl-rungsformulierungen, sondern konkrete Kleinarbeit: Heizk-rper, Decken, gemeinsame Standards, gemeinsame Registrierung betreffend.  Ebenso beharrlich arbeiten wir auch mit der Turkei zusammen. Diese hat erste begràenswerte Schritte unternommen, um den gemeinsamen Aktionsplan umzusetzen. So hat sie unter anderem eine Visumpflicht fer Syrer aus Drittl-ndern eingef-hrt, und sie arbeitet daran, den Arbeitsmarkt fer syrische Flàchtlinge zu 'ffnen. Das sind sehr wichtige Schritte. Doch es bleibt noch schrecklich viel zu tun, um den Flàchtlingsstrom nachhaltig und spurbar zu reduzieren. Der gemeinsame Aktionsplan muss in Gànze umgesetzt werden, und zwar schnell! I do not like all the headlines I read day after day, but I have nothing against those headlines when they talk about hard work that produces good results. December's historic agreement on climate change demonstrated the European Union's capacity for global leadership. In Paris, the European Union worked hard for a deal that was ambitious and legally binding and that is what we have achieved, but the real work starts now. The Commission is assessing the Paris Agreement so that we can move on to agreeing on new steps. In the meantime, the EU Member States will have to continue setting the example and implementing current commitments, so we will need to collectively agree 2020 targets. Looking at the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union, the European Council held a constructive debate on the four sneakers that the British Government set out. Let me underline what I said at the time: none of those four sneakers are simple or easy to address and we are treating each of them seriously. But let me also underline that the Commission, as I said before, wants a fair deal for Britain. The Union is stronger with Britain inside and Britain is stronger inside the Union. That is why we think that the deal we are seeking has to be a fair deal for the European Union too. The Commission is working together with colleagues and representatives at the Council in that direction. I would like to conclude by paying tribute once more to the work of this Parliament. I have been witnessing this Parliament for more than 12 months now, and I have to say that our coordinated action is producing good results. And this Parliament has helped the Commission to deliver good results. When we needed speed and when we needed flexibility, flexibility for our new proposals, Parliament was there and Parliament delivered. I am grateful for this support and confidant that we will continue in the same spirit this year and in the next few years.

Nevertheless, i would like to begin by returning to what I also said in the December plenary speech, namely to remember the success stories, to encourage people that Europe can succeed together. I see Federica Mogherini sitting here, for example. I was a proud European politician a few days ago when I saw them together with the Iranian Foreign Minister to present the Iran deal, to make it clear that we, as Europeans, are contributing to peace in this world, that no nuclear weapons are produced. A great success for Europe - thank you for that! (Applause) In the Friday press conference of our President of the Commission, we saw the figures that the Juncker plan now epitomises. Thousands of businesses in Europe are now benefiting from the billions we have jointly committed. And Paris, as a symbol of the fight against climate change, is also a European success. That is why it is important that we remember this if we want to convince people of our project. In the December Council – this is my second point I want to raise – the debate on the United Kingdom was at the centre. I think that David Cameron has presented the ideas, the ideas very positively in the Council and has also made many friends. Many of the ideas that David Cameron is putting forward are ideas that can make Europe better if we tackle it together. I would like to express my support for what he said on competitiveness, innovation, better regulation, big and big things and small and small things. He has the full support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and we want success in this. Admittedly, it is becoming more difficult when it comes to social abuse issues. Everyone wants to fight against social abuse. However, I must also make it clear at the beginning of the year that we, as the PPE-DE, cannot tolerate discrimination against European citizens. We must succeed in this bridge. I have a fundamental question in the British debate that concerns me, because there is a great deal of discussion in London about the question of ever closer union. I understand the concerns that are also associated with this: more and more competences for Brussels, more and more power in Brussels – this is certainly being discussed critically. However, I would also ask you to read the text in its entiren way in the discussion that is taking place. It says: 'ever closer union' of 'peoples' – not of institutions, not of Brussels, not of states – of peoples.   And this is a perfect description of the idea of Europe. After the terrible wars that we have had on this continent, to say: people should come together – ever closer union of peoples. In this respect, I am also campaigning for the text to be read in full in the British debate, because it is a wonderful description of what we had as a lesson from the terrible wars of our continent. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise a third point: the great issue of migration. The guiding principles are clear to us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: if there is war in Syria, and 250 000 people have died, then this continent must help. There can be no border closure, where we no longer agree to help. On the other hand, we also know that the figures we have in many areas are challenging, are also too high and we need to return to reliable, sustainable figures. These are the two guardrails. I would like to make it clear on my group that we very much welcome the fact that the Commission has presented a number of legislative texts. We have a promise that, Mr President of the Commission, we will also process the proposals quickly in order to make it clear that Europe is delivering. What we need to do now is simply to implement and enforce the law. If only 40% of the 1.1 million people who have arrived, for example, in my own country, Germany – 1.1 million last year – are Syrians, then we must implement the law and ensure that those who have no reason to flee are not admitted to the European Union and also to be repatriated. We must also enforce law in a second respect. We all have the Cologne events of New Year's Eve in mind. Yes, we want to protect people, but it must be made clear that the one who breaks the law and who breaks the traditions, that is, the equality of men and women, does not respect culture in Europe, then its guest right must be forfeited and deported. That too must be clear. Thirdly, we must enforce the law on aid in the countries of origin. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this is an appeal, above all, to the Council. If the Council decides that we are funding EUR 3 billion for Turkey, that the Commission is making proposals, that the European Parliament is rapidly amending the budget, that we – Europe – are delivering the money, and then we are witnessing the tragedy that, for example, Italy is not prepared, or only by means of counter-trades, to actually transfer these promised funds, then that will damage the credibility of Europe and the European leaders. And that is why we are calling once again: this behaviour, especially by Matteo Renzi – And I must make it so clear – damages credibility, and this loss of credibility is the cause of populism in Europe. It is not that we are making promises, but this loss of credibility is the problem behind populism. We are ready to give answers. Let's get on with it in 2016!

The problem is that when one reads the conclusions of the Council in June, the Council in October or the informal meetings in September and November, one must read very carefully to realize that they are not the same conclusions.  It seems that we are doomed time and time again to follow the same sequence: the Commission prepares and proposes, the Member States meeting in the Council take decisions, and the Member States in their countries ignore and fail to comply with the decisions they have taken in the Council. This is the myth of Sisyphus: we are continually returning to the original point.  Let's talk about the issues: terrorism. The issue of information sharing remains unresolved. This morning Mr Juncker pointed out to us that we were as we were in 2001 after the New York bombings. It is true that I welcome the proposal announced this morning by Mr Juncker to combat the financing of terrorism.  If we talk about emigration, hotspots are not working, relocation is not working and the moral, social and political climate within the Union is deteriorating.  If we talk about the economy, it does not exist in the Council's conclusions, but unemployment remains high, investment continues to drop and inequality continues to grow.  So are we going to settle, as Sisyphus, that he knew he was doomed to return again and again to the starting point? Let's listen to Toynbee, who you yourself just quoted: let's avoid our own suicide.

It tries to do too much and ends up doing little or making things worse. In fact, many other problems – economic, political, security – are consequences of the EU’s own policies. We welcome the support of other governments and sensible Members of this House for the reforms sought by the British Prime Minister. The opportunity for change should be grasped enthusiastically. MEPs should be the first to recognise that the citizens of our countries do not want ever closer union. They want national governments responsible to them for their actions. They want a European Union that costs less and which spends its resources more effectively. They want an EU that cuts red tape and removes barriers to trade and competitiveness and which moves rapidly to conclude free trade agreements with countries such as India and our transatlantic partners. They certainly do not want the whole nature of our countries changed by the massive uncontrolled influx of people from other cultures, and clearly our countries should be able to adjust their benefit systems as necessary and should be given greater flexibility in the scope and duration of suspending EU rules for public policy or national security reasons.  We should recognise how sensible David Cameron’s policy towards refugees has been, dealing with the problem at source, helping those in the refugee camps and accepting limited numbers of the most vulnerable. Perhaps the Commission should be looking at ways to reduce the pull factors and reviewing the limitations imposed by international laws such as the Refugee Convention and ECHR and, as Mr Weber said, most refugees do not come from Syria.

It is the fourth or the fifth time that we have exactly the same debate, and I agree with Mr Guerrero, who used a very active comparison, namely the myth of Sisyphus. Every time we say ‘Yeah, we need European border and coast guard’, where is it? It is now months since the Commission put that proposal on the Council’s table, and still we are waiting for that. Meanwhile, everybody knows what the first thing to do is: register, monitor and secure our external borders. When I hear, Mr Van Orden, that you are praising Mr Cameron’s policy on refugees, I feel that you should go – maybe with me or a number of other volunteers – to the camps in Calais and in Dunkirk where they are living in the mud. There are pregnant women and children who are not allowed to come into Britain, in spite of the fact that their families are living in Britain. They are not allowed to come in. That is the so-called ‘open policy’ of a Conservative Government. I can tell you, it is a shame when you go there and when you see in what circumstances these people have to live. It is easy to talk about the southern borders of Europe, but you can see what is happening on the western borders of Europe.

You want to return to your British Empire that no longer exists, but the reality is a little bit different. The reality is that, today, this all is falling apart because of a lack of decisiveness by Member States. It is not the European Union that has a lack of decisiveness; it is the Council, which meets time and again. I hope every time that they are going to take decisions on the European border and coast guard, on the new migration and economic migration policy, on a new asylum system, on a relocation system, and on a mandatory relocation system for the refugees. What is happening? 290 people have been relocated officially of the 160 000 proposed by the European Commission, and everybody knows that even that is theoretical, because in reality there are more than one million people already inside the European Union and in need of a new system.  My plea to you, Mr Tusk, is this: you are going to have an exceptional summit on 18 February, I think, on Brexit. Well, I propose a change. Hold an exceptional summit on the refugee crisis. Brexit can wait until March or April. The most urgent thing to tackle now is to finally take decisions with the Member States on each of the four points that are necessary: a relocation system, a migration system, a new asylum system and, at the same time, the first thing to do is set up a European border and coastguard. That seems to be far more important than starting the whole discussion about the Brexit, because you will maybe find a way out of the Brexit so that Britain remains in the European Union, but we could find ourselves without a European Union if we continue like this.

On the pretext of increasing the number of refugees, the European Union is setting up a real hunt for all non-asylum seekers. These conclusions are about the increased operationality of hotspots, the hotspots that will serve to expel migrants from the territory of the European Union more quickly. There is talk of increasing the identification of migrants, of supporting countries such as Italy or Greece in so-called return operations, but which are actually expulsion operations. Turkey has promised €3 billion in return for the containment of migrants in its territories, who knows how to be able to do dignity and a violation of their rights. But it does not matter: what matters is that the European Union is to get out of the problem it has created and continues to create through destabilisation and interference in the Middle East and North Africa. What the Council should decide was to shift, yes, the funds of the Frontex agency, Europol and resources from the Internal Security Fund – in short, all the resources allocated to surveillance, border control and repression – to the reception (of this is hardly spoken of in its conclusions), to social integration (much less is spoken of in the conclusions) and to the creation of legal and safe routes.

But what we are seeing to this day – a month and a day later – is that this crisis management on the refugee issue is still not working, and that is a catastrophic picture.  The reception centres, the so-called hotspots, are still not working. The distribution of asylum seekers is still not working. 160 000 were planned, up from 290 so far. This does not at all contribute to the fact that the people can really believe that together we in the European Union will bring about solutions here.

It is not Brussels that is Europe, but each and every government, each and every Member State, and only together can we solve this.

His passionate defence of a United States of Europe and a European army is, I know, sincerely held, and I am sure that the Liberal Democrats will be delighted. (Laughter) It has now been a month since the last European summit. I don’t know about a week being a long time in politics, but there has been a sea change in that month and I think that one event has woken people up to the folly of EU leaders: the Juncker common asylum plan, the Merkel call which led to a stampede. Those of us who have warned that unlimited numbers of people from different cultures without security checks would pose a threat to the cohesion of our societies were roundly abused for doing so. And then we came to New Year’s Eve: Munich, the main train station closed down because of a terrorist threat, the intelligence coming from Syria and Iraq. The very same train station that in September people had stood at holding up their placards: ‘Refugees Welcome’. That irony was not lost on me.  But it is what happened in Cologne – where we saw the mob, up to a thousand young males in the street, sexually assaulting and harassing women – which is, I think in many ways, one of the most disgraceful public order events that we have seen in modern—day Europe. And yet there was an attempt by the police and the press to cover it all up, and even the suggestion from some German politicians that German young women should change their dress and their mode of behaviour in the street, which I thought was a total insult. There is even a name for these assaults in Egypt, because they have now become commonplace and part of everyday life. We ought to have the courage to send out a message to say these assaults must never be acceptable in any European town or city and we will do our damndest to make sure that it never happens again. (Applause) When we go to the next European summit, where Mr Cameron is going to conclude his renegotiation, I have no doubt there will be a compromise on the fairly minor issue of migrant benefits and I have no doubt that he will come back from that summit with a few promissory notes for the future about Britain’s relationship. But what he is not going to be talking about is our ability to get back control of our borders, and the British people know that those young men in Cologne, in a few years’ time, will have EU passports and be free to come to Britain. To give you an idea of how big the sea change has been. Daily Telegraph commentator Allison Pearson, who had said she was undecided on Brexit because she did not have enough information, wrote this the other day: ʻAfter Cologne, the EU referendum is about nothing less than the safety and security of British women. We, the Euroclueless, need to woman up and vote for the right of our daughters and granddaughters to live as they choose and to smile in the street. No more Mrs Don’t Know – let’s get the hell out.’ I hope 2016 is our year of deliverance.

This compromise was part of the agreement with the European Parliament and is contained in the report of the five Presidents. But a second compromise, this one in 2012, still failed, at the time of Herman Van Rompuy, according to which the new single resolution mechanism would be accompanied by a common guarantee of bank deposits.

Also, if there is one country in which a European Force must be established, it is Turkey. Only in this way could such a Force on the one hand not allow the official state to exploit illegal immigrants in the pursuit of resolving its national issues and, on the other hand, prevent corrupt state actors from speculating against these poor people.

Following the lines of my notebook, I can not find a statement of this type. I would just remind you that, following the priorities set out by the Commission, we are focusing on policies that are resolutely geared towards growth and jobs, which is why we launched the investment plan in November 2014, which covered EUR 315 billion.

When it comes to the migration crisis, I have no doubt that today we are at a very critical moment regarding the implementation of our decisions. But this is perhaps the first time when I feel that this is a critical juncture for the political system in Europe. The EU is based on an assumption that all Member States are ready to act with goodwill and to respect our common decisions. Without this method and this determination, our work has no meaning. You are absolutely right.  What is most critical today is that I have no problems reaching compromises at the level of the European Council. On the contrary, it is too easy to achieve compromise, but the next day almost no one is ready to respect our common decisions. This is a really critical moment, not only because of the matter of immigration, but for Europe as a political organisation. It is truly difficult to discipline Member States today. Neither I nor the Commission receives much thanks. I am sorry to say that if the first principle – that we are ready to respect each other and our decisions – is not respected then we will have a huge problem implementing anything at all. Maybe this is because the scale of the challenge is so unprecedented. This is the very brutal truth. Neither Europe as an organisation nor the Member States were sufficiently prepared to face this completely new – in terms of numbers – problem concerning migration. This is true. I cannot agree with Mr Verhofstadt’s assessment when it comes to our discussion about external borders. I am sorry, but the discussion about the idea of strengthening our external borders is quite fresh. If you remember, as I do, at the beginning of our discussion about the migration crisis, there was a different topical issue, not external borders. I am really satisfied with what the Commission has done in strengthening the external borders and on the quite new idea about common external border guards in Europe. As you know, some elements of this idea are still controversial for some Member States, for many reasons. It is still quite a demanding challenge to explain and to convince them that we need this new and controversial – but absolutely necessary – new measure. What we need today is to solve some problems as quickly as possible. This is why it is my intention to dedicate the February European Council meeting to the issue of the UK. I hope it will be our last European Council meeting about it. But the February meeting will also be devoted to an assessment of implementation regarding the migration crisis and our action plan with Turkey. The next European Council in March will also concern the migration crisis. Esteban González Pons asked about Poland. As I said a few days ago at a meeting with the political groups here at Parliament, the EU has a right and an obligation to engage in a tough and open dialogue with the authorities of every EU Member State where the rule of law and norms of democracy may be violated. But please do not expect me to be happy and full of enthusiasm when the procedure on Poland is launched.  You must understand that this is something really difficult for me. I know that the Commission acted in good faith. I have no doubt in that. We could discuss how some of the Commission’s measures, methods and decisions could have been tougher or softer. There was also a discussion within the Commission about timing and some procedural nuances, but the Commission took the decision. I am absolutely sure that this decision is an optimal one and I fully support it without any doubts. Believe me, seeking conflict between institutions, especially in this case, makes no sense.

According to the EU Commission, a further three million asylum seekers are expected by the end of 2016, with family admission not yet included.

It is doubtful whether there is any possibility of integration and ability for such a large number of people. Sweden has therefore already closed its borders and introduced a ceiling on Austria. Only Germany continues with its welcome culture. The EU must finally take action and protect the external borders effectively.

A proposal that we must agree with, but why did it not come until December 2015?

Although negotiations with Turkey are very complicated, but the three-billion-billion-strong aid should improve the situation of migrants in Turkish detention camps in terms of social, health, but also humanitarian, so that these migrants have no reason to flee further to Europe and to be able to return to their homeland once peace has been established in their home country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1979, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   The next item on the agenda is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Poland (2015/2989(RSP).

No, no, we are not allowed to have a debate on the Rules of Procedure here. We are now entering this debate. You can try as much as you want. This has been laid down in the Conference of Presidents, as has been communicated in the political groups, as your group was aware. Dear Prime Minister Szydeo, welcome to the European Parliament.  Ladies and gentlemen, the decision to debate the Commission's actions, to initiate a dialogue to assess the situation in Poland on the basis of the framework for strengthening the rule of law, is a first debate of this kind in the European Parliament. This is a completely new instrument. There has never been such a debate or procedure. The instrument was first presented by the Commission in March 2014. A so-called early warning mechanism has been set up. The rule of law, as we all know, is not a purely procedural issue, but a core body of our European democracy and our social model. That is why this debate is certainly also a central debate for future procedures of this kind. I therefore assume that we will work very concentrated lynotsand in respect. Once again, a warm welcome to the Prime Minister of Poland and also my thanks for agreeing to take part in this debate.

The EU Treaties are eloquent and crystal clear. Article 2 states the values on which this Union is founded and reaffirms that these values are common to all Member States. Membership of our Union entails not only  benefits, but also responsibilities. Among the foremost responsibilities of each Member State is respect for the Union’s fundamental values, not least the rule of law, democracy, and fundamental rights. It is what makes us as Member States, and also as a Union, unique in the world. These values are shared not only because they are written on paper, but because they have been brought to life in pluralistic and open societies over the last decades, sometimes against stiff opposition. They are fundamental because they provide essential guarantees for the freedom of our citizens and the functioning of our democracies. However, neither the rule of law nor other fundamental values can be taken for granted. This continent brought forth the three most deadly and venomous political doctrines that we have known. Our ancestors fought over these doctrines and finally overcame them. We have learned our lessons the hard way, and we have vowed countless times that we would never return to those dark days, but would build a new community on this continent where freedom and peace would reign. We have been successful in this endeavour and the secret of that success is that we put democracy and the rule of law first. It was crucial then and it remains crucial today that we continue to do so.  Ensuring respect is a constant challenge that governments have to live up to, and yet we must be honest. No one country has a monopoly on virtue and no one country has a monopoly on vice. We all have deficiencies, but the true strength of our democracies is that we can identify these deficiencies, debate them, acknowledge them and fix them. That is what democracy is all about. This also implies that we are ready to have open discussions about the best way to protect these values in times of change. Today’s debate in which the Council – and I thank you for that – has been invited to speak, has been triggered by the most recent measures introduced by the newly democratically elected Polish Government, including the position of the Constitutional Tribunal, and the governance of public media.  Both the independence of tribunals and the freedom and pluralism of our media are indispensable elements in ensuring the rule of law in a democratic society. The Council has repeatedly stressed that media freedom and pluralism are fundamental values and essential pillars of democracy. This is due to their important role in ensuring transparency and to their impact on public opinion and on the participation of citizens in decision-making processes. On several occasions the Council has also highlighted the independence of the judiciary as a core value emerging from the constitutional traditions of Member States. It is not for the Presidency to pass judgment, especially not at this juncture in time. The Council has not discussed the situation, but I do want to briefly say something about Poland. Not many countries have suffered from European history as Poland has, divided, occupied, purged and ravaged, but the Polish spirit has never died. It has fought for its independence and its identity even under the Soviet yoke, and while its government was in exile, Polish soldiers helped to liberate my country in 1945, and for that I will be eternally grateful.  (Applause) And now in 2016, 11 years after Poland joined the European Union, it has thrust itself forward into the circle of big powers. It has succeeded in establishing itself as a confident and successful European political and economic power, and it has grown into a democratic state with strengthened institutions. And the Polish people have been able to do this because they could build upon a tradition, having had one of the earliest enlightened constitutions in Europe as its Constitution of 1791 attests. The Polish people deserve huge respect for what they have accomplished and in their quest for sovereignty they have found themselves at the heart of the European Union.  The Presidency is grateful for being given the opportunity to participate in this debate. Parliament has always shown great dedication to the protection of rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights in the Union. It is no secret that my country, the Netherlands, home to Grotius and host to many international tribunals, feels it must embed fundamental rights and the rule of law in its foreign and European policies. In 2013, together with Germany, Finland and Denmark, we sent a letter to our partners arguing the need for a platform to debate the rule of law. If we can talk about fish and finance, why not also talk about fundamental rights and the rule of law? That is also why we are organising a rule of law seminar on migration in Strasbourg on 2 February. We hope to have many participants from the relevant institutions.  Already two months ago the Council held its first annual dialogue on the rule of law in the Union. We will organise a second rule of law dialogue in the May General Affairs Council. We will use the outcome of the February seminar as a basis for this discussion. Our Presidency is thus committed to ensuring respect for these core values.  Of course, the Council is not acting alone in these matters of fundamental importance. On the contrary. The Commission plays in our view a vital role in monitoring developments in this field across the Union, especially in its role as guardian of the Treaties. I also wish to highlight the role played by the Council of Europe and its Venice Commission in these questions. Both the European Commission and the Venice Commission, in accordance with their roles, are looking into the developments of our discussion today, and we would suggest that this debate is carried out in an impartial and cooperative spirit, and that progress can be made after a thorough analysis of the facts.  The Vice-President of the Commission will update us on the work of the Commission and the next steps after the College’s decision last week to launch a structured dialogue with the Polish authorities, and Prime Minister Szydło, with whom I had the honour to talk today, will have the opportunity to address this Chamber and share her government’s position. I welcome her participation today which can only contribute to the necessary dialogue within our European democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1981, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Before giving the floor to the Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to make a brief comment: ladies and gentlemen in the stands, ladies and gentlemen.

The main reason for beginning this assessment under the 2014 Rule of Law Framework is the situation concerning the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, and in particular the dispute about the nomination of a number of judges of the Tribunal. In principle, this should be an issue for the Constitutional Tribunal itself to resolve. However, as things stand, the other institutions of the Polish State have not complied with the judgments rendered by the Constitutional Tribunal on the matter. This has given rise to uncertainty regarding the functioning of the Constitutional Tribunal. Furthermore, the Polish Parliament has decided to shorten the mandates of the President and Vice-President of the Tribunal. On 28 December last year, an amendment to the law on the Constitutional Tribunal entered into force which appears to render the functioning the Constitutional Tribunal considerably more difficult. Given the central position of the Tribunal within the Polish judicial system, we risk seeing the emergence of a systemic threat to the rule of law. Concerns have also been raised as regards the new media law. The rule of law, as defined in our Rule of Law Framework, requires the respect for democracy and fundamental rights. Media freedom and pluralism are also closely connected with fundamental rights, in particular the freedom of expression. This is why the Commission considers it necessary to assess this law in the light of the rule of law. The European Union is founded on a common set of values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union, which include, in particular, the respect for the rule of law. Mutual trust among EU Member States and their respective legal systems depends on the confidence that the rule of law is observed in all Member States. When national rule of law safeguards seem to come under threat, the EU needs to act. I would also note that the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland has a key role to play in ensuring that the legislative reforms currently envisaged in Poland comply with the Constitution. For this reason as well, it is essential to resolve the present dispute concerning the Constitutional Tribunal as a matter of urgency, so that the Tribunal can fully play its role as a national rule-of-law mechanism. I wrote to Poland twice on these matters on 23 and 30 December last year. However, the replies we received then were not complete and not sufficient to dispel our concerns. The Rule of Law Framework allows us to assess the matter in a structured manner together with the Polish authorities. We should make use of the Rule of Law Framework in an open and constructive manner, in a spirit of cooperation, not of confrontation. We have just received, I think an hour or so ago, another letter in answer to the letter I sent last week and we will assess it, indeed, in a constructive and cooperative manner to see what the answers are to the questions we sent last week. Obviously, I cannot go into that already now, we need to assess it carefully, as we just received the letter an hour ago. I would like to stress firstly that we are at the beginning of the process under the Framework. The Framework has a preventive nature, and the start of a detailed, factual and legal assessment in no way implies any automatic move to decisions at later stages. That will depend purely on the facts – and answering us so quickly will help to stimulate that dialogue and to have a constructive dialogue with the Polish Government. We will engage in this dialogue in an impartial, evidence-based and cooperative way. It goes without saying that the Commission fully respects the sovereignty of the Republic of Poland, and carries out its duties in an objective and non-partisan manner, as for any other Member State in line with the duties imposed on the Commission by treaties, signed and ratified by sovereign states – the Members of the European Union. Finally, we will conduct our assessment in close cooperation with the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe. I welcome that, following my suggestion, the Polish Government has itself asked for an opinion of the Venice Commission on the reform of the Constitutional Tribunal. I want to repeat, this is the spirit in which we wrote to the Polish Government last week, and I have a feeling this is also the spirit in which the Polish Government has responded to our letter of last week. We will make a careful analysis of the response and then enter into further dialogue with the Polish Government to hopefully solve this issue shortly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1983, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Beata Szydło", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Prime Minister Polish. – Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent Dear President, I would like to begin by thanking mr Minister, i would like to thank you for your comments. Dear! Thank you very much for the fact that I can talk about Poland today in the European Parliament. I thank you for this invitation, for allowing, I hope, a substantive, good, substantive debate. For me, it is very important that today we can dispel your doubts, if any, about the changes that we are making in Poland. And we are introducing them because, as a result of the democratic elections held in October 2015, the Polish people in this democratic act of elections have decided that they want the changes that have been proposed by my ruling camp – by Law and Justice – to be implemented. This is the decision of Polish citizens. Thank you for speaking here today on behalf of the Polish Government, but above all on behalf of Polish citizens, for whom freedom, equality, justice and sovereignty are inalienable values. These are values that Poles have fought for for many years and which we value above all else. It is precisely freedom, sovereignty, equality and justice that are the values on which we set the development of our state. I am very keen for you, after my speech, to be convinced that Poland is part of a united Europe in the same dimension and meaning as the countries you represent are part of it.  Dear! It seems Polish to me that these voices, which we very often receive in Poland with pain, unjust voices, voices that judge Poland, the Polish state, but also the government in an unauthorized way, that they are only the result of misinformation or are given by those who simply have bad will, but I also firmly believe that they are in a minority, because we are , Europeans, we should build our community precisely on the basis of trust, respect for diversity and building within the framework of our diversity of unity, which is the European Union. We have taken up this challenge, we have taken it up, because we are dear to the values of security and unity, and we know perfectly well that only a united Europe, strong by the strength of its countries, is able to stand up to the challenges that we also face today, which we must all talk about together with an open visor.  Poles are open to supporting Europe in difficult decisions. Poles are open to supporting Europe in addressing these challenges. We are part of a united Europe. This is a huge value for us. The Polish story, which was also mentioned here, which Mr Henderson spoke about, for which I thank you very much, is a very difficult story. This is the story that meant our way to this day. Our fathers, our grandparents, shed blood for us today to enjoy freedom so that we can be part of an equal and united Europe, but also to shed blood for the freedom of other European nations. For many years, for decades, we have had to fight for the right to express our own opinions, to build our own statehood. We have won this and we will not be able to take it away from us, because this is an idea that a united Europe has taught us. We are Europeans. We are proud of that. Poles in the elections that took place last autumn chose the program with which we went to the elections – we, the representatives of today's ruling law and justice party. They have chosen a programme that is primarily aimed at those citizens who, today, after years of transformation, including participation in the European Union, are not the best in Poland. This may be strange for you, but Poland, although it is in the European Union, although it is a large country, still faces problems such as high youth unemployment and low wages for young people. Many Polish children still dream of the only warm meal at school. There are pensioners in Poland who spend half of their pension on medicines and very often have to make dramatic choices: whether to buy a prescription or pay their bills. Such a reality is also in Poland. Many Poles feel that they have been omitted from this process of transformation. Today we want to build a Poland as the European Union is – a Poland of equality, equal opportunities. We want Poland to develop even faster on this path to equal opportunities. We have a programme in which we have proposed solutions that are applied in many European countries. We have taken good patterns from individual Countries of the European Union, because we believe that we need to learn from those who have succeeded, who are able to do so, but we also know that many Polish citizens today feel that they must finally have created a level playing field and the programme that we are implementing is precisely such a programme. This election, which made us form a government today, the decision of our citizens obliged us to make good Changes. These good changes, which we agreed on in the elections with our voters, for which we agreed with the Poles. And from the beginning of our government's work, we have been doing this. We have realized these demands, which according to Poles should form the foundations and foundations of Polish development and the state. We are doing this lawfully, respecting the Constitution, respecting laws, and finally respecting the European Treaties, because I will repeat once again: we are part of the European Union, we have been, we are and will be part of Europe, of this developing Europe, of a Europe of equal opportunity. This is how we imagine Europe that Europe will respect all Europeans, care about the development of all the countries that build it. This is our future and we want to be an active member of such a European Union.  Poland has for centuries respected the rule of law and the rule of law. Yes, we are the country that first introduced the constitution in Europe and the constitution for Poles is holiness. And there has not been, ladies and gentlemen, any violation of the Constitution in Poland recently. I must therefore say that, although I am pleased to be able to present myself here today, I can present the position of Polish, I see no reason for us to devote so many words and so much time to Polish affairs, because It seems to me that many important, extremely important issues and problems that deserve to be tilted and our attention now exist in Europe.  But I'm here because I want to engage in the dialogue that was being talked about. I want to tell you about Poland, I want to clarify all the doubts, and I firmly believe that with the goodwill I will encounter here, we will all be able to come out after this debate in the belief that Poland is a strong, well-growing member of the European Union and that we are all proud of it.  Dear! There are two doubts that have been raised here: the Constitutional Court and the media, the media law. The Constitutional Court, ladies and gentlemen, is doing very well in Poland. Works. Even today, just a few hours ago, he made one of his decisions, he works, nothing bad happens. The amendments we have made to the Constitutional Tribunal – in the Law on the Constitutional Tribunal – are in line with european standards and do not differ in any way from those proposed by other countries of the European Union. We had to amend the Law on the Constitutional Tribunal, because in June 2015 the previous Sejm, the previous ruling coalition, adopted the Law on the Constitutional Tribunal, which, moreover, was challenged by the Constitutional Court on 3 December 2015 – it was ruled that it was partially unconstitutional. And this judgment of the Constitutional Court challenging the law adopted, I recall, by the previous Sejm, by the previous ruling coalition, and the numerous opinions of experts, ordered that these errors be corrected. In violation of the Constitution, the Judges of the Court were prematurely elected to take office after the new parliamentary elections. We had to fix this – 14 of the 15 judges were to be nominated by the outgoing ruling coalition, whereas the Veneto Commission, which I will refer to here, in its 1997 opinion, explicitly states that 'the system for the selection of judges of the Constitutional Court should be aimed at ensuring more democratic representation in its composition and that the ruling party should not be able to fill all the posts of its choice'. However, this has been done, even though the President-elect has also asked that such decisions not be taken during this transition period. The president's decision not to take the oath of office in violation of democratic standards allowed the new Sejm to adopt resolutions correcting these abuses. The adoption by the Sejm of resolutions cancelling elections made in breach of democratic standards and re-election of judges is the prerogative of the Sejm, and the Constitutional Court acknowledged on 7 January 2016 that it did not have the power to assess the constitutionality of those decisions. From a legal point of view, we have 15 sworn judges of the Court in Poland – exactly as many as the Constitution provides. The vast majority of judges of the Constitutional Tribunal were still elected by the previous parliamentary majority. Only 5 out of 15 judges are those elected by a parliamentary majority supporting my government.  Law and Justice has never sought to dominate the Court. Moreover, we never wanted a majority in the Court. Our only aim was to ensure balance. I would also like to state to you that we agree that 8 out of 15 judges should be appointed by the opposition. This is a positive change in the approach to the perception of the rights of the opposition, which radically distinguishes us from our predecessors. We respect the opposition and its rights. We want dialogue, we want to solve issues that are important Polish the Polish people and for the Poles.  In order to ensure a pluralistic the nature of the Court's decision, the current Parliament has decided that, as in many other EU countries, the Court should rule in principle in full. This should not be in doubt. This is also the case in some countries of the European Union, where the Court must always sit in full. In addition, which raises doubts among some, it was considered that decisions should be taken by a qualified two-thirds majority. As decisions taken by the Constitutional Court de facto determine the shape of constitutional rules, it was considered that they should be taken by the same majority as the National Assembly adopts the Constitution.  In many countries, judges of the Constitutional Court are elected by a two-thirds majority. There are countries in Europe where some of the cases before the Constitutional Court require a two-thirds majority. Moreover, you know this very well, because many of you represent these countries. It is also worth stressing that this requirement will encourage judges to seek compromises and give their decisions a more pluralistic and inclusive character.  Finally, it is necessary to clarify the misunderstandings that have arised around the implementation of the judgments of the Constitutional Tribunal last December. It is worth pointing out clearly that the ongoing polemic around the Court is political rather than legal. The Constitutional Court is a court of law, not a court of facts. It assesses the constitutionality of the rules of law and therefore decides whether the contested rule will continue to apply. Unlike ordinary courts, however, the Constitutional Court does not assess specific actions. The standards which the Court declared unconstitutional in December have already applied and will no longer apply. They have been definitively eliminated from the legal system and this is the only legal consequence of these judgments. So there is no need to do them in any additional way.  However, I would also like to stress once again to you that the dispute over the Court now has a political rather than a substantive dimension in Poland and, as such, in my opinion, should be resolved on the basis of an agreement and political compromise in Poland. This is an internal matter Polish and that is why we should resolve this matter ourselves. I am so willing and will talk to the opposition to accept the solutions we have proposed.  Dear! As regards changes in the public media, they have been introduced by a parliamentary majority and do not in any way violate European standards for public service broadcasters.  Moreover, the changes we have started are an attempt to restore the authentic nature of apoliticality and impartiality to the public media in Poland. To date, many communities in Poland have argued that impartiality, neutrality and objectivity are not preserved. In our view, the public media requires changes that restore pluralism and equal access to all parties and introduce standards of neutrality and integrity. That's the only goal of the changes we're making. Three weeks ago, Polish parliament passed an amendment to the Broadcasting Act, which is the first stage in the reform of the public media. The Association of Polish Journalists called for reform at its extraordinary congress. In the first stage of the reform, we have sorted out the issues of ownership supervision of public media, which until now has not only been incompatible with European standards, but has also proved inefficient, leading to the financial collapse of the public media.  It was therefore necessary to separate the functions of the media market regulator, the National Broadcasting Council, from the implementation of the treasury's own powers, expressed in the appointment of the boards of media market operators. The need for such a model is clearly stated in the opinion of the 2010 Venetian Commission. The government is currently working on another amendment to the Broadcasting Act, which aims to give a new organisational form to public service broadcasters and provide a stable basis for their funding. In the case of changes made in the public media, we are following the solutions that are applied in many Countries of the European Union.  Dear! The Government of the Republic of Poland is open to dialogue and debate. We want to build an agreement in Poland with all parliamentary clubs, both opposition clubs and with those clubs that today support the Polish government in making good changes for Polish. We are open to dialogue and conversation, we are open to solving Polish problems together. I think it is important for all of us to feel the support of the European Union in these activities, that we feel that Poland, as a free and sovereign member of the European Union, can always count on support and that decisions our community, our sovereignty, remains. Dear! I am ready to answer all your questions. I am ready to provide all the information, as are all the representatives of my government. Poland is a beautiful country, Poles are a proud nation. We want to be the leader of the European Union. These are our dreams, these are the dreams of Poles. We have waited too long to enjoy freedom, justice and sovereignty, so that today we can lose these values that are important to us. This is priceless for us, for all Poles.  Thank you very much for listening to me. I firmly believe that my explanations will present you with a new quality of this information, which you have obtained about Poland. I firmly believe that it is in dialogue and agreement that we will work together to build a good future for the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1984, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Esteban González Pons", "mepid": "125027", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Madam Prime Minister, the Chairman of my group, Manfred Weber, is German. That is why, with all due respect, he has decided to give me, as vice-president, his turn, so that no one uses nationality as an excuse and eludes his responsibility. Madam Prime Minister, the second largest delegation of my parliamentary group is Polish. But today, with all due respect, a Polish man will not deliver our main speech, so that no one is excused for domestic policy reasons and eludes his responsibility. Madam Prime Minister, it is not normal for us in Europe to take precautions so that words do not become political weapons. No, it's not normal. A Spaniard, a Spaniard from the People's Party, is speaking to him, but in my place could be any other Member of my group, because we all think so. Europe is, first and for all, a set of democratic values and then a market. I repeat: first, a community of values and, only after, a market. That is why, on behalf of all of us, I would like to be certain that you think so: that Europe is not Brussels, that Europe is not Berlin, that Europe is not Paris, that Europe is five hundred million people that we want to live together. The Polish people have fought all dictatorships and defeated them. First, against Nazism, and the Europeans were with Poland. Then, against communism, and the Europeans were with Poland. Now all Europeans are fighting terrorism together. But authoritarianism doesn't always come from outside. Authoritarianism does not understand times or places. Its sole purpose is to end our system of values, our rights and our freedoms. The Poles know, unfortunately as well as the Spaniards, as the Portuguese, as the Italians, as the Germans, as the Romanians, as the Slovenians, as the French or as the Greeks that the worst of authoritarianism has always come from within. That the destruction of the judiciary and the control of the media can be a principle to end democracy. The problem is not Poland. The problem is authoritarianism, reproduced where it is reproduced. The mistakes of the past, even the most heinous and abominable, are there not to repeat them, not to revive them every day. The Europe of which we are all a part is based on reconciliation, not resentment. We are the Europe of respect and human dignity, the Europe founded on Roman law and Christian morality, the Europe that recognizes no more empire than the rule of law. That's what we're discussing here today. We want to clarify whether there is a possibility that any of these values could be in danger. No one here comes to prejudge or condemn. We come to discuss facts and actions and this, Madam Prime Minister, is the time to clear up the misunderstandings, if necessary. No one wants to apply to the Polish Government a pre-trial conviction, let alone the people's parliamentary group. Polish members of the Popular Parliamentary Group would never consent to this. We therefore look forward to the results of this dialogue with the Commission and I encourage the Commissioners to act with the same prudence and restraint with which they have done so far. On matters of internal order, Madam Prime Minister, you have every legitimacy to develop your government programme as you see fit. You'll be judged by Polish voters when the time comes. But as far as we all are concerned, such as the defence of the rule of law, friends should not deceive us. Good partners, with all due respect, must look at each other face to face and we must tell each other the truth. As we have told ourselves the truth with the Greek Government. As we are telling each other the truth with the British Government. So, we hope that today, here, you and we will tell each other the truth and recognize things as they are. Madam Prime Minister, this is not about the law. It's about the values. You, like any legitimate government, can change the law. But neither you nor any legitimate government can change the values. That's never, Madam Prime Minister.

Here, Prime Minister, we appreciate the tone of your speech. We do not want to put your country on trial, nor do we want to try to overturn a democratically achieved outcome in your nation. You have every right and a duty to govern, in full autonomy of choices, but with respect for European values, principles and law. Poland is one of the pillars of the Union in its history and vocation, especially in its fight against the totalitarianism of the twentieth century. The Polish people are an example to all of us. The measures taken by your government, Prime Minister, deny this history of freedom. An independent constitutional court and the free media are the prerequisites for the rule of law. We therefore considered the European Commission's decision to be right and timely, and we would particularly like to thank Vice-President Timmermans. The European Union is not a marriage of convenience and not even a scapegoat. The Union is first and foremost a community of values, freedoms and democracy. Europe needs a free and strong Poland: think, Prime Minister, about the measures you have taken in a spirit of dialogue and confrontation, as Vice-President Timmermans said a moment ago. Poland is a great country, we will not abandon it, you will not take it down a path that is not in line with its history and tradition!", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1986, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Syed Kamall", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, as we assembled here this afternoon I could sense MEPs chomping at the bit to lay into the Polish Government. But before you unleash a volley of words, let me make a plea for everyone to take a step back, to allow the European Commission and the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe to work with the Polish Government to address the concerns that have been expressed. Having spoken to Polish MEPs, ministers and the Prime Minister earlier today, it is clear that they have no intention of undermining pluralism and the rule of law.  When the last government passed a law to stuff the Constitutional Court with their nominees before they left office, why is it that the Commission did not open an investigation, or MEPs here did not complain? Why the sudden complaints when the new government seeks to appoint only five out of 15 judges on a constitutional court? We should welcome the constructive talks that President Duda has held with the court’s president. We should welcome the Polish Government inviting the Venice Commission to give its opinion. We should welcome the new government’s separation between the regulator and the broadcaster.  But when the new government tries to bring its practices in line with other countries and EU law, it is accused of political interference in the media. Now when I worked on the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, I was shocked by the number of MEPs from one large Member State who sat on the boards of public broadcasters and who were interfering in legislation, ignoring the obvious conflict of interest. In this Chamber, there are former national politicians who would phone editors of newspapers, or TV stations, complaining and leading some of them to be sacked. So, if you decide to gang up today on the democratically elected government of Poland, you would also be pointing fingers at the people who voted for that government. And do not be surprised if the Polish people respond by electing more Eurosceptic politicians, as in Hungary, Italy and France. So in this climate, I would appeal everyone to be careful about their choice of words.  When Mr Berlusconi came to this Parliament and made comments linking Mr Schulz to Germany’s National Socialist past, many here were offended. So I ask you to consider your reaction when a German politician goes on the media to talk about elements of a coup in Poland and compares the Polish Government to Vladimir Putin. You must realise just how offensive this is to the Polish people, who had to endure Russian imperialism, who had to endure German National Socialism, and who had to endure Soviet Socialism.  So let us, in this House, focus on the real crises facing the EU: migration, the Eurozone and low growth. And let us allow the Polish Government to work constructively with the European Commission and the Venice Commission to reach conclusions based on facts and fairness. Given the historic suffering of the Polish people at the hands of tyranny, and their noble fight for liberation from their oppressors, I have no doubt that the new Polish Government will cooperate with all those who wish to cooperate with them to ensure that Poland reinforces the freedom, the pluralism and the democracy for which the Polish people fought for so long.  (Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1987, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for her presence and for the tone that she has used. I am going to try to follow your path and your example on the tone, Prime Minister – not always easy for me. You and your party won the elections, and you and your party got a strong mandate to lead your country. We respect this, and we have to respect this.  In fact, as a Liberal Democrat, I may not like all of your policies, but they are not our policies. That is your responsibility. This is how it works in a real democracy: on the basis of a broad majority. It is your right to reshape the media landscape, to reform the civil service. I can tell you that when I was Prime Minister, I did similar things myself. But that is not the point here. What makes us concerned and alarms most Members here in the House, and what a democrat never does, is the use or abuse of a huge majority to dismantle the checks and balances in the country. That does not happen. Why?  Because this is at the core of European democracy. It is a system of checks and balances that makes it possible to enact laws when these laws are in contradiction with the Polish Constitution. I think that the legislation on the Constitutional Tribunal, which your majority rushed through the Parliament – I think it was on Christmas Day – does exactly this. It eliminates, it paralyses, in fact, the Constitutional Court, and I have to tell you that this was not announced in the manifesto of your party before the elections. It is not – and I am going to be very precise – the composition or the nominations (Mr Kamall) that will be the problem; it is not the quorum, which you have increased, that will be the problem; it is not the two-thirds majority that you impose that is the problem; it is not even the enforced chronological order of cases that is now introduced as a new rule. Some of the Member States – you said it yourself – also have some of these rules, but they do not have them all together. That is precisely the point. It is the combination of all four elements that definitely paralysed the courts and made it impossible for them to do their work. I will tell you very clearly: it is fair enough, Mr Kamall, that the Polish Government has rectified the mistake made by the previous majority. But you do not rectify it by then paralysing this Constitutional Court. From your tone, it seems that you feel yourself that there is a problem. I feel it in your voice, and that is why you followed the advice of Mr Timmermans to ask for the opinion of the Venice Commission, which is a good thing. But let me say one thing, it would be a very bad thing if we brought Poland eastwards to another system.  (Jeers from the Chamber.) It is true, Mr Kamall, I have once used the word ‘Putin’,  and I know that Mr Kaczyński does not like Putin or Russia, and neither do I. He is not on the blacklist, but I am. So with these policies Mr Kaczyński is helping Mr Putin, because the inconvenient truth here is that Mr Putin does not like European unity. He has an obsession with destroying European unity, and what is happening in Poland could help him in his course. Never forget, Mr Prime Minister, history has proven that Polish unity and strength go hand-in-hand with European unity and strength, and vice-versa. But I have, in fact, no doubt and I have faith. I think there is no problem, because there are the Polish people and the Polish citizens. Knowing the Polish people, who gave rise to Solidarność, they fought against repression; they fought for their freedom, for democracy, for the freedom of religion and for the rule of law. All this they did. Well, I know that the Polish people will never accept giving up their democracy. So my plea to you, Prime Minister, is this: I would like to encourage you not so much to listen to me or to us, but to listen to the majority of your own citizens who want their country to remain in the world community of democracies in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1988, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Gabriele Zimmer", "mepid": "28248", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, Prime Minister Szydeo, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work she has done on this Thank you for coming here to the European Parliament today to ask yourself critical questions. As head of government, you are, of course, obliged and also the right to perform constitutional tasks and powers. No one questions that at all. It has already been said here that respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and also respect for human rights are among the fundamental principles of the EU. But that requires independent courts and also independent media. That is precisely the question we are asking you. It is a question, and I therefore think it is good that you have agreed to seek an opinion from the Venice Commission. I am sure that we will continue to discuss this further. That is why we also welcome the fact that the Commission has opened an investigation. A test procedure! And this test procedure, which is being applied for the first time because it did not exist in this form before, should, in principle, be applied every time doubts or questions arise in a Member State, irrespective of the Member State and regardless of the political constellations in the Member State. This must be our way of dealing with each other in a very objective and direct structural dialogue, respecting each other. It is not a question of the democratic legitimacy of the Polish Government, but of the rule of law of action. That is why we want to stay in the discussion with each other. The problems in Poland , and I would like to draw attention to this, have not fallen from the sky. Neoliberal and radical market structural reforms, which have already been a precondition for EU accession, have not brought development and prosperity for all. Disappointment, frustration and socially excluded were ignored. In doing so, however, many people in Poland and in other Eastern European countries have not primarily discussed the merits of the European Union, namely the question of values, the question of democracy, freedom, equality, but above all perceived the European Union as the subject that is partly responsible for the social divisions in society. I think that is something that needs to be discussed. You, too, cannot say with your government today: 'We have only now been elected, we are eliminating what has been done before'. There was also a government in which the PIS was represented before, and there was previously a Liberal government in which, for example, the issue of poverty reduction was not discussed at all. In this respect, I believe that there must be no double standards in the EU, that rights, fundamental rights and human rights apply to all. That is why I would also like to ask you, Mrs Szydeo, to say earlier that Poland wants to be a champion within the European Union. I would be very much in favour, I do not need German leadership. I would like to see each other deal with each other, and I believe that the Countries of Eastern Europe, Central European countries that joined in 2004, still have a great deal to do, but also have a great deal to contribute. Perhaps we have made huge mistakes within the EU in this accession process and in the subsequent process. My request would be: if you say you want to be a champion, please ask yourself the question of migration! It is not acceptable for Poland to say exactly '400 this year' – it cannot be, please not! That is one of the key issues. A second question, and a second request, is one more: I think one thing would also be important. Poland has an opt-out on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Would it not be a good sign now, a really strong sign, if you lifted this opt-out and thereby allow Polish citizens to enjoy the full benefits of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1989, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Rebecca Harms", "mepid": "28233", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Madam Prime Minister, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work she has done on this You have probably already understood this, the debate here today revolves around, on the one hand, concerns about what is happening in Poland, about the rule of law in Poland. But behind this debate, you will certainly also feel the concerns about the European Union as a whole. Non-functioning rule of law, no respect for the rule of law, that would mean that little is possible in the EU. The internal market, all European legislation, the guarantee of fundamental freedoms, nothing will be possible in Europe if we do not maintain respect for the rule of law. I think it is right that you have reminded us once again of the importance and role of the Polish nation in the European Union, especially for the becoming of the European Union as it is today. As a German European politician, I would like to expressly contradict all the voices that have been heard in recent weeks asking – on the occasion of the debate on your government's legislation – whether it was at all right to admit the Poles and the other Eastern and Central European states into the EU? Were they ripe for it? I take a completely different view on this and I know very well that we owe this struggle of the Poles, which in my personal time-calculation began in my personal time in my life, that we owe this struggle of the Poles not only freedom and democracy for Poland, but a tremendous gain for democracy, stability and security throughout the European Union. But because I appreciate and appreciate this so much, it is so difficult for me to imagine that all that I have heard about developments in Warsaw since you took over the government is true, not from sharpeners, but from Polish citizens who tell us this. These are not just partisan rivals of yours. In this context, I would like to expressly welcome Mateusz Kijowski, who travelled to Strasbourg today for KOD and who also represents an important position for the further debate. I think that Guy Verhofstadt has correctly described the problems in the debate on the rule of law. It's not just about personnel decisions. It is about the impression that a government majority is resorting to a diktat and is no longer seeking the conflict between the government and the opposition. Overnight, you made certain decisions that are usually discussed for longer.  My group is strongly in favour of using this rule of law mechanism, which we have given ourselves from experience with Hungary, and of examining it. However, we would like to decide on the consequences at the end of the debate and not, as some German colleagues have done, discuss sanctions now.  What also concerns us is the question of possible selective action. As a Green Group, we have always believed that we need instruments to examine the rule of law and to try to guarantee that, because that holds the European Union together at its core. But what we do not like is the impression that party political interests sometimes protect if we had to do more to violate the rule of law. That is why we would like to see the debate on the Copenhagen Commission, a consultative commission for the European Commission that is gearing up against selectivity, continue.

This debate is unnecessary, the reasons for convening it are unclear and the legal basis is questionable – as the Prime Minister mentioned in her speech. Against the odds, however, there will be benefits to this debate. Eurosceptic sentiment is rising in Europe. The Italians, together with the Socialist Prime Minister, Germany and Hungary, are increasingly against EU politicians and institutions that do not deal with what they have been set up for.  We Poles have very bad experiences when it comes to the interference of foreign politicians in our affairs. When, more than two hundred years ago, Russia, Prussia and Austria – after a few slings – were concerned about the state of Polish democracy, it ended with three partitions of Polish and the loss of independence for a hundred and twenty-five years. In the last century, in turn, we barely got out of the communist system, where Soviet commissioners rushed to help. Now it appears that European Commissioners are assisting with fraternal help.

As a Pole, I am not worried that foreign competition is criticizing us, Poland. This, after all, may mean that the Polish authorities have taken some decisions as to whether any action is clearly in line with the Polish national interest and the Polish national interest, so I should rather enjoy it. I am also not particularly worried about the positive and negative opinions that are expressed in this House, because they do not affect the situation in Poland – there we solve our problems. The problem, however, is the very fact that this debate is taking place here. This is europe's problem, because this debate is an ostentatious manifestation of the mixing of external factors in the internal affairs of sovereign states – and this is the disease of the European Union. This debate says nothing, because it cannot say anything about the political health of Polish. This debate, on the other hand, speaks very clearly and very much of the disastrous political situation of the European Union as a political project. It is an escape from all the real problems that the European Union in this form is unable to solve. So, speaking as a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom political group, I would like to stress to you, and I urge you to finally point out that this project is exhausted, that it is only running by the force of a certain inertion. If Europe is to recover, if it is to develop and provide us with security, a new formula for the coexistence of European, sovereign and independent states must be developed – and this is our task, and we owe it to our homelands and our compatriots.

The use of the new Mechanism of the European Commission would, in my view, be even more justified than poland elsewhere, including in my Slovenia, to be honest.  It is well known that the Slovenian judiciary functions badly. According to a report by the European Court of Human Rights, Slovenia comes first after its violations and, according to Eurostat, the judiciary in Slovenia enjoys the lowest reputation.  It is not surprising, therefore, given some of the facts which point to political abuse of the work of the courts. For seven years, the two-time Prime Minister and Leader of the Slovenian Opposition, Janez Janša, was to be ousted in the courts and imprisoned for three weeks before parliamentary elections without any proof. It is true that later the Constitutional Court overturned all charges and convictions, but the political consequences remained.  Political abuse is also reflected in the recent month, in December, police raided the premises of the largest opposition SDS party and wanted to seize a server containing the electronic correspondence of thousands and thousands of members from the past 15 years. There's a lot more stories like that. This is why the European Commission has so far failed to respond to the problems with which, to the point of the eclatant violations of human rights, which we have also pointed out, and which have already been caused by people who have already violated human rights in the previous system.

The first is the matter of language. I am pleased to note the tone and language that we are discussing today during this debate. It is a tone so strong and persuasive that even the honourable colleague Verhofstadt has adapted to it, which I am very pleased about. I also wanted to say, to express my hope, that this language will be maintained, because what we have had to deal with so far has been an unprecedented linguistic aggression that took place on the Polish government before this government was formed, which is, however, a kind of world record. There were statements that destroyed language and the ability to communicate. If it is said that a coup has been carried out in Poland, it means that whoever says it does not understand the meaning of the words he uses, or specifically changes that meaning. (applause) The second point is the facts. Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner, i would like to thank you for your comments. I read the document that came after the College of Commissioners meeting, and that is a bad document. My question is, where does the Commission get information about the facts? Who provides this information to you, who does legal analysis? The description of the facts leaves much to be desired, but what surprises me the most is that the information came from representatives of the Polish government earlier. There is no trace of this information, as if you had thrown it all in the trash. Where do you get your information from then? From the media? How does this arise? How can such a document be created on the basis of which a decision is taken? (applause)  Gentlemen, admit that you are with the facts on the bakier – that is the truth. The third point That I wanted to talk about is the issue of double standards. This is, unfortunately, a chronic, deep and potentially fatal disease in the European Union. President Pittella and President Harms have just talked about demonstrations, how their hearts are with these demonstrators. Ladies and about, over the last eight years there have been many more demonstrations in Poland. Somehow your hearts did not bleed, I have not heard in this Room that Mrs Harms, Mr Pittella or someone else will stand with these crowds of people.  (applause) Come on they were here, they were in Strasbourg, they were in Brussels right in front of parliament. Did any of you go out, talk about what they're all about, maybe it's some people who have something important to say? I ask you, for the last eight years in Poland, and please treat this as important, I would say even the key information, we have had to deal with something like a one-party state in Poland. It was a one-party state, that is, one party controlled virtually all the institutions.  (applause) I hear suddenly here today from you that this is not about personnel matters. If my party had inserted fourteen judges into the 15-member Constitutional Court, hell would have broken out in this House. And I hear here that nothing happened, because these are personnel matters.  (applause) Where were you when journalists were kicked out of the public media en masse? All! You heard exactly what you heard. All but one has been removed. Very fast. And what, where was there any reaction? There was no reaction. Unfortunately, these double standards show that there are more equal countries in the European Union and less equal countries. There are more equal parties and less equal parties. If this continues in this way, unfortunately we will not fall victim to it here, only the European Union will fall victim. By acting in this way, you are acting against the European Union. And the last thing is to exceed competences. Mr President, Commissioner, you know perfectly well that the instrument you have used is a legally suspect instrument. The Council's legal services have criticised it in principle, it has no good justification in the Treaties, some say that there is no justification in the Treaties at all. You here in Parliament are planning to pass a resolution. I hear that there is going to be an examination of the facts, so the resolution is to be made before the facts are examined, that is, you already know exactly what the problem is. Why then investigate the facts?

You want to take over the kind of competence that you do not have, and by the facts made to be able to act in this way, I would say not entirely legal, even in the future – and that is also very bad.

Ladies and gentlemen! More than themselves, the Germans owe the fall of the Wall to the Poles. I would remind you of Solidarity, some of whom are now responsible in the government of Mrs Szydeo.

Thank you very much for all your votes. They are important, very important, and I think that in all these voices there is a fundamental thing that should come up in this House – concern for the European Union, for its future, for its shape. Poland wants the European Union to be stable, Poland wants the European Union not to be shaken by all sorts of crises. Poland does not cause these crises, but Poland wants to actively participate in the conduct of European policies that will allow us to avoid this.  Thank you for all the critical voices, for all the voices, that is, also those that have expressed support for my country and government. For us, this is very important. I have come to you to share information, and I have a feeling, so I have at least tried to use these first speeches to give detailed facts on two issues that are doubtful to many of you, namely the constitutional court and the issue of the media law. I will also admit frankly that I thought that there would be detailed questions in your speeches relating to these matters, but in fact there were not many of them. I may think that this is due to the fact that there is simply no problem, so you have nothing to ask, and our discussion is a problem for all of us, as professor Leguka has also pointed out here. It is a problem that I, too, am in trouble with because I do not agree that the European Commission should take the Polish decision that has been taken against it. But I am open to information, I believe that the future of the European Union is paramount, and we should all, as members of this great committee, ensure that the institutions that make up the European Union work as best as possible and, above all, we must very courageously discuss their competences. That is why I am ready to provide all the information, as I have done before. Yet, if you allow it, I will repeat some important facts that I think may have missed you in my earlier statement. I believe that Poland does not deserve to be judged by the European Commission at the moment, because in Poland neither human rights nor the principles of the democratic rule of law are violated, and all matters that are currently being pursued in Poland are implemented in accordance with the Constitution, the laws and treaties of the European Union. We are a sovereign state, we are a free nation. I would add such a digression that in the Polish Parliament in the stands you can clap or express your satisfaction or not, so this is different, but it is a sense of freedom, a deep sense of freedom of the Polish people. In the Polish Parliament, the public can also speak and express their emotions.  We love our freedom, we try to guard that freedom like the pupil of the eye, because we have paid too much for that freedom. Our story taught us, which was also mentioned here, that Polish affairs should be handled in our Polish home, because whenever others did it for us, we went out very badly. And it is my concern that we do not bring here things on which I am not saying that there is no political dispute between us, because political dispute is the basis of democratic debate, it is the basis of democracy, but let us have this dispute where it takes place – in the Polish Parliament. Let us fight this dispute where it is. The best proof that the Polish State is a democratic state is that, even those who are here in the European Parliament at the moment during this debate, Polish citizens can express their dissatisfaction with the government's actions during the demonstrations that were organised without hindrance. Poland is a democratic state. I am coming to you today as prime minister of a democratic state concerned that we will work together to develop a model for our functioning in the European Union, and that we do not have to have to have such debates, which I believe do not have grounds for doing so at the moment.  I also come here, I ask you, because I have a deep sense of responsibility not only for what is happening in Poland, but I have a deep sense of responsibility for what is happening in Europe. You are talking about migration – this is a serious problem – and you know that very well. Poland has accepted about one million refugees from Ukraine, people whom no one wanted to help, they are with us today and we are helping them, and this is also something that needs to be talked about, but Poland and the Polish government, because we respect the rule of law and respect the decisions taken by the previous government, is ready to participate in this further. We are participating in the discussion and in the process that the European Union is currently working out on migration. We can deal with it, we must all respond to it, and we and you, and especially here in this place in the European Parliament, are expecting it from you today. european citizens concerned for their safety. Let us work on this – this is very important, it is a great challenge for Europe. I do not want people in my country, Poland, to be afraid that anti-European fears will grow. Let us do everything to ensure that Europe develops in peace and that it is a community of sovereign, equal, justly ruled states.  Polish, the government will not abandon the programme we have committed to the electorate. There were democratic elections, Poles chose just such a program, they chose us. We won the elections, but we won them because that is what the Poles decided, and we will implement the programme that Poles are waiting for, because very often, unfortunately, they feel that there has not been enough justice for all citizens so far. We want Polish a fair, fair and equal way for all, Polish equal opportunities, Polish development. For us Poles, it is very important to face these best-growing countries in Europe. We want all central and eastern European countries to have the same opportunities. We are young members of the European Union, we have entered the European Union with the baggage of our history, all of us from Central and Eastern Europe, but we have come with great hope. We came to a Europe that was a dream for us, a great idea of freedom, integrity and equality – and we want to be in that Europe. It is not easy for us, we have a lot of difficulties, we still have to overcome many barriers, but we want to do it, we are determined.  Poland today needs to work hard to heal a country that must protect the weak and not be afraid of the strong. This was said by the tragically deceased leader of our environment, President Lech Kaczynski. In this way he defined the challenges facing Poland. These challenges are still relevant and before us, and Saint John Paul II, the great Pole, the great European, said \"do not be afraid\". Let us not be afraid, ladies and gentlemen, to build an equal, just Europe. Let's do it together, together. Let us make sure that every European feels that he or she has equal opportunities and is treated equally. Poland does not deserve to be censored today. Once again, in the case of the Constitutional Court, we had to amend the law, because the previous government referred further to the bill in June 2015, i.e. accelerated the work on the bill, which, more interestingly, was tabled in 2013, but nothing was done for two years, only after the elections lost by the previous president. The Constitution was violated, as ruled by the Constitutional Court. We want to ensure that there are equal rights, that the opposition has a majority in the Constitutional Court – that is our proposal.  You are talking about the media – after all, the principles on which we are currently building the media in Poland are, for example, in Italy and in other European countries. You know this, because it is at home that we do not do anything that is not available in other European countries. We can discuss a number of issues that are important today, but It seems to me that – I will say this again – we have a problem with this debate, because it also expressed concerns and had doubts about this new framework set out by the European Commission, the Polish Government in 2014, led Polish by the current President Donald Tusk, who was Prime Minister at the time, and the government in its opinion stated in its opinion , also based on the opinions of Polish analysts, Polish lawyers, but above all on the legal services of the European Council, that this new institutional framework, previously presented by the European services, is unacceptable to the Polish Government. We have a problem with this, ladies and about, and we need to solve it.  I may feel injustice today that Poland is subject to this experiment, but I am here and I believe that it is my duty to the Polish, to the Polish state, which I have the honour to direct, but also to the European Parliament, to the European Commission, to come here and to explain in fact how things are going in Poland, because that is what we all need today, but above all it is needed to build the authority of the European Union and the European institutions.

Today's debate focuses on the limits of the competences of the European Commission and the European institutions. We are dealing with the constant movement of these borders, with the addition of further competences which are not justified by EU law. The European Commission is creating a super government, a head of all heads, a overseer of national governments.  This must be made clear: there is no agreement on the European Commission's interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nation states.

After all, behind the current debate on the rule of law in Poland, there is indeed a debate about what holds us together, why we simply no longer get a positive definition of what our European identity is.

You said earlier that you are European, your party, your government, we are Europeans, we want to be champions, we want to be at the forefront. But not by re-entering the national world! What we need in the European Union is indeed a correction, it is indeed a fundamental reform. What we need is for the European Union, on the basis of fundamental rights, to find itself again, for the citizens, the people who live in our Member States, to see the European Union as an added value for themselves, something for which they want to fight, because that is precisely the alternative to national opposition, also to a return of wars and conflicts, as we have had in the past, that we can all live with dignity.

I have to tell you, Prime Minister, that I admire you in a certain sense, because after a few weeks you are already using all the tricks of a Prime Minister in office, for example by saying: ‘Yes, I am here to respond to your questions’, and nobody had real remarks on what is happening. I think the Commission and I myself have described what the problem is, and what the problem is with this change in the Constitutional Court. Let me explain it again, because maybe the interpretation was not good into Polish. The system is simple: you have nominated three, out of five in total, new judges to the Constitutional Court, and these three with new rules you have made – you have given a right of veto to three PiS Members. That is what you are doing. Three members of your party can block any decision in the Constitutional Court based on the new rules you have made. That is what is happening, and you do not respond to this? You find it very normal that this is happening, and the only argument you have is to say, and this is also what Mr Legutko is saying, ‘Yes, but the Platforma made mistakes’. That is true, the Platforma did make mistakes, but you were elected, you received the victory to do better than Platforma, not to make the same mistakes as Platforma. That is democracy and you do exactly the same things Mr Legutko is referring to: ‘They did things that we did not like, a one-party state, and now it is our turn to make a one-party state for the coming years’.  So, I have only one question for you, and I think you can respond to this at least, as Prime Minister.

One enemy is ignorance, and the other is prejudice. It is very difficult to fight prejudice even with arithmetic, because it is not the case that if we have a constitutional court with a proportion of nine to six and it is to sit in a certain composition and there is a constitutional majority, then such a Court is blocked. This is some complete nonsense. It's just absurd that doesn't deserve to be answered. There is nothing wrong with such a structure, and so that you do not know how arithmetic it rotated, you will not prove it anyway, because it is a completely rational and normal construction.  And the question is also this: is this Court, which is more representative and does not allow arbitrary decision-making by five judges, as it was before, is this the Court better or worse? It is better from the point of view of standards and there is no argument capable of calling that into question. This is simply a better court. I would like to hear an argument that undermines this, because I do not know. Maybe it's somewhere, but I don't know it.  And the media issue: do we now have better or worse media? Do we have one narrative, as we have done so far, do we have many narratives? Well, we have a lot of narratives, now we have a lot of narratives.

Firstly, a rather general tribute to Poland's role in defending its sovereignty throughout history, a recognition of what Poland has done for the recovery of democracy in Europe, but at the same time a clear concern for the decisions that its government is taking in terms of the media and the Constitutional Court.  Everyone has recognized that you have enough electoral legitimacy to carry out your government program. There's no problem with that. Simply that the democratic majority does not justify circumventing democratic values, it does not justify not protecting pluralism, and pluralism defends itself in control of government and in the freedom of the media.  Several of the interveners have externalized: \"I am Polish\". Some I have to tell you that they were 'dangerous friendships', but I am also going to return to that expression: I will consider myself Polish, but of all Poles, 50% who have gone to vote and 50% who have not gone to vote and who by not voting has not lost their rights.

I would like the way in which you have spoken here, so favourably, of the European Union to also be followed by your party in Poland and that this Europeanist speech that you have when you come to the European Parliament will also be had by your party when we are in Poland.  I have not been reassured to hear you say that the Constitutional Court is a political body, because political constitutional courts are useless. Those of us who can trust the constitutional legal courts. Nor has it reassured me, at all, that you say that it is the Government that will guarantee the objectivity of the media. When I hear a government say it's going to guarantee media objectivity, I always imagine the bitch putting order between the chickens. The Government is the last to try to ensure media objectivity if we want the media to be free.  I repeat what I said before: it's not about the law. You are entitled to change it. These are the values; those can't be changed by anyone. This is not about Poland; it's about the Polish government. Confusing a government with a nation is one of the most dangerous exercises that can be done in politics. It's not about sovereignty; it's about the rule of law. It's not about politics; it's about freedom. As Manfred Weber said, it's about unity and not division. And I'm going to end up like Enrique Guerrero did, too. Some who do not suit him anything as a company have today proclaimed themselves Poles. All Europeans can proclaim themselves Polish, because we are Europeans.

I would like to remind you of what I have already said: Polish government itself has asked the Committee in Venetian for an opinion. No one had to encourage us to do so. We will, of course, look closely at it, we are waiting for it. I believe that it would also be much easier for us to use the arguments not to have this debate about Poland today if we already had this opinion, because I firmly believe that it will be an objective opinion showing that the legal situation of the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland is excellent. We have not changed the rules for the election of the Constitutional Court. The previous parliament also elected the Constitutional Court: two-thirds of the fifteen are ten – it is difficult for ten to block a group of fifteen. I think it's clear. I am presenting arguments to you, and I want to put them forward, although I believe – and I will emphasise this once again – that this debate is completely unnecessary. But I am here because I respect that the European Parliament is concerned and, I hope, objectively wants to look at this problem. Dear! I will not refer to statements that I find offensive and which, in my opinion, should not fall in this House. This is my sense of dignity as a citizen of the European Union. We are not a nationalist party and I find such words offensive. I will not comment on them. But, dear Ones, I will say once again: the Polish government was elected in democratic elections by Polish citizens and the Polish government is today leading the Polish state from the mandate of the sovereign, that is, the citizens. And it is not that the Government Polish is anything other than Poland than our homeland.  Such are democratic elections in your countries as well. I cannot imagine me to say that I do not respect the Spanish or Dutch Government, but I respect the Netherlands or Spain. Not! I respect the government of a nation that I respect and the countries that I respect. I may disagree with you, that is our right. This is the foundation and foundation of Europe, that there are different opinions, we have different opinions, we very often disagree, but we discuss. And this is a great value that is extremely important to me, to my citizens, to our citizens, Polish is very important. Because we, ladies and gentlemen, have not had the right to discuss for decades. You are talking about justice and equality, and I am very pleased about that. I believe that the European Union will look with care at the issues of the Polish economy. There was talk of Silesia. I live near Silesia, actually I can say that I feel very strongly connected with this land, I am from Malopolska, but I live on the border of Silesia and Malopolska. Silesia is a wonderful region, the Silesians are great people, but Silesia needs the help of the European Union today. Be in solidarity with Silesia, help the Polish mines. This is a big problem for us. Today's people are asking me this: will the European Union look at our problems, will it see that we need this help today, or will it leave us as it once left the Polish shipyards? Please forgive, but such questions and such bitterness is also in Poland. We explain, talk and want Poles to feel first and foremost that the European Union is with them whenever they need help. That is why I am here today too, because I believe in the European Union, I believe in Europe, I believe in civil society, which you are talking about so much here. And I must say that a civil society representative has been appointed in my government because we take this very seriously. We have a representative for civil society (this was not the case in the previous government), and I firmly believe that a good example from Polish, including in building civil society – and we have great examples from our history, we have the siphone of Solidarity, we have everything Poland has brought to Europe – that this is the foundation on which we will be able to build a common Europe of equal, sovereign states. Let us, in accordance with the will of the Polish people, implement our programme, let us govern, let us show that Poland is a country that takes the law, the constitution very seriously, very seriously.

I think it was very clear from the exchanges we have heard, also in the last minute. But I nevertheless think it was a very important debate. All of us, all of you, have spoken on the importance of the rule of law as a founding stone for our cooperation, with very, very few exceptions, if any.  First of all, that is a positive sign, but we all realise when we talk about the rule of law it obviously becomes very quickly not only a legal issue, but also a political issue, and that is understandable. It is an issue about sovereignty issues, about institutional balances, about political choices. Yes, the debate on the rule of law is therefore intrinsically also political and it is therefore important that you discuss it here today in the Parliament.  All of you have made clear that nobody is holy. We have to exclude double standards. We have a task in front of all of us. It is not just finger—pointing, it is ensuring that all of us in a very difficult time of the European Union look at our own foundations for the rule of law.  I speak here on behalf of the Council of Ministers. We have not met on this yet, but I have tried to assure you that on the side of the Council, the rule of law is key and we have agreed on a few areas. One is the issue of the new mechanism that the Commission and the Council have established. It is an annual dialogue on the rule of law, and the Commission adopted a Rule of Law Framework in March 2014. It is important to work now with this new mechanism and a question was raised to me, to what extent we would go in a strengthened or other mechanism. I have not seen an approved proposal yet from the side of the European Parliament; we will obviously have to look at it if that comes.  We have a mechanism right now, and you see that it is important to start working on it with full respect and dialogue between all of us from the different institutions. In that sense, I would say on behalf of the Presidency that we are committed, as you know, to assuring the respect for the core values of our Union. The Commission is currently making an analysis of the facts, it is in constant dialogue with the Polish Government, and it plays in that sense a vital role in monitoring developments in the fields across the Union, especially in its role as guardian of the Treaty. You know where the Presidency stands and you know where the Commission stands, and it was very important that you had the opportunity to talk to the Polish Prime Minister, who has gone out of her way to stand before you today and answer your questions and listen to your comments.  I have gathered from the spirit of discussion, which is sometimes sensitive, first of all that there is a need for dialogue: that everybody agrees to. A serious dialogue. Secondly, that there is – as I have heard from all sides – a need to look at the facts in an objective way and, as was mentioned by the Commissioner, in a spirit of cooperation. On that basis, it was important that the Venice Commission was mentioned. From our side, you may rest assured that the Presidency will follow this process closely, and you may rest assured that with all our collective efforts – all our critical appraisals, letters, debates and articles – in Europe we will continue to foster and strive for the rule of law. Because, ultimately, only in such a vibrant society can there be a rule of law. If one thing has become abundantly clear here in this lively debate today, politically speaking, the rule of law is colour-blind.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2026, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. In the European Union, the media has an independent role. The independence of the media is a great asset and the diversity of the media is also a great asset. That is why, when it is complaints and inquiries, the Commission not only has the right to check whether the independence and diversity of the media in Europe is being jeopardised or safeguarded and strengthened. We have no less and no more to do. The new small Polish media law deals with three bodies. It is about the Board of Management, it is about the supervisory board of TVP and PR, i.e. public television and public radio in Poland. It is about the supervisory board for both companies, and it is about the media regulator. So far, the supervisory board, which consisted of seven people, has been composed as follows: a proposal from the ministers of culture, one proposal from the Ministers of the Treasury, i.e. two by the government, and five have been determined by the media regulator in an open competition procedure. The amendment adopted at the turn of the year is new, with the Supervisory Board being reduced from seven to three members and all three being determined by personal decision by the Minister of the Treasury. Secondly, the board. In future, the Executive Board may be appointed and dismissed at any time without giving reasons. This decision is again taken by the Supervisory Board, which has been appointed by the Minister of State alone. In future, the statute of TVP and PR can be changed without a media regulator and without parliament.  We are therefore also concerned whether this development, in which the government alone is moving closer to public service broadcasting, is jeopardising the independence of broadcasting, rather than the diversity of the parties. We are looking into the question. We are grateful that the government has promised us dialogue on this. We also offer to continue this dialogue if the major media law is to be presented in February or March, as announced. We ask that there should then be a chance for dialogue before it is adopted. We would be better off if the rule of law did not have to be examined retrospectively, but that a close constructive, consultative dialogue could be held between the Commission and the Member State and its government and Parliament before it was adopted.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2027, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, there are so many things to which I could react today, but given the hour I will be very brief. There are three points. The first point is: after hearing all this discussion about sovereignty, I maintain that Poland is now more sovereign, more a master of its own destiny, than in the thousand years before it became a Member of the European Union. By pooling its sovereignty with other European nations, for the first time in its history Poland has borders that are no longer disputed by its neighbours. That is true sovereignty, Madam Prime Minister. That is a true achievement of all European nations, and Poland in the first place.  Secondly, all Members of the European Union have signed, of their own free will, and ratified through their national parliaments, European Treaties, thus entering into obligations as far as maintaining the rule of law is concerned. Not just that, but you are even allowing the way you maintain those obligations to be judged by the Court in Luxembourg, to be controlled by the Commission in Brussels, to be discussed in the European Parliament, and even to be challenged by other Member States of the European Union. So when there is an issue of the rule of law, there is no hiding behind national sovereignty, because you have agreed in the Treaty you have signed and ratified that these issues can be discussed at the European level. That is a fact, Mr Legutko – a man who loves facts so much. Let me give you some more facts about the issue at hand. And by the way, Mr Legutko, you have full right to your own opinions, but sadly not to have your own facts. Let me raise a few issues.  We have no objection, Madam Prime Minister, to the principle that the composition of the Constitutional Tribunal should be balanced. We also fully agree that the constitutional law and customs of Poland should be respected. But our concern that remains is that the Constitutional Tribunal has interpreted and applied these laws, yet these judgments are only partially being followed by you. I am not referring to the judgment you have been referring to all the time, which is the one of 3 December in which the Court said that the old parliament appointed too many judges. But there is also the judgment of 9 December, in which the Court invalidated a law of the new parliament because it had cancelled all the previous appointments, including those that the previous parliament had been fully entitled to make. Please, in our dialogue that we are going to continue, react to that point. And by the way, if you so cherish the opinion of the Venice Commission – and you have asked for it; I thought you did it because I suggested it, but apparently not – then why do you not wait with the implementation of the laws until the Venice Commission has time to give its opinion? Now you have just gone along with it, so the Venice Commission will have to come afterwards.  Well, the question remains of how Poland will solve these issues because only by solving these issues of the composition can the Tribunal again fully play its role as a rule of law safeguard. We also expect clarifications and the other reforms which have been adopted concerning the Constitutional Tribunal.  The rule of law, and especially – especially – the separation of powers is of concern to all of us. We have learned, through painful European history, that we need the tripod of democracy, respect for human rights, and respect for the rule of law. None of these can flourish without the other two. You can never use democracy as an argument against the rule of law. Nor can you use democracy as an argument against respect for human rights. We learned that through painful history, and Poland has always been the greatest victim of that painful history. And now we see a free, proud, independent Poland – not in spite of the European Union, but because of the European Union. That is why I believe in maintaining a constructive dialogue with the Polish Government, because I believe we can solve these issues in conformity with the rules that all Members of the European Union have adhered to.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2028, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Ladies and gentlemen, I must ask you, too, to conclude this discussion with you, Mrs Szydeo.

Secondly, I believe that the initiation of the procedure for the Polish not from newspapers, but from in-depth legal analyses of the Commission. Who developed these analyses and when will you present them?  Thirdly, the Polish constitutional court has a majority of judges by choice of the opposition, ruling by a two-thirds majority, in order of influence. What's wrong with that? How is Polish court worse than the Luxembourg court that your country intends to abolish? Have you heard of this?

Let me say that, for once, among many different difficult situations in the world around us and far away, this is a place in the world where we have signs of hope and change. I am very glad that you decided to organise this debate on the peace process because I am convinced that this year can be the year where we have good news after an armed conflict that has lasted for over half a century.  Two hundred and twenty thousand people have died and over six million have been forcibly displaced. Countless others have been kidnapped, and these appear to have been victims of violence. The first peace negotiations were held more than 30 years ago, and today in Havana we finally see the chance of a breakthrough. Let me say that this opportunity for peace, for good news – sometimes we do have good news, as happened a few days ago in Vienna on Iran – cannot be missed. Personally, I had been following the Colombian peace process even before becoming the Union’s High Representative. I was already in Bogotá as an Italian Prime Minister and, since I started my role in the European Union institutions, I have supported, on behalf of the European Union, my friend President Juan Manuel Santos’s courageous efforts. Over this year, our relationship with Bogotá has grown stronger in many different ways, from the visa waiver agreement to Colombia’s engagement in our mission, Atalanta.  Just a few months ago I decided to appoint Eamon Gilmore as my special envoy for the peace process to demonstrate and strengthen the EU’s active commitment to it. I was particularly glad that this decision was taken with the full support of President Santos. Eamon Gilmore’s direct involvement in the peace process in Northern Ireland and his political experience made him a perfect, ideal candidate who, as I said, has already been very well received in these first months with all the contacts he had among the parties, even in recent days. He is currently in Bogotá, and I know that he is looking forward to meeting the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) later this month to explain his role, share his views on the prospects and the remaining challenges of the peace process and discuss with the members of AFET the way in which the European Union can better contribute to supporting this process. Let me give you an update on the state of play. We have all seen the landmark agreement that was reached last December on the victims. This agreement offers a sound basis for truth, justice and reconciliation. We all know that reconciliation is the only possible real base for any peace process to move forward in a sustainable way. This agreement can ensure that the truth about the conflicts, its roots and each actor’s responsibilities is known and acknowledged. It can bring justice and guarantee the non—repetition of crimes, can make it possible to move beyond the conflict and look to the future and can ensure that the disappeared are accounted for. It is crucial to heal the wounds and, for those who have lost their loved ones, to grieve the loss and cope with it. The agreement can also guarantee appropriate reparations to the victims, either individually or collectively. This is probably the first time a peace agreement has given such a central role to victims. There is no other way towards reconciliation, and the culture of political divergences can be solved peacefully through politics and elections.  The agreement walks a thin line – we know that very well and the Colombians know it very well – between preventing impunity and making peace possible. It was not an easy task, but the deal has managed to strike a good balance. The two sides have also committed to making the effective protection of human rights a top priority. This includes a strong focus on human rights defenders. Their extremely precious work too often makes them the target of threats and violence. Colombia started from a difficult position in this regard, but it has also made very good progress over the past few years. In spite of a security situation that remains challenging in a number of regions, such commitments by the two sides will help consolidate progress. Of course, the Havana negotiation is not over yet. We are talking about a process that is still ongoing. Important issues still need to be addressed. Just to quote a number of them: the modalities for a definitive ceasefire and its verification, the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants, the arrangements for guaranteeing their physical security, and how to implement the agreement. Still, I am confident that the negotiation can not only be concluded, but can be concluded rapidly in line with the commitments taken by President Santos. As an agreement comes close – hopefully – we must also think of what comes next on how to support the peace that it is now possible to build. Experience shows that implementing a peace agreement is often the most challenging part of it. Vested interests may stand in the way. A new mentality will need to replace the old ways of doing things and all parties will have to confirm their dedication to peace, well beyond the signature of a deal or even its ratification through a plebiscite. This is why our work and Eamon Gilmore’s mandate is focused very much on the implementation phase and how we can support it with all the different means that we have. European Union engagement will not decrease once an agreement is signed and ratified – on the contrary. On land and rural development, political participation or human rights, we will keep encouraging deep change in the country along the lines that will be agreed in Havana. It is these reforms that can bring sustainable peace and not just peace in Colombia. The European Union will be with Colombia all along the way. We are together with Colombia today, we will be there at the moment when the peace agreement is signed – soon, hopefully– and we will be there to help the parties implement it fully. My colleague Neven Mimica and I have been working together to set up an EU trust fund which will pool contributions from the EU budget and from willing Member States. We are already seeing contributions coming in. We are currently finalising the preparatory work for this fund in close contact with interested Member States and, as I said, there is a growing interest in this. The trust fund will have to be ready by the time the peace agreement is concluded. It will complement Colombia’s own financial efforts in close coordination with other donors and partners of the country. We are not just offering good intentions but constant political support that is very much needed and concrete means to make this work in a sustainable way, for when the agreement is signed, for when it starts to be implemented and for future decades. Through our political support, our work with international partners and our financial assistance, the European Union is making, and will continue to make, a crucial contribution to the success of the peace process in Colombia.  These are days that are very important for Latin America, days of change, days of new challenges, and – potentially – days of reconciliation. Such change needs to be driven, encouraged and accompanied. When the opportunity for positive change arises for once, our European Union has a specific interest in playing a key role. That is what we are also doing in Colombia – and not only there – and I know that I can count on you for support in doing this because, as we focus on managing the crisis in the conflicts around us, we cannot afford to lose sight of the positive and encouraging steps that can be taken around the world, helping us stabilise , as in this case, a conflict that lasted for 40-50 years or prevent further destabilisation and conflict. Even when they look far off, they do affect the stability and the security of the world, so it is our primary interest in the European Union to support and facilitate them with the maximum of our efforts and, as I said, our political and also financial support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2060, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Luis de Grandes Pascual", "mepid": "28393", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Madam Vice-President / High Representative, the fact-making relationship expressed here in detail by Mrs Mogherini saves me from repeating them.

That's why my words will be value judgments about that factual relationship. And I would like to say, as a first point and with solemnity, that, in our view, Colombia, with its conduct, has earned this support to be given to it by the European Parliament at this time, which is undoubtedly historic. This is a historic moment that has been precedent. Others have tried: to find some kind of solution through dialogue between antagonists. I would like to remind you that presidents Betancur, Gaviria, Pastrana or President Uribe himself tried before President Santos, even if he is now reluctant. But it is no less true that President Santos, if he completes this historic peace process, will have in The History of Colombia an absolutely deserved pedestal. And for our part, Mrs Mogherini, we have also made an effort to live up to the circumstances. This Parliament, so different, so different and pluralistic, has achieved a proposal for a consensus resolution from seven large political groups which, in a unique way, will adopt, in a very majority way, this motion for a resolution with the principles and values that we believe are worthy of this moment. I believe that Colombia has become credited with its conduct, I repeat, to this deference. So what's missing, Mrs Mogherini, is what I said.

I would like to tell you, first of all, that, as we all know, humanity has long shown that ending a war is much harder than starting it. Humanity has shown us that negotiating with a terrorist group at the end of violence is far harder than fighting it. You fight him police even.  I believe that, as you said, these two great conquests of Colombia in the coming months effectively mark a historic moment for Colombia, because let us not forget that they are probably ending what has been a tragic tradition of more than 50 years not only in Colombia but in many other countries in South and Central America, where , for many years, many political groups thought that violence was legitimate to achieve their political goals. Today, we are probably at the end of that tragic story and that tragic mistake, because I am one of those who thinks there was never any reason to kill; that there was never reason for violence.  I think Colombia's decision has enormous merit and the European Parliament could not be far from that decision. We have made a decision, as Mr de Grandes has just said, which is an important decision: it is timely. It is very timely because peace can come in a few months definitely. It is committed because we have talked about everything that has happened in Colombia and committed to the European Union and committed to the different political groups. And it is courageous, above all, because it is unanimous and, for the first time, in an international policy event, we unanimously decided the whole European Parliament in favour of the peace process. Peace is not perfect, we know that there are many people against it, but it is peace, and that is why it is important to remember that there are no paths to peace, that \"peace is the way\", as Gandhi said.

They have applied pragmatism, will and imagination to this and are achieving it. And that deserves our most determined support. A good example of how this effort can be accompanied by much more than words is the commitment and success made by Mrs Mogherini, to which I would like to thank her efforts, in this process.

I hope that this resolution will help in the same direction, because it certifies the European Parliament's support for Colombia and its citizens. An endorsement that is based on respect for its decisions, the recognition of its successes, the condemnation of violence as a tool for political action and an express reference to the implementation of international legislation aimed at preventing impunity for crimes against humanity worldwide.

We acknowledge the stopping of air strikes by the government and the unilateral ceasefire undertaken by the FARC, but further gestures towards peace, including on the treatment of prisoners, are still required.

We all know that a peace process, like the one that has been consolidated in Colombia, is fragile and difficult, and it is our obligation to bring together all efforts.

This option is remarkable because it is a pioneering option, and the agreement signed in December shows this fact and is a pillar of this process. The European Union has made an important contribution all this way and the trade dimension is not unspicient because, in addition to the economic dimension of the agreement established with Colombia and Peru, an important commitment has also been made to work together for peace, democracy, respect for human rights and the promotion of the well-being of peoples.  That is why this resolution, which we are debating here today, combines a very important triple perspective. Firstly, it gives priority to fostering lasting peace based on the defence of people, victims of conflict and strengthening civil society. Secondly, however, it takes on the trade partnership between the European Union and Colombia, with a platform for promoting not only economic recovery, but also of values and practices of respect for peace, human rights and full democracy. Finally, this resolution welcomes the commitment spirit shown by the parties and calls for the development of a culture of non-violence and the development of trust in Colombian society. These efforts have generated new platforms for understanding and cooperation, and the European Union can and must, as it has done so far, continue to consistently support this process.

Fifty years of civil war have killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, mostly civilians. The conflict forced millions of people to flee their homes.

The September and December Havana agreements on a special court and the compensation and identification of all victims of the conflict are therefore to be welcomed. In 2016 – this year, the year of the final peace agreement – this makes this very likely. Once the civil war is over, aid will be needed for war-ravaged regions.

Calculations of the distribution of responsibilities for violence are substantive in terms of truth and memory, but do not attenuate the responsibility that each victim claims. And it's not about conciting hatred or revenge, it's about justice, repudiation and reflection. Victims and Colombian society need the assumption of responsibilities without impunity. Even in our careful motion for a Resolution, it is worth remembering that civil society is not participating in the negotiating table and that, so far, the degree of impunity in crimes exceeds 90%. Some sources speak of 98%. It's not just about invoking that there will be no impunity.

It is very encouraging. A major step – I would say a historic step – was taken in December, solving one of the most difficult parts of the negotiations in a difficult, complicated, but I think very constructive and encouraging way. But we are not there yet.  That is why I underline – as I did in introducing our debate – that our support does not focus only on the follow-up to the agreement and implementation, but also, in these coming weeks and months, on trying to accompany the negotiations, trying to support them and also trying to support the strong leadership and vision of President Santos, who is certainly taking bold and impressive steps in this direction, and also supporting the country – all of it – in this process.  Regarding the territories, I very much share the reference to the fact that we need to make sure that our support goes all the way down (for me, somehow, it is going up!) to where people live. When it comes to civil society and human rights defenders – I specifically mentioned this in my introductory remarks – this is a role for the European Union, and we know that very well, as is encouraging and supporting the country as a whole and its people as a whole.  I believe, for instance, that what we have done on the visa waiver was particularly important because it showed not only the support that the European Union was giving to the process, and the intention to support implementation of the process, but also that this is part of a bigger picture which is the excellent bilateral relations that the European Union has with Colombia, and also that this is framed into an even bigger picture which is the strategic relations between the European Union and Latin America, and in particular with some countries in Latin America with which our relations are developing in an extremely positive way, especially in the last year.  President Santos and I met probably four or five times in the last year and past couple of months. The last time was in December in Brussels where we witnessed together the signing of the visa waiver, but we were meeting regularly before that. I would say we were having a meeting every couple of months, every time that we crossed each other around the world, whether in the margins of the Cumbre de las Americas or in the General Assembly, to pass the message to him, but first of all to listen to him about what we could do to better support the process.  Even the decision to appoint a Special Envoy and to identify him or her – in this case it is him – in Eamon Gilmore came out of a conversation with President Santos, who believed this would be a positive sign, and a positive experience in negotiating the process given the experience that Gilmore has with the Northern Ireland process, and on working on the follow-up, which might be even more difficult than the process of agreeing on the agreement itself. Let me also say that I believe this is – and some of you mentioned this – an example of what the European Union’s role can be in the world. It is first of all a sign that our engagement is precious, including in places that we might perceive as being far away from us.  Our focus in these dramatic times is obviously on our neighbourhood, in our region: south, east, and I would also say north and west. It might be strange to hear this from an Italian but I believe that our work on the Arctic has to be substantial and consistent because it is probably the new frontier for many things.  Certainly we have a priority in making sure that our region becomes a little bit safer and more stable than it is now, but our added value is incredibly high, including in places around the world: in Asia, in Latin America, in Africa. Not necessarily everywhere, but in specific places where history, politics, sometimes the economy, sometimes people-to-people exchanges and culture mean that the links and ties make our position and our contribution somehow special and valuable for institutions or people.  This is one of those cases. This is the global role of the European Union. This is our strength. This is the strength of our contribution, somehow, to peace in the world. I know that these are words that sometimes we feel a little bit naive in saying but, at the end of the day, this is our interest: promoting and trying to facilitate peace in the world. But this is also the role of the European Union: investing in some models for trying to find a way out of conflicts. Some of you said that it is much more difficult to put an end to a conflict than to start a conflict. I could not agree more. That is why it is much more convenient for us to invest in conflict prevention than to try to find a way out of a conflict that has already exploded.  But there is a way – I would say a European way – of facilitating dialogue, facilitating cooperation, finding mediation, encouraging compromise also, because this comes from our history too. This will come up in the following debate on the situation in Syria and the debate after that on tensions in the Middle East.  At the end of the day, it is always the same story. European history is a history of conflicts – centuries of conflicts – that we have somehow spread around the world, dragging others into our own conflicts and wars, and which we finally managed to stop at the point when we discovered that regional cooperation and reconciliation within Europe was the way out.  That brought us peace, stability and prosperity, even if we sometimes tend to forget this today. So it is our European way that can bring hope and in some way good stories around the world. It is also the role of the European Union to invest in good stories, making them possible, and, once they do happen, making them sustainable, making them last and making them work, which is not something that we can ever take for granted.  Let me finish by saying that I really appreciate the unity you are showing in this, in the debate and in the vote you are going to take. Let me say that I am completely sure that our friends in Colombia are going to notice and appreciate this. These are exactly the kind of signs that also bring an added value to a difficult process, in terms of encouragement and political support, which is precious in these difficult times. Some of you mentioned Pope Francis. Let me conclude by quoting him on something that is also somehow a European way of seeing things. Pope Francis said that the night of violence can turn into a day with no sunset, a day of concord and justice so that there can be lasting peace. Please, we cannot afford another failure on the path to peace and reconciliation. This is the spirit, I think, in which we engage, we continue to engage, with our Colombian friends, knowing that the way ahead is still difficult and we should not take it for granted, but knowing that it is possible. I am also convinced that 2016 can be the year when this conflict finally comes to an end and Colombia can find its peace.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2087, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   I have received 7 motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 123(2) of the Rules of Procedure.

Six and a half million Syrians are internally displaced, and if the fighting continues these could be the refugees of tomorrow. Around 400 000 Syrians have no access to humanitarian aid, especially in areas that are besieged. We now have 4.6 million Syrian refugees in the neighbouring countries, with chances being high that this number will continue to grow due to intense fighting on the ground. Starvation inside Syria is used as a means of warfare against the weakest and most vulnerable people on the ground, in particular against women and children. The Syrian Government has now guaranteed humanitarian access in Madaya, but this is far from being enough. In other ongoing sieges, people have been trapped for months, unable to exit, with no access to food, no access to medication and no access to basic services. Several local ceasefires reached in recent months are a reason for hope, for example in the Waer neighbourhood of Homs, but still they stopped far short. The goal of a nationwide ceasefire between the government and the opposition is an urgent one. The bombings and targeting of civilian areas and structures such as hospitals and schools, in particular by the Syrian regime and its allies, are unacceptable. This is why it is crucial that, in parallel with the efforts to start a political process, we call for all parties to cease all attacks and bombing of civilian targets, to put an end to the sieges of civilian areas and to fully respect international humanitarian law. It would be a disaster if, as we manage hopefully to start the political process, the situation on the ground does not improve; the credibility of the whole process would suffer enormously.  Some progress was made in the fight against Da’esh in Iraq, but less so in Syria. Let me say very clearly that the terrorist group cannot and will most probably not be fully defeated if the civil war in Syria continues. Daesh bases its own survival and its propaganda on sectarian strife and chaos in Syria and in Iraq, and only a united Syria – only a Syria that puts an end to its own civil war and finds ways to reconciliation – will defeat Daesh once and for all.  In these weeks and days, this is somehow a real condition to not only fight, but also to defeat, Daesh. We have worked hard to build such a united front outside Syria and inside Syria, with the European Union playing a crucial role first and foremost for humanitarian reasons, but also because we know very well that ending the war in Syria concerns our own security because it is clearly the condition to better fight against Daesh, and it is in our own interests. The consensus we reached in the International Syria Support Group – first in Vienna with two rounds of difficult but successful talks, and then in New York in December – led to the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2254 last December.  Finally, we managed to unite the international community around a roadmap, endorsing the talks in Vienna, their format and their content, and showing the Syrians and the regional actors that there is unity on the international side to indicate the way forward. The resolution calls for intra-Syrian talks between the government and the opposition. Preparations are underway and the talks are foreseen to start in Geneva next week. The resolution sets up a schedule of six months for the establishment of inclusive and credible governance in Syria and a target of 18 months for free and fair elections based on a new Syrian constitution with the clarification of the fact that wherever the election takes place it will have to see the Syrians outside Syria taking part in it too.  In parallel with the political process, the resolution also calls for the development of confidence-building measures between parties in conflict and for a mechanism of implementation and the monitoring of ceasefire. This is clearly a very ambitious calendar, a very ambitious agenda, but it is clear that we cannot afford to waste time and we have to set high objectives in order to have some hope that the process starts. As peace gets closer – as the possibility of starting this process gets real – we see that the resistance from the enemies of peace is getting even stronger. I believe we should consider the current phase as a window of opportunity that was not there in the past years. Let me say that this window might not be open forever if we miss this chance, and let me add that I believe that we finally managed to bring all the different regional actors around the same table on the Syrian conflict partly because we managed last July to find an agreement on the Iranian deal, opening the way for the possibility – although not yet the reality – of a different kind of cooperation in the region. We will discuss that in the next debate. The conditions are there again, but the way forward will be bumpy, difficult and challenging for all.  The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, has our full and united support. We have put this issue on the agenda of all the last Foreign Affairs Council meetings – the last one took place just yesterday – and we discussed at length on how, united, we can support the process and the work of Staffan de Mistura. I am in constant contact with him; I met him just a few days ago in Brussels to discuss exactly the preparation of the talks, the way ahead, and how the European Union as such, together with the Member States, in a coordinated way, can further contribute to the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution. Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Ministers discussed Syria and our further work on the implementation of this resolution. The European Union and the Member States will provide support to the intra-Syrian talks and the entire transition process in terms of mediation, expertise and consensus—building. We will support the ceasefires, and once the ceasefires are in place – whether local ceasefires or a national ceasefire – we are preparing to step up our aid to the Syrian people. This also includes local governance needs, rehabilitation and reconstruction of the country, because it is key that, as we are trying to do in Iraq, liberated areas or areas in times of ceasefire or peace are immediately supported with humanitarian aid wherever the access of humanitarian aid is possible. As you know, the European Union is the biggest donor to the management of the Syrian crisis, with almost EUR 5 billion that we have mobilised so far. The Ministers also agreed yesterday on a European Union common approach and preparation towards the upcoming Syria-London conference that will be hosted in London by the UK and co-hosted by Germany, Norway and Kuwait on 4 February. We have already prepared substantial support to Turkey. We are putting together further additional comprehensive support packages for Jordan and Lebanon, not only to support them in their remarkable work in protecting and hosting refugees, but also to strengthen the resilience of the two countries, which has been tested in different ways in each country, and it is a top priority for the European Union to invest in the resilience of these two countries in order to prevent them from facing major security , social, economic or political problems that could turn the crisis in Syria into something even bigger.  In addition, we need to be ready for the fast deployment of humanitarian and civilisation aid once the conditions change inside Syria to make sure that, if and when we get to the point of something close to peace, the country can be rebuilt in all forms.  Later in the evening, we will discuss the current tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Let me just reiterate that I had lengthy discussions with the Foreign Ministers of both countries to convey the message that it is vital that the Syrian talks are protected and that there is no serious spillover of these bilateral tensions over this multilateral process that has finally, and in a difficult way, started. It is also vital that together as Europeans, in a coordinated way, and together with our partners, starting with the United States but also others, we pass on the same message to all the interlocutors in the region.  All those with influence over the warring parties inside Syria should help them walk the difficult path towards peace. Confidence-building measures in particular have to be implemented immediately to create a favourable environment for the talks, and to guarantee that the process is credible and delivers to the Syrian people immediately.  This is a critical phase for the political process. What we agreed on in Vienna and New York with regional and international actors has to become reality on the ground, otherwise it will not fly. Only the Syrian parties and people can make this happen with the help of the international community, which, as I see, is ready to do that.  Last week I met with Riad Hijab, the coordinator of the Syrian opposition’s High Negotiations Committee, and I confirmed the EU’s readiness to support these talks and to provide capacity-building during negotiations and afterwards and during the political transition when it starts. We also support the work of the UN Envoy for inclusive representation in the talks and accompany him in the difficult task of arranging the way in which the talks can be organised. Only a comprehensive representation of Syrian groups will help us to reach the much needed consensus for the way ahead.  Let me also say something that is not normally mentioned: the role of Syrian society in managing the way out of this conflict. I believe the civil society inside Syria will play a major role in the implementation and monitoring of confidence-building measures, for example local ceasefires, and so the civil society in its different parts and ways needs to be brought into the discussion as early as possible, and all minorities and religious groups should have a say. Excluding this or that group on sectarian or ethnic grounds would be a non-starter. Inclusiveness is the only way forward towards national reconciliation and will be the most powerful and the most effective way to defeat Daesh: we have seen this in the past in Iraq. We have to try to avoid the mistakes that were made in previous years.  The work to build a democratic, non-sectarian, inclusive Syria has only just begun, but we are finally heading in the right direction. Peace in Syria is possible, and we have shown in the last year that some incredible things and positive things are indeed possible. The transition can start and Daesh can be defeated. The international and regional players have finally united after five years, five long years of work to make it possible, and it is now time for the Syrians to take this opportunity to start the transition, to stop the war, and to stop Daesh, and they will need to know – as we have been telling them all – that we will be at their side , continuing to work for the unity of the international community and the region to make this process possible.  I have just received news that relates to the previous discussion: if I may give the good news to plenary, Mr President, the Colombian government and FARC have just announced a Havana agreement on a bilateral ceasefire and a mechanism to implement it.

Yes, you have shown that today: the challenge for the European Union is to ensure that progress is made both politically and humanitarianly. With that in mind, I would like to draw attention to four elements. Firstly, the \"Madad\" trust fund and the contribution of the Member States. We know that in order to manage the humanitarian situation, we must act today, but also anticipate tomorrow. Member States must keep their promises and remember that this is also a response to the refugee crisis that occupies them so much. Secondly, in view of the Geneva talks, it is clear that developments on the ground must reflect the commitment of all parties to this political process, not only as a sign of good faith, but also to avoid any disconnect between the aspirations of Syrians and the agreements reached between the representatives involved in the negotiations ahead of the transition. Third, the crucial issue of the composition of the opposition delegation and the participants in the negotiations. Two points: on the one hand, the divisions among the members of the international support group on this issue should not hinder the process between Syrians - the December 2015 Security Council resolution is clear on this point; on the other hand, but I know that Mistura's special envoy pays special attention to it, women's participation, a key element in principle, is like an investment in syria's future. Finally, the exchange of views you had yesterday with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Jordan, as well as the ongoing dialogue with Lebanon, are very positive points.

We lived with the image of Syrian children starving to death and we were happy when, finally, a humanitarian convoy managed to break into a besieged city, where nearly 40,000 people had been starving for months. Other cities on Syria's western border are in the same situation. I reiterate here the statement of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon: \"the use of starvation as a weapon is a war crime and will have to be treated this way\".  It is clear that we need an immediate political solution and this can only be possible through the implementation of the Vienna Agreement and Resolution 2254, which were adopted with the substantial support of the European Union and yours. We need a political solution knowing that only it can create conditions for a lasting peace. Bombings, including Russian ones, which indiscriminately destroy civilian targets, constructions and also target in moderate opposition are counterproductive.  A political solution must involve, as you mentioned, Iran, Turkey, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the other local and regional actors, and in this respect I welcome the UN effort for confidentiality-building measures and wish success to the Donors' Conference for Syria, which will take place on 4 February.  We know very well that peace in Syria is the guarantee for the defeat of Daesh, it is the guarantee for reducing the flow of refugees, and it is also the guarantee that this madness of violence, which Daesh has generated, will be defeated.

The starvation of at least 400,000 civilians in besieged areas and the depriving of the Christian minority by the Syrian Kurds.  Madaya has become synonymous with deliberate starvation of the civilian population for war purposes. This includes the civilians of Fou'ah and Kafraya (near Idlib), Nubl and Zahra (near Aleppo) and Deir al-Zor, where 200,000 Syrians are besieged by islamic State. What I have heard today about what is happening there is shocking. All of these places are in areas where anti-IS coalition aircraft are flying, including those from some European countries.  My question - which I am also being supplied with from the region itself - to the High Representative: Why are food parcels only dropped here by the Russians and do you not hear about Europe?  I would also like to draw your attention to the legal status of Christians and churches in the Kurdish region of Syria. Confiscation of homes and property of displaced Christians and Kurdish attacks on checkpoints in Christian neighbourhoods in the towns of al-Hakaseh and Qamishli call for a strong, dismissive European response.

I will be happy to be here in a few months’ time, even at midnight, to congratulate her also on Syria. I do not want to be redundant because a lot of what she has said would be my conclusions having read through the rather large file in the last couple of days, but let me say a few words anyway. Firstly, it is clear that the five bloody years of a very bloody war has had its influence, its impact. It has had its impact primarily, of course, on the Syrians, but it can be felt across the world. We can see the devastating consequences of the Daesh terrorist attacks on the French, the Russians, the Turks, the Lebanese and the Saudis, just to mention some of them. I think that last year was a wake-up call for Europeans, in particular. The Syrian war is clearly reshaping politics across the continent, especially as the response to a surge of Syrian refugees has called even the European Union’s raison d’être into question. The November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris have meant in reality that the threat is driving day-to-day concerns across the continent. I very much believe that we will make progress in Geneva. We cannot fail, but there are four points which I think are preconditions, and for the sake of time, I will exceptionally read them out. Firstly, all sides, including the Assad regime, Russia and Iran, must abide by the UN Security Council resolution 2254: ‘fulfil its demand to immediately cease military attacks against civilians, and to allow humanitarian aid across Syria to help all people in need, including the besieged areas’. Of course, Madaya has to be mentioned among them.  Any political situation is hardly imaginable without concrete humanitarian improvements for the people in Syria.  Secondly, that the talks have a clear agenda and deliver a real political transition towards non-sectarian inclusive governance without Assad. The EU must step up its efforts on the international scene and get all the other regional and global powers to respect the agreements made and to constructively back this process. Finally, de-escalating the broader war in Syria: this is a prerequisite for any effective campaign against ISIS. No military strategy against a group that is detached from the wider Syrian dynamics will be effective, as many of the key actors needed to defeat ISIS have their own priorities. I wish you the best of luck, and of course I am happy that that the Czech Embassy in Syria, now being the last EU embassy, will be providing a helping hand on the humanitarian side, especially on the infrastructure we have in place.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2095, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Τάκης Χατζηγεωργίου", "mepid": "96907", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Madam President, I do not really know whether there is anyone in this Chamber who can say something substantial, something that is workable for Syria. If there is one of us, perhaps one should be sought among a handful of people in this room who, when everyone was talking about the Arab Spring, we shouted as loudly as we could that, on the contrary, a heavy frozen Arab Winter is coming. We were looked at at at the time by some people with anger. So today with the millions of refugees, with the hundreds of thousands of dead, with drownings in the Aegean, if there is still a solution, let these leaders of Europe and the world pursue it, bringing the warring sides in Syria, pro-government and opposition, to the same table. The dangers are growing with tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran, but also with the full deployment of Turkey's war machines against the Kurds within their own country. But to be fair to all, I would like to appeal to you, Mrs Mogherini, make a phone call to the former President of the United States, Mr Mogherini.

In the meantime, this process has already stalled again, and it is questionable whether the meeting scheduled for this month in Geneva can take place at all. It is foreseeable that the negotiations will not progress as long as there is no agreement on key critical points. One of the central preconditions of the Syrian opposition is that government forces and their allies stop both the bombing of civilians and hunger blockades.  These demands remain unfulfilled, as the cruel conditions in besieged Madaya have made clear. The EU must therefore put particular pressure on Syria's allies Russia and Iran to put an end to this war against civilians.  Furthermore, it is necessary to clarify which actors will be involved before a next round of negotiations. In particular, the EU should take a clear position on the participation of the Syrian Kurds. In principle, we should argue for an approach that is as inclusive as possible.

Meanwhile, the Assad regime stands and falls with cooperation with foreign allies. Russia stepped up militarily in September last year in support of the Assad regime at a time when Assad's opponents were gaining the upper hand. In fact, they saved the Assad regime, prolonged the war, and caused a new wave of refugees. Unfortunately, there have been voices in the European Union recently calling for cooperation with Assad and the Russian Federation. For example, Czech President Miloš Zeman has openly called for support for Assad. Even at home, in the European Parliament, there are increasingly views that cooperation with Russia in the fight against terror is needed. I consider this situation absurd and schizophrenic for two reasons. Firstly, they are challenges to cooperate with a country that is itself committing state terror. On the one hand, do we want to sanction Russia, on the other, to cooperate with it? Second, the Assad regime is far more dangerous to the average Syrian than the Islamic State. While IS has caused some 1,400 civilian deaths in 2015, Assad has killed more than 12,000 Syrians in the same period, including 2,600 children and 2,000 women. This comparison is made by the Syrian Network for Human Rights, a serious organisation working for the UN as well.

Let me also recall the suffering of the inhabitants of Foua and Kefraya, who are besieged by Islamist rebels because of their loyalty to the Syrian government. At a time when the Islamic State is retreating in Iraq and Syria, but is back on the offensive in Libya and emulsing the world, it is urgent that our nations normalize diplomatic relations with the Syrian government, with the latest report by the organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons claiming that the Syrian authorities have completely destroyed their chemical weapons stockpiles.

They must decide what form the new governance of the country will take and together turn against ISIS in order to neutralize it and end this bloodshed, which does not pay any price to either civilized humanity or the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2115, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, let me first of all say that yes, I am trying to indicate some signs of hope because I am really convinced that if we do not identify the reasons for hope on the way ahead, it is very difficult to work on the change that is needed to get to a better place. But, indeed, the way is going to be difficult and long.  Please do not expect any dramatic turning point any time soon. What we have finally done is to be on the right track, but we are far from having a solution to the war or an end to the war. However it is true that if you look back one year ago to when we had no unity within the international community, no unity in the region and no path, no process, no roadmap, no calendar, then we are certainly in a much better place today, and this allows us to have a sense of direction and to create the conditions for the talks to start, for the roadmap to be implemented, the calendar to be fulfilled.  I believe this is our role as the European Union, coordinated with all our Member States, both those that are sitting at the table and those that are not sitting there. That is also why, for me, it is extremely important to constantly put the issue of the Syrian crisis on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council to make sure that all 28 are fully involved in the process and that, when we are sitting there, all the European Union is present and there is constant feedback both ways.  I am glad that we can do the same with Parliament because, as you know very well, Parliament is for me a very important actor in our external action. But this is, I believe, our role: not so much setting conditions or preconditions, but trying to create the conditions for the talks to start and to be productive, in strong cooperation with the United Nations.  Many of you asked questions about the composition of the opposition’s delegation, the time, the modalities, the formats of the talks, whether the talks will happen on Monday of next week or whether they will be delayed. We have obviously discussed all of that, not just with the Foreign Affairs Ministers yesterday but I also discussed these issues personally with Staffan de Mistura just before he debriefed the Security Council yesterday.  Let me also say that there is a specific role for the UN Special Envoy, supported by the Support Group, but we have, I believe, as the European Union, to preserve the role of the United Nations in trying to define the modalities and the time of negotiations that they are going to lead. Also to guarantee that all the different actors in the region, and internationally, feel comfortable enough with the fact that the leading role of the UN guarantees that all are on an equal footing.  What is important for us as Europeans and what we are making clear is, as I said at the beginning, that in one way or another – that is in the hands of the UN Special Envoy to define – but in one way or another, we manage to find ways of guaranteeing that the entire Syrian society, all the different Syrian groups – those that were in Riyadh at the Conference and those that were not, provided that they sign up to the political process and they fight against Daesh, al-Nusra and the terrorist groups that are concentrally defined as terrorist groups – all of them find their own way of getting into the process and feel ownership. Because, as many of you said, the key point is having the Syrians decide on the future of the country and also on the present of their country – the Syrians, all Syrians, meaning also as I stressed, those that are outside the country.  What is also important is something that our colleague Mr Cozzolino said: working on the generations. We are losing generations of Syrians. They are losing their lives, they are losing their education, they are losing hope and this is something that Syria and the region will pay for, not just for years but for decades to come.  This is also why we are investing a lot of our finance, our money, but also our work in education programmes because we have to guarantee that a country that had a very high level of education for the overall population manages to continue to invest in its own future, because when the time comes that we have to work on the reconstruction of the country, we will have to have generations of Syrians ready to engage in a very difficult process of material and non-material rebuilding of the country.  So the knowledge, the competences, the experience, the education of entire generations has to be taken care of now, because otherwise we will have serious problems in five, 10, 15, 20 years from now. Also in terms of radicalisation because the young generations that are experiencing today only war, conflict, starvation, and life in refugee camps in the best option might not necessarily be the best citizens of tomorrow. So this is clearly not only a humanitarian must, but also a clear interest that we have in investing too in our own security and stability for the future.  Let me finish by saying that many questions were raised relating to debates that we will have either later tonight – the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran and the regional developments linked to that – and the situation in Turkey, the situation of religious minorities beginning with Christians: all things on which we have debates today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.  Here let me stress again one thing that I have shared with you already in the past. I very much enjoy spending time with you and exchanging views and I find it extremely useful for my work both in the Commission or in the Council as European Union High Representative, but I would suggest as a former member of parliament, not the European Parliament but a national one, I would humbly suggest that you find a way of defining a calendar for foreign policy debates that manages to focus on some key issues , that manages also to communicate to the outside world that Parliament is focusing on foreign affairs priorities month after month. This is a humble suggestion that maybe we could find a way of organising our work in order not to repeat similar discussions over the two or three days that we spend together every month.  Let me finish with one point. Someone raised a very specific point on support to Jordan in relation to trade. Let me say that we discussed this at length yesterday with Nasser Judeh, the Foreign Minister of Jordan, in a bilateral meeting and with the Foreign Affairs Council. I had the honour and the pleasure to discuss this with Her Majesty the Queen of Jordan last week in Brussels. This is going to be a proposal that I will put forward to support Jordan not only through financial support, but also with some exceptional temporary and targeted measures to increase and facilitate their trade with the European Union.  They are developing in view of the London Conference a very creative and ambitious plan to create job opportunities together for Jordanians and Syrian refugees, which I believe is going to be extremely important to making integration of Syrian refugees in the host communities sustainable in the mid-term, in the long term, without creating a conflict in these host communities, because the perspective of hosting Syrians in large numbers for a long time in a country that is surrounded by crisis and is not rich in natural resources in any particular way might create social or economic conflicts that we need to prevent.  I hope we can count on the support of this Parliament to work in this direction as well; not only financial support, direct support, for the hosting of refugees and the protection of refugees in the case of Jordan, but also trade measures that can help Jordan in the mid-term to invest in job creation and economic investment.  I will finish here, thanking you very much for the input that is for me extremely precious for the way ahead, hoping that the way forward will be as encouraging as it has been in these last three to four months, and that we will manage, in partnership with our main friends and partners in the region and on a global level , to facilitate and move this very difficult process forward, but again, finally, I think on the right track.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2116, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "PUHEMIES. –", "mepid": "28314", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The European Union plays a hypocritical role in supporting the US in igniting the war and turning its back on refugees seeking asylum on its territory.

The IAEA verified this compliance and the international community, through the E3+3, the joint commission that I coordinate and that I, and my successor after me, will continue to coordinate for the whole duration of the agreement, verified that this has been done and therefore that the deal has been implemented. Let me reiterate that six months ago there were many people, in Europe, the region and the world, who were deeply sceptical as to whether we would ever manage to implement this agreement. They were betting on the possibility that Iran would not follow up the agreement with concrete deeds. Let me say that most of all it is a nuclear negotiation, a nuclear agreement, and this is the core of our satisfaction: the fact that we have prevented a major risk of nuclear proliferation and maybe even the possibility of a conflict in the region. This is the first reason for satisfaction, but there is another element of satisfaction linked to the fact that we have shown that multilateralism and diplomacy can work. As we saw in the previous debate, not only can it work in terms of reaching an agreement, it can also deliver in terms of implementation. So, in these difficult times there is good reason for hope. And let me also say, as I get to the real issue of our debate, though the two are closely connect, that there are two other elements for hope. One is the door that now opens for relations between Iran with the rest of the world – starting with the Europeans – and for us Europeans to engage in Iran in different ways and in different sectors. Finally, last but not least – and perhaps most importantly – this agreement could open the way to a different kind of relationship in the region.  Here we come to the issue of tonight because, after managing to hold negotiations for 13 years, with difficulties and ups and downs and a lot of scepticism, and achieving that historic result against all odds, we now have to invest in the possibility of a different kind of cooperation in the region. We are not naïve; we know very well that this will not be easy, that this will not happen overnight and that we will face obstacles and setbacks. The willingness of Iran to further cooperate on regional matters will have to be tested. But the fact that they have stated this willingness is already a step forward in respect to the past. Their will to implement the agreement they signed in July will also be tested. But just think back one year ago. Many believed we would never manage to agree on a strong deal with Iran, a verifiable and implementable deal, and we proved them wrong. If we keep working hard and together – united as Europeans and with the rest of the international community – I am sure we can keep surprising the sceptics somehow.  Dialogue among all regional powers, starting with Saudi Arabia and Iran is – we are united in believing – the only way out of the current turmoil in the Middle East. In the past few years, a struggle for regional hegemony has mixed with revamped ethnic and confessional tensions. Terrorist groups such as Daesh are fostering sectarianism to throw the region into even greater chaos and bolster their own power. International disputes between Saudi Arabia and Iran can easily play into the narrative of a war of religion between Sunni and Shia Muslims, and we know this very well. The risks of this are huge. New frictions can block the difficult path towards peace in Syria, as we have just discussed, but also in Yemen. We did not discuss that this time, but I think we will tomorrow. These frictions can destabilise Iraq and Lebanon, the two countries in the region that are most exposed to sectarian tensions. They can destabilise entire Muslim communities worldwide, from Asia to Africa, in the Horn and in the Sahel.  Bilateral tensions can, in this way, potentially inflame the region even more, prevent political processes from either starting or yielding results, and potentially inflame the war. This is why we are trying to contain and de-escalate these tensions in close coordination among ourselves as Europeans, with all the Member States. We are ensuring that we, our international partners, including the United States and, to mention just one, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia – whom I had on the phone just before her trip to Tehran and Saudi Arabia a few days ago – send a similar message to try and facilitate the containment and the de-escalation of the conflict. This shows how important this issue is in at least three continents, if not four, because potentially this could inflame communities around the world. As you may know, we reacted immediately on 2 January 2015 to the execution by the authorities of the Shia cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, and 46 other individuals, most of whom had been convicted on terrorism charges in relation to their links to Al-Qaeda. As I expressed in the statement that I issued on the same day, the death penalty can in no way be sustainable or an efficient response to crime or terrorism. The EU opposes capital punishment under any circumstances, and we shall continue to consistently advocate for the universal abolition of the death penalty. This also refers to Iran, whose human rights record is worrying. This is the message that I conveyed, not only to the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia, but also to the Foreign Minister of Iran, whom I contacted at that time.  The specific case of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr raises very serious concerns regarding issues such as freedom of expression and the respect of basic civil and political rights. These should be safeguarded in all cases. Also let me stress that, in the framework of the fight against terrorism, we have also taken an immediate position on the reactions in Iran because nothing can justify an attack on embassies or consulates, as happened with the Saudi Embassy in Tehran and the consulate in Mashhad. In the conversations I had with both the Iranian and the Saudi foreign ministers in the wake of these events, I stressed the need for Iran to abide by its international obligations. This also means ensuring the protection of diplomatic premises in all circumstances. In my phone call with both sides and in the contacts we had afterwards (we met with Mr Zarif over the weekend, among other people) the main message I passed on was to try to manage the bilateral tensions without inflaming the risk of spill-overs, especially in the region, to preserve our efforts for peace in Syria and Yemen and to avoid further destabilisation in the area , especially with regard to Iraq and Lebanon. I was given reassurances by both sides on the need to find a way of preserving this process. As we have said, for the Syria process to begin and have some chance of succeeding, it must be supported by all the regional players. For the same reason, to try to find common ways of protecting the process, early this year I discussed the situation, and the risks of it degenerating, with the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, ministers of many Arab and African countries, and with some Asian ministers. We are also coordinating messages and actions, not only with our partners, but first and foremost among Europeans. This was the case yesterday at the Foreign Affairs Council, where we discussed and agreed on common lines in this regard.  Finding a negotiated solution to the current conflicts in the Middle East is in everybody’s interest, especially everyone in the region. Protracted war can only benefit terrorists of all kinds, and it can only let instability spread further well beyond the borders of the Middle East; we in Europe know that very well. This is not a zero-sum game, and this is the other strong message we are passing on to our Iranian and Saudi friends. If the wars in Syria and in Yemen and the tensions in the region do not stop, everybody will lose. There is not a single place in the region that can benefit from the escalation of tensions. The only alternative to a win-win solution, where everybody sees their interests recognised, is chaos and further chaos. It took us months to gather all regional powers around the same table to discuss peace in Syria. As we said, the same goes for Libya, a country from which we had encouraging news today since we managed to unite the region’s international actors in a process along similar lines to that which we put together for Syria. We cannot afford to waste any of these positive trends and we cannot afford to expose them to tensions that need to stay contained – if possible at a bilateral level. The European Union will keep doing all that we can to promote dialogue, and fight sectarianism. This is because we have learned our own EU lesson. I said this in the previous debate, about Colombia. This is the EU lesson. It is only regional cooperation that brings peace and prosperity, and we have experienced this for 60 years now. Only through this kind of regional understanding, cooperation and partnership did we manage to overcome centuries of war and conflict and experience peace in our region. This is our way. We believe it is regional cooperation – and never confrontation or competition – that is beneficial for all. This is particularly true for an area of the world like the Middle East.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2120, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, as we know, the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have reached a new climax. Saudi Arabia and some of its Sunni Arab allies severed diplomatic relations with Tehran earlier this year after protesters, angered by Riyadh's execution of a prominent Shiite leader on January 2, attacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran. The execution of 47 people, including Sheikh al-Nimr, by beheading and shooting, is the largest execution by Saudi Arabia since 1980. It is not necessary to recall the fact that we categorically reject the death penalty and, as the High Representative said, this commitment must be kept. We must also remember that Iran's record of capital punishment is not at all glorious. Last year, even as progress was made on nuclear power, Iran recorded 1,084 executions. That is why I am glad that we were able to add Iran to today's debate, because the initial proposal from our left-wing friends - communists, socialists, liberals and greens - was to discuss only Saudi Arabia and to criticise what is happening there. I believe that we are now facing a new phase of confrontation between Shiites and Sunnis. I know that we find it difficult to accept the political strength of this religious divide.

Both countries should refrain from allowing external financing, which can destabilise other countries and, directly or indirectly, support extremist groups. I would like to ask Mrs Mogherini again which human rights safeguards have been applied to the EU’s counter—terrorism agreement with the Gulf States, given that some of the people the Saudis executed have been identified by human rights groups not as terrorists, but as political dissidents. I also ask her to respond to the legal opinion which suggested that targeting of civilians in Yemen means that continued arms sales to Saudi Arabia are in breach of the EU’s Code of Conduct. I hope and believe we have succeeded in halting a nuclear arms race in this region, and urgent action is now needed to stop one in conventional arms too. In many countries, Shia and Sunni Moslems cohabit peacefully. In Europe, we should be respectful about religious differences within Islam, which have existed for centuries, but should also be determined to seek political cooperation, which is needed for the future. Both Iran and Saudi Arabia can have a role to play in the region that does not have to be at the cost of the other.

You should know that, too. The intelligence services of several Member States of the European Union are familiar with Riyadh.

This is how the United Nations and major NGOs describe Iran and Saudi Arabia. In addition to these shocking similarities, there is another very significant one: the power of oil. Saudi Arabia's energy dependence and obscure businesses such as arms sales have hurt our defense of human rights. We've already fallen into that trap and now we can make the same mistake with Iran.

EU engagement with the Kingdom of course is very different state by state, but my own state, the UK, has since 2010 sold GBP 5.6 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia. These are being used in Yemen with disastrous consequences. This is been harshly criticised by Edward Santiago, the head of Save the Children’s Yemen office. He said that the UK gives the impression that diplomatic relations and arms sales trump the lives of Yemen’s children: harsh criticism there.  Turning back to the EU, we do have a community of values enshrined in laws and international agreements. It is a very concrete question, Ms Mogherini, and I will write to you tomorrow.

We are also facing a Sunni-Sunni divide, which we have to be aware of, and that is definitely complicating the picture in the region and far beyond.  Let me also share with you something that many of our friends and partners in the region, in the Muslim world, share with us: that there is not so much a religious confrontation, but a political confrontation that uses religious or sectarian divides to its own purposes and that Sunni and Shia live together in many places in the world, including Europe, and had done so for centuries before this politicisation of the sectarian divide came to the stage.  I believe that our role here can be to help and facilitate a wise investment in what some of you defined as a collective security architecture in the region – that could really be the way forward to guarantee peace and security to a region that is crucial to the world, and that it is exactly this lack of vision, of a common security architecture, that is probably amplifying these tensions in a very dangerous way. How can we help in this respect? That is also something that there is a valid interest to facilitate. First of all, some of you said ‘not taking sides’: we have working relations and open channels that in some cases work, both with Iran and with Saudi Arabia and, for sure, the implementation of the deal we have with Iran on its nuclear programme opens up further possibilities for our bilateral relations with Iran to develop. We have relations with Iran and with Saudi Arabia that we can use with a clear agenda that we have to make clear to our partners and to the other actors in the region. That includes different aspects, including the bilateral confrontations that are taking place now, including the regional dynamics, including the need to invest in political solutions to the many crises we have in the region, including the need to strengthen the resilience of key countries that are particularly exposed to this political use of sectarian divides as in the case of Iraq, Lebanon and others, including internal developments of the countries, and including human rights, which are always on the agenda whenever we discuss with both our Saudi Arabian and our Iranian partners. Let me say to those of you that mentioned the issue of oil that you probably have to update your reflections on this, because I believe the oil prices that the world is facing today have put us in a completely different situation, including in our relations with the Gulf. So, indeed, we have a political agenda. We have clear political agenda, no taboos, everything is on the table. And somehow we are in a privileged situation when it comes to talking with our partners in the region, because our agenda is clear, transparent and coherent. Yes, indeed, there are some different economic or trade agendas, some belonging to our Member States, but as the European Union we do not have anything like that so we have a greater margin for manoeuvre in political discourse with them.  I believe we definitely have to continue to invest in our relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia, first of all with the people of these two countries, in all different forms we can put in place. We must also continue our work on two central lines of external action: our foreign policy is the first – full respect of international law – and the second, at the top of our agenda not only with Saudi Arabia and Iran but also with many other countries in the world, is our work for the abolishment of the death penalty in the world. That is based on our principles, on our practice and also on our experience that tells us that it is not effective: it is not only something we believe is inhuman, but it is also not effective in preventing or fighting crime, including fighting terrorism.  So let me thank you for the support you have given to our alliance of action in this respect. I think this will be helpful for the way forward and let me thank you again for the contribution to our work in this region that is so crucial and so close, not only to our hearts, but also to our direct interests when it comes to security and stability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2138, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "PUHEMIES. –", "mepid": "28314", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The best and most reliable way to avoid these two concentrating on their rivalry will be their practical compliance with their obligations to respect human rights of their citizens.

The execution of the prominent Shia cleric has completely shaken both the Muslim world and the fragile political situation in the Middle East. This has resulted in the rupture of diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia – two powerhouses, major rivals of the Muslim world and important players in the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. This further instability in the region comes at a particularly sensitive moment – the growing influence of Daesh and the worst refugee crisis of our time.

Madam President, Commissioner, although the hour is very late, I am very happy to mention in a debate this evening this directive on the presumption of innocence, on which we have been working for many months and on which we have finally reached, after this sometimes difficult work in terms of negotiations, an agreement and even, I might say, a good agreement. This agreement enshrines an ambitious legislative text on this great principle of criminal law, for the respect of our rights of defence to all of us, the citizens of Europe.  On March 31, ladies and gentlemen, you gave me a clear mandate. Our Parliament's position was strong and strong. It called for greater protection for suspects or those prosecuted, an ambitious directive to protect the rights of Europeans and a directive harmonising national provisions rather than down.  Here, in a few points, is the content of this directive: the right not to be publicly accused by the public authorities before its judgment is enshrined in this text. I give you a recent example: during the Charlie Hebdo attacks in my country, a young high school student from my constituency, Mourad Hamyd, was accused of taking part in the attacks while he was quietly attending the mathematics class. His name was everywhere, in all the media, on the networks, when he was totally innocent. His name was dirty, mixed with horrific attacks, it was a traumatic experience. This European directive proposes to prohibit any public statement or official decision by public authorities that would present or even insinuate that a suspect is guilty before the judgment. The text contains clear definitions of public declaration and the concept of public authority. Second, and this is a victory for Parliament, the directive contains a new article on how suspects are presented, who may, at the hearing or in public, be behind glass walls or partitions, be handcuffed, armed with infighting irons, dressed in prisoners' clothing, and this manner of presenting persons may fully suggest the person's guilt at the outset and impair the person's right to the presumption of innocence. From now on, we will have to ensure that suspects or those prosecuted are not presented in a manner that may suggest their guilt.  Finally, the directive fully enshrines the great principle in dubio pro reo, that any doubt as to a person's guilt must obviously benefit that person, and where there is doubt about guilt, the person must be acquitted. Finally, the fact that the burden of proof hangs over the prosecution is a very principle of criminal law, and that is a no-brainer. In the text, some wanted to make it possible, at some point, to reverse the burden of proof as a principle. It was one of our battles, if not our red line, and we were able to move forward and ensure that this element exists only in limited cases, where there is a presumption of guilt.  The directive also enshrines the right to remain silent, and it makes, in this area, a real step forward in the area of law, the right to silence an absolute right. This seems obvious, but in some cases silence can be used as such against a person as an element that induces guilt. The directive enshrines the right to be present at trial and, above all, last point, with regard to the obtaining of evidence, a paragraph refers to national rules of admissibility of evidence and fairness of proceedings. We have fought for an additional recital and this is a real first in a European text, since there is a clear reference to Article 3 of the ECHR and to the case law, which indicates that when evidence is obtained through torture, it totally deprives the whole procedure of fairness.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2143, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to congratulate and thank Ms Griesbeck and all the shadow rapporteurs for their work and dedication on this file, which made a swift agreement on this directive possible. This text is not merely a statement of principle. Our objective was to make the presumption of innocence effective in all the Member States. This directive will strengthen the right to a fair trial and protect the rights of suspects and accused persons in the European Union.  Today great disparities in the protection of the presumption of innocence exist in Europe, as evidenced by the recent and still-too-frequent condemnations of Member States by the European Court of Human Rights. The compromise text on which you will vote tomorrow is carefully balanced. It is based on the European Convention on Human Rights and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.  The directive prohibits public references to guilt, and it contains clear rules on the burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and any doubt is to benefit the suspect or accused person. The right to remain silent and the right not to incriminate oneself are protected. The directive will also harmonise the right to be present at the trial, which is an important aspect of the right to a fair trial. The Commission would like to add two declarations to this compromise. The first is a clarification of our understanding of the text concerning the right to remain silent and the right not to incriminate oneself. The second is our position on the question of the burden of proof. The Commission regrets the deletion of a paragraph on its initial proposal on presumptions of fact or law. Our concern was that, as such presumptions already exist in Member States, it is important to have them regulated in the text of the directive so that all the safeguards for defendants are precisely set out. This being said, the overall compromise is highly satisfactory. The standards set in this directive will become EU law and will be enforced as such. The Commission will closely follow the transposition and the implementation of this directive in Member States and will ensure that it is correctly applied in practice.  Commission’s statements (Written Text) 1. Relating to Article 6 on the burden of proof   \"The Commission regrets the deletion of article 5, paragraph 2, of its proposal for a Directive on the strengthening of certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings. The Commission considers that the compromise in relation to Article 6 may lead to problems in the implementation of this Directive, in terms of legal certainty, monitoring and operability, which may increase the risk of unnecessary litigation, in particular at national level. However, the Commission does not stand in the way of the adoption of this Directive \". 2. Relating to Article 7, paragraph 6, on the right to remain silent and the right not to incriminate oneself   \"The Commission considers that Article 7, paragraph 6, of the Directive on the strengthening of certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at the trial in criminal proceedings must be interpreted as merely confirming the possibility for Member States to decide that , with regard  to minor offences, the conduct of the proceedings, or certain stages thereof, may take place in writing or without questioning of the suspect or accused person by the competent authorities. In contrast, this provision does not allow derogating from the rights enshrined in Article 7, and it may notably not be interpreted as obliging a suspect to make any statements in relation to the facts at issue or allowing a Member State to draw negative consequences from the exercise of the suspects' right to remain silent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2144, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Kinga Gál", "mepid": "28150", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Nathalie Griesbeck, for her excellent job with this very complex and important file.

And yet, from 2007 to 2012, the European Court of Human Rights found 26 violations of this principle, in 11 Member States. But it is not only the presumption of innocence that needs to be strengthened. In the negotiations with the Council – as we have heard – there have also been attempts to silence the right not to incriminate oneself, to weaken it and also to introduce a reversal of the burden of proof. This would have meant that it was not the state, the prosecutor, who had to prove the guilt, but the accused's innocence.

And we have also prevented accused people from being portrayed without need as already condemned, for example by wearing ankle restraints or presenting them in court in a cage.

Madam President, the presumption of innocence is a fundamental right, but France does not need the European Union to protect it. Section 9 of the 1789 declaration does so better than any directive written in abstruse jargon. In fact, I believe that criminal proceedings should be the sole sovereignty of the Member States. In any case, the Union is unable to protect this beautiful principle without damaging it. His proposal for a directive attests to this. Article 5, for example, admits the reversal of the burden of proof by placing the burden on the accused, rather than on the accuser. In my view, this is contrary to the presumption of innocence. Even more worryingly, its recital 17 authorizes the use of coercion to compel suspects to provide information. Why not torture while we're at it?

I therefore hope that this directive can really also be applied as minimum standards, but we hope that confidence in the judicial systems can be increased more and more in all the European States, member of the European Union, in order to give what is also said in the directive, confidence in the judicial systems. It is clear that it is aimed above all and only at criminal offences and is very important, especially (no one and a half minutes, Mr President) with regard to the dissemination, including of news, is the most important thing, and I hope that this can be taken on board by the magistrates and the press.

Strengthening it, as well as identifying mechanisms that guarantee it throughout a criminal process, have been serious challenges in extremely complex and at the same time different judicial systems.  On the assumption that judicial decisions must be considered equivalent, irrespective of the Member State in which they were taken, we understand the need to develop judicial cooperation in this field between the Member States of the European Union. In this respect, there is a need for the establishment of common minimum standards on the right to a fair trial throughout the duration of the criminal trial. It should therefore be noted that it is extremely important that any person accused of committing any crime has access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings, but not least to be given the opportunity to communicate with third parties and especially with the consular authorities during the period of deprivation of liberty.

This will ensure the fairest possible proceedings for those accused and allow for adequate protection, as is the aim of this proposal.  Another major achievement of the Directive is the prohibition of public authorities from ruling in advance on the culpability of a person, without interfering with the work of the Public Prosecutor's Office. It is solely for the court to determine culpability on the basis of the evidence submitted to it.  Last but not least, I welcome the fact that suspects should not be presented in a way that makes them look guilty. The way it is presented can have a lot of impact on public sentiment, which the directive aims to avoid.

Yet it is a fundamental right, an essential right to avoid arbitrariness and abuse in trials, and, as one of the colleagues pointed out at the time, one of the pillars of democracy. That is why it was important that we reach this agreement - a solid agreement at a time when democracy and the rule of law are under snags or onslaught within the European area. As a lawyer by training, I am proud to have been able to participate in the drafting of this directive, but my colleague Lebreton has called the text abstruse and endless. A directive containing 15 articles is relatively brief and rather worthy of the attention, in all cases, of lawyers. I am also pleased, and this is in line with the majority of colleagues' comments, that this directive continues to establish the Union's roadmap on procedural rights, and above all, the construction of a Europe to which many of us aspire, a Europe that respects the rights of defence and is a coherent Europe between the Member States and between the rights of their citizens.

We have also strengthened the wording of the right not to incriminate one another, not to cooperate and to remain silent, and we have also established that the exercise of this right cannot be used against suspects or defendants. Furthermore, in order to be effective, the presumption of innocence must apply at all stages of the procedure until its final conclusion. This requires particular caution against public authorities which, while without prejudice to the prerogatives of the public prosecutor and freedom of information, must always avoid presenting the accused as guilty before the final judgment.

This file has been an interesting case study in how the single market operates for both businesses and consumers across the 28 different countries, in the roles of the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, and in how they interact. It has also been a case study on why it is important to have a seat at the negotiating table. Just a few weeks ago, many of us saw the shocking images of a factory in Turkey manufacturing thousands of fake life jackets. Instead of helping a person to float, these jackets would make it more likely that the wearer would drown. In order to prevent fake, fraudulent or dangerous equipment from entering our markets, the European Union has had common standards on personal protective equipment for 25 years. This covers lifejackets, crash helmets and safety harnesses – sort of equipment that is used in many different workplaces. I am sure colleagues will remember the recent Ebola crisis, where PPE was crucial to protect nurses and doctors from infection. When PPE fails, lives can be lost. Our European rules not only cover the responsibility of the manufacturers, but of importers and distributors too. They make it easier for our market surveillance authorities to track products that are found to be dangerous and to remove them from the market. Having a common standard in Europe can often help our manufacturers to secure sales in other parts of the globe, thus boosting our own trade. The technical changes in the report that we are discussing today will help simplify and modernise 25 years of legislation. This is welcomed by manufacturers, consumer organisations and market players along the supply line, and I welcome it too. But one of the key quandaries of a single market is always how much standardisation is necessary. In the Commission’s initial approach, they suggested increasing the scope of the legislation to domestic gloves. Now I believe we need a better approach to regulation, and new laws should be based on a clear analysis of the costs and benefits. There was no impact assessment to justify this increase in the scope. Furthermore, I do not believe we need an EU—level agreement on what we wear in our homes to do the washing up. I went into politics to get out of the kitchen not to write rules about what people do in their own sinks. I would like to thank my colleagues from the Parliament’s Internal Market Committee for voting to reject this Commission suggestion to extend the scope to domestic gloves. We then went into negotiation with the Council – the representatives of 28 European governments. After much discussion, they agreed with most of what the MEPs had suggested. There will be no EU law on washing-up gloves. There will be no EU law on those handmade artisanal products which we see in our Christmas markets and craft fairs. But 27 of those ministers voted by a large majority that they would like to have an EU law on factory—made oven gloves. I personally do not see that need, but I do respect their democratic decision. Furthermore, given that many countries – including my own – already have a market standard on this product, I do not believe that this particular element would add cost to the consumers. I am therefore happy to concede to the Member States’ elected democratic governments on this point. The gloves are off – at least the washing-up gloves – as are the umbrellas – one more minute, please – but by being at the table, we have made a hundred different amendments to the legislation, all making it simpler, clearer, less bureaucratic and also safer in life saving equipment. I hope that this will make it easier for businesses and consumers to trade.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2168, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Catherine Stihler", "mepid": "4545", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to thank the shadows, the Commission and the Council for their cooperation on this gas appliances file. For those of us across the EU who have turned on their gas fire tonight or cooked their dinner on a gas cooker this evening, this proposal will ensure that these day—to—day household products we all take for granted are safe, do what they say they will do, and can be bought or sold across the European Union. Therefore, these new proposals set an example that, by cooperating together to create one set of rules affecting gas ovens, gas cookers and gas central heating systems, we can ensure the greatest safety of these products, which cover 500 million EU citizens. The mandatory essential requirements and the conformity assessment procedures to be followed by manufacturers must be identical in all Member States.  Tomorrow’s vote in plenary will be on the final text agreed upon in the trialogues. I hope everyone will be able to endorse the agreement, as I believe we have managed to find a good compromise between all parties involved. Subject to a positive vote in plenary tomorrow, the regulation will be transposed into national law by all Member States by January 2018. The gas appliances sector covers a wide range of products, from simple portable cookers to boilers in big buildings. The current EU stock of gas appliances is at 470 million and growing, with more than 30 million units being sold annually. The annual sales for installed gas appliances account for around EUR 40 billion, and the annual turnover for fittings alone is around EUR 1.7 billion. With the scale of this market, it is absolutely imperative to set the highest manufacturing standards possible when producing and placing gas appliances on the EU market, in order to ensure the health and safety of persons and domestic animals.  When talking about health and safety, I would like to highlight this evening the issue of carbon monoxide. When a fuel burns, it generally reacts with the surrounding oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. However, when fuels are unable to burn fully, they produce the dangerous gas known as carbon monoxide, which is poisonous. I have insisted on certain references to carbon monoxide poisoning in this regulation, and I am happy to see this language reflected in the final text. However, not enough is being done by national governments and the EU in this respect and its importance seems to be downplayed despite statistics. In the UK carbon monoxide – often referred to as a silent killer – injures around 200 people per annum, and around 40 of such injuries are fatal. These deaths are all avoidable. The case of British children Bobby and Christi Shepherd, who died in 2006 of carbon monoxide poisoning at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel in Corfu as a result of a faulty boiler, has provoked widespread anger and calls for change. The coroner in the case, David Hinchliff, has called for the tightening of EU—wide regulations in this area in order to prevent future deaths. The travel guidance group, Holiday Travel Watch, has estimated that half a million UK holidaymakers are at risk of CO poisoning every year. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), CO kills more people annually than HIV-Aids or skin cancer. Currently there are no EU laws setting out minimum safety standards for hotels in Europe to comply with, meaning there exist varying levels of safety in hotels across Europe. Labour MEPs certainly feel this is clearly a cross—border issue deserving legislative action. Consumers deserve to be properly protected, no matter where they choose to stay. In the absence of further proposals for legislation on hotel safety, Labour MEPs support the review of the 1986 Council recommendation and want to see a firm provision for carbon monoxide safety within this revision. This is the only current EU legislative tool containing guidelines for hotels and fire and gas safety. Without any new regulation, we want to see specific research provisions on carbon monoxide safety and the use of carbon monoxide detectors. There is currently also no body which collects pan-European data on carbon monoxide. If the effectiveness of EU measures taken in this area is to be assessed, this must be remedied.  I hope that you will agree with me that it is essential to deal with the importance of gas safety and carbon monoxide and that we must take further action.

European industry maintains a dominant position in the global market for cable transport facilities – covering 60% of the global market – with the ski industry being the main market for cable transport technology. We are talking about four thousand jobs directly related to cable transport facilities companies and millions of users in Europe and around the world. These numbers highlight the importance of ensuring high consumer protection and full harmonisation of technical requirements, as well as clear and detailed rules that are uniformly applicable throughout the Union, creating a true pan-European framework that will set a standard at the global level and creating common standards. Harmonisation of the internal market is a challenge that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and I myself take very seriously. Since the creation in 1951 of the European Coal and Steel Community, the process of economic integration has been the main driver around which progressive political integration has been built. A harmonised internal market allows for greater economic integration and greater growth of our companies. Today more than ever, in the face of anti-European discourses, we must highlight the benefits of the Union and all the way we can still go to generate growth and wealth for our companies. With these three reports discussed here today, we take another step towards a more effective internal market, a friend of businesses and consumers. The market for cable transport facilities is characterized by a high degree of specialization. For this reason, we are dealing with a report of high technical content. The 2000 Directive, which we are replacing with a Regulation today, led to a number of divergences in transposition, which we will abolish tomorrow. In fact, the regulation we will adopt tomorrow allows for full harmonisation and allows us all to fulfil the overall political commitment to work towards improving regulation and simplifying the European regulatory environment. This proposal harmonises the conditions for the introduction on the market of safety subsystems and components for cable transport installations and ensures the free movement of these products in the European Union. To this end, uniform application throughout the Union is ensured, total harmonisation, since Member States cannot impose new or stricter requirements on their national legislation. This gives the industry the guarantee that its goods meet the technical requirements to be sold in all European countries and, on the other hand, the unnecessary costs of transposition are avoided. However, Member States will continue to have jurisdiction to regulate other aspects of cable transport facilities, such as land use, land management and environmental protection. Improving legal clarity was another key objective of this Regulation. The new Regulation indicates its scope and clearly lists exclusions. The proposal provides precision, in particular with regard to cable transport facilities for the transport of persons as well as leisure activities. Facilities used for leisure purposes at fairs or amusement parks and historic facilities over thirty years old are excluded from the scope. This complies with a request from many Member States, which will be responsible for the safety standards for these facilities. Finally, it is still worth noting the integration of subsystems into the conformity assessment procedures used for safety components. Treating subsystems differently than systems would result in market distortions and differences in treatment. Thus, the proposal maintains conformity assessment procedures for safety components, extending them to subsystems.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2170, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first I would like to thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and congratulate the rapporteurs Ms Ford, Ms Stihler and Mr López-Istúriz White for their hard work on the three files, which made it possible to find a satisfactory compromise which will, hopefully, help us to swiftly adopt the three regulations at first reading. A thorough and deeper single market is one of the priorities of the Commission. This package demonstrates that we are also not falling short on delivery. It is an important step in assuring a simpler legal framework. The three regulations on personal protective equipment, gas appliances and cableway installations cover a significant part of the products circulating in our internal market. They concern a vast range of products which millions of EU citizens use on a daily basis. It is crucial that single market legislation ensures that these products are safe and, of course, as regards personal protective equipment in particular, that this actually provides adequate protection. We also need to ensure that the companies producing those products can count on the legal framework that meets their needs and allows them to be competitive and prosper: a legal framework that is clear and does not impose an excessive burden. This package is really a major step forward in our endeavour to simplify the regulatory environment as the so-called ‘new approach’ directives are changed into regulations, which will be directly applicable in every EU Member State. This will significantly facilitate the life of enterprises. Instead of analysing and researching 28 national transposition laws, companies can directly refer to one single text available in all official languages of the European Union. With the adoption of the package we are also a step closer to completing the implementation of the new legislative framework, which will make the whole of our single market legislation much more consistent and easier to apply. New obligations have been introduced for importers and distributors, who now have a very clear set of tasks and checks that they must carry out before importing products from third countries into the EU. New rules on traceability will make it possible to follow a product throughout the entire distribution chain. The package will also give better tools to market surveillance authorities, allowing them to fight more efficiently against unsafe and non-compliant products on the EU market. This will be to the benefit of all companies, making them comply with the applicable rules. It will also reduce unfair competition. The benefits of this package are for all: for consumers, enterprises and authorities. And they are clearly there. Let me make one short remark on an institutional issue. It must be clear – and the recently-concluded negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement on better law-making have confirmed this – that comitology committees are not the same as Commission expert groups. With the new interinstitutional agreement coming into place shortly, the Commission will play closer attention to the role of the committees. The adoption of these proposals will doubtless have a positive effect on entrepreneurship and competitiveness in Europe. Thus, considering the agreement that has been achieved by the co-legislators and the benefits and significant added value for enterprises, citizens and national administrations, as I illustrated previously, the Commission welcomes the agreed compromise package.

The European internal market is characterised by high standards of consumer protection worldwide. I would even say and say that nowhere is a consumer as well protected as or by the EU. Specifically, this regulation is about very high standards for safety helmets, earmuffs, bicycle helmets, sunglasses and warning vests. It's not about the self-crocheted pot holder, it's not about rinsing gloves.  This regulation therefore concerns each and every one of us. When I buy my young daughter a bicycle helmet, when my father, as a do-it-yourselfer, puts on a respirator, or when countless workers on the building, i.e. everyone has to be able to rely on the guarantee of optimal protection – all over Europe. We therefore need high binding standards to protect the consumer from poor quality articles. For us as the GROUP of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, however, it was also important to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the manufacturing industry to be able to implement these new requirements in concrete terms. And this without too much bureaucratic burdens, because small and medium-sized enterprises simply lack the time for excessive paperwork. So what are the best uses of the best rules if no one is able to implement them afterwards? In this context, I particularly welcome our agreement on a simplified recertification procedure. This means that if a manufacturer does not change the product and the product still complies with all legal requirements, then he should not have to pay for this approval again.  So here we can show that we can do both. On the one hand, protect consumers throughout Europe efficiently from fraud and poor quality and, on the other hand, dispense with excessive bureaucratic requirements. That is why I am very much and explicit in support of this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2173, "date": "2016-01-19.json", "name": "Kerstin Westphal", "mepid": "96839", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

Protective clothing, which requires no less than 224 million workers in the European Union. But it is not only about protective equipment for professionals, it is also about protective equipment for private use. Yes, Mrs Ford, it is also a question of oven gloves, and safety must also be guaranteed here. Because wherever safety is on the packaging, safety must of course also be included. We have managed to do that. In the negotiations with both the Council and the Commission, we have been constantly aware of the danger of being too bureaucratic. That is why we have taken out a number of things, such as the rinsing gloves, but also sportswear, which has simply lost nothing. In addition, we have also achieved some facilitation for manufacturers: they get legal certainty and can now be confident that their type tests will be extended easily and quickly.

But the Commission got it wrong by including historic cableways, and I am delighted that they have now been excluded from the scope of this regulation. This is great news for Bridgnorth Cliff Railway in Shropshire, which next year celebrates its 125th birthday. It originally started as a way to help local people avoid climbing the 200 steps between the high and low town in Bridgnorth, but it has evolved into a major tourist draw and a vital source of income for the town. It already complies with national health and safety legislation, so it is safe, but forcing it to comply with new one—size—fits—all rules on replacement parts would likely have led it to being shut down, given the expense of trying to get its custom—made parts to fit the new requirements.

I am also happy that common sense prevailed in these negotiations. So, for instance the historical cableways like the one in Prague – the Petřín cableway – are excluded from the regulation. For me, these files are good examples of where European harmonisation just makes common sense. Unless there is a justifiable reason that a technical standard should be different between one Member State and another, common technical regulations help to increase competition in the marketplace.

It should be noted that this is of significant economic importance for the European market, estimated at around EUR 10 billion in 2010 and continues to grow, stimulated in particular by modern technologies, technological innovations such as new fibres, smart fabrics and nanomaterials.

Strengthening the harmonisation of national legislation in the various sectors remains a fundamental step, which not only unifies and simplifies the regulatory framework for market players, but also guarantees higher levels of consumer protection and also improves the lives of our citizens, and that is also our objective. As rapporteur for the report on the strategy for the single market in goods and services, for which we have shared many comments together, we are pursuing this approach, highlighting the need to effectively remove the concrete obstacles that take place in the harmonisation of the system. We often talk about an economic union, but in reality there is no economic union at three hundred and sixty degrees, and so one of the objectives we set ourselves is to harmonise the system more and more and remove these obstacles. The three reports, on which I congratulate the rapporteurs, which we will adopt tomorrow go in precisely this direction: that of making harmonisation more effective by moving from directive to regulation. This is the real step forward, it is what I, as a Parliament and as a Commission, will increasingly have to use, so that the regulation is adopted as soon as possible, very quickly in the individual Member States. That, in my view, is the real meaning of Europe and also of the role of the European Parliament.

That is why it is actually clear that the regulation on cable cars will play an essential role here, because they are, of course, very much used in tourism, but will also have great significance for smart cities in the future. Especially with the smart cities you will see that the cable cars naturally produce very little noise, also very little particulate matter, so that the cable car can also be used well over bridges, over corresponding obstacles. It is clear that the uniform level of safety can also reduce road accidents, and that the free movement of goods clearly shows that Europe can make proper use of the internal market and that, of course, new additional jobs can also be created, because this high European safety culture is, of course, also an export hit. Our cable car manufacturers have already worked on the markets worldwide, making an important contribution to life and safety. Billions of dollars are being generated here in this area.

I think it is fantastic that we have MEPs here in the House who are prepared to give their time, energy and expertise in dealing with issues like this when they get very little publicity out of it. But they can be sure of one thing. Their work is actually going to save the lives of European citizens because of the harmonisation of standards and ensuring that everything is done according to spec. We are covering three areas here: cable installations, gas appliances and protective equipment. Obviously, in relation to cableways, we have 60% of the world’s cableways – 17 500 in Europe. In my own country, the little island, Dursey Island, is dependent on a cable car to connect it with the mainland, so obviously, the higher the standard, the greater the security. In relation to gas appliances, we have 30 million stoves, boilers and cookers in Europe. Again, these can lead to major accidents. Carbon monoxide, in particular, is the highest killer in relation to these. In my own country we have had a very successful carbon monoxide awareness campaign. Again, having strong legislation here, harmonised across Europe, is very sensible and of course helps us to complete the single market. Regarding the final area – personal protective equipment – I think all we have to do is listen to Vicky Ford, who showed us what can happen with inferior products which can come onto the marketplace.

It would be appropriate to imagine a Europe where, of course, the rules were the same for all and all European citizens were equal in the face of the rules, because this would help – I believe – also to have a more comprehensive vision of Europe and which perhaps represented all European citizens more.  Today, in particular, we are voting and discussing in this plenary session the harmonization of the rules on cable way installations, and therefore on everything that concerns the installation of mountain stations in our Europe, I believe that we are taking a great step forward in the protection of all our stations, because it is clear, for anyone who has a certain type of competence in the field of , as at distances, often very limited by kilometres, i.e. one kilometre away in general, two ski resorts, perhaps one in France and one in Italy, have regulations that are completely different and which, moreover, place them in a position of unfair competition with each other.

Let me just say that I also consider this issue to be extremely important. I want to say to the Commissioner that I consider it important what at first glance seems like a mere formality, that regulations are being approached from directives. I have been responsible in the Czech Republic for five years for the implementation of directives into the national legal order and I know well what differences then exist between national regulations. This means one directive and twenty-eight different implementations. Therefore, if we want to create a truly single market with uniform rules, then, in my opinion, it is much better to apply a regulation that simply applies as one piece of legislation to the whole territory of the European Union. So the transition from directives to regulation is, in my view, extremely important in this case and, of course, in the content of what we are debating today and what will hopefully apply today is much better than the existing legislation in several fragmented directives. Colleagues have already talked about individual products, about the uniform rules for the requirements for these products. I particularly want to thank the rapporteurs and I want to comment on the discussions in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, where it has been possible to rationalise what requirements should be, in particular, for products which take the form of personal protective equipment.

While the construction of an internal market requires continuous efforts, the further deepening of the single market could yield significant gains for EU consumers and businesses if the remaining barriers are eliminated.  The Commission proposals for a regulations on appliances burning gaseous fuels, personal protective equipment (PPE), and cableway installations, update and align with the New Legislative Framework on the marketing of products. The PPE rules are now in need of updating to reflect the new developments in technology. I thus welcome the proposal, which lays down requirements for design and production of PPE to ensure the health and safety of users and the free movement of PPE in the EU market.  Apart from the harmonised approach, the new legislation does not imposing excessive burdens for businesses. This simplified and modernised legislation is needed especially for facilitating the inclusion of the Small and Medium enterprises in the market. A harmonised internal market will facilitate greater economic growth. With the three reports we are taking a step towards a more effective Single Market which will be both business and consumer friendly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
