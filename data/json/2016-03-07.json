It is generally believed that it is by developing a common European air passenger file that we will be able to trace their movements as best as possible and prevent future attacks. We worked there for three years. On such a sensitive issue, the 28 governments have agreed and our competent committee, which has worked this agreement, has given its own approval. This agreement balances the requirements of security and the requirements for safeguarding individual freedoms. Some of our colleagues had hoped that at the same time the negotiations on the regulation on the protection of personal data would be advanced. This precondition is now lifted. Meanwhile, further massacres have taken place in Paris and since then the threat has continued to escalate with the chaos of migration. In these circumstances, it is a real race of speed that is being waged between the terrorists and our democracies. We can no longer advance procedural arguments to delay our decision.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I am here today to present the new scheme to help distribute fruit and vegetables and milk in schools, the culmination of a year and a half of work. This result is the result of intense collaboration with the rapporteurs of the political groups, whom I would like to thank: Mrs Sofia Ribeiro, Mrs Ulrike Muller, Mr James Nicholson, Mr Bronis Ropé, Mr Marco Zullo and Mr Matt Carthy. I would also like to welcome the european Commission teams, which had made an excellent proposal under the leadership of Mr Joost Korte, and the Luxembourg Presidency, represented by Mr Franck Schmidt, with whom we have worked closely. In general, the new programme is based on two pillars: on the one hand, the health of children and the learning of healthy eating habits from an early age via school, and, on the other hand, support for farmers. In the first pillar, we ensured that the distribution of fresh produce - fruit, vegetables and milk - was an obligation for the Member States participating in the programme. The Member States participating in this programme - I would remind you that this participation is voluntary - will have the opportunity to expand the list of products, but under very strict conditions. For example, we have secured a ban on artificial sweeteners and flavours, as well as strengthening the role of national health authorities. I would remind you that one of the main objectives of this new programme is to combat childhood obesity and improve the health of children. Educational measures, now compulsory, will aim to bring children closer to agriculture, while teaching them good eating habits from an early age. Let us not forget that school plays an important role when it comes to training young people in life and encouraging them to develop healthy eating habits. The new programme also aims to encourage local and regional production, short circuits, organic products and thus support small local farmers by also promoting seasonality. Moreover, Parliament's powers are strengthened from this negotiation, since the Council wanted the application of Article 43, paragraph 3, which excluded us from important parts of this issue. Finally, we got in the negotiations base 43, paragraph 2, which gives us full co-decision. I fought and managed, with the help of all the shadow rapporteurs, to safeguard the prerogatives of this Parliament. With regard to the budget in particular: we have obtained an increase in the eur 20 million envelope for the Milk Programme to a hundred million, so that it is painless for countries that have used it very well for a long time and that they are not penalised by a distribution that will also apply to countries that did not have historical references. I am thinking of Croatia, in particular. With regard to transfers between the two programmes: Parliament and the Council agreed on a 20% transfer between the two programmes, with an additional 5% for the outermost regions. Some countries wanted 50% or even 100%. It would not have made sense, because one program would have been emptied for the benefit of the other. A European Commission report on the application of transfers was also awarded in 2023. We have also made the allocation of budget envelopes between Member States fairer. Two criteria for the whole programme: the share of children aged 6 to 10 in the Member States, but also the degree of development and the region of the Member State. For milk, we will take into account the historical use of program funds, as I said, with obviously - we have not forgotten - countries that did not have a historical reference or, at least, that had less. Clearly, the visibility of programmes and the reduction of administrative burdens represent further progress achieved by Parliament, always pursuing the same objective: to enable more children and schools to benefit from this programme. For all these reasons, I call on all colleagues to support this report, which aims to improve children's health, encourage food education and support agricultural production, which is, as you know, in difficulty, particularly in the fruit and vegetable sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to congratulate all, and in particular Mr Tarabella and the shadow rapporteurs, for the substantial efforts invested to conclude this file successfully.  I am sure Mr Tarabella will agree, and the shadows will agree, that it is an understatement to say that this process was complex and challenging since many sensitive issues had to be tackled, such as the legal basis of the proposal, the range of products to distribute, the budget of the programme, as well as the transfers between allocations for milk and fruit and vegetables.  After long and intensive discussions we finally secured a balanced agreement, not least thanks to the input and efforts of Parliament. This progress could have been achieved only with constructive cooperation and a flexible position from all sides. I have personally done my part in defending this scheme’s continuation and I thank Parliament for having done a great job in helping me to secure the future of the scheme. Parliament has played an important role in strengthening the health aspects of this scheme, in particular by ensuring that sufficient priority and prominence is given to fresh products. Members also took a solid position in relation to the objectives of the programme: to ensure that children learn to appreciate the real taste of products without substances used to enhance this taste. With your support tomorrow in the vote you will confirm an investment of EUR 250 million per year for the benefit of children and their attitude towards agriculture, and for healthy eating. This means over a six-year period a fixed budget of EUR 1.5 billion.

It is gratifying that Parliament has managed to increase the school milk programme by a further EUR 100 million to EUR 100 million and EUR 150 million for the school fruit programme. As Marc Tarabella has mentioned, this will preserve the funds available so far, at least in all Member States, and it will also take account of the special situation in Croatia and the outermost regions. I think it is important that our children and pupils are introduced to our excellent products in schools, and it is envisaged that certain funds may be used for pedagogical training.

What is more important is that we have probably succeeded for the first time in european union legislation that flavour enhancers such as monosodium glutamate are wrong. We have succeeded in anticipating that European Union funds will not be used to finance food products with these unhealthy additives. It is difficult to believe with common sense alone, but it is unlikely that such a ban would have existed so far. We have also managed to improve the entire management of the support programme. The new document clarifies the criteria for allocating funds among Member States. Member States will be able to use support funds more flexibly. We have also successfully included provisions to promote short supply chains. In addition, in the context of good governance, greater involvement of local and regional authorities in the programme-making and implementation process is envisaged. This is very important because it is local authorities that are generally better off than the central ones of the specific needs of the local population.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Marco Zullo", "mepid": "125237", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Tarabella for his excellent synthesis work and also for the way in which he conducted the negotiations to the trialogue, which made it possible to bring home a good result from our point of view.

For me, it has been very good that the volume of the child population be taken into account when sharing these funds should be included in the agreement. Also, of course, that there is that extra 20 million in milk endowment because, of course, it could not be otherwise: we expand the money because we expand the products that can be used.

My announcement today is also to make the goal even clearer. The aim of these programmes is quite clear that sensory learning is also required. At school you always learn with your head, with your heart and with your hand – as it is called. But you also have to learn with your mouth. You have to learn how things really taste right when they are really ripe, when they are really good. In other words, sensory learning is at the heart of it: it is clear that taste creation is being promoted.  In times of fast food, taste formation is getting under the wheels more and more. Children only taste very sweet and quite salty, and the intermediate tones taste them too little. Taste formation is one of the most important goals, besides health and, at the end of course, of course, the change in behaviour.

The former has been around for nearly forty years and is attended by nearly twenty million children. The latter is much shorter, but also attended by about ten million students.  Therefore, the Commission's initiative to implement both programmes under a common legal and time frame deserves parliament's strong support, especially as this means simplifying the procedures for accession and participation in both programmes. This, in turn, will encourage an increase in the number of beneficiaries of both schemes, increasing the number of young people using them, and thus in the future the number of consumers of milk and processed products, as well as fruit and vegetables, which will create additional demand for European agricultural products.

I am also interested to see that the schools that go into the scheme have got to erect ‘gratitude plaques’– in other words, the picture of the blue background and the yellow stars to say how grateful everyone must be to the EU. As the children drive to school they will see gratitude plaques in the fields – the farmers have their environmental schemes – and then they go into school and there are more gratitude plaques, and this is all going to happen during our referendum campaign about British membership of the European Union. Call me cynical. I hope that the milk in the schools will be British milk and not Irish milk, but we shall wait and see, and of course the British apple grower will not be very pleased if his product is not mentioned and bananas are.

I have pointed to this problem numerous times at the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but also at this pulpit, and I am glad that my arguments have been accepted.  The Regulation allows agricultural producers a new market through the placement of domestic, quality products in schools. The Regulation also allows Member States to include in their measures a wider range of agricultural products, as well as other local, regional or national specialties such as honey, olive oil or table olives. This program, in addition to having an educational role for our young people about what they need to eat and that they should eat healthy and homemade, it also has a social dimension because for poor children this meal will be the only meal they will eat.

These are all things that could be achieved with this programme. If, of course, I do not agree 100% with the compromise – because I believe that chocolate milk, etc. is not necessarily something that belongs there – we have managed to take measures in these areas too: that only the milk content is promoted here, that, as colleagues have already said, there must be no additional sweeteners in the future, no flavourings, etc., namely artificial ones.

The educational aspect is central: in a globalized world where the supply of food products is very high. training informed consumers protects against disease and scams.  Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for including an aspect which is particularly close to my heart in the Regulation. Products distributed in schools must be local products. Priority must be given to regional production in order to support markets in great suffering, but also because the link with the land and with the agriculture of its territory is rediscovered by traditions and self-knowledge.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Pirkko Ruohonen-Lerner (ECR).", "mepid": "132366", "text": "   – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what to do about it.

I welcome the accompanying educational measures in support of distribution included in the agreement and it is important to bring children closer to agriculture and to encourage young citizens to know about food and their origin, to family with their taste and with the varieties of eu agricultural products, especially those produced in their region, with the help, for example, of experienced nutritionists and farmers. It is therefore an excellent result, to encourage the consumption of fruits, vegetables and milk.

Mr President, malnutrition in Greece has taken on enormous proportions. According to the prevention research institute, six out of ten Greek students in 2013 - 2014 did not have access to food of sufficient quality. In addition, for the school year 2014 - 2015 53% of pupils' families face food insecurity and 21% suffer from hunger. This shows that European aid for the supply of fruit and vegetable products and even dairy products to greek schools is half-measures and not sufficient to tackle child malnutrition in Greece, which greece is now facing in recent years a humanitarian crisis. It must be made clear in every direction that the eradication of malnutrition in schools cannot wait, as children's health is at risk. So what needs to be done is for the troika to take the debt noose out of Greece, to stop the mercely austerity and the suffocation of the Greek economy, especially in view of the critical situation that the refugee issue is causing Greece.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 64, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Λάμπρος Φουντούλης (", "mepid": "125070", "text": "  NI). Mr President, I have to agree that it is a very positive step to incorporate the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables and fresh milk into the diet of European adults. Of course, I very much doubt that these measures alone will bring some effect if they are not combined with a simultaneous learning of the beneficial effects of this diet, not only from children but also from their parents and other adults.  Of course, I would like to point out that with the austerity policies implemented by the European Union this diet will probably be the only one that some Greek children will have access to, since we have a huge increase in unemployment and many parents are unable to offer even the necessities to their children once they have zero income.

The scheme needed to be changed because of a Commission evaluation, but also because of a Court of Auditors report which highlighted that there were deficiencies and inefficiencies because of two separate schemes in milk and fruit and vegetables. The fact that we now have those schemes together will save money on administration, provide a more efficient scheme and give more money directly to the educational establishments for our particular products.  It is an important timing for this particular scheme, with market difficulties in dairy and fruit and veg, and there has been a request for a larger budget because there is a higher demand for these very important schemes in many of our Member States. I would like to say to Mr Mach and Mr Agnew that it is a voluntary, co-financed scheme – there is no compulsion for Member States to participate. The United Kingdom, I understand, participates in the milk scheme.  Ms Noichl mentioned that we should have priority given to local fresh products over processed foods in order to generate healthy living and good habits for children at a younger age, and this is exactly what the scheme is intended to do and what it is doing. Mr Frunzulică and Mr Mato mentioned fruit and vegetables and how important it is to have a broad range of products included, and I am particularly pleased to agree with the inclusion of bananas in this particular scheme, which is important for areas like the Canary Islands, but also for our outermost regions, our POSEI regions, which is a great boost to the consumption of those particular internal European Union products.  I would like to say to Ms Grapini that the main target group intended in these schemes is children between six and ten years old, and it will certainly hit the target that she advocated. The importance of having this scheme at such a young age will hopefully, as many speakers have indicated, be able to get young people involved and young children at this early age involved in good healthy habits in terms of their food intake and to be able to deal with the health agenda, particularly in terms of obesity. Mr Jahr, I agree with these sentiments in relation to streamlining the scheme, and the scheme will be reviewed in 2023, as outlined.  Mr Agnew, I know that you used the word ‘cynical’, but as you know, farmers in the UK do not have to worry about any gratitude plaques, because they get GBP 3.2 billion every year from the European taxpayer. I hope they will continue to get that as Members of the European Union in the future, because you cannot be sure how much money they might get from the UK Treasury.  The flexibility of this particular scheme and the flexibility shown by the rapporteur and the rapporteurs all round will help to make this scheme more successful. I would like to confirm to Ms Aguilera that olive oil is included in the scheme, and I am sure that would be a help to the country that she knows best. From the point of view of the French delegation, honey was also included in the scheme. I hope that this flexibility clearly indicates that we have taken everybody’s views reasonably on board, we have had a balanced outcome and have included as part of the trilogues many initiatives and ideas that people had in a very flexible way. So I wish to congratulate Mr Tarabella again and thank everybody and the shadows for their cooperation and I wish the scheme every success in the years ahead. It will, of course, be like any other scheme and subject to a review, which will be in 2023.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Marc Tarabella", "mepid": "29579", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, perhaps we must first remember that, indeed, at Parliament level, it has been firmly ensured that the legal basis is the one that clearly allows codecision. In this regard, I once again thank the shadow rapporteurs, who unanimously supported me and who made the legal basis the one we wanted. On the content, I will make five remarks in response to the comments of five colleagues. Firstly, with regard to 6 to 10 year olds: I would like to point out that this is an objective criterion for determining the amount owed to each Member State, but that it is, of course, open to Member States to use the money for children from zero years, i.e. in nurseries, in pre-schools and primary schools, of course, but also in secondary schools. At least it allowed for objective criteria. The second thought concerned chocolate milk. A few grams of sweetness in such a brutal world, it doesn't hurt. Especially since it was demanded that it be real chocolate, from real chocolate beans, without artificial aromas, and that there be 90% milk in the chocolate milk. So, if by chocolate milk, children can ingest more calcium, which is good for their bone build, so much the better! Thirdly, some criticised the Commission - one of them who did so - by saying that Parliament's role is to listen more to citizens. I note, however, that on this proposal the Commission has done very well, I say! As with the bio regulation that is being discussed, the Commission has done a very good job, and it is the Council that is distorting this regulation for the time being. Regarding the reflection on health authorities, on health which would not be a European competence: clearly, the European Union has every right to be concerned that obesity is on the rise among children and that, in 24 out of 28 countries in the Union, daily consumption of fruit and vegetables is insufficient. We are therefore merely suggesting to the Member States: there is a budget of 250 million, free for them to add national co-financing. Fifth point, on the budget: as I have just said, co-financing by the Member States is possible. I conclude, Mr President, by thanking in particular three people beyond the shadow rapporteurs: Alexandra Leone, my assistant, who has helped me well in this matter, Maggie Coulthard, from my political group, and Hélène Cuisinier, from the staff of Parliament's Agriculture Committee, who has been very effective in negotiating.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 70, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.

They make it more possible, together with the increase in the consumption of fruits, vegetables and milk by children, to stimulate more local production. I find it particularly valuable to offer local and regional products and to the possibility of including other local, regional or national specialities such as honey, olives and olive oil within the scope of the Regulation.

I would also like to thank the European Commission, which has demonstrated real skill in terms of creativity and flexibility in the negotiations. At the same time, I would like to express my special thanks to the Latvian Presidency. Its dedication to this dossier has given us a unique opportunity to reach a very attractive agreement for Parliament. The result was the first European law establishing the link between animal welfare, animal health and public health. All in accordance with the principle of \"one health\".  The communicable diseases to be dealt with by law, such as avian influenza, also threaten human health. The same applies to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. All in all, this new law gives us much better preparedness and better tools to deal with disease outbreaks in the future and to focus on prevention, prevention. The essence of the law's requirements also includes that every keeper should be forced to apply the principles of good animal husbandry and the responsible use of veterinary medicines. In other words, it will be much more difficult in the future to mask poor animal husbandry with antibiotics. The law also tackles the problem of the stray dogs in Europe. When taking infectious disease control measures against wild and feral animals, national authorities are obliged to avoid any unnecessary pain and suffering in the animals. Breeders and sellers of dogs will be obliged to register, and the European Commission is mandated to adopt EU rules on dog registration, should the need arise. In addition, it has succeeded in resolving the horizontal and therefore extra complex issue of delegated and implementing acts.

It is a brilliant example of the fact that it is actually possible to simplify european animal rules. It is my predecessor, Marit Paulsen, who has worked on this for the most part, and I am grateful that I have had the privilege of finishing this work.

This is a very important piece of draft legislation. It is the result of a great deal of hard work by Parliament, by the Council and by the Commission. The outcome is, I believe, a credit to all three institutions. We all share a deep and common understanding of the fundamental importance of animal health and its link to human health. Furthermore, we collectively recognise that animal disease outbreaks and even crises will inevitably occur from time to time. Clearly we must ensure we are best prepared to deal with whatever the future holds in store and whatever possible disease scenarios come our way. Good animal health makes a vital contribution to the sustainability of our agriculture and aquaculture sectors. It also underpins our competitiveness in international markets. The new regulation will bring a more efficient and streamlined system to combat transmissible animal diseases, safeguard human and animal health, and contribute to a safer and more competitive environment for our agriculture and aquaculture sectors.  In particular it will clarify the responsibilities of all actors, such as farmers, veterinarians, other professionals and competent authorities, improve our response to trans-boundary animal disease outbreaks and lighten the burdens of certain measures on the agriculture and aquaculture sectors in a measured and risk-proportionate manner.  The One Health concept is now well enshrined and indeed is becoming more deeply and vitally rooted, for example in relation to our work on antimicrobial resistance.

This new regulation on animal health will combine 50 current disease prevention and control rules. This should help to simplify the existing legal framework. Through numerous compromises and the combination of hundreds of amendments, the Committee on Agriculture has managed to find a broad compromise in terms of disease control and animal health. Effective reporting and cooperation within the 28 EU Member States, but also between EU Member States and third countries, will be better ensured in the future.

Swine and avian plague are the worst cases, those exalted by the media, but there are several diseases, threats of communicable diseases, which this animal health regulation intends to combat. I would like to thank my fellow Members who have worked with me on this proposal, the rapporteur and Mrs Paulsen, who has concluded his term of office with this regulation, achieving great success and managing to achieve broad consensus among all the groups.  There are two aspects that I would like to highlight today: the first is that, at last, we have put it in black and white, that animal health depends on their well-being, that is, on their living conditions. A mistreated animal can never be a healthy animal. Article 13 of the Treaty recognises that animals are meaningless beings and we call for all those who treat animals, from breeders to holders, to avoid their pain and suffering, applying the principle of good breeding, the former, and treatment that meets rules of humanity, the latter.  Then there is the prevention aspect: the transmission of diseases, which is more than opposed, must be prevented through better animal husbandry and the responsible use of veterinary medicines; prevention that also involves a clear responsibility of those who care for animals.  The importance of this regulation lies in its establishment of a single regulatory framework, compared with the 40 different previous pieces of legislation, some of which were from the 1960s. Clear rules on animal welfare as well as animal health are still needed in a Europe where cases of unjustified violence and actual torture of animals are still all too often tolerated or even ignored to date.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 82, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Janusz Wojciechowski", "mepid": "23784", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Selimovic, the previous rapporteur, who was absent from us, Mrs Paulsen, for the very good work that has been done.

Concern for animal health is important not only for the animals themselves, but above all for public health reasons, for reasons of human health as well.  As shadow rapporteur of the ECR Group, I would like to express my satisfaction that the proposals for a strategy to protect pets and, indirectly, homeless animals have been taken into account. The obligation to register the identification of these animals introduced in the strategy is a very important step forward on this issue, but I believe that we should take the next steps.

Antibiotic use is increasing dramatically worldwide, by as much as 67% in just one generation. Since 1987, however, no new classes of antibiotics have been added. Action must therefore be taken both veterinary and humane. The Netherlands proves that this is possible! In just four years, antibiotic use in animal husbandry has been reduced by more than half. It is good that the Dutch Presidency has made this a spearhead. For the first time in history, a meeting of ministers of both public health and agriculture has been organised, the so-called one health approach is essential.  The new animal health law, which has now been negotiated in Europe, is a step in the right direction. The liberal group has left some crucial elements, such as the legal obligation to use antibiotics responsibly. Antibiotic reduction is not an easy task. It can only be done by working together smartly, good management and innovations in stable systems, for example. The cost aspect is important here. It cannot be that one farmer has to invest and the other does not.  We want to ensure a level playing field and at the same time eradicate the problem at the root.

It is to be welcomed that Article 1 of this draft takes account of the prevention of animal pain, stress and suffering. Another important positive aspect is the mandatory registration of all professional breeders and sellers of animals, which will help to ensure that the illegal puppy trade, which causes so much suffering to the animals concerned, is finally offered parole. Regular puppy factories engage in a massive illegal trade in unvaccinated puppies, whose health is simply catastrophic due to the circumstances in which they are bred and reared. And this fatal ity also poses enormous risks to the spread of disease. Unfortunately, however, I must also say that this proposal does not really serve animal welfare. Although it clearly emphasises the link between animal welfare and animal health, this proposal focuses on dealing with communicable animal diseases. We expect the Commission to present us with an animal welfare framework law, and to do so as soon as possible. It is about sentient creatures and not about lifeless production units. For my group, the definition of domesticated and wild animals also remains a very problematic point. According to this definition, for example, stray dogs are considered to be wild animals.

Although the draft legislation in question is merely a framework regulatory document, it adequately reflects the main issues of animal health and disease prevention. We support its goals of protecting animals not only from diseases, but also from stress and pain. We support its system for categorising animal diseases, and the requirements of professional knowledge for animal farmers. At the same time, I would like to call on colleagues to draw attention to structural circumstances that can strengthen the effectiveness of even the best animal welfare objectives. I am thinking of the disastrous decline in the incomes of livestock farmers, such as the declining incomes of dairy producers and pig farmers, which prevent farmers from investing the necessary funds in the health and full feeding of cattle. According to my data, dairy cows have been fed under-quality feed in at least a few Member States for the second year. This means that farmers simply can no longer purchase the necessary nutritional additives, vitamins and medicines, and thus, for economic reasons, creates conditions for the spread of animal diseases. I would therefore like to call on colleagues to vote in favour of this report.

It is therefore necessary to take measures concerning animal health, as the text proposes, but it is necessary that this well-being be respected to the end of the chain, because the issue is also about food security and, therefore, human health. However, it may be threatened by the links between welfare, animal health and food-borne diseases. Stress, possible abuse and the mode of slaughter can promote the development of diseases, such as E. coli or Salmonella infections, for example, and it depends on the humans and how they treat animals during breeding, of course, but also transport, methods of stunning and slaughter. Regarding ritual slaughter, the Netherlands has decided to subject it to stricter rules and has prescribed stunning and special labelling. This is a common-sense measure! For the slaughter of animals that take several minutes to die is contrary to your principles of animal welfare, which, in fact, is not at all respected by these methods of ritual slaughter. The health risks associated with slitting are also known, as this technique facilitates the reflux of germs from the intestines and stomach, germs that escape through the wound and thus promote contamination of meat.

It gives us more agility, and fundamentally gives more agility to the European Commission to act in the event of a disease with a strong impact.

According to a study in recent years, the number of antibiotics used in animal husbandry is expected to increase worldwide to around 130,000 tonnes by 2030. On the other hand, the trend of antibiotic allocation within the Union is, thankFully, declining. It is therefore right to encourage our domestic agriculture to use medicines in animal husbandry in a responsible and careful manner. However, it is much more important to raise the issue of the use of antibiotics in trade agreements as well. In the Usa, for example, according to a report in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, the use of medicines in animal production is increasing very sharply.

The globalisation of trade and climate change pose serious risks to both animal and consumer health, which is why the European Union should simplify, intensify controls on animals imported from non-European Union countries, so as to ensure food safety, but at the same time not to transmit diseases to consumers.  For the necessity of this, I would like to take as an example my country, Greece, where sheep and goats are often smuggled, mainly from Turkey but also from Skopje, which have not undergone the controls provided for, and therefore pose a risk to the health of domestic breeds of animals and also to consumers.

I must point out that animal health is important for the safety of EUROPEAN Union citizens and we are concerned about the increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, which has recently posed an increasing public health and safety risk. Excessive use of antimicrobial drugs contributes to the accelerated appearance of new strains of bacteria resistant to new antibiotics. Excessive use of antimicrobials is harmful to the health of animals and humans, but also to consumers' perception of the food they use.  Europe prides itself on a high level of food quality and safety and high standards of animal care thanks to our hardworking farmers. It defends these high standards in international negotiations on international trade agreements. It is this Regulation that is the answer to the widespread and unwise use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine. It adopts measures such as the collection of relevant, comparable and sufficiently detailed data on the use of antimicrobial medical devices in animals in the Member States. These measures are necessary to make the use of these funds more prudent and to contribute to reducing the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Animal owners are invited in the breeding process to stick to the principle of good master and apply drugs responsibly and under supervision.  This Regulation also has a public health dimension, as, in addition to caring for animal health and welfare, and due to the reasonable and measured use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine, according to commission estimates, it will directly affect 25 million people.

I have listened to the views of this House with close attention. The various points illustrate the very strong interest of the honourable Members in this legislative initiative. Some of you mentioned the economic situation, and the Commission is aware about today’s economic situation which, in some cases, will damage animal health issues. Some of you raised questions about stray dogs: the European Parliament recently adopted a resolution calling upon the Commission to adopt rules for the compulsory identification and registration of dogs and cats and some other animals commonly used as pets. The new animal health law is a legal framework and contains basic rules, including those for the identification and registration of animals. It provides more specific rules only for those animal species where the identification and registration rules exist at present. However, the regulation also provides for the possibility to lay down further detailed requirements for the identification and registration of animals of other species such as dogs, cats, and so on, for which specific requirements do not exist at present. The necessity of such future rules will be assessed by the Commission in the course of the years following the adoption of animal health law, and then delegated and implementing acts will be prepared. The Commission is committed to animal welfare and considers it a very important issue, as you just raised in the discussions. However, the scope of this regulation focuses on the transmissible animal diseases and does not directly regulate animal welfare. A number of compromise solutions were found during the trialogue negotiations to clarify the relation between animal health and animal welfare and to address the concerns of the Parliament on animal welfare. It was not always easy to agree to all of them; nonetheless, the Commission understands the importance of animal welfare for the European Parliament and has therefore made a statement confirming its commitment to animal welfare. The Union has a well-developed acquis regarding animal welfare, covering different species (broilers, laying hens, pigs, calves) or activities (farming, transport, slaughter, research, etc.). This animal welfare legislation will necessarily continue to apply.  Some mentioned antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is very important to me, therefore issues of antimicrobial resistance were always included in the Commission’s proposal on animal health. This, together with the future legislation on veterinary medicines and medicated feed, will provide solid grounds to address this issue. Finally, the Commission has also made the statement, ‘The Commission undertakes to publish a regular report as regards the use of antimicrobial medicinal products in animals in the EU on the basis of data made available by the Member States.’ Let me finish by expressing my sincere hope for the support of Parliament for an early second reading agreement on this file, which would pave the way for its multiple benefits to come to fruition as early as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 113, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Jasenko Selimovic", "mepid": "134243", "text": "   Rapporteur.

The new law will give us better preparedness and better tools to deal with serious outbreaks of disease in the future. There is a great deal of suffering both in humans and in animals that can thus be avoided and, to mention it too, large amounts that can be saved for society in the form of reduced health care costs.

In this way, we can tackle the illegal puppy trade, which now leads to countless harrowing examples of animal cruelty. There are still \"puppy mills\" where puppies are illegally and unvaccinated on the assembly line. This has to stop! Proper identification and registration can help.  However, a major sticking point of the law remains the difference between loved animals and wild animals. Stray animals and runaway animals fall within the definition of wild animals; as a result, the presence of the owner or caretaker of an animal determines the degree of protection against diseases (such as vaccination) and against disease control measures.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which Since the beginning of the debate on Port Package 1 15 years ago, there has been – and rightly so in my opinion – in this House, no majority in favour of the port package.  I am convinced that today's draft is better and that it can be approved, because it is very different from the previous port packages. Approval and a mandate for negotiation in the Council are possible because the draft no longer abuses the desire for competitiveness for radical market ideologies.  The focus is no longer on the forced opening of markets – at whatever cost – but on the better organisation of ports, even with a limitation of port service providers where it is necessary and sensible.  Today's draft is about strengthening competitiveness, about greater transparency, about the autonomy of ports, about better information and involving port users, in order to provide serious but unbureaucratic supervision in the sense of a complaints body. Strengthening competitiveness also means that there are good jobs in ports. In the 21st century, there should be no more day labor work in our ports.  I know that these issues cannot be resolved by the regulation. But a hint for those who could regulate it is necessary and useful. This relates to training and training, to working time models that could be developed to enable better and better jobs. Today's solution was possible because, unlike her predecessors, Commissioner Bulc took a very cooperative and pragmatic approach. It has also become possible because we have spoken to many stakeholders, some of them on the ground. Of course, we have not been able to convince everyone. British ports say that because they are private ports, they are not affected – unlike the private ports on the continent. The Polish terminal operators are against this because too much transparency is not easy for them to discuss. European shipowners are rightly unenthusiastic, because their dream that Filipino sailors will be able to load and unload the ships themselves in ports in the future has finally been dreamed up with tomorrow's vote.  We will start negotiations with the Council quickly if the plenary decides tomorrow. But there will only be a successful conclusion if both sides – including the Council – move in terms of content and if Commissioner Vestager joins in with a sensible draft on the block exemptions in the context of the debate on state aid to ports. We will also examine them intensively. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive support, the Commissioner for the pragmatic approach she has chosen and from stakeholders from all sides – a thank you, because the will to achieve a good result was evident. I know that we have not been able to satisfy everyone. However, I am presenting this report today with the firm conviction that this is a good compromise, which I would ask tomorrow to adopt.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission welcomes the report that we will discuss today. I sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Fleckenstein, for the important and future-oriented work he has accomplished. Thank you also to the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the good quality of the report. The port services regulation is an important piece of the European transport policy to foster investment and push further modernisation of ports. You know about the crucial role of ports for the transport system and our economy. They are Europe’s gateways to the world. They provide employment in ports directly and in related sectors. They are hubs for short-sea shipping which we must strengthen as part of our decarbonisation strategy. In short, ports are valuable assets which we must preserve and strengthen. That is what the regulation aims at and that is why it is one of the Commission’s priority files for 2016. The regulation will ensure transparency in the use of public funds in ports. We need to ensure a level playing field between European ports, many of which receive considerable financial support from both national and EU budgets. Financial transparency is crucial for this. Financial transparency will also allow us to simplify the application of state aid rules. The Commission is working on the general block exemption regulation; it should exempt certain port investments from state aid rules and focus the Commission’s work on critical cases in order to establish a genuine level playing field. A first draft, proposed, was published today for consultation. And today the public consultation has started. The port services regulation will provide an important input into this work, provided it gets your support. The port services regulation will also bring more clarity for the organisation and tendering of port services. It will end today’s unclear situation where ports policy is not decided by the legislator but defined on a case-by-case basis by the European Court of Justice, only according to the Treaty principles. The adoption of the regulation will therefore mean more legal clarity and legal stability for both port workers and investors. The regulation is also important for our decarbonisation strategy, which after COP21 we are even more committed to. Making ports more attractive is essential to developing alternatives to congested motorways and avoiding unnecessary land and sea traffic. We need to diversify maritime routes and promote short-sea shipping. The report got broad support in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. All major organisations representing the European port sector stand behind it: the trade unions, port authorities, port terminal operators and port service providers. Let me stress that the Commission fully supports the social dialogue as well as better training and safety for workers. Let me also stress that the regulation does not impose a one-size-fits-all approach. We know that every port in Europe is different. The draft regulation respects this. It is compatible with all forms of organisations, including private ports. It does not impose one model. Your vote tomorrow, to start the trilogues, is essential for advancing with this important piece of legislation. The Council already adopted a general approach in 2014. This was one of the major successes of the Italian Presidency. It is time for Parliament to enter into negotiations with the Council and conclude this file. The Dutch Presidency is very interested in negotiating and concluding the file still before summer.

Mr President, ports are undoubtedly one of the most important levers of economic growth but also a source of prosperity for the Member States and Europe. It is no coincidence that 75% of the European Union's trade and 38% of intra-Community trade are carried out by sea, which indicates the importance of the sector.  That is why the regulation that we will be voting on in plenary aims to enhance the performance of European ports and improve the overall quality of port services with a view to modernising them. It also creates conditions of fairer competition, reduces legal ambiguities, strengthens transparency and better allocation of public resources. Only the creation of a stable legal environment governed by a fair playing field and specific transparency rules can attract investment in ports, contributing to the development of the European Union economy, particularly in times of economic crisis.  At the same time, the new legislation gives ports greater autonomy over the definition of port charges. This strengthens competition both between European ports and between European Union ports with third countries. In addition, it provides for a number of favourable provisions for small ports in order to avoid a disproportionate administrative burden and additional fees and costs. Europe needs such legislative initiatives that highlight common interests between Member States and strengthen the single internal market.

Especially given the diversity in size, operations and governance of EU ports, we should only regulate this sector with the utmost care.  Now, I should say that I am not saying this on behalf of the S&amp;D, but I and other Labour MEPs are not opposed to the idea of progressive balanced EU measures on ports. These could help improve standards in the sector, in the UK and across the whole of Europe, on port safety and security, terms and conditions of workers, environmental protection, as well as provide a secure framework for investment.  The problem is that, despite the commendable efforts of our rapporteur, this proposal, even if amended as he suggests, simply does not quite achieve the goals that I have mentioned. There are good provisions on training. There are good provisions encouraging good practice on minimum requirements on tendering, but it is not enough overall.  The draft regulation is in fact an example of the spectacular double standards of the so-called better regulation agenda; for instance, the provisions to regulate port charges will undoubtedly still be an administrative burden for ports and do not give legal clarity if you read them carefully – you are still asking yourself questions about what they mean. They are also unsupported by concrete evidence from the Commission of major problems in charging practices in many ports and the report by PwC – the management consultancy report that looked into this – did not uncover major problems.  There has also been no updated impact assessment since at least 2012 despite the new institutional agreement on better regulation saying that these things should be updated. Equally the right for trade unions to take legitimate industrial action is not sufficiently protected in Article 8 and Article 10 fails to provide for the compulsory transfer of staff. We were looking for something that improved workers’ rights, including in relation to how agency workers are dealt with, but it is just not there.

He stuck his neck out and got to work realistically. As a result, the PPE, ALDE and ECR Group have now achieved an excellent result with the rapporteur. I am thinking of the following points: firstly, less bureaucracy and less social burden on ports. Initially, the proposal was full of social provisions, such as the requirement that port companies should provide training and training to port workers. But many port companies are not about that at all. That is rightly out now. Secondly, ports now decide for themselves how they want to be organised. Mandatory market access is no longer an issue. Europe is now in line with the situation in the regions in the Member States, not the other way around. Port companies decide for themselves how they want to be organized, and rightly so. The situation in Rotterdam is very different from, for example, in Vigo, Spain. Subsidiarity and sovereignty have really come into their own. Thirdly, there is an exception for private ports. We have taken extra account of the situation of the British private ports and they can now arrange services themselves, such as towing or mooring ships. They also do not have to go through complicated procurement procedures, so that too is very nice. Some here are calling for the proposal to be rejected. That would be very stupid. It is stupid, because the Directorate-General for Competition will come around and Commissioner Vestager will have the provisions on competition also apply to ports.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. Thank you, above all, to Knut Fleckenstein as rapporteur. Ports in Europe are different. We have already noticed this, and it makes it so terribly difficult to get a suitable port package. This is the third attempt, and I hope that this time it will really work. It is perhaps quite nice that I can now speak about S&amp;D and ECR, because we have already noticed how different the positions we have been arguing about are also natural with us. The S&amp;D said that too little attention has been paid to social matters, too little attention has been paid to workers' rights. The ECR said that there is actually too much of it. That is why I have to say that this shows that the rapporteur has reached a really very good compromise. It is, of course, the case that no one is 100% satisfied with a compromise. Even here, the Liberals, some are not entirely enthusiastic, because there are exceptions that come out of this regulation. The fact that not all services are covered, that handling services and pilots are taken out, that smugglers and moorings have special clauses – these are all things that we would not have liked to have had. But it is now the case that we think it really is a compromise, something that is a viable way to move forward. In my view, something is very important: press releases have of course been issued in advance, and both the port operators and the port trade unionists are in favour of this compromise and ask all of us to agree to this here in plenary, so that we can continue to negotiate and thus for the ports, which are really hugely important for Europe and for future flows of goods – we want to stay on the pulse of the times. , really have semi-uniform rules, have transparency about financial flows, in some areas a bit more competition, but very good conditions also for the workers, and then also incentives for investors to really invest in the ports. All this is entirely guaranteed. I know that it was difficult because the Commission's proposal and what the rapporteur initially had did not really fit together. Now we really have a middle position, and I can only encourage all those who are still thinking about voting against it at the moment: there is a whole lot in it, no one can have anything.

There is also no doubt that public finance needs transparency. We cannot talk about port services without looking at the public money flowing into the ports for their infrastructure and operations. The port services regulation could have facilitated some of those aims. Unfortunately it seems clearly to fail to meet its own objectives of ensuring a more sustainable and interconnected transport network. On financial transparency, the one valid point it does contain, it still does not do enough to ensure much needed legal certainty for the sector due to the strong link between financial transparency and the Commission’s envisaged state-aid guidelines and/or block exemptions for the ports. Both proposals should have been developed in parallel. Having first announced this initiative some 11 years ago, the Commission’s news that it will not now adopt state-aid guidelines before 2017 is frustrating but somehow unsurprising.  If Parliament accepts this report it needs to be prepared for some serious criticism, having backed a piece of binding legislation that does very little to tackle anything at all. This legislation is undeveloped and ineffective, and I therefore call upon Members to reject this report when they have the opportunity to vote tomorrow.

Mr President, the liberalisation of port services is an old European sea snake. Although the European Commission has already suffered two failures in the early 2000s, it is back in charge: never two without three. The commission's proposal is unacceptable. On the one hand, it tries to standardise the major European ports, which have different organisations, effectively preventing Member States and port managers from framing these services based on experience. On the other hand, under the pretext of competitiveness and with a view to attracting more investment, it emphasizes the need to liberalise certain services. This would have the negative effect of preventing States from requiring certain services to be performed under the national flag for security reasons. Replacing qualified sailors, pilots or tugs with under-qualified persons, underpaid because they are employed on a flag of convenience vessel, is not an option. The amendments of the Committee on Transport are positive, but at the end of the day, this regulation will be an empty shell. So why would you want to continue to harmonize and privatize at all costs? Do we want our ports, strategic elements of our economy, to be bought out little by little by foreign investors, as was the case recently in Piraeus, taken over by the Chinese group Cosco?

The regulation will apply to all ports included in TNT. Member States, however, have the flexibility not to include ports in the global network in peripheral regions. Small ports have flexibility in avoiding red tape and disproportionate costs in order to strengthen the efficiency and quality of services.

It should not be forgotten that we were dealing with a proposal from the European Commission from the so-called Kallas era, which aimed at turbo liberalisation in all areas. In this respect, it was all the more difficult for the rapporteur to find a compromise. As the name suggests, a compromise is not 100% what everyone wants. Nevertheless, we must be prepared to compromise. If we now look at this paper that is on the table, we see that the forced liberalisation that should have come in the original version of the European Commission has been prevented. If we go within ourselves, we see that the ports can now decide for themselves how they want to offer their port services. What, for me personally, was the main argument for ultimately agreeing to are the so-called minimum requirements that the rapporteur has negotiated, minimum requirements, for example, for the withdrawal of so-called good reputes in the event of non-compliance with social and labour standards. The fact that the right to strike has also been negotiated in a binding manner is a win. Because I remember many other dossiers where we did not succeed.

It was actually a Conservative government in 1981 that began the process of privatising the ports in the United Kingdom, and therefore I will not support anything that would jeopardise the success that this has brought to the UK economy and on growth and jobs. I would also just like to assure an earlier speaker that we are not inundated with thousands of Philippino workers who are loading and unloading our ships.  Both Conservatives and our Polish colleagues and others will support a rejection of this Commission proposal. We believe that competition between ports rather than prescriptive regulation on ports’ internal operations is a greater driver for efficiency. The Commission’s proposal was overly-bureaucratic and does not fit well in our UK system of privatised and market-driven ports. Whilst we welcome some improvements in the Committee position, I am fully aware that both our UK port owners and trade unions remain firmly opposed to the proposal as it stands.  The present text could still interpret the open port duty in the UK as imposing public service obligations on private ports whilst we believe that the proposal on private and trust ports does not go far enough to guarantee their exemption from the regulation. Moreover, it is feared that the social provisions introduced by the rapporteur and others would gold—plate existing EU legislation dealing with the transfer of staff due to a change in the service provider as well as current ILO training and labour protection guidelines.  In addition, we are disappointed that the rapporteur’s compromise package did not include smaller ports from the provisions on market opening. It is for these reasons that I have re—submitted amendments which would exempt small ports from the regulation as well as amendments reflecting competitive market exemption in order to allow a fully competitive industry to be free to procure goods and services commercially, and lastly, an amendment which would exclude all private ports from the regulation.

This text is the result of long and painstaking negotiations to reach compromises that have radically transformed the Commission's initial ultraliberal proposal. Together with other colleagues, I myself have done an important task of amending and I am pleased that Knut Fleckenstein has taken up much of it. This refers to the requirement of a national flag for the most sensitive services, which will stabilize the legal situation of ports that already comply with it. Public service obligations are also written in black and white in the report, which is in line with a more social Europe. Financial transparency is an essential point of the text, which will allow for fairer and healthier competition between European ports, but the smallest or most vulnerable ports will not have as many administrative obligations as the large ones, to prevent them from suffocating under the weight of bureaucracy.

I have listened carefully to all of the comments, but some of the information in the debate is a bit outdated. State aid exemptions have been published today. The focus is now on the modernisation of ports to make them greener, more socially responsible and more innovative. The benefits are for all ports, not only a few in the north. The text is based on clear complementarity between EU and national levels, leaving ample room to adapt to local environments. The vote will decide if it is a stable legislative framework for ports. The momentum is there to improve the functioning of the trans-European transport network to create growth in ports and through ports, which also leads to new employment opportunities. Regarding some of the comments by the honourable Members Anderson, de Grandes Pascual and Ayala Sender as regards the autonomy of ports in setting infrastructure charges, I am open to working with you constructively to find a solution during the trilogues. Like the Council, some of you think that the regulation should not prevent Member States from having their say on charges and port management. I hear you; be assured the Commission is willing to look at this question during the trilogues. To honourable Members Seymour and Foster I would say that as regards private ports, we are open to solutions, but they must not allow private undertakings to abuse their dominant position or distort competition with other ports.  In response to honourable Members Taylor, Delli and Šoltes, allow me to highlight again the benefits the regulation brings for the environment. The internalised external cause the regulation will serve to develop a method for varying port charges according to the environmental performance of the ships. More generally, financial transparency and clearer rules on access to the market will encourage the investments which are dearly needed to make ports greener. I therefore see no disagreement with the objectives of the Green groups. As regards Article 10 on the transfer of rights, let me be very clear: the transfer of staff should not be regulated at European level, but left to the Member States. We must respect national labour laws and the arrangements which have been developed by social partners. I am confident we will be able to clarify these during the trilogue. I hope this answers the call of honourable Member Anderson. With that, I want to thank again the rapporteur and his shadows for their perseverance. The support from all major organisations show that the report on the table strikes the right balance, and that is what we have a chance to achieve tomorrow with positive support: a chance for a balanced agreement on ports, an agreement that can further strengthen the single transport area and the single market which has been a great achievement of the EU.

Ports will be forced to contract out services and appoint at least two service providers, even if only one is required. This will undermine the competitiveness of local ports in a tough market. The proposed PSR would also undermine commercial confidentiality. I am very concerned at the impact the regulations would have on Teesport: it is another kick in the teeth for hard-working people.

Not only because this is about money, a lot of public money, but also because in the troubled times that we have right now, building back confidence in EU institutions is a key issue for the European institutions and for every responsible European politician. We have to assure citizens of the European Union that their money is used properly, is transparent and is spent in a way which is in line with the EU regulation. The report which we discuss on a yearly basis generally mirrors the opinion of the Commission and this year we had a good and quite detailed report. Of course Parliament as usual has its own priorities and issues to be raised in the debate. The report we voted on in the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) has wide backing from different political groups and was voted for almost unanimously in the CONT Committee. Basically we concentrate on two levels of protection of the EU’s financial interests. The first is protection of the revenue of the European Union, the own resources of the EU. From this perspective I think that it is very important to emphasise that VAT fraud is clearly an EU competence as VAT is part of the EU own resource system. The VAT gap is varying too not only at European level but also at Member State level. The VAT gap reached EUR 168 billion in 2013. So we welcome that the Commission supports a strong PIF directive, including VAT in the scope, but we have also to include it in the directive or the regulation on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office to be effective. A couple of days ago too the European Court of Auditors published a special report on VAT issues and this supports our view that the EU system on VAT is not effective enough: Data coming from the Member States is not reliable; exchange of information among the Member States is not working properly; tax authorities do not cooperate effectively and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) does not have competence to investigate cross-border VAT fraud, so it is an important issue. But we also have to point out the problems with the recovery rate because in 2014 it was at the level of 24% which is a historical lowest point and this has to change.  The second level of the protection of the financial interests of the EU is proper spending of EU resources. The Member States and the Commission have shared responsibility for implementing approximately 80% of the European Union’s budget so the Commission has a lot of things to do here. We need sound financial management while spending EU money and it should be combined with a ‘best use of every euro’ approach. We accepted a new public procurement directive but it is also important to check its implementation. I also have to mention the corruption index in our report. I have to raise the issue of the biannual anti-corruption report of the Commission, which we are eager awaiting in Parliament and we hope that this year it is going to include the 29th Chapter on the EU institutions as well, and better protection for whistle-blowers in the European Union and in the Member States as whistle-blowers are a very important part of anti-corruption activity.  I think that we had very good cooperation together with the shadow rapporteurs. We have prepared a report which I believe can count on well founded grounds on your support in the vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 175, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control and in particular the rapporteur, MEP Benedek Jávor, for the 2014 Report on the Protection of the EU’s financial interests, and also to express our gratitude for the strong commitment of Parliament to the fight against fraud. We fully share this commitment and welcome the report’s analysis, as well as many very valuable recommendations which we will thoroughly follow up on. Let me flag up some of the key recommendations and how we are going about them. First, reporting on irregularities. Parliament has requested, and rightly so, to improve the comparability of data reported by Member States so we can actually have a picture that is understandable and allows us to draw conclusions from it. We have adopted in 2015 a new regulation concerning reporting on irregularities and on that basis we have launched with the participation of national experts the preparation of new guidelines on reporting. On that basis, data would now feed a new improved version of the irregularities reporting systems and I am very pleased to inform you that we expect this new improved system to be operational in the second quarter of 2016. Secondly, national anti-fraud strategies. As the rapporteur pointed out, we have obligations together with Member States. Member States are becoming increasingly more effective in fighting fraud and this is visible by the increase of detection and also prosecution of fraud cases: 1 649 cases overall. This is more than in 2013, but the recovery rate has to be beefed up, it has to be improved, and we believe that a lot more can be done in prevention, detection, reporting, prosecution and sanctioning if we are to have Member States embracing what Parliament is supporting very much, namely national anti-fraud strategies. So far this is not mandatory, it is voluntary. Five Member States have adopted such strategies. We encourage others to do it and we work already with those who have done it so we can actually improve the actions on the basis of exchange of best practices and experience. Third, the rapporteur mentioned public procurement following the special report of the Court of Auditors on this issue, on public procurement. The Commission is looking at how to improve the functionalities of the irregularities management system which I mentioned, and the possibility to have interoperability between different databases so we can make best possible use of information and, of course, enhance transparency. We know that transparency is the taxpayers’ best friend, so the more we can do in this area, the better for the protection of the financial interests. There is a proposal to publish beneficiaries, and I want to clarify that the current legislation already foresees this and lists the type of information that needs to be published. Fourth, corruption indicators. Concerning statistics and indicators on corruption in the Member States, there are significant differences in terms of definition and statistical recording practices, so we have to work on that over the medium term so we can have greater availability of corruption information, and I want to use this moment to respond. Yes, we are working on the biannual anti-corruption report so it will be available in 2016. Fifth, the follow-up of OLAF recommendations at national level and the establishment of a European Prosecutor’s Office. We agree that comprehensive prosecution of crimes against the EU’s financial interests is essential and that more has to be done in Member States to follow up on OLAF’s recommendations and also to provide feedback to OLAF on actions taken. We think that the establishment of the European Prosecutor’s Office will help us in this regard and we also believe that the evaluation of Regulation 883/2013 governing OLAF’s investigations, to be completed by 2017, will provide an opportunity also in this regard. Like the rapporteur, we believe that VAT fraud should be part of the work of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, it should be covered by the PIF Regulation. We also believe that it is essential that the mandate of the EPPO is clear about that and that discussions between the co-legislators should be brought to a successful conclusion as soon as possible, so that we have the best possible EPPO we can design. Finally, there has been a question in the committee on what we can do specifically on the independence of OLAF’s supervisory committee secretariat. I want to take the opportunity to report that on 4 March we have taken a decision in the Commission and we adopted a proposal for an amendment of the OLAF Regulation to transfer the Supervisory Committee secretariat to the Commission and we hope that there will be swift action by the legislator to adopt this proposal, so any appearance of a conflict of interests, any perceived conflict of interest can be eliminated.

When I saw the amounts in the report, I was somewhat surprised. We all know the stories of fraud in the context of, for example, cohesion policy or agricultural subsidies. 2. I believe that this report could give a little more attention to prevention, because prevention is better than cure in the context of fraud. 3.

Corruption and fraud against the EU budget are directly proportional to a lack of transparency in the procedures for allocating and managing and spending European funds.  In my opinion, therefore, a clear distinction must be made between fraud and error, and information must be given on both fraud and the most frequent errors, including concrete examples, so that users of European Union funds and managing authorities are better informed and it is therefore better to make a clear distinction between fraud or error, perhaps due to difficulties that we will try to temper and reduce with the work on the better lawmaking project.

The fight against irregularities and fraud is hampered by the diversity of member states' legal and administrative systems.  commission's action must therefore be intensive and systematic.  Effective recovery of funds unduly disbursed from the Union budget, more efficient collection of own resources and the establishment of uniform reporting rules are indispensable elements of effective action.

I believe it is very important to highlight what is in the report that these should be used in accordance with the relevant legal basis, and in the context, Madam Vice—President – something I find very important – is that you have adopted a new early warning mechanism.

The Commission must take full responsibility for the recovery of this money. The Commission must also maintain strict rules for the interruption and suspension of payments. Indicators for measuring corruption in Member States should be used. This is one of the minimum urgent measures that need to be taken. Another urgent measure: the protection of whistleblowers, so-called whistleblowers. The experience of those who work in European institutions and who have revealed illegalities has often been traumatic and, as such, there are fewer such whistleblowers, which makes us lose money. The regulation must be amended and these people must be protected. Another measure: the publication of agreements with tobacco companies, with all tobacco companies. The agreements must be published in order to prevent, to the greatest extent we can, tobacco smuggling. I also call for that 'VAT carousel' for European funds to become a criminal offence in the Directive on the protection of financial interests and to stop this assault by the Member States, of most Member States which do not want this carousel of VAT, the fraud of European VAT money, to be a criminal offence.

In real Europe, cases of fraud raise public attention and damage the reputation of the Union. It obliges us to ensure sound financial management and to put in place all necessary measures to protect the EU budget. The annual report of the Commission on the protection of the EU’s financial interests presents the functioning of preventive and corrective mechanisms and actions taken by the Commission services to protect the EU budget from illegal or irregular expenditure and irregularities related to their revenue.  While the EU and Member States are sharing responsibility for protection of the EU’s financial interests in fighting fraud, it is essential that the Commission and the Member States work together to protect effectively those interests. Here I can say that the Commission is working in that direction, as has been stated by Commissioner Georgieva. The report presents the real situation in the area of financial interests of the Union, to include the status of detection and reporting of irregularities, revenues and expenditures. Problems are also identified and a number of measures are presented in the areas of reporting and control. The Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT Committee) suggests the development of a system of indicators to measure the level of corruption in the Member States, amending the EU Staff Regulations to protect whistle-blowers and enhance transparency of lobbying. Among the policy areas considered at risk are public procurement, tobacco smuggling and counterfeit goods. The CONT Committee suggests enhancing cooperation among EU institutions to tackle fraudulent behaviour in the use of EU funds. Investigations and the role of OLAF are highlighted. Well-developed is a chapter related to performance-based budgeting and the value—for—money approach. Finally, it is important that anti-fraud measures are undertaken and should find the balance between control and the desire not to discourage beneficiaries.

We can no longer accept easy waste and fraud of European regionally run funds, the lack of transparency in the documentation relating to contracts awarded directly, national supervisory authorities appointed by the control bodies in conflict of interest, which certify their expenditure and, above all, the unwillingness of governments to cooperate seriously in the exchange of tax and banking information. This is essential if we are really to combat major tax evasion and avoidance and money laundering. A recent Eurodad report sees Juncker's Luxembourg as the European champion in this regard.

Madam President, it is important to institutionalise the existence and operation of anti-fraud services and mechanisms in the European Union, but it is more important to take into account the results of the reports and conclusions on policy-making and how to deal with the wrong texts. For example, it is self-evident and necessary to simplify the rules and procedures relating to public expenditure and revenue from own resources in order to limit non-fraudulent irregularities, which for 2014 amount to a total of EUR 362 million and EUR 176.2 million respectively .  However, it is self-evident and necessary to revise the Council and Commission's decision on aid amounting to EUR 3 billion. In turkey, when the anti-fraud report points out that it is the main protagonist of the blatant irregularities linked to pre-accession aid funds, in particular those relating to cross-border cooperation. The Union is moving to the limits of deceit when the anti-fraud office is sounding the alarm about Turkey's credibility.

The bad news is that, in 2014, EUR 538 million of EU expenditure and revenue were affected by fraud. This is unacceptable and must be corrected. Controlling the use of money and punishing fraudulent acts is of the utmost importance. To achieve this, at least three things have to be done. Firstly, the Commission must be as proactive as possible in following the use of our money. Secondly, the Member States must consequently be held more accountable for tracking the projects and providing correct data to the Commission. Thirdly, logically, the Member States must have a common goal in fighting fraud. This may eventually help achieve the long—unfulfilled objective of making the EPPO finally materialise.

As I have said many times, the main problem remains that the Member States are not obliged to provide comprehensive and comparable data on their use when receiving huge cash from the European Union.

Dog watch and the reaction of our citizens will also be afraid.

I will try to answer everyone, especially those who have put forward questions to the Commission. Let me start first with the role of prevention. As Mr Pirinski indicated, we are putting in place early warning systems that allow us to integrate different databases so that, as in the last intervention, we can actually see where money comes from and who the beneficiary is and then trace the route of the money. We now have multiple systems, and they do not always talk to each other, and that is a problem we are concentrated very much on resolving. In the budget focus for results initiative, we also want to create a way for us to see not only the movement of money, but also what we are getting for the money – what the benefit is, what the impact is. This will take time, but the efforts are structured and consolidated and, as I mentioned in my opening comments, already in the next quarter we will see some operationalisation of a better integration of these systems. Secondly, there was a point made on the importance of separating irregularities and fraud. Of course, fraud is the most dangerous – it is cancerous in societies – but it is also the more difficult to catch, because in fraudulent activities there is usually a lot of effort and smart investment to hide what is being done. What does it mean for us? Two things: one, to simplify the rules so that it is more difficult to create misinformation, and that simplification certainly would not only reduce fraud but also would reduce irregularities. Secondly, in the analyses we do to sketch more clearly the lessons learned when we catch fraud, what does it mean in terms of the systems in place to prevent it from happening? Here comes the point on institutional capabilities. We are currently missing a hammer when we know from the work of OLAF that there is irregularity and, more importantly, there is fraud because we send the information back to national authorities and it is up to them. In countries where the legal system is strong, action is taken; in countries where there are difficulties in the legal system, it may not be taken. We know that people here recently reflected on only 24% being claimed back – this is, by the way, not only about fraud, but also about irregularity. Our thinking in the Commission was that, with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, we will provide this extra hammer to go after fraud. We put forward the proposal, but unfortunately what we have seen is a watering down of the original proposal. We are concerned about it and have expressed our concerns, including the fact that VIP fraud now seems to be excluded from the mandate of the EPPO, which of course would mean a big chunk of potential abuse being out of action. Of course, it is for Member States to complete their deliberations on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, but I would agree with those of you who have said that it has to be value added for us to fund it. We do not need institutions for the sake of institutions; we need them for effectiveness, for doing the right job. There has been a very important point made that we are strong when we equip people with the opportunity to speak up. In that sense, protection for whistle—blowers is critical. We do it for staff in the Commission, and the question is: what more can we do to support Member States in enhancing their whistle-blower legislation? That is a conversation still to be had – what is our responsibility? We want to be sure, we want to be prudent, and we do not want to step out of line of what is our responsibility. We heard a comment that if we do not respect sovereignty and subsidiarity there could be more trouble than benefit, and we are, of course, very mindful of this. Let me finish by saying that we hope next year will come, Mr Pirinski, with a very good analysis of why the level of fraud has gone up. Is it because we detect more, so we catch more, or is it actually bad news, because more is taking place? Hopefully we would already integrate that analysis into the action by the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 199, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Benedek Jávor", "mepid": "124721", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her contribution and all the Members who participated in the discussion tonight for the lively debate. Very briefly I would like to say – as a short reaction to the different issues which were raised – that I believe that there are four basic elements in the fight against corruption and fraud in the European Union. The first – and this links to the question of prevention – is full transparency. There is no fraud and there is no corruption if there is transparency. This is, for example, about the mandatory lobbying register in the EU, but there are also some worrying developments in the Member States regarding transparency. This is also about better reporting by the national authorities.  The second element is enhanced cooperation between the Member States. Mrs Macovei mentioned that it is impossible to fight against carousel fraud – VAT fraud – without good cooperation between the Member States and the Member State authorities, which is not happening right now. The third element is strong institutions. When we talk about OLAF, of course we can criticise it, but OLAF cannot be effective without the rights it needs to be effective. That is why we need to strengthen OLAF, for example by checking how OLAF’s recommendations are respected in the Member States. We also need more institutions such as the European Public Prosecutor’s Office.  The fourth, and last, one is the question of sanctions. I think that there are serious shortcomings here in the European institutions. How can we make sanctions? How can we enforce that the Member States respect the rules we set up? This is essential.

I therefore welcome the annual report, which show that the strategy on international fiscal policies is not separated from coordinated action at EU level. The benefits of the internal market must also be enhanced by relentless pressure on tax fraud and evasion. The use of interconnected databases on irregularities in cohesion policy, including public procurement, must also be developed at their respective levels, and the awareness of every institutional body, at European, national, regional and local level, must be strengthened. Public sentiment in general must change.

A large proportion of these relate to the funds, but the report presented, which follows a critical and attentive approach to all problems, underlines the growing importance of VAT fraud. In the absence of a single levy system, in fact, the single market lends itself to so-called 'carousel' fraud, which, in 2013, had already cost EUR 168 billion. In this respect, the report therefore calls on all Member States to participate fully in Eurofisc and to facilitate the exchange of information on eurofisc, in order to gradually limit the problem.

In this context, I would also like to highlight tax evasion, which is one of the most difficult problems facing the Union. Let me take a practical example from Finland. A power grid company called Caruna avoided taxes by recycling its money through the Netherlands. Only EUR 800,000 was paid to Finland from profits of EUR 50 million. After the profits were faded from the ledgers, the company informed consumers that it would increase electricity transmission prices by just under a third. This attracted a lot of criticism from the public – and entirely for a reason.

Europe needs to be ambitious, to lead, on big data but Europe should also lead in protecting our values.  First of all, privacy and data protection.

Big data helps businesses to manage logistics, to target sales, to reduce costs and thus to increase their competitiveness. This is key to driving our economic growth. But the regulatory environment must work for both businesses and consumers. Good regulation can bring benefits. Clear rules on how personal data is used can empower consumers. Clear competition rules can give businesses, large and small, a level playing field and helps to bring confidence to investors and innovators. In the digital space new entrants emerge rapidly and new sectors like data brokers, raise new questions on transparency and accountability. So what is the Commission doing to monitor these new entrants, and how do we make sure that any rules we pass are technologically neutral, future proof and do not just lock in old monopolies? Big data also brings big benefits for health with next-generation medicines, for the environment by saving energy and reducing waste, and can help make our public services more efficient. But to achieve all of this we need smart procurement to unlock smart technology. So what is the Commission doing to help our Member States and their public services to share best practice and to enable savvy – tech-savvy – procurement? My committee first tabled these questions last summer. We are only debating them in March. This is not good enough. In the months in between Parliament negotiators have agreed new rules on data protection, but outside our Brussels bubble there is still a lot of concern about the details. If the data protection authorities are overly cautious when they implement the regulation they will put a straitjacket on the data processing. But to unlock the benefits of big data, data needs to be processed. So, Commissioner, we need clear guidelines, they need to work for businesses and for consumers, for innovators and incumbents, for scientists and service providers.

They show that it is time to put the right conditions in place for Europe to leverage the growth potential of the data-driven economy. The EU data economy is growing fast and is expected to reach at least 3% of GDP by 2020. It must become the building block for our entire economy, creating new jobs, services and business models. In the recent public consultation on platforms, the Commission aimed to improve understanding of the role of data markets, access to data and the free flow of data in the European Union. The Commission will map existing restrictions on the free flow of data and assess emerging issues related to businesses’ access to data, the use and reuse of data, and the ownership of non-personal data. Data is the new oil. Standards and interoperability are its new pipelines. The Commission is working on a set of priorities for standards and standardisation actions in key technology areas for the digital single market, which can guide the standardisation of organisations in their work. Regarding cloud, the Commission will promote the rapid adoption of cloud computing in all sectors where we are convinced that cloud can boost productivity. In order to digitise public administrations, the digital single market envisages a new e-government action plan. Under the action plan, I aim at accelerating the implementation of open, innovative and collaborative government. They will support interoperability and cross-border digital public services. An effective regulatory framework on personal data protection, complemented by revised e-privacy rules plus cyber security and consumer protection, will help to build trust in the data economy. By enhancing legal certainty and providing more uniform rules, it will also help to guarantee equal conditions for businesses to compete across the European Union. The specific situation of SMEs has been taken into account in the proposals for the general data protection regulation. The Commission has been careful not to impose undue administrative burdens on them. SMEs will benefit from the simplified regulatory environment that the regulation provides and the one-stop shop mechanism of the national supervisory authorities. But this is not only about data. The right skills are needed to process data properly and to create new businesses. The Commission has included a New Skills Agenda for Europe in its 2016 work programme to promote skills development and maximise the potential of digital jobs. One question raised the issue of data brokerage. The Commission is following closely the emergence of data markets and brokerage in Europe. To assess the need for policy action, we first need a better understanding of the mechanisms for finding the right price and composition of data to be traded, as well as their effects on the data economy.

A data-driven economy can give us more efficient products, user-friendly services and personalised solutions.

It is also the best leverage for making SMEs more competitive and cost-efficient, scaling up their businesses.  What do we need? A better framework, both regulatory and non-regulatory. The new technologies require much more soft law. This should be with respect to privacy and security, but also flexible for new opportunities for data processing concerned with solving the problem or the ownership of data. Open data as a basis, accessibility of many kinds of data and the possibility to use them for public and commercial purposes; efficient infrastructure; future 5G for digital industrialisation, a network of high-performance computing centres and cloud development; a well-educated workforce, new e-skills development in the whole system; coverage of standardised and interoperable solutions all over Europe.

It will not happen by miracle if things are allowed to go spontaneously. We have a long way to go, because we know that the United States is way ahead, we know that Europe is not big in this big data economy; it may become so, but much needs to be done.

But to do this we also need foresight. President Buzek said that Europe must look ahead, be innovative but defend its values, affirm them.

There are important legal and also, Dare I say, ethical aspects, which are also linked to developments in democracy.

However, we must not forget the system background, without which it would not be possible to manage large amounts of data in a tolerable time. This applies to cloud computing, but also to the dynamically increasing demands on supercomputing systems. These are capable of a huge number of computing operations on large amounts of data.

There are two issues regarding big data. One is data protection, and the other is skills, so firstly, data protection.

This time we seem to have created a sentence without a verb: ‘towards a thriving data-driven economy’. At least there is no target date, so we shall not quite know when we have failed. Can we at least learn the lessons of past failure? We do not achieve competitiveness with fine words in carefully crafted regulations: we achieve it by creating incentives and removing obstacles.

Many of these projects require the mining of publicly accessible content held by thousands, or even millions, of different copyright holders.

According to analyses prepared by the European Parliament, if we are able to implement e-procurement across Europe we could save EUR 50 billion per year, which is a huge amount of money – and, I am sorry to say, we do not have this money. We have to implement and introduce e-invoices in all the Member States. We have to use digital signatures more proactively. Of course, we have to pay attention to privacy issues. We have to protect everybody’s privacy, but we have to allow free data flows across Europe. Governments have to open their data in all the Member States. All of the companies, all the players, have to get access to data – it does not matter whether they are small and medium-sized companies or bigger players.  The digital divide is a real issue in the European Union. This divide is not only between our Member States, but also within Member States, even in those Member States where IT is highly developed. We can see that there is a real digital divide between downtown and rural areas, between men and women, and between young and elderly people, and we have to deal with all those issues.

To reach such a result, concrete ideas of how to effectively put in place gender equality has to reach the hearts and minds of people. Gender equality needs to become a natural part of daily life, but the truthful acceptance of gender equality means major changes in mindsets and behaviour, not only concerning the treatment of women, but also concerning the understanding of equality between humans in general. It is the fear of such broad and deep implications that is the reason why it is still so widely opposed. It is mostly women who engage themselves, lead the discussion and do the essential work toward strengthening the scientific and strategic base for the steps which are still so necessary to implement gender mainstreaming into everybody’s reality. Therefore, I would like to warmly thank all the colleagues who contributed to the report, co-operating in a highly constructive and fair manner. I would like to name them: Julie Ward, Sirpa Pietikäinen, Eleanora Forenza and Monika Vana. Only though productive and horizontal cooperation do we now have such a shared and balanced text. However, for public opinion, gender mainstreaming is still an unknown and generally contested concept. In practical terms, the concept means the integration of a gender perspective into the preparation and design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies. It includes and needs spending programmes with a view to promoting equality between women and men. The report presents undeniable reasons for the necessary steps of building awareness and changing realities.  The three main points why we need to emphasise gender mainstreaming are the following: firstly, gender mainstreaming is a process to promote gender equality in the policy field, and no policy is exempted since the need for a balanced effect of policies is horizontal. This is one of the true dimensions of the concept. The other concerns the representation of women and men in the given policy area and for it to definitely make a difference to the policy outcome. Unfortunately, international recognition did not give this concept a concrete impact on the decision-making process in both dimensions.  Secondly, Parliament – further to several resolutions on gender mainstreaming – gradually developed a gender mainstreaming structure. However, analysis shows that the system is fragmented and not particularly efficient. It is time for corrective measures, as well as an efficient feedback and evaluation mechanism, if we want to prevent this resolution from remaining a dead letter.  Finally, the best way to promote gender equality is to set a good example, to live its essence, and to show how it is done. Gender mainstreaming and gender equality are principles that are enshrined in the Treaties. Who, if not the EU institutions, could be the best example when it comes to implementation? That is why we tried in the report to build an interinstitutional network involving, among others, the Council and the Commission. I personally believe that gender—sensitive policymakers should consider how gender relates to the content of policy measures to gain a better understanding of how women and men would benefit from gender equality. Parliament is not even close to reaching the targets in both dimensions.  I hope this report will be an instrument to raise awareness on the topic and initiate the implementation phase to reach more and more ambitious targets.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 239, "date": "2016-03-07.json", "name": "Michaela Šojdrová (PPE).", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Mlinar, for presenting the report, because I believe that it is right for the European Parliament, as she herself has said, to set an example and assess the opportunities it gives women, both politically and in senior administrative positions. We find serious shortcomings in this area, and we therefore recommend that the European Parliament's management deal with this situation in order to achieve a higher representation of women, especially in those higher administrative posts, where it should be up to 40%, and to create conditions for women to perform this function as well. I think these are all very correct measures.  Unfortunately, there are proposals in this report that I cannot agree with. For example, for gender mainstreaming to be the subject of training, certified courses, so that each committee has to develop an action plan for this inclusion on its agenda.

Gender mainstreaming is an important tool to achieve real equality between women and men. For the EU, it is Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which states that: ‘in all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality between men and women’. Gender mainstreaming is therefore not a choice, but an obligation. All major institutions, including the European Parliament and the Commission, are confronted with the permanent challenge of putting gender mainstreaming into practice and continuously improving its effectiveness.  The so-called ‘dual approach’ of specifically targeted gender equality actions, on the one hand, and gender mainstreaming on the other hand, has proven successful not only at European level, but also at national, regional and local levels. The Commission also follows this dual approach in the recently published strategic engagement for gender equality 2016—2019. This strategic paper, in line with the principle of gender mainstreaming, emphasises the need to integrate a gender equality perspective into all EU policies, legislation and funding programmes. In practice, this is translated into constant efforts to integrate a gender equality perspective into every aspect of EU intervention. It means assessing the impact of Commission action on both women and men and taking responsibility for adjustment if necessary, so that equality between women and men is promoted and equalities are not perpetuated. In order to monitor the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the Commission in practice, the strategic engagement announces that the Commission will consider issuing a report on gender mainstreaming in 2017. The Commission’s inter-service group for equality between women and men, managed by the DG for Justice and Consumers, plays a key role in implementing gender mainstreaming at the Commission.

It should be noted that in countries such as Greece, which are affected by the memorial policies, women are the biggest victims. Therefore, in order for the EU to eliminate these differences, it should impose transparency on the labour sector and pension systems as well as ensure that it strengthens the Commission's influence on women's rights and gender equality when drawing up aspects of the EU budget linked to gender mainstreaming in the work of the European Parliament.
