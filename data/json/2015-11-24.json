I was very encouraged by your reactions in this House. This gave the strategy important momentum from the very beginning. Nine months of intensive work and intensive contacts have passed since then. In the Commission this was very important collective work, involving 14 Commissioners on the Energy Union Project Team. I would like to thank them here in the plenary for this work. We have proved that the new Commission structure works and can deliver. Last week, we added a new instrument to our energy toolbox: the State of the Energy Union Report. This will become an annual exercise to take stock but also to provide concrete policy guidance for the year ahead. This will allow you – and us – to keep up the momentum and to have a debate every year about all the dimensions of the Energy Union. Your support and your commitment to this ambitious project are crucial. As co-legislator, you will have to set the legislative framework for the Energy Union and you can carry the debate into your capitals, cities and regions, and to the citizens in your constituencies. As you know very well, their support for the Energy Union will be decisive. Let me highlight four key messages that need political attention in 2016. The first is to highlight the fact that the EU must remain the leader in the transition to a low-carbon society. COP21 is only days away, where the EU, and notably our chief negotiator Miguel Arias Cañete, will spare no effort to get an ambitious, legally-binding agreement with a built-in review mechanism. The EU must also continue to lead the way after COP21. The Emissions Trading System (ETS) reform and the new electricity market design must give the right signals for clean and energy—efficient technologies. We will make proposals for a heating and cooling strategy and for the decarbonisation of transport. We will also propose the Effort Sharing Decision in the non-ETS sector. We will present legislation to ensure that we reach the 2030 targets on renewables and energy efficiency, the latter having in mind an EU level of 30%. In parallel, we will further develop our financing instruments, making them more suitable for financing needs at the local level and for energy efficiency needs in the building sector. My second main message is to highlight the fact that, if we want this fundamental energy transition to be successful, it has to be socially fair and consumer centred. We must empower our consumers, as we explained in the Communication that we discussed with you in plenary in September, together with the rest of the summer package. But I am also convinced that in 2016 we should pay particular attention to the increasing numbers of the energy poor. When we review our legislation next year, we should make sure that the interests of energy-poor consumers are duly taken into account. My third message focuses on the geopolitical challenges, because they will not go away in 2016 and we need to be on top of them. We have to keep pushing for the diversification of energy sources, routes and suppliers, especially through an ambitious liquefied natural gas (LNG) strategy which we will present in February. At the same time, we will present a revision of the Security of Gas Supply Regulation and proposals to revise the decision on intergovernmental agreements. Let me mention another issue to which I want to pay special attention. We have to speed up work on infrastructure projects. I am glad that we have also adopted the second Projects of Common Interest (PCI) list – a list that is more focused, moving from 248 to 195 projects of common interest, and much better aligned to the core objectives of the Energy Union. Let me also say a word about Nord Stream 3 and 4. I know this is a subject of huge interest and concern to this House, as reflected in President Buzek’s letter sent to Commissioner Arias Cañete and me two weeks ago on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. We have taken note of the plans of commercial companies to build further pipelines connecting Russia and Germany through the Baltic Sea. These pipelines, if built, will have to comply fully with EU law. But let me also state that this project would not give access to a new source of supply and even further increase excess transmission capacity from Russia to the EU. The EU will only support infrastructure projects that are in line with the core principles of the Energy Union, including the EU’s Energy Security Strategy. Diversification of energy sources, suppliers and routes is crucial for ensuring secure and resilient supplies to European Union citizens and companies. It is for these reasons that the Nord Stream project will not become a project of common interest and will not benefit from EU financing. But let me also clearly say this: Ukraine proved to be a reliable transit partner for Russian gas throughout the last winter, and the EU believes that it is in the interest of all parties that Ukraine remains an important transit country. Last but not least, my fourth message. With this State of the Energy Union, we are laying the first building blocks of a ‘governance mechanism’ that will bring more transparency and predictability to investors and businesses. The low-carbon and energy-efficient technologies are here, but they need investment. When ready, the governance mechanism will thus be based on three pillars. The first will be the State of the Energy Union Report with its policy conclusions and country fact sheets, all of which we will further develop in the coming years. In that way we will keep implementation of the Energy Union under close scrutiny. We will keep it regularly on the European agenda through discussion in this Parliament and in different Council formations. It will also allow the European Council to give continued guidance on this issue. The second pillar will be represented by national energy and climate plans with biannual progress reports, covering all five dimensions, covering the 2021—2030 period, and promoting regional cooperation between Member States. This year we are providing, firstly, guidance and key indicators for the progress reports. Next year we will come with a proposal to ensure that this monitoring and reporting system is firmly anchored in legislation. The third pillar will be represented by the sector-specific legislation that I mentioned before, in particular to ensure that we reach our 2030 targets. In all this, we will ensure that this Parliament will play its full part in making the Energy Union happen. So I think that I can say that we have got off to a good start in 2015, but my promise to you today is that 2016 will be the Energy Union’s ‘year of delivery’.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Krišjānis Kariņš", "mepid": "96901", "text": "  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to thank the – Commissioner, i would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on The EPP Group is, of course, in favour of the Commission-driven creation of the Energy Union. This is our attempt to create a truly free market, to increase energy competition throughout the European Union, by reducing our import dependence, reducing CO2 emissions and increasing our energy security, hence security of supply. In this regard, I would like to emphasise two things in particular. Firstly, Commissioner, you are talking about reforming the emissions trading system. This is very important. We in the European Union must reduce CO2 emissions, but the request is for you to be very balanced, balancing both our target of reducing CO2 emissions and our objective of maintaining industry and jobs in the European Union. I can mention the steel industry as an example. The steel industry as such is not environmentally friendly. We all know that, but we in Europe consume and use steel, both in our automotive industry, in construction and elsewhere. So we're going to buy it somewhere. If this industry is 'rolled out' outside the European Union, we will not consume less steel, but perhaps it will be produced where there is no control at all. So, as you try to reduce CO2, be balanced in the industry. And the other thing I would like to highlight is exactly what you also mentioned about the Nord Stream pipeline expansion project. I call on the Commission to look very carefully at whether this project is at all compatible with our objectives of creating an Energy Union, because we see that it would not increase the security of our energy supply, on the contrary, it would increase our dependence on a single supplier, from Russia.

The Social Democratic Group, through its parliamentary work, is ready to support the Commission's proposals and work closely with the other European institutions to implement the necessary measures for an integrated internal energy market. Our economy and society are facing energy imports from unstable regions that make prices volatile. The key to the Energy Union is to create a safe, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy market in order to increase the global competitiveness of the European economy by reducing and harmonising energy prices in Europe and between Member States. An integrated market would maximise benefits for new industries and technologies while ensuring protection and support for traditional labour and industries. I stress that we must ensure that the proposed objectives and targets are not met to the detriment of European industry and jobs. An integrated energy market must first and foremost bring tangible benefits to consumers. It is therefore regrettable that the electricity and gas markets do not have the expected performance. In addition to transparency of energy costs, both industrial consumers and citizens need lower energy prices. I also stress, Mr Vice-President, the importance of interconnections in order to have a genuine internal electricity market. Last but not least, we Social Democrats support the Commission's approach to combating energy poverty and protecting vulnerable consumers. But I stress that we need an integrated European approach.

I am therefore glad that the Commission (and Vice-President Šefčovič himself) is dedicated to the Energy Union with full commitment. However, Parliament is also carrying out its tasks and I must commend my colleague Gróbarczyk, now a minister in the new Polish Government, who has prepared a balanced report on ITRE.  Let me make a few comments. First, to the infrastructure. We need inter connectors, which is why I welcome the energy projects under the CEF approved last week as you mentioned them.  Furthermore, briefly on energy security, which should be based on the principle of solidarity. From this principle, however, the Nordstream II project is out of the way, rightly perceived by many as a threat. The issue of decarbonisation needs to be approached with reason, respecting the specificities of some states, especially those with a high share of coal in the energy mix, and its importance, for example, for heating.  And also respect nuclear power as a low-carbon energy source essential for many countries. We must avoid the negative effects of our policy, such as the high price of energy and deindustrialisation. On the contrary, the Energy Union must provide an impetus for an open energy market that will help the competitiveness of the Member States and our industry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Morten Helveg Petersen", "mepid": "124872", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for the excellent work done in this report, which helps to illustrate the scale of the challenge ahead of us. Europe needs a holistic approach to achieving an energy union. We need integrated solutions in order to get more renewables into the energy mix, cut our carbon footprint and use scarce energy supplies in the most efficient way. Doing so will cut costs for business and make Europe more competitive, reduce energy bills for ordinary citizens and help us innovate to become world leaders in the energy technologies of the future. But many EU countries have back—pedalled on even modest objectives and have then gone on to block efforts to strengthen Europe’s ambition. This cannot continue if we are to deliver on a true energy union. What I want to emphasise today is that we too, as Parliament, need to step up to this challenge. In the own-initiative report on the Energy Union, which we will hopefully adopt next part-session, we call for Parliament to play an active role in the governance of the Energy Union. But clearly, we can only play this role if we are able to work together to find common ground on the crucial issues which often divide us. This is a priority for me and my Group: looking to find pragmatic approaches, but also approaches that maintain our ambition and determination to deliver the fundamental changes that energy union must deliver over the coming years. I would again like to thank Vice-President Šefčovič for all the hard work, and clearly I hope that Parliament is also up to the challenge of achieving a true energy union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Νεοκλής Συλικιώτης", "mepid": "124689", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately the Commission's first report on the state of the Energy Union confirms what we knew. No substantive actions have yet been taken to remove states' energy isolation from energy networks, to ensure energy efficiency and supply, to tackle climate change, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, to promote renewable energy sources and to reduce the Union's energy dependence.  Of particular concern, however, is the Failure of the Commission to take the necessary steps to combat the energy poverty that is causing more and more people in Europe. It is no longer enough to point out the problems. Time is running out and peoples' needs require - immediately - action. An important role in removing energy isolation and ensuring equal and cheap access for all people to the good of energy can and must be played by the Union's domestic energy sources.  We therefore continue to call on the Commission to build on the prospects created by natural gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean, to support energy investment in the region, to promote the creation of a Mediterranean gas hub with pipelines, but also through the development of LNG production. It is equally important that we immediately develop a realistic, comprehensive plan to support and promote renewable energy sources.  Above all, however, we need to redefine our energy policy so that the needs and interests of people, consumers and local communities are at the heart.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Claude Turmes", "mepid": "4432", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I would like to address the Commissioner. Yes, you have made some progress over the last nine months by making south-eastern Europe a bit calmer after South Stream was cancelled, bringing Poland back on track on the Gas Interconnector Poland-Lithuania (GIPL) and working with the Baltic countries around the Baltic Sea. I think it is working, with Ukraine, to stabilise the relations with Russia. So on that front some progress has been made, and a lot of it is to your personal credit. But overall, what you presented last week is weak. It is a paper without a clear vision. I will identify this on three points: one is energy efficiency. “A binding 30% objective for energy efficiency by 2030 is, to me,” said Jean-Claude Juncker last year “the minimum if we want to be credible and forward-looking”. One year later, this is a completely broken promise. In your paper you speak of 27%, and this is not even binding. Can you please explain to us: what is the word of the President of the Commission if one year later it does not count any more? In the modelling exercise you are doing, our call for 40% is not even modelled, which I think is democratically not acceptable to this institution. On energy efficiency, what is the situation in the world? World investments in renewables have grown by 14%. Europe’s investments in renewables are almost stagnating. Where was the Commission in Spain on the retroactive changes? What concrete proposals have you made for Paris? Jean—Louis Borloo, the former French Minister under the Sarkozy government, is calling for a big plan for Africa, including for reasons of migration. Why do we not go for massive PV deployment in Africa? You have presented nothing this year on renewables but hostility towards renewables. On ETS: ETS has largely failed over the last ten years. Can you explain to me how we will bring back gas and phase out coal with this weak ETS price? How do you foresee phasing out coal? Yes, you are discussing Nord Stream at the Commission. But if Nord Stream goes ahead, then we will weaken Ukraine and make Eastern Europe so fragile that we will completely discredit the Energy Union. Please, stand up and be courageous, including on these particular French and German interests in Nord Stream. We need a vision. Do we need another energy crisis before Europe gets its act together?

We are concerned about the lack of binding targets at the level of the individual States, because we believe that, when these 27% or 40% targets are not met, there would in fact be no responsibility on the part of the individual States; We therefore call for more ambitious and more binding targets to be set. I would like to invite you and my fellow Members to reflect, to the link we all know between the geopolitics of energy and the geopolitics of terror. We are all, in some way, responsible for a fossil-based development model. We are well aware that we have fed a huge flow of wealth to certain countries which now have the means, men and economic resources to go and create what happened in Paris only last week. In some way, we are responsible for our future. I therefore believe that binding targets and more ambitious targets are the European way to peace and prosperity: as long as we depend on external resources, as long as we depend on oil and gas for our development, we will somehow also be fueling the hand of terror that we find ourselves in our homes every day. And there is another issue that I do not think is being addressed: there has been talk of loosening the Stability Pact with regard to investment in security. I hope that these investments will be in real security, in intelligence on the ground, because in reality this phenomenon is taking on the aspect of domestic terrorism. But, given that the objectives of the energy transition are ambitious and in need of investment, we believe that the free market and that this economic model can in fact have the long-term vision necessary for investments based on private investment.  We therefore believe that we need a new deal, a new investment, a new quantitative easing to finance what is the European energy transition, because the challenge is truly great and extraordinary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Barbara Kappel", "mepid": "125024", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take a iendled with the ENF Group. Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and for his work You mentioned it, next week cop 21 begins in Paris. The European Union has set itself the goal of being at the forefront of climate policy and climate protection. In order for us to be able to take this leading role credibly, it is necessary for the European Union to meet the 2030 targets. As you know, this is the 40% reduction in greenhouse gases, at least 27% of renewable energy and also an improvement in energy efficiency of at least 27%.  We all know that these changes, that these points, these measures will lead to a complete change in the European electricity market. It is likely that up to 50% of renewable energy will be used in electricity generation, taking into account the efforts towards the Energy Union, the current state of play that you are telling us. But that is not enough. What to do? In addition to a functioning internal energy market, we need regional cooperation – as you have already mentioned today – ten per cent interconnectivity, cooperation between network operators, a reassessment of ACER, harmonisation of support schemes for the efficient development of renewable energy, the new role of end-users, which you have already taken into account in the summer package – we are talking here about the so-called prosumers, i.e. end-users, businesses and households are being more closely involved in energy production. , but also more resources for network expansion and for research and development – as we mentioned today – new financial instruments, but also almost fast-track procedures, so that the lines can be built really quickly. This brings me to the last important point, namely European energy security. We have already mentioned it today: diversification of networks, diversification of suppliers, diversification of sources, but also a secure and stable interconnection network, otherwise there will be no European security of supply. You have already set out some good intentions in the summer package. I raised the New Deal for consumers, there is energy labelling, but the new energy market design and capacity markets and, most importantly, the ETS reform and here please proceed with a sense of proportion. The steel industry has been mentioned. It is important that Europe remains competitive.

Even Commissioner Šefčovič himself cannot get the wind to blow and the sun to come when consumers are in demand. And perhaps we also need to take into account the high cost of energy, the amount of support they need. Thus, the use of nuclear energy, which is considered clean energy in terms of CO2 emissions, should not be negliged.

There would be a lot to say, but I will just focus on 2 points.  The first is to achieve the goal of improving energy efficiency, i.e. 20% by 2020. We know that we will find it very difficult to achieve this, because many Member States are not spending the necessary investments in this area. However, the Juncker plan has financed a number of projects, particularly in France. This must be emphasized, especially on heating and cooling, which are the main energy consumption points in the European Union, because existing buildings, 98% of buildings, cannot be left out of any energy improvement. I would therefore like to know, Commissioner, what you intend to do to really lead the Member States towards investments related to energy efficiency.  Secondly, with regard to the electricity and gas markets, we see that they are not working well: lack of interconnection, regional cooperation and cross-border trade. The internal market absolutely needs to be strengthened and integrated. Renewable energy makes this system a bit complex and, therefore, it is important and urgent to respond to the complexity of energy management with a real European strategy by focusing on so-called intelligent network management.  So there is still a lot of work to be done. With a view to reforming the carbon market to come, as my colleague Kari mentioned, it is important to take into account the interests of our industry and not to sacrifice our industrial base to a certain ideology; a proper balance should be taken into account and relocations should be avoided.

We have only just started, and it is worth making every effort to really run this marathon to the finish line, because the competitiveness of European industry has often been mentioned. On the other hand, we have the issue of climate protection. We are most likely expecting 200 million climate refugees from other continents if we do not change course, unless there is a decisive agreement in Paris. That is why we should see the Energy Union as a whole. I must compliment him: the Commissioner is on the ground a lot, talking to stakeholders on the ground. It is not only decided in Brussels – in the ivory tower – and then laws are spit out, but on the ground they are discussed with each other. That is very positive. What must be the case at the end of the day – this has also become clear today in the debate: for example, in the area of energy efficiency, we need robust legislation, and we need specific provisions. This cannot be done on a voluntary basis, but the industry and those who want to take money and invest at the end of the day also need investment security. And that's why: clear conditions and ambitious but feasible goals, so that this can be implemented! This creates work at the end of the day.

I would like to start by saying that, as far as I am concerned, it is so extremely clear that this is one of the areas where we really need more of the European Union and where we need more market. There are some forces that criticise the EU and say that it is all about the market. Here we have the clear evidence that, in the field of energy, we have no common market at all. If we are to cope with the climate, we are going to do the jobs, we are going to manage the industry, we are going to manage the economy and security, then it is extremely important that we have a common energy union that is also very, very market-based. If we look at the example that exists in the EU that is north pole, which affects the Nordic countries and the Baltic countries, we can, for example, if we look at Estonia see how a common market has benefited the economy both for private households and for industry and how it has been possible to reduce the cost through more efficient energy use. It is also based on an increased interconnectivity which will enable us to ensure that in those parts of the Union where we have an energy surplus, we can compensate for those parts of the Union where we have an energy deficit. It also gives us greater security throughout the European Union. I would urge the House not to get too caught up in the details of what we have in this market since. Now we're going to create the system, security, the rules and the market. Then there are other instruments, such as the ETS, to ensure that we steer in the direction we want in the future.

Given that, for all sorts of reasons, Europe is increasingly falling back into its principalities, it will be difficult to realize the dream of a modern energy union. The Commission's concepts also bow to the logic of the principalities, otherwise they would not co-finance a new nuclear power station for 35 years, otherwise they would not be pushing for the coal phase-out and fracking would be made fit for court again. Instead of small-scale statehood, we need European recognition of the global reality that climate change cannot be stopped with half-heartedness.

On this point – governance – we must continue to look far ahead, we must think long-term. The system of governance of the Energy Union can be built minimally, that is, as the regulator of the decisions of the Member States in the form of the various national climate and energy plans, but it is much more far-sighted that the system of governance of the Energy Union is demanding and implements truly European choices, than being the sum of the national determinations made in the various capitals of Europe.

Firstly, member states where, in recent years, usable hydrocarbon deposits, such as Greece and Cyprus have been found, should be strengthened in order to reduce dependence on third countries and to shield ourselves from price changes. On the issue of natural gas, Europe, which is heavily energy dependent on Russia, continuing its anti-Russian European policy, wants to import through Greece American LNG from shale gas, as agreed at political level during Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' recent visit to America.  We must stop the sterile rivalry with Russia and look more at what unites us and not what may divide us. Closer cooperation between Member States and a shift towards those renewable or inexhaustible energy sources that are truly reliable and can guarantee energy autonomy and self-sufficiency, both at Union and State level, is needed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 45, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "András Gyürk (PPE).", "mepid": "23816", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to talk about one aspect of a thorough and good Commission report, the question of competitiveness. European industry is suffering from high energy prices and regulatory burdens. A reduction in energy prices is essential to increase the competitiveness of the European economy. However, the road to a competitive European industry at low energy prices is often very bumpy. Allow me to cite Hungary as an example, where industrial consumers pay for gas above the OECD average, even though the country has invested hundreds of millions of euros in new infrastructure development in recent years. It has also built a new link to three neighbouring countries and built a two-way link to Ukraine.  Hungary has therefore done much to diversify and thus make gas prices competitive, yet we cannot see the results. This is because some of the new infrastructure is still operating in one direction, outwards from Hungary, and there are still no new sources available in the region, no diversification, no competitive prices. The solution, of course, is, on the one hand, to implement the missing bidirectionals and, on the other hand, to build the LNG terminal in Croatia, so that there is gas competition in the region. The lesson is that we can only reap the benefits of the single market if all actors strive to contribute to common goals.

Some may wonder why we are discussing the issue of energy, first and foremost the decarbonisation of the energy industry. I believe that this is true, firstly because there are many reasons, but because we also have direct links to our major problems of terrorism and refugees. The Islamic State, which threatens Europe, already owns oil wells and sells the oil, thereby also financing terrorism. A strong source of Islamic State funding is that rich Saudis and wealthy Qataris are supplying the money there. Where did they come from? Also because we have such a great hunger for energy. That is why part – not the whole strategy, but a part – of the strategy against the Islamic State is also to become more independent of imports from this area. When I raise the issue of refugees, it is certainly the case that we have to act very much in the area of climate protection so that we do not have large flows of refugees.

Firstly, I welcome the proposals from the Commission to date on Energy Union. This is absolutely vital for Europe, particularly the point that we need to utilise our resources within Europe as far as possible. In relation to renewables, these are obviously something that most people would desire, but we need also to create a climate where the fear that has taken place amongst many people in the public can be allayed so that they can see renewables as something environmentally very good – good for our resources and particularly good for them. Secondly, I also welcome the proposals to diversify supply where we have to import, and particularly the recent proposals on LNG. We have seen the effects in Lithuania, and I am glad that the Commission mentioned a project in my own constituency – Shannon LNG, which has had difficulties up to now, but being part of the European strategy hopefully means it can now get off the ground – because, first of all, LNG diversifies supply and, secondly, it is the ideal mix with renewables.

Next year, some of your key proposals will be presented, such as the revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive, building efficiency or renewables.  However, let me mention two areas where, in my opinion, progress is not entirely sufficient. One of them, and one of the biggest problems of the Energy Union, is that the price of electricity to end consumers is the highest globally in the European Union, perhaps with the exception of Japan. And I think that, given that this has significant implications for a number of industries that are exposed to strong foreign competition, the Energy Union should change that. It should contribute rapidly to bring European prices closer to the global average, which would increase our competitiveness and reduce household costs.  The second area to be mentioned is how the Energy Union will be managed. How do we want it to have real results? Many of the initiatives we are discussing are non-binding. For example, in the area of energy efficiency, which is one of our key priorities and is a pillar of the project. It is a sign of a lack of ambition and also of political will.

Secondly, we have a climate policy. The Energy Union cannot be just an extension and complement, there should be synergies between them, but an energy union 100% subordinate to climate policy does not add value.  Thirdly, the Energy Union must reflect the differences between countries: for example, in terms of the energy mix, even the presence of coal. It would be wrong if she imposed one model on everyone. Instead, we should use the strengths of individual countries for the common good. Let's eliminate emissions, not fuel!  Fourthly, we criticise Nord Stream. Why? For the overarching principle should be not to support projects that may shake up the common market, including in the regulatory sphere, or to negatively affect countries not involved in the project, such as the Baltic States or neighbouring countries, such as Ukraine.

Relying on the market alone to solve everything would not make sense.  I do not believe that it is the invisible hand of the market that can multiply interconnections, replace our fossil power plants with renewable energies, insulate our buildings or accelerate research and development.

Since there is no point in expecting the market to trigger this transition movement, it must be stimulated by European political impulses.

If we want to reduce oil dependency and the use of fossil fuels, we must also pay more attention to transport. It is responsible for a third of energy consumption throughout Europe, and we know that transport is very dependent on oil: 94% of transport still uses oil.  Europe has every opportunity to become a pioneer in clean transport in the world. It can be done in a very cost-effective way. We already have a lot of opportunities at the moment. We have advanced biofuels, electricity, hydrogen. New technologies are constantly emerging. It is important that we set targets, realistic targets, while encouraging companies to invest and develop new innovations in the field of clean transport. If we succeed in this, Europe will succeed in taking the lead in the world and our own industry could benefit significantly from it.

It is not just about the competitiveness of the economy, that is, prices – energy prices, which also determine the competitiveness of the economy. Nor is it just about protecting the environment. Indeed, security is at stake, an important thing in our unstable times – that is, the continuity of energy supply on a continent that is and will depend on external sources of energy generation. The very circumstances of the birth of this concept, namely the conflict in Ukraine or the use of gas as a tool of political blackmail, demonstrate the importance of security. And this has its own internal dimension, a little-tested – so-called interconnectivity – technical premise of solidarity between European countries. And a much more difficult external dimension – coordination of 28 countries in relations with external suppliers, especially with a single dominant supplier.

The key to energy is energy costs and it is a myth that energy costs in the European Union are very high.  We pay very dearly for energy in Europe. In order to be able to reduce energy costs, which must be our first objective, we must immediately become independent of the monopolistic energy situations in the European Union, taking advantage of our potential reserves or natural wealth deposits, which exist in many regions of the European Union.

I would also like to thank you very much for the support you clearly highlight towards the introduction of the State of the Energy Union Report, because I believe that we are equipping ourselves with a very important tool. We now have a very clear policy marker in the political calendar of the European Union. In the autumn we will have regular debates on how we are progressing with the Energy Union, what we have accomplished over the last year and what the challenges we are facing are and what the plans are for the next period. I think that is very important, because I see this as a very important founding stone of the strong robust governance that this House was calling for when we were introducing the Energy Union strategy. If you would allow me to react on some of the most frequent questions and topics which have been raised: first, COP 21. This very important – I would say historic – conference will start in only a few days, and I very much thank all of you for the support for the ambitious binding agreement we will all, from the European side, try to achieve in Paris. I think it is very important to see that all major economies – all the parties to this agreement – will show ambition and will show how decisively we are going to tackle climate change. I believe that Paris will really be a new beginning in this fight, that we will again get new mechanisms which will allow us to learn from the past and to have this five-year periodicity where we can access, compare and act on the figures and results, which will be much more precise than before, because it will be putting much more emphasis on true verification and precise monitoring of the efforts of all parties to that agreement. When it comes to our Energy Union in Europe, I think that several of you highlighted where the real problems are. First we need to make sure that we have our signals right, and by that I mean signals for carbon pricing – I agree with all of you that current carbon prices are not reflecting the cost and not driving in the necessary innovation we need in our energy and climate policies. Therefore, once again I would like to thank you very much for a very cooperative approach on the market stability reserve. I believe that it will be the same in the negotiations on the ETS reform, which we presented for the post-2020 period, because I believe that also by these activities we are already making very clear what the European policies are, how serious we are about a transition to the low—carbon economy and what kind of signals we want to send to investors. But when we are speaking about the price signals, we also have to speak about the price signals for electricity. It is quite clear that if you want to bring the investors in, and if we want to highlight how important active consumerism in this respect would be, we need to do much more for demand—side management, the flexibility of our electricity systems, better integration of renewables and giving more powers to consumers to decide if they want to produce the energy, from whom they want to buy and what kind of supply schemes they want to have for their households or for industries. All this is currently being assessed and will be presented to Members in the series of proposals we will be presenting to Parliament next year. Many of you spoke about energy security. Thank you very much for those strong words, because we are living in a political world, and I think that we also need to send very clear political messages that energy diversification is important, that if we speak about diversification we are talking about the routes but also sources of supply, that we want to have a wider range of energy suppliers and that LNG will play a very important role in this respect. When it comes to Nord Stream, I would like to assure you that, both with Commissioner Arias Cañete and with the other Commissioners, we are working hand-in-hand on this issue, and we will make sure that any project in Europe, including Nord Stream II, will have to fully comply with all EU laws; that all the proposals would really be verified and assessed with all the vigour which you have seen in the previous approach, which we assessed in a similar way; and that for us the transit route through Ukraine is very important. I think we should see it as a priority, not only for the European Commission, but for the whole Energy Union. When it comes to the internal energy market, I agree with all of the Members who said that it is high time we finally complete this, and that we complete it from the legislative point of view but also from the point of view of the hardware and software of the internal energy market. Therefore, it is very important that we agree on this new list for this project of common interest. I would like to make a proposal to you. Let us work on this list much better than before. Let us have regular monitoring and a kind of regular inventory of where we are with this energy infrastructure project. Are we on time? If we see that some projects are struggling, let us analyse why: how can we help these projects take off financially through the feasibility study, through technical assistance or sometimes also through political mediation? This was important for quite a few infrastructure projects mentioned in several of the interventions, because it is important to shorten the time from the current 10 to 12 years; we need to build interconnectors in three to four years, which would bring much more dynamism into our system. We need much more coherence and much closer coordination among our regulators. Therefore, I very much welcome the support for the new powers for ESA. We would like to present this proposal together with a new electricity market design and also the revision of the directive on renewables in the autumn of this year. We have already allocated, thanks to Members’ support for this as well, more staff for ESA, because we agree that the role of this agency is very important and will be even further increased. On energy efficiency: the first principle – and I think we are very clear here and we will be discussing with Members this issue on many further occasions – is that we want to operationalise energy efficiency first – when we assess all the legislative proposals next year and when the Member States consider new infrastructure, we will be calling upon them and discussing with them how at first to assess how much energy we can save, what we can do at national level, how we can improve our energy regions to make sure that, if we are progressing in this effort, we will do it on the most cost—efficient basis. We will be very ambitious on this front, and Parliament will see that we will be very ambitious, just as we have been very ambitious until today. Of course, we want to make sure that all these figures for 2030 line up, that we will deliver. Therefore, we need to make the next year, as several of you highlighted, the year of delivery, where we will put all the key elements on the legislative front on the table for Parliament and the Member States, and the Council, to start the true negotiations on how we will transform the Energy Union proposals into valid legislation. I want to put it on the table also because we want to call upon Member States to start working as early as 2017 on draft national energy and climate plans, to make sure that they also develop their vision for 2030 and that they will tell us how they want to implement all these plans at national level, so we can see if the figures are adding up and if we need some further action to be undertaken. Then we can actually have the process which would make it possible, despite the energy mixes which are decided at national level, to have a common European framework, a common European goal and, I believe, good common European results. One word, if you allow me, on energy poverty. We deliberately highlighted this as one of the key messages of the state of the Energy Union, because it is true: we have more than 10% of Europeans – more than 50 million European citizens – who are facing energy poverty and have problems paying for energy bills. We have to take action on these issues and equip the people with new skills if they are from the traditional industries and offer them a future in these new low—carbon economies. We need to equip them with new skills, and we will be working very closely on these proposals together with Commissioner Thyssen in the first months of next year. I see that time is flying, and there were a lot of questions. I would like to conclude by thanking this House and thanking the Members of the European Parliament for this very rich debate and for the many contacts we have had throughout the last nine months, here in Strasbourg and in Brussels. I also very much appreciate all those Members of the European Parliament who joined me on the Energy Union tour across European cities, across European enterprises and in all the citizen dialogues we had together. I very much appreciate this, because this helps us to bring this project to the places where it must be built – in our cities, our villages, our industry.

The insurance companies are responsible for ensuring that their insurance distributors register properly. There will be a one-stop shop at EIOPA, in particular with regard to the freedom of services and establishment, which will ensure greater transparency of registrants in the EU. There is also the third point: qualification requirements. Contrary to what some Member States have advocated until the very end, the first registration is the qualification in the home Member State and not the one in which one has to go. However, the Member State in which you work has a certain say in continuing training. This was highly controversial. The training obligation was low, but better than nothing. And the Member States have the opportunity to check this. The fourth area is the commission bans that have been sought, including from parts of Parliament. There is no general prohibition of commission or an obligation to disclose the amount of the remuneration. Because of the very different structures of the insurance markets, member states have therefore been given several opportunities to lay down stricter information requirements, pending the opening up of commission bans. That was a demand from the Council, which we could not fend off. The fifth point is the product information sheet, which is part of our catalogue of measures to improve consumer protection. There has been a long resistance here. We discussed and decided on a concise product information sheet, the basic format of which EIOPA must make proposals for. The sixth point is product overview and management. In line with the Markets and Financial Instruments Directive, rules for product supervision and management have been introduced for all insurance products. There is a danger here that a bureaucratic instrument will end up if EIOPA is not put on the brakes on this issue.  Seventh, investment-based insurance products. No commission ban and obligation to provide independent advice have been established here, but Member States have the opportunity to introduce this. Moreover, similar rules have been adopted to those laid down in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Then we have the transitional periods, the obligation to implement them in 24 months. There is a new annex which provides for the qualification requirements, knowledge for the provision of insurance. And we have taken over out-of-court dispute resolution, as decided by Parliament. Overall, we have succeeded in strengthening consumer protection. We have succeeded in establishing uniform rules in the insurance market for the distribution of insurance. Once again, I would like to thank very warmly all those who have taken the trouble to negotiate with the Council for three years. Finally, on the last day of the Latvian Presidency, we managed to reach a compromise on the whole.

It is going to give citizens more choice; it will make sure that those selling insurance understand the products that they are selling, and that those buying insurance better understand what they are buying. So I am very pleased that we have reached this point today and that I have got the chance to congratulate Werner Langen and the shadow rapporteurs for all their hard work over many months, indeed over many years, as we have heard, in getting this proposal into shape. The directive builds on national regimes of insurance distribution. It sets out a number of minimum standards for insurance distributors to follow, and it broadens the scope of distributors covered, to include companies that sell insurance as an add-on to their core business, like travel companies or car dealers. It also gives legal certainty to insurance companies that sell their products directly to consumers by clarifying how they can register their distributors and the information that they need to give to customers. As we have heard, there are stronger requirements around training and development, and when a product is packaged with an insurance policy as part of a special offer, it will in future be possible to separate the elements of the package so that you can buy the car or the holiday you want, with or without the extra insurance. We want people to be clearer about what they are paying for when they buy or invest in an insurance product. So the directive requires greater transparency on fee structures and on any financial incentives that the distributors may have. The requirement for non-life insurance to produce a simple and standardised product information document, which was added by Parliament, is a further strengthening of consumer protection. The directive also includes stronger requirements for the sale of life insurance products with investment elements. It requires suitability tests to be run to help determine whether a product fits a consumer’s profile, and because products covered by MiFID II and the IDD are often interchangeable, these rules have, as far as possible, been aligned. There is one small technical point I need to mention for the record. The view of our legal service is that recital 69 of the text is not fully in line with the Common Understanding on Delegated Acts. That said, in the context of a general compromise, the Commission can accept this wording because generally it does adhere to the Common Understanding, in accordance with which the Commission will, of course, continue to act. This directive ensures a level playing field between different insurance sellers and a more consistent level of consumer protection, in particular by increasing transparency. For me, transparency is essential if we are to legislate in a manner that is proportionate and that avoids unnecessary burdens. By making the right information available, we can help consumers make the right decisions and also encourage responsible behaviour in the sector. The insurance distribution directive is, I believe, an important step in that direction, and that is why I am very pleased today to have the chance to support it. COMMISSION’S WRITTEN STATEMENT The wording of the second sentence of recital 69 of the text is not fully in line with the Common Understanding on Delegated Acts because it refers to the need for appropriate contacts with Parliament and Council ahead of the adoption of the delegated act. In the context of a general compromise, the Commission can nevertheless accept this wording because it generally adheres to the Common Understanding that we remain committed to upholding. The Commission considers transparency in preparation of delegated acts of paramount importance. The Commission will continue to act in accordance with the Common Understanding and particularly declaration 39 in the area of financial services.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Burkhard Balz", "mepid": "96997", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has I would like to begin by thanking rapporteur Werner Langen very warmly for his really great work, as well as thankyouing the shadow rapporteurs. I believe that the directive strengthens consumer protection for insurance products in the Member States across all distribution channels. Consumers across Europe will now receive standardised briefings before purchasing products, and this will finally remove the confusion of different information sheets in the Member States. This will enable consumers to compare insurance products across borders. It is not the sheer mass, not the overloading of hundreds of pages, but the quality of the information and the information provider that is crucial.  We consider it very positive that the quality requirements for intermediaries should be laid down. Substantial training and training standards for insurance intermediaries should apply in all Member States. This is certainly a major step forward. We want to make it possible to continue existing advisory models in the Member States. Access to advice on different products and product models and the transparency of intermediaries should be essential. The directive has also succeeded in this. At the same time, we have ensured that proportionality is maintained. Micro-insurance and part-time placement are excluded from the directive. This is appropriate, because no consumer will want to have a long, comprehensive mediation interview before travelling for a few euros a year for foreign insurance.  As co-legislators, we have defined the requirements. Our view now goes to the European insurance regulator EIOPA. EIOPA wanted to become self-employed again, but EIOPA will have to realize here that the legislator sets the requirements. The ECON Committee will certainly follow closely how the Commission and EIOPA are now implementing concrete action in the spirit of the co-legislators.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 120, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Catherine Stihler", "mepid": "4545", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and shadows. The European insurance sector has trillions of euros worth of assets under its management, making it the backbone of our financial industry and an important contributor to GDP. The insurance distribution directive (IDD) is, along with Solvency II, just one piece of the puzzle of updated regulations aimed at strengthening European standards and encouraging cross-border purchases. A patchwork of national regulations, with some governments gold-plating the measures and others implementing the bare minimum necessary for compliance, has been the case across Europe for some years now. However, the agreement reached on IDD includes substantial achievements in consumer protection, notably on information for consumers, a ban on time practices and the prevention of conflicts of interest. This agreement includes substantial achievements in consumer protection, which was my priority and my group’s from the get-go. The implementation of this updated regulation will ensure consumers understand the risks, costs and features of all insurance products and that those selling them possess the relevant professionalism and competence. Part of a review by the Commission in 2008 found that a lack of transparency around remuneration was resulting in too many Commission-driven conflicts of interest in the market. The new directive requires Member States to lay down rules ensuring the intermediaries, insurers and reinsurers do not remunerate or assess the performance of employees in a way that conflicts with their duty to act in the best interests of consumers. Also, before a contract is concluded, an intermediary must disclose to customers the nature and basis – such as a fee, commission, or combination thereof – of the remuneration. This is a huge increase in transparency for the consumer. Insurance and reinsurance distribution can be carried out by insurers and reinsurers as well as intermediaries. So the scope of this regulation has been widened to reflect that. But in specified circumstances, such as ancillary insurance intermediaries, those whose principal activities are not insurance related are excluded from the scope. Another important achievement of IDD is ensuring that sellers’ professional qualifications match the complexity of the products they sell. Included in the directive is a requirement for at least 15 hours of professional training or development per year, although as part of our compromise with the Council, Member States may allow evidence of continuous training and development through successful completion of an exam. Under the existing directive, there will be requirements to disclose information to customers before a contract is concluded. So to remain competitive, there is a need for innovation – particularly digital innovation – and this will ultimately lead to huge potential for the provision of cross-border insurance sales. The adoption of IDD is an important step towards this, and I look forward to Parliament endorsing it during the plenary session.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 121, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Ashley Fox", "mepid": "96957", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, the Insurance Distribution Directive will enhance consumer protection, increase competition and create a more level playing field between insurance and investment products. I am pleased that we have agreed upon a principle-based approach giving Member States flexibility to implement tougher rules where they see fit to do so. This is the most sensible way to go about legislating: allowing companies room to ensure they give consumers the best outcomes rather than worrying about tick-box style exercises. The product information document is a good example of this. We have been able to strip out many of the over-prescriptive one-size-fits-all requirements, instead focusing on the information that can actually benefit the consumer. It was vital to protect consumers’ interest in the wide variety of tied insurance products that currently save them time and money. I am pleased that consumers in my country, for example, will still be able to choose a bank account that includes travel insurance, should they wish to do so. Consumers will also benefit from a move towards aligning insurance distribution more closely with the rules laid out in MiFID II in order to create a level playing field between insurance and investment products.

Ensuring common legislation on different types of insurance and ensuring comprehensive and transparent information for consumers are absolutely necessary objectives. However, we fear that once again the big bank, which is the one that increasingly centralizes and concentrates insurance distribution activities, will be favoured.  It is true that in some respects progress has been made and we hope in particular that, if implemented, the new Directive will help to put an end to misleading or fraudulent packages.  However, as far as the initial objectives are concerned, it is unacceptable that, if transparency is sought in the consumer-facing market, brokers can continue to charge commissions opaquely. It is difficult for a broker to provide objective information about the different products if, at the same time, it is receiving commissions from the insurers themselves. Moreover, once again, transparency requirements are restricted to certain products, without reaching the market as a whole.

It has to be said that the positions were far apart. The Commission had put forward a comparatively ambitious proposal. There were very different views of this report in Parliament, as well as in the Council. The insurance industry has insisted all the time that its products are different from bank-based products, although some of the suppliers and distributors are actually identical. Unfortunately, it is now the case that, while we are taking a step forward with the conclusion of this directive, we are taking a step forward in order to increase consumer protection in the area of insurance distribution, to greater transparency and also to increase competition, but that we nevertheless retain different rules, including for products that are in direct competition with each other. So, for example, a form-based life insurance policy is sold under distribution rules other than an investment fund or a bundle of investment funds. In the interests of fair competition, this makes no sense. For example, in the case of investment funds, commissions will have to be disclosed to consumers in future, while in the area of capital life insurance it remains the case for disclosure of the total costs, even though the same products are partly sold by the same distributors. After all, we have been able to ensure that a delegated act will now ensure that there are at least similar standards. It is important that we ensure that uniformity is allowed into the rules.

We think this report is very favourable, but I think we must also emphasise that tomorrow large financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies will also have to comply with the same directives as insurance intermediaries. It was time for the European Parliament to give all the powers so that this profession could be widely authorised, not only by banks and insurance companies, but also by financial intermediaries. I think the point of this report is to put the banking and insurance lobby in trouble, which thought it was the only one that could manage and organize this profession.

It has three major advantages: on the one hand, it leads to improved consumer protection, on the other hand it leads to greater transparency and, on the other hand, it takes account of the different cultures in the Member States. I have always advocated improved consumer protection, also from the point of view of administrability and fair competition and the relationship of trust between intermediaries and customers.  Secondly, increased transparency is important because we must ensure that there are information requirements so that customers make independent decisions and the products on offer are comparable.

The consumer will be given clearer information, more robust advice and, in general, stronger protection. A particularly important provision is that the consumer should not be forced to purchase such insurance offered in packages with another good or service. The item or service must be available for purchase without insurance. All this is a valuable step in the right direction.

Care should still be taken in the event of damage to policyholders and consumer confidence.

In terms of the themes that were raised, there is a great deal of consistency around the themes of transparency and the importance of proportionality. Here the regime does allow a graduated approach, with a lighter regime for some kinds of business and some businesses in ancillary services excluded altogether. In terms of the consistency between different pieces of legislation, I think we have made good progress. For instance, all the risks on sale standards are a hundred percent aligned with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), so that is a step forward. We talked about the importance, obviously, of consumer protection and of citizens being better able to understand risks. Here again, I think we have made big steps forward. We have also talked about the necessity of making it possible for there to be innovation, particularly in the field of digital services. In that respect, later this year we will be publishing a Green Paper on retail financial services that will look, in particular, at the question of digital financial services and how we can make further progress there. One of the aspects on insurance that I am keen to look at as well is this question of insurance in the car rental market, where again I think we can make progress in making that market more transparent.

Mr President, however, only on the points on which you wanted to go further, in the others. We have shared our share of the fact that the title has been changed. Overall, I believe that it is sensible regulation, and it also meets the different needs of the different markets that have developed. For example, in line with the rules in the northern European countries, we have given the Member States the possibility of a ban on commissions and mandatory advice. But Mr Giegold was the only one besides me who survived the change of mandate from the former shadow rapporteurs, so that we can observe continuity better. Mr Woolfe said that we need to think of insurance intermediaries, small and medium-sized enterprises. He obviously did not read the text.

The European Parliament is presenting amendments to repeal two additional acts, which have also become obsolete: the Council Convention of 17 June 1998 on the withdrawal of driving licences and Council Act 98/C 216/01 and Council Framework Decision 2008/978/JHA on the European mandate for the search for evidence for the acquisition of objects, documents and data for use in criminal proceedings (MER).", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 512, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Alberto Cirio (PPE)", "mepid": "124772", "text": "  in writing. \\u2012 The Council's Joint Action established a directory of specialist expertise, skills and knowledge in the field of counter-terrorism in order to make them more widely and promptly available to the services of all Member States, which became obsolete when Europol was given the task of supporting and strengthening mutual cooperation between the law enforcement authorities of the Member States.

Justified steps to maintain them will result in a continuous and significant reduction in the amount of marine fish fish fished. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming.  A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

That is why the Socialists have proposed establishing a child guarantee as part of an integrated European plan to combat child poverty, which also encompasses programmes that provide aid and opportunities for parents to get out of situations of social exclusion and integrate into the labour market. In this regard, we deeply regret that the proposal is not accompanied by a specific guarantee fund, since the European right as a whole has refused to support its creation.

I am therefore convinced that we need new concrete measures, as I propose and the Social Democratic Group. We urge the Commission and the Member States to create a Children's Guarantee that enables every needy child to receive free health and childcare, education, decent accommodation and adequate nutrition. This could be a similar measure to the youth employment initiative that is already in place. I am pleased that today the majority in the European Parliament supported the Children's Guarantee. In order to reduce child poverty, we need to create a special EU budget for this, because without money we will not be able to do anything. We now have different instruments to reduce child poverty, but they are not harmonised and, in most cases, money from the funds is allocated to other areas, and the money for investing in children simply is no longer there. So we need to combat poverty from as young age as possible, so that all children have equal opportunities and are not condemned to poverty.

In addition, inequalities are growing between European countries, and the percentage of malnourished children is increasing. That is why we call on the Commission and the Member States to set targets for reducing poverty and social exclusion, and to put in place multidimensional plans to achieve this, with particular attention paid to the most endangered children. Education can play an important role in achieving these goals; it is therefore important to ensure that all children have access to a public education, open to all and of quality at all ages, and to combat school drop-out.

It is well documented that the marginalisation of social groups is also a cultural ground for fundamentalism, organised crime and political or religious terrorism. It is therefore desirable to launch EU projects with long-term funding and perspectives in order to deeply involve the target groups, increasing the effectiveness of the intervention and ensuring that the funds support investment in the real needs of the beneficiaries, with mechanisms to ensure that target groups are reached and that exclusion and marginalisation are addressed.

At European level, there is no comprehensive definition of a 'marginalised community'. The first step, therefore, is to understand the phenomenon of marginalization by analysing its specific characteristics. It is appropriate to examine the typical and specific situations and needs of different realities and to assess living and working conditions, access to education and health care systems, level of employment and early school leaving. In this scenario, Europe's task is to establish a set of common indicators that will allow us to reconstruct the concept of 'marginalised community' in a uniform and shared way. Cohesion policy thus becomes a driving force for development by supporting the economic, social and territorial inclusion of minorities. The next step is to extend these measures to all minorities that are currently excluded, so that the process of breaking down moral and material boundaries can be implemented.

It should be borne in mind that, according to criminological studies, factors such as housing, educational exclusion, unemployment and poverty create favourable conditions for demoralisation and pathological behaviour, and often result in high rates of crime among those subjected to these factors.

The UN is undoubtedly the best forum for promoting the EU's values and interests by transferring them to a global level. However, there are many problems in the UN system of operation, which, in my opinion, go to the detriment of the EU. Indeed, the EU cannot act as a single entity within the UN, as the UN's action is directed at individual countries and not so much interstate organisations such as the EU. The EU itself also has problems with a patchy foreign policy, which is why it does not play the most important role in international relations. The interests of individual Member States play a significantly greater role here, and the interest of the EU as a whole is often sidelined, as it is often difficult to identify, let alone defend.

Well, that is the reality of most large multinational companies operating in Europe that pay effective rates of 5 %, sometimes even lower than that amount, even in countries where the nominal tax rate is around 30 % and more.  This situation has very serious consequences. The first is that the tax burden that feeds our collective expenditure on health, education, unemployment support, infrastructure, focuses almost solely on two types of taxpayers: small and medium-sized enterprises and natural persons, that is, the ordinary citizen.  The second consequence is that, at a time when so many exceptional sacrifices are being asked for by the population, which include giving up public services and social benefits, including some that have been solemnly contracted with the state, such as pensions, while the worsening tax burden rises to impossible levels, this situation is totally unfair. An injustice that becomes unbearable.  How does this explain itself? Strangely, although the rules of the internal market and the single currency have evolved to the creation of a level playing field across Europe, the European Union has always maintained, as regards direct taxes, the capital principle that it is sufficient for any Member State to object to an evolution in this area to be immediately blocked. This would perhaps be tolerated during the period of the founding of the European Union, when the three major countries, France, Germany and Italy, turned a blind eye to more or less open tax competition on the part of the three small Benelux countries. But today, with the European Union extended to 28 countries, and when the movement of capital is more important than the movement of goods, the distortion of competition in the internal market, coupled with this principle of unanimity, requires us to a very serious reassessment of our collective functioning. A year after the Lux Leaks scandal, the European Parliament is now producing its first major report on direct taxation in Europe. This report must be a factor capable of triggering the structural change that is needed. We all work seriously and intensely, we listen to hundreds of people, and we hope that our conclusions will enable this Parliament to take a solid, strong front in the face of the Council and the Commission, in defence of the interests of the citizens, who are also taxpayers.  Our proposals, it should be noted, do not want tax harmonisation in the Union, but rather to ensure that direct taxes on corporate profits are calculated according to common methods, that multinational companies publicly report on key information in each of the countries where they operate, that tax administrations, and in particular the European Commission, will have access to the terms of the tax agreements anticipated between administrations and large companies , that there is a much greater transparency regime at European level on how these issues are dealt with at Member State level, in particular in the framework of the Code of Conduct. We must also move towards a European definition of what tax havens are, assuming zero tolerance for them, and to create clear rules for the protection of alert launchers. It is also necessary to manage the conflicts of interest of those who advise tax on multinationals and at the same time advise the States and the European institutions. I'd like to leave one last note, and I'm done now, Madam President, and this note is that this work is not done. We have to keep working and get the information we haven't obtained so far, but that doesn't mean going backwards. We must quickly move forward this week with a continuation of our work, with a clear mandate to obtain what we have not achieved so far, but to move forward in monitoring the Commission and the Council in implementing what we are now recommending.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1728, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   I was being kind because you are the rapporteur.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Equal treatment for all is the central issue, not only on the issue of speaking time, but also, of course, on the issue of tax payments. We note that there is no fair tax competition. Unfortunately, the revelations a year ago that brought investigative journalists to light in the wake of the LuxLeaks scandal have led us to find that some – and not just a few, but above all international – corporations are able to exploit tax loopholes. They have aggressive tax avoidance models that greatly reduce their tax burden. The figures on the table here are worrying when, for example, Disney can reduce its tax burden to 0.3% on a multibillion-dollar profit, if, conversely, it is clear to the House of Commons, for example, that Facebook paid only 5,000 pounds in corporation tax in 2014, less than the average Facebook employee earning 26,500 pounds and paying 5,393 pounds in income tax in return. , including insurance. That is unfair. Above all, the competitive disadvantage for small and medium-sized enterprises is significant. Scientists have calculated to us in committee that small and medium-sized enterprises have a disadvantage of 20-25% compared to large corporations. It was therefore necessary for this Parliament to set up the special committee, as I also proposed here a year ago. We worked hard. We were there in Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, but also in the UK and outside the EU in Switzerland.  We have also invited representatives of so-called tax havens. We spoke intensively with NGOs and tax experts from independent institutes, universities, and we also wanted to listen to the corporations. Unfortunately, it took a very long time for the international groups Facebook, Google, Amazon, HSBC and Barclays to even be prepared to come to our Parliament. We should agree on this: such contempt for Parliament must not be repeated in the future. This is where we have to stand together. We have drawn up a whole series of proposals on how we can achieve fairer tax competition in the future. Our central insight is that the combination of 28 national tax laws leads to the loopholes that a few – especially large international corporations – have been able to exchange.  That is why it is now necessary to create a common European legal framework. This should include: the automatic exchange of information – we are grateful to the Commission for the legislative proposal. I repeat at this point that what has now been concerted does not meet our expectations. The exchange of information should have gone further. We also propose a common consolidated corporate tax base. We propose that the OECD recommendations in the BEPS project be implemented in a common EU directive as a way of making this binding.  If it were to be implemented nationally, loopholes would probably be inevitable in the end. Then it should be ensured that no profit leaves the EU without being taxed – here the double taxation agreements must be considered. We are calling on the Commission to clearly define the economic substance, and we call for a reform of the Code of Conduct working group, which needs political responsibility. Ladies and gentlemen, we have made good progress with this report, but there is still much to be done. The issue of political responsibility has not yet been finally resolved, and it is a major scandal that documents are still being withheld from this Parliament by the Member States and the Commission. That is why I can only call on us to take democratic control seriously.  We, as a directly elected Parliament, should now have full access to the requested documents. That is why I am also calling for the work of the TAXE Committee to continue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1730, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Pierre Moscovici", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Madam President, Madam and Mr rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, it is a real satisfaction for me to be present for this presentation of the final report of the TAXE Committee. It is a quality report and I want to put this to the credit of the two rapporteurs, Mrs Ferreira and Mr Theurer, as well as that of all the participants in this committee. I want to take the time to extend my sincere congratulations to them. We both want to make taxation more transparent, fairer and more efficient. This is a priority of the European Commission. It's expected by our citizens. This is one of the major thrusts of my action. I have already wanted to move fast and hard in 2015 and I want to maintain this momentum in 2016 with the support of the European Parliament. You know the two fundamental principles that drive my action and which are part of the most basic sense of justice. First, taxes must be levied where profits are made. This is called the principle of effective taxation. Second, everyone, including multinational firms, must pay their fair share.  This is an ambition which, I know, is shared by the TAXE Committee, which irrigates the report and explains why on many points, in reality, our views are converging. I will go back to a few of them, but I will go back to the quality of our cooperation with the TAXE committee.  I noted what Mr Theurer said at the end of his speech: the need for information. We have tried to find pragmatic arrangements to allow as many documents as possible to the different groups. There is still progress to be made. You know the limits that exist. They do not come from the Commission. I want to say it with a lot of force.  This year, the Commission presented two major initiatives to radically change the corporate tax system in Europe: the tax transparency package , it was last March, and the action plan on corporate taxation in June. These are two initiatives that lay the groundwork for substantial reform of the corporate tax framework, which covers a wide spectrum, ranging from transfer prices to preferential regimes, through pre-tax agreements, tax havens, conflict resolution and the reform of the code of conduct.  Many of these initiatives are the subject of specific recommendations from your committee. I want to get back to the main ones quickly. First, we heard the European Parliament's message on country-by-country reporting. I had the opportunity to say this in one of my hearings, because I had two before you, the Commission keeps the tempo on this initiative. We will finalize our impact study in the first half of 2016, accompanied by an initiative, which we will calibrate. You know my personal preferences, but we must also take into account, in the definition of the public to which we are addressing, the need to preserve the investment. That is where the Commission will set its point of view. It is in the Commission's work programme for next year, which gives you the measure of our commitment. Believe that mine, all personal, is strong on this issue.  With regard to the proposed Consolidated Joint Corporate Tax Base - ACCIS - the Commission wants to revitalize this issue, which has been in the Council for too long. This is a desire that has been clearly marked, again, in the Commission's 2016 work programme. We will withdraw the current proposal, not because it is bad, but because it is blocked. We will replace it with proposals for a two-step approach, starting with an agreement on a mandatory tax base. This will improve the single business market while filling in the gaps and ensuring that every business pays its fair share of tax. This is the key element of the overhaul of corporate taxation so that it is finally in line with the European dimension. I mean, however, that I am not giving up on consolidation. I know that is what is expected, but it seems to me that first proceeding to the creation of a common base is the way to convince those who are reluctant and, I regret, to move towards consolidation. I am pleased to see that we agree on these key instruments in the fight against tax evasion and on the establishment of a fair taxation system within the European Union.  With regard to the work carried out by the OECD, the Commission is totally in line with your recommendation. Now that the G20 - held in Antalya a few days ago - has approved the final measures of the BEPS project, this must effectively become the rule of the European Union. This must be implemented in a way that is compatible with the treaties. A patchwork of national approaches would split our single market, obstruct the freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty, and weaken Member States' efforts against tax evasion. Therefore, a coordinated approach to BEPS is essential and the Union has already taken the lead on this point. For example, the Commission's proposal to increase transparency on the early decision-making process in tax matters was adopted in a record time frame, only seven months after it was proposed, and I had the opportunity to come and defend this proposal for a directive. Here I once again welcome the very high quality of the work of the European Parliament. I would have liked, as you, ladies and gentlemen, to go a little further, but I think the compromise we have reached is, let us say, quality. We must move faster if we are to protect the taxable bases of all Member States and safeguard our common competitiveness. We must also ensure that our own instruments are consistent. Parliament calls on us, and I quote, to 'address in depth the problems related to corporate taxation, including harmful practices and their impact in the case of the European Semester'. The Commission is of course ready to continue to use all the instruments at its disposal to combat tax evasion, including in the context of the European Semester. So I'm responding favourably. Where the rules and practices that make tax systems vulnerable to aggressive tax optimisation are already being examined, they need to be more so. With regard to the external dimension of tax evasion, the Commission fully shares the opinion of the TAXE Committee that the Union must raise its level of play.  Last June, we published a pan-European list of third countries identified for tax purposes. It was the first time. This is an important step towards a more coherent approach to good fiscal governance in these countries. I am aware of the criticisms that may have come here or there. It was a potpourri or a best of. We must now move towards a much more coherent and common strategy. We must have a real external strategy in tax matters, which must be based on a common mechanism within the European Union, to deal with external threats to the member states' tax bases. On this point, again, our views converge. The Commission also shares the European Parliament's expectations for combating the misuse of legal structures such as corporations and trusts. We will therefore pay particular attention to the implementation by Member States of their obligations under the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.  With regard to the tax council, I would like to point out that new rules, which are already being implemented within the European Union and which apply to the auditing of the accounts of certain entities, will allow, among other things, to regulate the joint provision of audit services and tax advice to limit, as you wish, the risk of conflict of interest. They will apply from June 2016. Finally, a word about the control of state aid in the tax field. The Commission thanks the European Parliament for its support on this subject, which is obviously major. Aid control is an important tool to combat the illicit benefits that businesses get from Member States and helps to strengthen the fiscal fairness of our union. As my colleague Margrethe Vestager said, with whom I work in the best conditions, each in her field and in respect, of course, for the competences of the other, legislation on the one hand, implementation on the other, particularly through procedures that are at its disposal, she is continuing investigations on behalf of the Commission. It is making progress in its analysis of the information received from all the Member States on the report on tax rulings and you know that it has been led to take quite courageous steps with the college which, like you, I fully support. Ladies and gentlemen, when I was appointed, with this College, Commissioner of Taxation, a little over a year ago, I promised to make fair and effective corporate taxation a top priority. The pace and breadth of the Commission's business tax reform initiatives presented this year are proof, in addition to my personal commitment, of the Commission's commitment to go faster, stronger, further than any Commission has done so far. But 2015 is coming to an end and my work in this field has barely begun. Of course, it will continue at the same pace and with the same ambition in 2016 and beyond.  I want to tell you my conviction, which is also that of the Commission and its President, that the European Parliament has a crucial role to play. This is the role of deliberation. It is also, let us say, to maintain political pressure because you and I know what the tax rule is. It is restrictive, difficult and even limiting. That is the rule of unanimity, at twenty-eight. So we also have to be able to turn to the Member States. I do it, you do it, we do it together. I am sure that our institutions will continue to work hand in hand to advance these joint initiatives, and I believe that this report and the work of your contribution are an essential contribution to this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1731, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Danuta Maria Hübner", "mepid": "96779", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, we do need changes in the way tax systems, tax policies and tax practices work in the European Union. What we have right now does not fit the European reality of the 21st century and the principle of fairness. We all share the view that reform of tax systems is about making them fair, which entails ensuring that taxes are paid where value is created, and this is a common-sense principle. We also need to end the de facto double standards between SMEs and multinationals, which can use sophisticated strategies to escape taxes. A wide range of recommendations are made in this report, but let me use my one minute to insist on one point – the call for an improvement in the mechanism to solve tax disputes. This system is very weak in Europe and we need a good quality arbitration system, both globally, and this is a task for the OECD, and within the European Union. Let me conclude by saying that the unacceptable shortcomings we found should not conceal the fact that most companies are honest taxpayers, creating growth and jobs and serving our economies, and we need to be mindful of that and act in a proportionate way.

Madam President, Commissioner, I think it is always surprising to hear people are in favour of something at the global level when it is certain that this will not happen right away and accommodate the lack of action where it would be possible to act. I think that's a nice excuse.  For my part, I am rather here to welcome the work of the two rapporteurs, Mrs Ferreira and Mr Theurer, that of Alain Lamassoure and the whole Commission, who have tried to work on a subject which is anything but obvious, where definitions are not so easy to establish since there are grey areas, that is, things that are lawful but which are , by their magnitude, end up becoming totally and morally unacceptable. Looking to the future, Commissioner, I would like to stress two points. First, we would like you to continue to help us. You have done that, but we would like to go further in the search for documents. What for? Because this Parliament is the place of democracy and you know how much in our country, at the moment, we insist that Europe does nothing on a number of issues, that Europe is not up to the task. \"What is Europe doing?\" Here we have the opportunity to put the Member States before their responsibilities, because without them there is no European action possible. The second thing relates to what you said about the text on the consolidated common base. I was one of the shadow rapporteurs, we did our best. You consider it your responsibility to remove the text. It is not to defend a job, but let us just make sure that we are not accused, after the fact - as we are doing now with respect to the NRP - of having braked. Our intention is not to slow down, and I do not think it is the Commission's, but to succeed as soon as possible. The paradox is that most of the companies, the multinationals we have heard have told us clearly: \"If you don't want tax rulings and evasion, give us a level playing field, let's make sure we have the same rules all over Europe\".

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her A year ago, a young courageous man, Antoine Deltour, made LuxLeaks and the tax deals of corporations with Luxembourg public. Deltour now faces five years in prison, while Juncker became President of the European Commission. But Juncker is right: LuxLeaks should actually be called EU leaks. We lose up to hundreds of billions of euros a year through these tax tricks, while the sponsors of the tax cartel, Mr Juncker or Eurogroup chief Dijsselbloem, are flooding the EU population with austerity diktats.  And it is also true that in tax havens banks also launder the money of criminals. Nor does the Islamic State park its oil billions under pillows in Syria. Neither the Commission nor the Council could say whether any of the measures required by the United Nations to dehydrate terrorist financing in the EU had been implemented in practice. The dehydration of tax havens and sanctions against banks that aid money laundering and tax evasion are therefore not only a requirement of justice, but also of security. The committee – we would have liked a real committee of inquiry – came across an omerta, a wall of silence. Documents have been refused or blackened by the Commission and Member States. That is why my group will be bringing an action before the European Court of Justice. The public has a claim to the truth. We have new insights into how Juncker and Dijsselbloem defended the tax tricks in patent boxes to the teeth for Luxembourg and the Netherlands. They can no longer hide behind small officials. Nor the finance ministers of the large Member States – like my own, Germany – who remained silent about this because domestic corporations benefited. Juncker also told Parliament the untruth on a secret side of the Krecké report. They must now be accountable to the people here. Are you ready to re-invite Juncker and Dijsselbloem: Yes or no?  The former chief of staff of the U.S. Senate Permanent Investigation Committee told me how they grilled the Goldman Sachs board for eight hours. She was disturbed by how weak the European Parliament was towards corporations. We too need a permanent committee of inquiry with instruments of sanctions against corporations. My group has been able to enshrine many positive elements in the report; for example, the impact of the cuts on tax enforcement, the extension of the list of tax havens also to INCLUDE EU Member States in country-by-country reporting and so on and so on. But that is not enough. The exchange of information on tax rulings must be as public as in the UNITED States and even in Belgium.  After all, the finance ministers have been penning and looked away. Corporate profits must be determined immediately across the EU for corporation tax. Profits must not continue to be pushed across borders. Every village policeman knows that you cannot write an investigative report until all the evidence has been assessed and the perpetrators have also been named. That is why my group regrets that, despite many positive elements, we must abstain on this report. The information work must go further. Taxpayers in Europe are entitled to this.

It re-publishs country-by-country, mandatory and public information, and re-reports on a common and consolidated corporate tax base.

Nevertheless, I think the Commission can do one or the other thing: the first, if you want us to be pressured, give us access to the documents.

Mr Juncker has not yet clarified the issue of the missing page of the Krecké report and continues to deny any direct involvement by Luxembourg.

The tax response is necessary and delicate, we support the harmonization of the corporate tax base, the ACCIS plan, the exchange of information, the publication of information by country, in order to tax profits where they are made.  But we patriots categorically reject the prospects of a fiscal union and a harmonization of rates.

The European Parliament is calling for a louder voice on European tax coordination, and quite rightly so. It is not acceptable for micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises to pay their full tax rate for the common good, but large corporations to spend their money only on tax advisors. The Member States – and I would also have liked a Council representative to be here today – have not done their homework in recent years. They have exchanged little or no information and have only thought of their own control pot. It is therefore absolutely overdue that the Commission should now start new attempts on these issues. Above all, it is important to harmonise the corporate tax base here, and we welcome the fact that the Commission intends to act swiftly in this area. We must also keep an eye on the international level. The OECD is doing immensely important and helpful work here.

I am enormously pleased that our Parliament looks set to approve six measures which, if enacted, would radically reduce the possibility of tax dodging across Europe. As colleagues have said, the measures are: first, making public the profits and taxes paid by multinationals in every country where they operate; second, fixing a common tax base for corporate tax so companies and governments cannot fiddle around by playing definitions off against each other; third, creating a robust European definition of tax havens with sanctions for those who use those havens; fourth, protecting whistle-blowers like Antoine Deltour who act in the public interest; fifth, ensuring tax advisers provide a clean service that does not involve conflicts of interest; and finally, making sure countries share information properly and quickly about sweetheart deals concluded with multinationals. I am particularly pleased to see these measures command support across all of the parties – certainly all of the Groups – within this House. In fact, when it comes to country-by-country reporting for multinationals and making that public, Parliament has already shown its support – emphatically – and I am very pleased that it looks like we will be doing that again in the days to come. The same applies when it comes to measures within this report to protect whistle-blowers, where it is excellent to see so much agreement within this House. However, I have to say that I have been disappointed before and I was disappointed again today – although sadly there appear to be no UK Conservatives left in the Chamber at the moment – that they continue to be against the consensus of this Parliament for European action against tax dodging. In 2013 David Cameron said that when taxes are not collected, the poor suffer, but his measures have been described by Conservative peers themselves as purely political gestures. I would hope they might have changed their tune, and I will continue to lobby for them to change their tune before the vote on this report.

They get the interpretation of tax law in such a way that they can reduce their tax burden, in some cases downto a minimum, while other companies have to bear the normal full tax burden. This obviously leads to a distortion of competition.  This is a concern for the internal market, and it is right that the European Union, the European Parliament, has taken action here and, in the form of this committee of inquiry, has tried to shed light on this darkness and into this confusion. The Committee of Inquiry itself, it must now be said, was a weak committee of inquiry. I hope that he will have more instruments in the extension than what he has had at his disposal so far. The way in which we were able to question the representatives of companies and representatives of tax administrations or parliaments was weak and almost a farce.

That is why the Socialist Group is also making clear and concrete proposals: companies that systematically commit tax evasion should be able to be stripped of their business licences. They simply should not be allowed to do business in the EU. Anyone who opposes tax fraud has to back down. Even those countries that profit from tax evasion must be punished considerably more severely.

At EU and at global level we have to find a way to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax and that SMEs and ordinary taxpayers do not continue to shoulder a disproportionate share of the tax take. In this context, however, we also need to ensure that the EU itself remains competitive. It is not just Belgium or France competing with Germany or the UK, but it is also that the EU itself must compete with Singapore or India. Thirdly, I do not support trying to change the unanimity rule with regard to the tax rate. Member States must continue to have the right to decide on that.

What is competition today? We have rushed as you know from Jacques Delors' very high exhortation to compete on knowledge and quality at LuxLeaks.

In OECD countries, 5% of current corporate tax revenues are lost annually. In the European Union, around EUR 1 000 billion of potential tax revenue is lost every year – through tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance. And it is true that each country is a tax haven from the point of view of another country, that probably even the various measures and the practice to date are mostly legal, but in any case unethical, because distorting competition, unjust and unfair.  That is why we demand that taxation take place where economic activity also takes place. We need more transparency, hence country-by-country reporting, cross-border information.

I say this in part because I think it is a job worth being welcomed, but hailed as a first step towards what might be called the Union's fiscal awakening. Much remains to be done, as has been said, but it must be repeated.  In this report, we can clearly see the shameful behaviour of multinationals that are implementing very sophisticated tax optimization strategies. It is a report that also demonstrates the very negative effects of this unfair competition between states from a tax point of view and which results in huge shortfalls. Mr Bayet has talked about EUR 1 trillion, and that is the amount of money. Finally, it is a report, we must stress this, which shows the unequal treatment between multinationals that sometimes evade tax and small businesses that pay full pot. So there are recommendations that go in the right direction and, of course, at the heart of the project is the ICSA, this consolidated corporate tax base.  Commissioner Moscovici presented the Commission's proposal. This is a step in the right direction, but I think we should not stop from looking further and going faster. I think there is this or that aspect that is interesting, for example, the protection of whistleblowers and the prevention of conflicts of interest. After, we can regret the absence of certain points. I am thinking in particular of a minimum corporate tax rate.  Overall, this is a good move.

Moreover, these companies, through intra-group transactions, avoid paying taxes on their profits, thus creating social inequalities and negatively affecting the budgets of the States.  However, in the face of tax rulings, all Member States of the European Union are called upon to take measures to stop multinationals turning to tax havens and avoid tax avoidance in the Netherlands or Luxembourg, as has become known through luxleaks.  Finally, the profits of multinationals should be taxed where they are made.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1794, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Stanislav Polčák (PPE).", "mepid": "124704", "text": "   – Mr President, I was very shocked by the scale of the Luxleaks scandal and I must say that the scale was so surprising to me that I considered myself supporting the provisions of this committee. I admire my colleagues in my political group who have found the courage to do so even against the opinion of even the majority of my political group. However, the conclusions made by the Committee are very inspiring and I think that in this case it is really about preventing tax dumping. De facto unfair tax competition, because that is what threatens Europe far more than a single tax system. I'm not in for a single tax system. And I must say that I am not yet convinced that a common tax base should be established at the level of European law. On the other hand, it is not possible for us to continue to tolerate practices that only multinational corporations really favour, and in this sense I will certainly support the committee report that has been tabled here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1795, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Pierre Moscovici", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you very much for this high-quality debate. I would like to show – of course, with the normal differences between Groups and MEPs – consensus on the objectives that we want to obtain together. A few comments on this debate. Firstly, tax evasion and avoidance cannot be tolerated any more. Tax fairness is supported by all political Groups, and for that you will have the full support of the Commission. Secondly, we need to build a tax system for the 20th century. That is exactly what we want to do together. Thirdly, implementation by Member States needs to be ensured, not only within the EU – that is about tax rulings – but also more widely, and globally, at the level of the G20 at least, on the automatic exchange of information. Of course, I will advocate for the fast adoption of the CCCTB – and I mention the three Cs and not just the two. There, we must pursue a level playing-field, reduce complexities for our companies and eliminate aggressive tax practices. Fourthly, on the EU action on BEPs: yes, I want the EU to be in the leadership. I fully support the remarks made here for an EU which is law-compliant and your concern with preventing 28 different approaches. We need to have only one common approach. Fifthly, on a country-by-country report: yes, we will have a complete impact assessment. I want this to be public, of course, but at the same time the Commission will also think about protecting EU businesses’ competitiveness, as called for by several Member States. Everything must be looked at. But again, this is not against my personal preference, which is well known. When we talk about publicity, there is ‘public’ in it, and we must do as much as possible in that field. Sixthly, on access to documents: the Commission has already given access to 350 working documents of the code of conduct since 1998. By virtue of the inter-institutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission of 2010, we need to have the formal agreement of Member States in order to share more. I did all that I could, and I am very willing to cooperate even more. We discussed that with the President of the committee, and you may be sure that the Commission is not a reluctant part of it. But of course I understand your concerns, and I will try to find an even better solution. On the extension of taxes mandate, the Commission has already cooperated with the committee so far and will continue to do so. The committee’s political pressure is of high importance to achieve progress, and I see that positively, not as a constraint or as criticism (criticism is part of democracy) but really as positive pressure. Seventhly, on an external dimension towards third countries and a definition of tax haven: the Commission is looking into this in the framework of its June planned follow-up. I said in what spirit I would advance on that, and we all agree on that. Eighthly, unfair tax competition is to the detriment of all, except certain multinationals. Tax competition, as mentioned, should not lead to tax war. Many of you said that, and I fully share that view. Ninthly, and lastly, improved dispute resolution mechanisms following the June action plan. We have started to work on that, and we will continue to do that together. I would like to finish by once again congratulating the TAXE committee for the work that has already been done. I look forward to further cooperation with Parliament and to bringing forward our agenda for a fairer, more transparent and more efficient tax system for Europe’s citizens and businesses. We, on our side, will continue our work with determination, conviction and ambition. Mais une dernière réflexion, peut-être, après vous avoir tous écouté. J'ai eu la chance, dans ma vie politique, de siéger dans les trois institutions. J'ai été membre de ce Parlement pendant six ans, y compris vice-président du Parlement. J'ai été au Conseil pendant sept ans, y compris deux ans dans le conseil ECOFIN et maintenant je suis à la Commission. Je connais par cœur les jeux de rôles qui peuvent nous regrouper ou nous séparer: je ne confonds pas le Parlement, la Commission et le Conseil, chacun est à sa place.  Mais si nous voulons avancer sur ces sujets délicats, pour le bien-être de nos citoyens, ne nous opposons pas les uns aux autres. C'est vain et il n'y a pas, dans cette affaire, les bons et les méchants. C'est seulement si la Commission prend des initiatives fortes, c'est seulement si le Parlement met en place des pressions fortes et intelligentes que les États membres – qui ont le pouvoir de décider en la matière – lèveront eux aussi certains blocages. Et donc par tempérament, sans doute, mais aussi par expérience, je vous invite davantage à la coopération qu'à la confrontation, une coopération qui peut être virile ou qui peut être forte, pardon je ne veux pas apparaître sexiste, et qui est la condition pour faire avancer la cause que nous défendons tous ensemble.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1796, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Elisa Ferreira", "mepid": "28308", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need broad support for this Parliament to be able to have enough political weight to overcome the habits and interests of taxation. Finally, I would like to thank a group of people and a group of entities: firstly, the Chairman of the TAXE Special Committee, Mr Lamassoure, who has always been able to use great diplomacy, great elegance, but has never lost the right direction; I would like to thank my colleague Michael Theurer for the fact that we have together managed to converge on the diagnosis of problems and also on solutions; I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the TAXE Committee; and I would also like to thank, in particular, all those who have come here to give their testimony on tax competition in European matters, especially journalists, warning launchers - who took very particular risks - and the international consortium of journalists, which launched Luxleaks, without whom we probably would not have had all this activity and all this debate; and, finally, to our personal secretariats and to the secretariat of the TAXE Commission, which have been insignificant in supporting the members of this Parliament. With regard to the Commission, the Commission can count on a very demanding Parliament, but also with a Parliament capable of supporting in this fight that interests us all. And I end by saying that of course Parliament does not accept the absence of elements on which we are probably, hopefully, to take decisions later this week: to continue to know more, to investigate further, not only to know, but to prevent the blockades that have prevented progress in the past in the future in relation to the agenda that we will adopt tomorrow , I hope, by a large majority.

A Liberal author, a Social Democrat, has presented a text which was a good basis for discussions with the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups. We would like to thank the suggestions that have also been made clear in the debate today. Yes, we need better protection for whistleblowers. That was the most moving moment when the poor people were with us on the committee, who have suffered personal disadvantages for representing the common good here. This must change in the future. A simpler tax system, as recommended by the OECD – at low rates – is also included in the report, including the binding implementation of the OECD recommendations. It is not true that the European Parliament or the Commission would have prevented the Member States from combating tax avoidance. No, the Member States have not been able to solve it on their own in the past. That is why we need a European solution. Dispute resolution is also proposed. These are all correct and important proposals.  However, we need more time. The consultation of the corporations came too late – too little time for it. The interrogation procedure is also wrong. We should do the hearing as we did in the Commissioner's hearings. The documents are also incomplete and full access to the file was not possible. Three hours for 800 pages, many of them blackened. This is not a way of working, Parliament should not allow itself to be allowed to do so. We are directly elected, we have to carry out democratic control. Citizens were concerned after the revelations of the LuxLeaks affair and they are awaiting clarification from this Parliament. This is where we should stand together. Together we can make a difference, and that is why I hope that tomorrow we will also get a broad, cross-party majority for our report, so that we can then go out with a strong signal and say: Member States, you are called now, let us have fair tax competition in Europe!

A typical case, the attempt to level the tax issues and in particular corporation tax. Until now, the obvious has been true, i.e. each country has the possibility to set its own tax rates for corporation tax, VAT and excise duties.  We therefore consider it non-negotiable to keep tax policies in the Member States, which will be able to define their tax policies and manage their own economy.

I am aware that there may be a need to restore the link between taxation and economic substance, and to ensure that taxes are paid in the countries where actual economic activity and value creation takes place. Our constituents should not be the ones to suffer from austerity policies while MNCs are able to avoid contributing to the Member States through fair taxation.

I think I can say that, in a particularly constrained context, Parliament has fulfilled its mission well.  We wanted this budget to be for growth, for jobs, and to meet the challenges of migration and refugee reception, but we must not pay words. Locked in a multi-year financial framework adopted in December 2013, our budget leaves us destitute as soon as a major crisis occurs. Faced with exceptional circumstances, we of course dream of exceptional resources and measure our impecuniousness as quickly. Subterfuge will no longer be able to mask reality. Many of the ads will look in vain for funding the means they call for in the budget we are about to vote on. This is so true that other sources, including direct contributions from Member States, must be sought to provide trust funds for Africa and Syria. Moreover, with regard to payments, a test of truth for all our commitments, the current appeasement is only the consequence of inertia and postponements in the launch of programmes. In other words, from 2017, unpaid bills will once again pile up on the Commission's desk at unsustainable levels. The situation has become crucial. At this stage, we must remember that Parliament's agreement on the 2014-2020 financial framework was only agreed on the condition of a mid-term review, a post-election review. I am counting on the Commission, which is described as the \"Last Chance Commission\" in the words of its President Jean-Claude Juncker. Yes, I am counting on the Commission to submit a project to us that is up to the challenges that we must assume, in line with the tasks that the Member States have already entrusted to the European Union in the European treaties, and those to come.  I remain confident in expressing the hope that the two branches of the budgetary authority, the Council and Parliament, can approach this meeting with seriousness, lucidity and courage. Your Committee on Budgets is preparing for this under the leadership of our colleagues Isabelle Thomas and Yann Olbrycht. Of course, I have no doubt that the Commission will provide expert assistance. May the Council show the same provisions of mind as those which prevailed in our successful conciliation. Be congratulated, Minister. Ladies and gentlemen, beyond the 2016 budget, which I encourage you to vote on, let us prepare to reframe our budgetary perspectives to convince Europeans that the Union, in an age of globalisation, has the ambition to assert its power and that our duty is to give it the means to do so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1805, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "José Manuel Fernandes", "mepid": "96899", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to greet the Commissioner, also greet the Presidency of the Council, Minister Pierre Gramegna, and greet all colleagues and colleagues. I would like to thank the rapporteurs, I would like to thank Gérard Deprez for his work excellence and also jens Geier, who is the permanent rapporteur for the agencies, and congratulate him on the work and results achieved, as well as Mrs Gardiazabal. We are a team, accompanied by all the shadow rapporteurs, which I also want to welcome. I would also like to greet all the councillors, all the political advisers, all the political groups, all those who participated in this negotiation, the secretariat and obviously greet, in a very special way, the Presidency of the Council and say that it has done a competent job. I do not think there has been unanimity in the Council on the budget for many years and I would therefore like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner Georgieva. I think we are all to be congratulated: we have an agreement that is positive, which responds to the challenges, which responds to the challenges, which is in line with the priorities we have set and Parliament's priorities.  We've brought this deal to the limit of our way. We used the flexibility instrument, EUR 1 530 million above the margins in its entirety, and we exhausted the margin of heading 1a, heading 1-B, heading 3 and heading 4; finally, we have exhausted the margins for growth, for employment, for social and territorial cohesion and also for internal and external solidarity to help solve the refugee crisis.  If we look at the first draft budget in relation to the appropriations for authorisation, we increase these authorisation appropriations by EUR 2 800 million, reducing the Council's cuts. Also in payment appropriations, if we look at the draft budget before amending letter 1, there are 2 151 million payments in appropriations that we also obtained. We can say that this is the employment budget and the solidarity budget.  In addition, it should be noted that we have succeeded in getting the Youth Employment initiative to be a priority for the institutions and continue after an assessment to be made in 2016. On the crisis affecting farmers, we have reinforced the amount by EUR 500 million, also to deal with this problem. And on employment, we do not forget to strengthen Horizon 2020 for innovation and research, Cosme for small and medium-sized enterprises and Erasmus+ for youth. On migration and refugees, the external side is well present: we mobilise all possible tools to solve this problem internally, but also to act at the source, and this package, where we include agencies, cooperation and development instruments, I am sure it will also bring more security to the European Union and help refugees.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1806, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Gérard Deprez", "mepid": "1473", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, I too will start with the thanks because I am afraid that I will not have time to do so at the end of my speech. I would like to begin by thanking my fellow rapporteurs, starting with my colleague and friend José Fernandes, who has done a remarkable job, our colleague Gardiazabal Rubial, and the one who has had arguably the most thankless work, Mr Gahler for the agencies. I would also like to thank all our staff: those of the secretariat and political groups, as well as our personal collaborators for the hard work they have done. I would like to congratulate the Vice-President, in particular, who has succeeded in its first real budget for 2016, and the Commission delegation. Finally, and in particular, I congratulate the President of the Council, Pierre Gramegna, our friend, for his perfect knowledge of the issues, his sensitivity to priorities and his remarkable spirit of conciliation. The success of conciliation on time owes him a great deal. I obviously share everything that my colleagues, President Jean Arthuis and the rapporteur-general José Fernandes, have said before me, and as rapporteur for the other sections, I will limit myself to what is my responsibility, that is, the other sections, and I will start with the European Parliament's budget for 2016. First of all, I will tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a rigorous budget. With the exception of an exceptional endowment of EUR 15,000 to improve the security of buildings and the security of computer systems, which is much needed today, you will agree, the European Parliament's budget for 2016 is only increasing by 1.6% compared to 2015. Secondly, this budget is all the more rigorous because it has been calculated on the basis of a wage adjustment of 1.2%, whereas under the application of the provisions of Article 65 of the Statute, this adjustment will in fact be exactly double what was the basis for the development of our proposals. We agreed in conciliation that this adjustment, which concerns all EU institutions, would not be financed by additional appropriations, but by spending cuts on certain items and internal transfers. For example, for the European Parliament, this will represent an additional effort in 2016 of almost EUR 10 million. Third, this rigorous budget, which I should say is doubly rigorous, is also a reform budget. These reforms are primarily concerned with the organisation of a better system of supervision and control of local assistants attached to parliamentarians. As a result, and through this reform, the excesses, if not the real abuses, to which the current system has given rise will no longer be able to occur or will in any case be detected and better controlled. Other reforms, including the parliamentary system, are currently under consideration and will soon be implemented. Fourthly, this doubly rigorous reform budget, as I said, is also, Mr President of the Council, Madam Vice-President, a budget of institutional loyalty. This loyalty is particularly relevant to the European Parliament's commitment to reduce its workforce by up to 5%, like all institutions, a commitment made under the 2014-2020 Financial Outlook Agreement. The European Parliament is obliged, very precisely, to achieve this reduction by 2019, according to a specific timetable starting in 2017 and completing the operation in 2019. I stress, however, forcefully, that the European Parliament will make the requested effort by excluding temporary posts from political groups from the scope of this reduction obligation. Political groups, their capacity to work, their dynamism, their confrontation, their capacity to compromise are the very essence of the dynamics of the European Parliament. To reduce the capacity of political groups to act by reducing their numbers would be a miscalculation which would only reinforce the bureaucracy and technocracy that are often too intrusive, if not sometimes arrogant, of certain European institutions. For the other institutions, the Court of Auditors, the Committee of the Regions, the Court of Justice, etc., we have essentially aligned ourselves with the Commission's initial proposals, which we felt were properly formulated. In the end, the Council, which had initially been much more restrictive, agreed to join our position. A regret, however, which concerns - I have already had the opportunity to say this - the European Court of Justice. We have certainly secured, for her, the creation of seven additional posts for strengthen security in the processing of classified documents, as well as the security of buildings, but it will nevertheless have to eliminate twenty posts, which will severely affect the logistical and linguistic support services necessary for the Court's activity, at a time when the number of judges will be doubled. In conclusion, you will understand that while the 2016 budget is not the new wonder of the world, it is a good transitional budget before the necessary revision of the financial outlook next year. I confess, in any case, that I am relieved to have finished.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1807, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Pierre Gramegna", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to represent the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council today, here in the European Parliament's Assembly, for this discussion on the 2016 budget. The agreement that the two branches of the budgetary authority, the European Parliament and the Presidency, have managed to conclude thanks also to the help of the European Commission, which has played an excellent role as an honest broker, is a very good end-of-the-road result for everyone, for all the institutions and, above all, a very good result for Europe. I will never forget the conciliation session on the evening of 13 November when we were in the process, thanks to the spirit of openness of each other, to reach a compromise, to finalise the last texts when we received the tragic news of the terrorist attacks and the barbaric acts that were committed in Paris.  We have a common momentum decided to make a minute's silence and I remember the words I uttered and the words that were uttered by the President, Jean Arthuis, at this moment of great sadness and mourning. The minute's silence, which we shared together, reinforced our will to succeed, which was already very present, and I believe that we have, through the agreement we have managed to find, proved the unity, solidarity and efficiency of the European Union.  Let me emphasize the effectiveness because we were able to complete four days before the end of the period. I believe that much credit goes to President Jean Arthuis, who wanted to put the final proposals on the table as much as I did, as did the committee, as soon as possible. This saved us time and money. I take a few figures from this budget: 155 billion commitment appropriations; 153.89 billion payment credits and then four other figures that seem fundamental to me and which are the cardinal points of this exercise. First of all, we have doubled the amount available to refugees, from two billion euros in the original budget to four billion euros for actions both internally for refugees and at borders, at border crossings or even in countries of origin. Secondly, we have spent $19 billion on growth and jobs, including $18 billion for what I have just named and then $1 billion, in particular, on the youth-employment action that is so dear to everyone around these benches. Thirdly, we have provided the necessary funds to reduce the delays, the backlog, the arrears of payment which will increase next year from 17 billion to 2 billion, a figure that is actually extremely small. The fourth amount I would like to quote is the 800 million budget margins that prudence has prompted us to forecast. I conclude by saying that we also had the wisdom to increase funding for the Homeland Security Fund; what had just happened in Paris, at the same time, proved to us that it was the right direction. I will stop there, Mr President, I will thank you instead in my second speech. I would just like to conclude by saying that this budget was keen to strike a balance between three constraints: the first is, of course, growth and investment on the one hand; the second, emergencies and priorities around refugees, what could be called solidarity; as for the third, it is the budgetary constraints that we have both in the European Parliament and in most of the Member States of the European Union. There is a consistency here that I wanted to emphasize.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1808, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I very much welcome the successful conclusion of the work of the Conciliation Committee for the 2016 budget and would like very sincerely to thank Parliament’s delegation led by the Chair, Mr Arthuis, as well as Mr Fernandes and Mr Deprez, but also Ms Gardiazabal Rubial for the work on Amending Budget 2015, and Mr Geier for what he has done to have a very good decision in the end on agencies. It has been a privilege to work with the Luxembourg Presidency, with Minister Gramegna, who has contributed enormously to a spirit of conciliation rather than confrontation. We have finished with a very strong sense of unity. Minister Gramegna reminded us of the sober setting in which negotiations were completed. But it was not only the fact that we faced the security concerns stemming from the Paris terror attack that was a determinant of how we worked. We face unprecedented humanitarian and refugee crises; the necessity – and, I would add, urgency – of supporting a fragile economic recovery in the European Union. We face market difficulties for many of our farmers and the debt crisis in Greece, and in that context we have come to a decision on the 2016 budget that is sound, focused on priorities and also makes use of the flexibility that has been built into the new multiannual financial framework (MFF), to a great degree thanks to Parliament. Let me very quickly give a presentation of the key points of this budget. With regard to commitments: with the EUR 155 billion we are some EUR 101 million above what we had proposed from the Commission. I am stressing this fact: that we actually went slightly above the proposal. This is a 3.2 increase compared to 2015. The two main blocs in commitments are support for investment growth in jobs, including for youth employment, and addressing the refugee crisis, where we have tripled funds for the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund, increased by 15% funds for the Internal Security Fund and increased significantly, by 20%, humanitarian aid as well as funds for the Neighbourhood Instrument. With regard to payments, it is very important to stress that we are working on implementing the payment plan agreed by the institutions and at the same time, directing the limited capacity for increase to where it matters the most. In terms of amounts, we have EUR 143.9 billion. This is an increase of 1.8% compared to the 2015 budget, and there we have an 11% increase for Heading 1a - Competitiveness for growth and jobs; a 57% increase for Heading 3 – Security and citizenship; and a 36% increase for Heading 4 – Global Europe. In other words, this is a budget where we walk our talk when we address priorities. Let me stress that there is a very strong commitment on the side of the Commission to monitor implementation, use money wisely and any possibility that might arise during the year to direct to priorities as they emerge. Finally, a word on margins. We have retained in this tight budget EUR 2.3 billion in commitments and EUR 1.9 billion in payments. Facing the uncertainties of tomorrow, we ought to have space to act. Finally, I want to recognise the staff of the Directorate-General for the Budget (DG BUDG) and other Commission services, Parliament’s staff who work on budgetary affairs, and also those who work on the budget in the Council.

The cuts proposed by the Council were thus avoided.  Many colleagues from the other groups see this result as a great success. I do not share this assessment. It is true that the draft provides that we have an increased budget approach to the unmistakable migration and refugee crisis – and that is right and important on the one hand. More importantly, however, we should finally develop a coherent approach in this area, which the Member States will then adhere to. In this way, we simply provide for more money without knowing how we can solve these problems in a sustainable way. We must work to help the people who live in Europe, but also those who want to come to us. We need a concept for this. Only with money alone will we solve these problems, we will not solve this crisis. My party has developed a comprehensive approach here, and we should work together on this basis to find a solution.  Irrespective of this, it has fallen short if we respond to crises only by wanting more money. Crises are also ideal times to pause and review a budget. What has proved its worth, what has not worked?  Take cohesion policy. It is intended to improve regions' competitiveness. We must also ask: has this result been adjusted? And if we see from the example of Greece that this is not the case, then we must also draw the right conclusions from it, but not simply always leave the budget lines as they are.

It is time to make the final assessment on whether the priorities have being followed correctly regarding the entire job done in the respective committees, plenary sessions and interinstitutional negotiations in the context of the existing economic situation and refugee crisis. In the 2016 budget, the overall level of commitment appropriations is set at EUR 155 billion, and payment appropriations at almost EUR 143.9 billion. This does not completely match Parliament’s position on the budget. Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction, because we reversed some cuts made by the Council. Furthermore, in implementation of the political priorities, we have achieved a budget that is even better in comparison with the draft proposed by the Commission. The increased appropriations and the mobilised EUR 1.5 billion within the flexibility instrument ensure more funding for migration, humanitarian aid, Horizon 2020, small and medium enterprises and Erasmus+.

Why, then, have I asked for a yes vote in our group? Because all of you — rapporteurs, Mrs Georgieva, Mr Gramegna — have worked well; because it contains some of the main demands of this Parliament; because it rushes almost all available margins; because it is the first budget of the new Commission, and neither the Commission nor Parliament are responsible for the narrow margin allowed by the current financial framework. We recorded some good news: the recovery of funds for H2020, COSME and Erasmus; contribution to international cooperation under heading 4; visible effort, but I fear that it is still insufficient, in the programmes for the refugee issue; with two unknowns that we must follow closely: the political commitment made to give maximum attention to the Youth Employment Initiative and the commitment to avoid reproducing the immense volume of late payments. This budget allows us to get closer to the two horizons we have raised to work a new budgetary logic for the European Union: the revision of the multiannual financial framework and the report of the working group which will give us results around the concept of 'own resources', a concept which now appears as sarcasm if we consider it from a European point of view. We must address these scenarios with three objectives: to have revenue from most of our own resources (\"No taxation without representation\"; move from programmes to policies with a spending budget in which the general interest dominates the distribution; and approach a global amount proportionate to the challenges we really face: open conflicts, migration, climate change, aging, social inequalities, and an increasingly endangered democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1815, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Jonathan Arnott", "mepid": "124958", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, this latest budget builds upon the work which went before it, carefully and methodically laying more paving slabs.

I could tinker around the edges and talk about space programmes or ridiculous political propaganda, issues which could be better done at national level than European level. There are so many things I could talk about. But I think, perhaps, it is better to respond in the other way and to actually address the elephant in the room – the extra EUR 1.5 billion for dealing with the migration crisis, frontloaded over the next couple of years, and which actually may well end up kicking the can down the line to a future budget at a time when resources are going to be even more stretched and creating more problems for the European Union. We are spending this money and it is leaving all sorts of contortions in other areas; we are spending it on a policy which fundamentally misunderstands the current crisis. It is a global problem which we are treating as a European problem. We warned back in April that a Commission change of policy would lead to the mass migration of people. And guess what? It has led to the mass movement of people. It has led to people trafficking, it has led to migrant deaths, and it has caused the problems in the Schengen area and security issues. Instead of bringing people ever closer, it is dividing still further. It is a policy which purports to be humane but actually leaves millions of the most vulnerable – the elderly, women and children – in refugee camps.

Madam President, the fact that we are discussing the budget today, the fact that an agreement has been reached on the budget is primarily due, without any exaggeration, to our two rapporteurs, Mr Fernandes and Mr Deprez, as well as to the wise and effective guidance of the chairman of our committee, Mr Arthuis, without downplaying the important contribution of Mrs Georgieva's Vice-President and the European Council. We have proved that by joining forces within the European Union we can succeed.  This budget can be recorded in the history of the budgets and of the European Parliament, as the budget which, under adverse economic conditions, with enormous emergencies arising from the refugee crisis, from Greece and other factors, has managed to preserve its social and development character, has managed to rescue programmes which are particularly accessible to European citizens, to the Member States. , businesses such as HORIZON 2020, Connecting Europe Facility, COSME. It has actually succeeded in balancing this budget with all the needs that have arisen, in order to make a proper allocation and in giving a truly successful project which I believe will be recorded as a great and important success.  But I must stress that what is a permanent enemy for the European Parliament is bureaucracy. We must finally prove that every euro that leaves the budget finally goes where it needs to go.

As a co-leader on the revision of the multi-year financial framework, however, I assure you that Parliament will continue the pressure. However, as you know, since or more accurately during the conciliation, there have been the attacks in Paris. The Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs met on Friday and announced a series of measures to combat terrorism: coordination of intelligence missions, perhaps in the form of agencies, border guards. But the 2016 budget does not give the means and we have already used almost all the instruments of flexibility.  So how do the Council and the Commission approach these new expenditures? How do they plan to fund them?

In my short intervention, I would like to focus on the importance of continuing the Youth Employment initiative, be it in its current form or in a revised form. My view is that it is crucial to send a signal to the European youth that they are still a priority for decision-makers at European level. Especially in these times, when we see that the lack of education and little prospect for jobs leads to radicalisation, we have to use all available instruments to secure a future for young people in Europe. In this sense I urge the Commission, as stated in the final conciliation text, to analyse the results of the Youth Employment initiative and to propose changes, if needed, so that this programme can continue until 2020. Youth unemployment still exists in Europe. The job is not yet done. The young people of Europe still need our help. Very briefly on migration: I very much welcome the fact that we succeeded in ensuring an adequate budget in Headings 3 and 4.

The Juncker Plan, the Youth Employment Initiative– a bottomless barrel in the form of a response to the migration crisis. This is called front loading – borrowing in the future – and that has implications for the budget in the future. A great challenge becomes review or revision. The sheer difference in vocabulary can be worrying. Reviewing or revising this perspective will decide whether we will accidentally survive this budgetary drama, which I remember in 2012-2014, which was linked to the maturation of multiannual programmes and at the same time a large lack of funding for them.

Citizens can expect jobs, support for science and innovation. I am pleased that 500 million are allocated to milk producers. Mobilising funds to tackle the refugee crisis through the instrument of flexibility is to be welcomed, as the terrorist attacks in Paris repeatedly show that Member States must join forces to protect citizens who, unfortunately, cannot feel safe at the moment. It can be seen that the 'open door principle' declared by some countries is discourseable. It is necessary to carry out immediate identification and return of immigrants if they do not qualify for refugee status. The protection of the European Union's external borders is now very important in order to prevent illegal immigration. The capacity of Frontex needs to be significantly strengthened. This must be one of our long-term priorities, which is also fores to be expected in the multiannual budget. Increasing funds for foreign policy is to be welcomed.

There is talk of a significant increase in youth employment programmes, but we have to realise that Erasmus+ represents a minimal part of the budget and that this 30% increase is unlikely to have much impact.  We also note that the European Parliament is committed to reducing around 179 jobs by 2019, 60 as early as next year.

Next year's payments amount to the EU's aggregate national income: the Commission proposes 0.98%, the Council goes down slightly to 0.97%, Parliament wants more 1%, the agreement is 0.98, which the Commission has tabled, and this is typical of each of the main lines, except for the issue of security and citizenship.

Three points in closure. Firstly, it is very important at a time of increased uncertainty that we have a budget that is agile, has a clear focus on priorities and is oriented towards impact and how to give the people the best value for the money they entrust us to manage on their behalf. That would require us to take the forthcoming mid-term review very seriously. This is our chance to strengthen the agility, focus and capacity of our budget, and also to look to the future as regards the kind of budget we would like to have next time around. Secondly, many of the speakers expressed a very understandable concern about the limited flexibility we have. But we still have some flexibility for next year; that is the contingency margin, if needed, of no more than EUR 4 billion. We have the contingency margin and, of course, we will only be using it if that is necessary. We will have the possibility towards the end of the year to use a global transfer; in other words, money that is not put to the best use. We should not rush headlong into using this option; we should try to keep it as a kind of cushion. Last but not least, we now have a chance to receive funds from our Member States, as assigned revenues for priorities that we all recognise are best addressed together. For this we have the Syria Trust Fund and the Africa Trust Fund, and we, the Commission, are proposing to provide the platform for addressing priorities in that manner. Thirdly, there was a question addressed to me: what is the Commission going to do in the long term to deal with the challenge of migration? This is one question that is not going to disappear. It was mentioned that climate change is upon us. The projections of the IPCC tell us that by 2025 there may be 100 million climate refugees. So, we have to direct our resources at tackling the problem at source and tackle the root causes that are causing the problem here in Europe. For this reason, we have refocused our development funds more on fragility – I also want to praise Prime Minister Cameron of the UK, who has recently announced that 50% of DFID funds will go to fragile countries. I think we need to do more where it matters the most: for the people affected, but also for our own security. Of course, we will have to invest more in the security of Europe. The Commission has promised to come up with a proposal on how we can strengthen external border controls, and that is an area where I believe that collectively we have a better chance to be successful than acting alone. Let me finish by thanking those who have made this budget miracle possible, and may we have it repeated next time around.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1846, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Pierre Gramegna", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Madam President, I would first like to thank all the speakers for their comments and contributions. I have registered a lot of support and I am delighted. I have also taken note of the criticisms and there have been a few, some of which were constructive and can be taken into account, it seems to me, I was going to say in next year's budget. But in fact, it's too late, I think it takes more agility. As the chair of the committee said, the first step will be to take into account the constructive criticism and emergencies that lie ahead in the coming weeks and months. As I did not do in my introductory speech, I would like to thank the key people in this negotiation. I will start with Jean Arthuis, who has shown great civic sense and a sense of priorities, and I thank him for that. I would like to thank Mr Fernandes, the rapporteur, José Manuel, who showed unwavering enthusiasm and was contagious. I would like to thank Gérard Deprez, who has shown humour and tenacity, to thank Mrs Gardiazabal, who has shown great pragmatism and, last but not least, Mr Gahler for his patience with all the agencies. Of course, Ms. G HYPERLINK \"https://www.google.com/search?rls=com.microsoft:en-GB:IE-Address&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=934&amp;q=georgieva+kristalina&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIqOrY56nJAhXCvQ8KHaNfChMQvwUIGSgA\" eorgieva Kristalina, Vice President, key figure, who has implemented much of her energy and talent. At the same time, I think it has innovated in terms of the method used, showing a lot of transparency about its objectives and the numbers. As a result, we have been able to accelerate the negotiation and I think it has set the stage for an excellent precedent for years to come. I would not like to forget all those who work behind the scenes, whether in the Commission, in the European Parliament, as well as in the Presidency, our ambassador, permanent representative Christian Braun, and to my right, Amir Motahari, who had done a superb job of preparing in the budget committee. Thanks to all of you, we have been able to obtain, for the first time since the Lisbon Treaty, the unanimity of the Member States on this budget, which is very good news. I also hope that tomorrow, but it is up to you to decide, of course, we will see a large majority adopt this budget. That would be the greatest gift you could give to the chair, who has done a lot of work on it.  I will not go back to the priorities of the budget, we talked about it, and the three axes of the triangle that are solidarity on the one hand, employment and growth on the other, and thirdly, of course, fiscal prudence and the necessary room for manoeuvre. This is the magic triangle that we have managed to solve.  The atmosphere here seemed very good, I must say that it was excellent also in the conciliation committee. Since Mr Gahler asked me why I was not with you in the previous debate, I would just like to explain myself. You know that I wanted it very much because I was in the antechamber, but I was informed that you cannot win parliament and that you have to be invited. As I was not invited, I did not want to break with the courtesy and good habits as they exist. However, I would like to say to Mr Gahler and the other interested parties, that I have followed the debates very carefully, that the Luxembourg Presidency has done everything in its power to promote the work of the TAXE Committee. I myself received the TAXE Committee in Luxembourg in June, and she invited me to come and see her as President of the Council, which I also did in October, I even sent her written documentation and answers to her questions.  I understand that the work will continue, we are also available for that. A simple word, as President, on this subject: Luxembourg has made the issue of international taxation and the challenges in this area one of the priorities of its Presidency and on 6 October this year, at the Ecofin Council, we reached a political agreement on the automatic exchange of tax rulings, which was one of the main topics. Luxembourg has therefore tried to work in the interests of the European Union; Luxembourg is part of the solution, not part of the problem. Last point, and I end with the good atmosphere that prevailed among us, I welcome what Gérard Deprez has stressed, namely that we have succeeded in strengthening institutional loyalty by reaching an agreement on the reduction of staff in all institutions. We have found a compromise that seems to me to be perfectly acceptable, perhaps even unexpected. This I hope that it will continue, to strengthen itself in the months and years to come, and in this sense this budget could be a happy precedent which I hope will serve you in the many challenges that lie ahead, which are described with great enthusiasm and truthfulness by both The European Parliamentarians and the Commissioner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1847, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   Thank you, Minister, for your reply, and also for remittances to the hearing of a previous report, where you did miss Mr Minister, and your response here was reassuring.

Of course, we have not received the funding we had hoped for to continue the youth employment initiative, but an assessment will be made and we will draw the consequences immediately. This budget also includes pilot projects and I am pleased that one of them gives us the opportunity to accompany apprentices and allow them mobility as well as students.

Most of the additional resources, in line with the Hungarian Government's position, are spent in countries that are on the front lines of the migration crisis and contribute to the management of conflicts that reinforce the wave of immigration on their site, in the non-EU regions where they were created.

With the final vote, the EU budget for 2016 can provide the resources for the EUR 500 million milk rescue package, thus clearing all obstacles to the timely granting of EUR 2.9 billion to Hungarian dairy farmers.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks of 13 November have plunged Europe and the world into astonishment. I hope that we will have a thought for the victims and the families of the victims on the eve of the national funeral. Today, more than ever, we must be, we must act, we must respond to the level of our responsibilities and the confidence that European citizens have given us.  The report, which we are debating this evening, should not divide us but should lead us to a consensus; not a soft consensus, not a consensus of ease but a consensus on the necessary awareness to fight firmly against the barbarism and terrorism that is now in our midst.  The measures proposed in this report help to tighten the net, to close the noose on barbarians who take advantage of our rule of law and our universal values that they know so well, since they were born in Europe and lived in Europe, and which they absolutely wish to destroy.  No excuse, no mitigating circumstances, no good feeling should actually take place in the face of these criminals. Failing that, we will have to answer to our countrymen for our weakness and cowardice. The main measures proposed, which were adopted in the committee on 19 October, are, first of all, the criminal responsibility of the internet giants. The Internet has become the first virtual training camp for these radical terrorists with videos and quasi-Hollywood sites inciting hatred, barbarism, terrorism and crime. Prison, another place of radicalization on which we have for too long turned a blind eye, thinking that those who were radicalized turned to the faith. Yes, they turned to the faith of horror. This blindness led to the training, the recruitment of barbarians, thus preparing them to become time bombs, once released. Fighting terrorism also means fighting against its financing. Today, we must denounce all those foreign countries that pour their money without control or transparency in favour of structures, places of worship, unofficial or official, associations, for the benefit of self-proclaimed imams, all on the territory of the European Union. Gradually, they destroyed our values, deconstructed individuals who became the enemies of our countries, where they were born and where they lived. The enemy today is no longer external, it is inside and we were responsible for the creation of these monsters.  Secondly, with regard to the control of the movements of individuals reported, monitored or radicalised, the European PNR as an intra-European is now necessary. The terrorists of the Paris attacks could have been more easily located and we could have known the extent of their network that led them to commit the carnage last Friday; as indeed, but this is not enough, the systematic checks at the European Union's borders which must be put in place quickly; such as the return of the jihadists, who must be arrested, detained as soon as they return.  These measures are not exhaustive and your amendments, ladies and gentlemen, of course are welcome. But even if adopted, this report will only have an effect if the European Commission and the Council agree to implement these measures. Then take responsibility. The european citizens are watching us and expect a lot from us. Let's live up to their expectations, otherwise we'll pay a lot more. In this respect, I call the attention of our Socialist colleagues, since irresponsible amendments - and I am weighing my words - have been tabled, such as the refusal of control at the borders of the European Union to avoid the control of migrants even though terrorists have infiltrated as migrants. If we falter in the face of this, if we do not put this control in place, it will be an insult to the memory of the victims of the attacks of January and November 13.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1856, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, in the aftermath of the tragic events in Paris and the developments in Brussels, we are all more than concerned. Our society is appalled by the terror that extremists are trying to poison us with. While we are still grieving for the innocent people who lost their lives in Paris, we cannot allow this to turn into a general psychosis. We cannot allow fear to prevail, because fear is also a threat. We cannot allow the terrorists to demoralise us and win, because terrorists target innocent people, but they also target our values and our way of life. We have been through this before, and we know that our strength is our unity and our resilience. Our only way forward is to act to prevent these actions from happening and to ensure the security of our citizens and our democracies. This report could not be more timely for our collective response to fighting terrorism and radicalisation. In these challenging times for Europe it is of crucial importance that the institutions of our Union see eye to eye on the way ahead. The European Agenda on Security, adopted in April this year, set out the principles and key actions in this area. This agenda is the reason why we are not just reacting to events now. We are implementing and accelerating the actions we already had in the pipeline to strengthen our resilience to terror. An important example of one such action is the crucial new rules to control firearms that we proposed just last week. I will very soon come forward with an action plan on their trafficking as well. However, let me start with our work on prevention. Our strongest partner and guarantor for the delivery of effective preventive measures is the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN). More than 2 000 local practitioners with different backgrounds from all over Europe are working on addressing the root causes of radicalisation. Since the year 2011, the RAN has produced policy recommendations as well as practical guidance and training material to better prevent and address radicalisation, on schools and the prison and probation environment, on the foreign terrorist fighter phenomenon, and on the development of counter-narratives. The RAN has now been reinforced with a centre of excellence, which has been up and running since 1 October 2015 and which will support the RAN and help it expand its reach further, even to priority third countries such as the Middle East, North Africa and the Western Balkans. Many of the perpetrators of these vicious acts are EU citizens, born and bred in our societies. This means that our work has to start right here in our countries, in our societies and in our neighbourhoods. Let me now refer to the abuse of the internet and social media for terrorist purposes. We have started our engagement with the industry, and I will formally launch the EU Internet Forum on 3 December. I can inform you today that I will personally invite the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to attend. I expect this partnership with the industry to lead to concrete outcomes in preventing and countering radicalisation leading to violent extremism. One of the key goals of this forum is to improve our cooperation in removing terrorist material that may push our youth towards radicalisation. The EU Internet Referral Unit, established within Europol, is instrumental and very helpful in this regard. It can build on the expertise of the European Cybercrime Centre within Europol, which has many years of experience in dealing with illegal content. So we are by no means starting from zero. In this context, I welcome the call to reinforce the mandate and resources of the European Cybercrime Centre to enable it to face these new challenges. Our inter-institutional discussions to finalise the Europol reform will also touch on this. The second priority is to support the development of effective counter-narratives. There is progress in this area, through initiatives such as the Syria Strategic Communication Task Force, which supports EU countries in developing messages and carrying out targeted communication campaigns. The Commission is both financially and politically supporting the continuation of this project. Today’s report touches on several other important elements that we are working on. We are working to improve evidence and intelligence-sharing across the European Union, in full respect – as is obvious – of fundamental rights. As a matter of priority, we will look into all available options to strengthen our tools against terrorist financing. This includes measures for freezing terrorist assets. I will very soon propose a directive to strengthen our framework on the criminalisation of terrorist offences, particularly travel with a terrorist purpose and terrorist financing. This is how we will tackle the problem of foreign terrorist fighters. I will also soon report on the implementation of the Commission’s Communication on the prevention of radicalisation. I hope that we will continue our constructive dialogue on matters of security and, more specifically, the pending proposals and envisaged initiatives. We will need your full support and engagement on the difficult way ahead. Europe needs to be united and to defend its values with the necessary rigour. You are well aware of the ongoing work on different counter-terrorism measures. We will discuss this in detail tomorrow and will have other opportunities to do so. Today, our discussion has focused on counter—radicalisation. It has focused specifically on one of the root causes of the problem, and this is where the solution should come from as well. This report will serve as a basis for a continued exchange of views about our prevention policy.

Increasingly – perhaps fooled by the belief that Europe had truly entered into a time of a perpetual peace – it appears that some of our governments are beginning to fail to live up to these primary duties. Addressing this problem will require tough and difficult decisions from Member States. The Dati report offers a balanced and sensitive approach to what is a very divisive and politically charged subject. Whilst commitments in the report to initiatives such as the EU PNR Directive are welcome, a more robust and all-encompassing overall strategy is clearly now needed as well. There is a growing sense, especially as many of the factors affecting radicalisation are often outside of the control of the state, that there is a need to move away from the ideal of preventing radicalisation and instead towards a proactive security policy of managing radicalisation, including asking difficult questions on the financial role played by countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1858, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   I would like to ask my fellow Members, on the one hand, to keep the timeframe and, on the other hand, to speak a little slower, because there are difficulties in translating.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1859, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Ангел Джамбазки", "mepid": "124873", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. – Dear Colleagues, many things can and will be said on this undeniably most up-to-date topic, but without urgent measures, we will not achieve any visible results.

Over the past few weeks, all of us European citizens have witnessed the consequences of the radicalisation of European citizens who do not fit into the European Communities and their recruitment by terrorist groups and organisations. I have long warned, and it is no secret, about this problem and its dangerous spread throughout the European Union.

As a consequence, this means that the so-called soft factors must be taken into account in the same way as tough measures. For me, the so-called soft factors include essential things such as interreligious dialogue, intercultural dialogue. I also say it quite frankly to us: invite Muslims so that they are not excluded, so that young people who are Muslim feel at home and are integrated here. On the other hand, however, it must also be clear that hate speech and calls to crime – such as the chastisement of women, which is nothing more than beating women, which is a violation of human rights – or calls for murder and manslaughter, or then the websites or the dangers or Salafist scenes that captivate and indoctrinate young people, , so that they no longer feel any empathy, no longer have any sense of what their environment is ... We must protect young people from being banned by such perpetrators and extremists. We also need more research to do this. There is far too little research into how young people can be banned from such dangers in the first place.  In any case, it is not only poverty that is the reason, but it was engineers among them, they were people who came from the best of society and nevertheless became dangers and terrorists and went to Syria. We need to address these factors, even if we want to avoid radicalisation.

It is the result of intense collective work, in cooperation with the author, Rachida Dati, which I welcome. Thousands of young Europeans have left for Syria and Iraq to fight in the ranks of Daesh, which is neither state nor Islamic. But it is not, as some deceptively beckons, with the closing of borders or with a PNR directive that we will be able to stop their radicalisation and recruitment.  The fight is also political and ideological, and it is fought right here in Europe, within our societies, because the attackers in Paris - in January, as in November - were European, French and Belgian. And so it is essential that we fight back to fight inequalities, discrimination and social exclusion particularly acutely felt by migrant communities in neighbourhoods that we have left to turn into ghettos of despair and resentment, with 60% unemployment, like Molenbeek, in the heart of Europe, Brussels, now besieged by fear. Our collective security requires ending the destructive policy of blind austerity, which also explains why instead of having human resources and other enhanced means, police, intelligence services and magistrates are struggling with disabilities, and explains that prisons have become centres of radicalisation rather than rehabilitation of offenders. We need unity in the fight against the transnational terrorist threat. We need a political union, where our States share security information and police and judicial cooperation, and make joint planning and joint security risk assessment. We need a common foreign policy, European security and security and defence policy, as Syria, Iraq and Libya highlight.  Member States of the European Union must coordinate and attack arms trafficking, terrorist financing and organised crime, associated with the capacity of organisations such as Daesh and al-Qaeda, and cannot continue in \"business as usual\" mode with regard to governments and states where Daesh and al-Qaeda have found financiers and facilitators. International trade, including arms, and oil cannot be worth our silence.  The lesson to be learned from the attacks in Paris is that our governments must coordinate to stop the terrorist threat and understand that this is a coherent and European strategy. And that it will not be at the expense of fundamental rights and freedoms that we will overcome terrorism. Without rights we will never have security. Make no mistake who argues otherwise to drop data protection, citizens' privacy and other fundamental guarantees, or those who try to stigmatise Muslims and even refugees, who suffer at the hands of terrorists and therefore seek to flee here, where there are rights freedoms and guarantees.

But we know we have to work within the framework of the democratic values that we espouse and which are under attack, and not only from one direction – and I do not mean the pop group. The report makes it clear that terrorism is not the prerogative of any single religion, nationality or civilisation, and we also have to recognise at the moment that it is an international phenomenon. We can all agree, for example, that we need to radically improve the use of the intelligence information that we have, to tackle arms trafficking, and to track and disrupt terrorist financing. We will not all agree, it is clear, on the use of PNR. My Group’s concerns are well-known, and we feel that the millions of euros to be invested in the system could be better and more effectively spent, for example, on joint investigation teams within Europol, on delivering on the effective resourcing of EU agencies – as called for in Madam Dati’s report – such as CEPOL, EUROJUST and EUROPOL itself, or on offering further support to the RAN network. Parliament thoroughly agrees with the evaluation of the Commission there. We need to strengthen local capacity to combat violent extremism. In terms of prevention within our own communities, London’s Police Commissioner at the time of the London underground bombings recently said that national security depends on neighbourhood security. Community policing depends on trust from communities, so that people feel able and know how to report the unusual, the worrying and the suspicious. This is not going to happen when everyone from a particular social group is treated as a suspect and an outsider, or if every teacher and social worker is turned into a potential spy. The roles and responsibilities need to be clear and the funding streams different. Social cohesion is essential, and those who increase social division and push a style of community collective guilt for terrorist acts are certainly not providing solutions.

I prefer to stay inside my apartment instead of going out to a restaurant when I'm in Brussels. I'm worried about the whereabouts of my children. In my country, Sweden, we are very vulnerable to future attacks. With mass immigration, especially from countries with many IS supporters, we are at greater risk of being subjected to these horrific attacks. Especially since we barely know who we let into our country. This is because you decision-makers in here have only seen you blind to freedom of movement and an open Europe. With the migration that is now taking place to our countries, how can you even believe that we will be able to integrate all these people? After all, we cannot even give them a roof over their heads, let alone give them hope of a better life, with access to work and housing. This, my friends, leads too many of them to a life of exclusion, hopelessness and despair. It is precisely in situations like this that many of the young men are attracted to becoming radicalised. Now the rapporteur is talking about prevention – deradicalisation, investigations, etc.m. Perhaps the rapporteur should bear in mind that we are at an urgent stage. What should be done is to prevent more and more of these scum from entering European soil as quickly as possible.

And in this case, we must also find legal limits that will determine what is hate speech and what is not, and what measures to counter it. I am therefore pleased that the Commission wants to increase cooperation with the online sector and to remove terrorist and extremist content from their platforms. The police, on the other hand, should draw absolute legal consequences for those who promote violent extremism.

They are the same people who at every opportunity promoted the rise of Islamism, criminalised any reaction and stigmatised those who dared to say the obvious.  The perpetrators of the recent attacks were neither unemployed nor marginalised. One of them even worked in a public service in Belgium. Unemployment and marginalisation cannot in any way be a cause for what has happened. If that were the case, Greece, with almost 60% youth unemployment, would be nothing more than a huge terrorist camp.  These people chose to adopt extremism. The real reason is the acceptance of the sermons of extreme Islamism and the indation that takes place in some mosques, operating with or without the permission of the various governments of Europe, as well as the strong support of Saudi Arabia, which has the doctrine of ouachabism as its official religion.  If you really want to prevent the recruitment of new terrorists in Europe, close down any mosques that embrace such ideas.

I do not want to fall into the trivial temptation of the mathematical equation 'refugee = terrorist' but it is essential that in order to enter Europe controls must be strictly strengthened and that all people who migrate to our continent are registered. There can be no security waivers. To this I would add more stringent measures for the processing of online data, the closure of the PNR trialogue with the inclusion of intra-European flights, closer cooperation with social media companies and, not least, the swift conclusion of the reform of Europol.

In the preamble to this report, you say that radicalization should not be associated with a particular ideology or religion.

It is time to put an end to this angelism, the fight against Islamism cannot be done with green numbers or psychological follow-up sessions! It is time to take the necessary measures: close Salafist mosques and ban Islamist organizations; stripping dual nationals involved in jihadist networks of their nationality; give back real human and material resources to our police, our army, our customs and our intelligence services.  Finally, Commissioner, after a previous debate on terrorism in Europe, you dared to say: 'Schengen is not the problem, it is part of the solution'.

These are men, women and, above all, young European citizens of all social origins who have in common a feeling of break with society and who pose a threat to security in Europe as elsewhere. But the phenomenon of radicalisation and subsequent recruitment must be combated, in addition to repression, with effective prevention policies, establishing an intercultural dialogue with the different religious communities, strengthening the exchange of information between countries of the Union and aiming to target money laundering that finances criminal and terrorist networks.

Madam President, jihadist terrorism in Europe needs both political and ideological treatment. The close relationship between Daesh and Turkey is confirmed daily, as there is a growing number of reports in the international press demonstrating Turkey's support for the jihadists, not only in Syria, but also in Libya.  At the same time, Turkey's involvement in Syria exacerbates the crisis, because under the pretext of dealing with Daesh it is finally bombing the Kurds. It is worth noting that the jihadists have coverage from Turkey's secret services as it has been viewed by a video channel showing Turkish MIT doing business with the jihadists.  In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to point out once again the recent confirmation of Turkish involvement in the ship, loaded with weapons and bullets, heading for a jihadist enclave in Libya, having sailed from the Turkish coast until it was stopped by the port authorities of Crete.

In our collective effort to address this issue and to fight radicalisation, we must by all means avoid stigmatising any community, any ethnicity or origin, whether they are Muslims, refugees or migrants. As I said, and as many of you repeated, almost all the perpetrators of the recent attacks on European soil were home-grown, and religion – any religion – has nothing to do with their acts. Radicalism has. Fanaticism has. Hate has. Relating terrorism to migration is stirring up hatred and leads to a vicious circle.

I would also like to praise Mr Kirkhope’s intervention. I hope that common sense will prevail in our working together to face the common threats. To do this we have different means, on which the Commission has been working for months, to put at the disposal of all Member States: exchange of information, closer cooperation among law enforcement authorities and agencies, a stronger legal framework against terrorism and detection of terrorist threats, effective management of the external borders, stricter rules on firearms, and targeted cooperation with key third countries.

In the long term, the effective way to combat jihadism is not to censor the internet, but to show constant respect for international law, especially by large Western countries.

Europe is facing a different kind of threat – the phenomenon of ‘home-grown’ radicalisation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are indeed approaching this report in an extremely complicated context, since, as you all know, Europe is the victim of a massive importation of steel, in particular from Russia and especially from China, at prices that defy all competition. That is one of the questions I will ask the Commissioner later.  To put this debate in the current context, I recall that, in eleven months, the price of the slab has been halved. So you can imagine that some countries are now able to produce steel below cost prices. The report deals with the sustainable development of base metal production, and I wanted to give it this title to cut short all the fantasies of each other, and those who told us that we had to choose between industry and respect for the environment. I am very keen, through this report, to demonstrate that both are possible: to keep the industry strong on European territory, the production of base metals, while respecting the environment, of course. But to do that, you need the means, you have to invest. Since the 2008 crisis, However, Europe has suffered from a lack of investment, which has, in fact, an impact on competitiveness but also on the environment. This is what I would like Europe, which the European Parliament, on the eve of COP21, to be able to defend through urgent decisions, although Europe is the continent that continues to defend both the environment and industry.  I would just like to point out, to give you an idea, that to produce one tonne of steel in Europe, we emit two tonnes of CO2. The same tonne of steel produced on average in China emits three tonnes of CO2. Therefore, this is not about protectionism, it is just about fairness. Today, the situation is very serious. It is all the more serious because it can sound the death knell for our industry. I say it can sound the death knell for our industry. Today, if we look at the figures for China, we see that china has 350 million tonnes of steel production overcapacity. European consumption is equivalent to 170 million tonnes. Therefore, you can imagine that with the decline of the Chinese economy, this country will try, indeed, through a much more offensive policy, through dumping and public aid, to sell this overcapacity of steel production. The consequences, we know them: it is the closure of Redcar in Great Britain, it is several thousand job cuts at Tata Steel, it is several measures of partial unemployment announced all over France, Spain, Italy, etc.  The real substantive question that is being asked collectively to each other and which I am asking you, Mrs Bie-kowska, and I thank you for being here this evening, is: \"Do we still want an industry at European level?\" Because I'm telling you, it's a matter of life and death and you have to move very fast. It can go very fast. We don't have to wait six months or three months anymore, we have to take action as of January 1, 2016 if we want to keep this industry.  To sum up some of the strengths of my report, I do advocate using trade defence instruments in a somewhat more offensive way against anti-dumping measures, anti-subsidy measures. This measure of fairness is carbon adjustment at the borders, because there is no question of charging the right to pollute only European industrialists and turning a blind eye to all imports that come to us from elsewhere. When I say elsewhere, it is China, Russia and Brazil. This is not just a target against Chinese steels. That is the possibility - because here too the industrialists tell us that they need visibility, especially in terms of energy contracts - that can be given to them to sign long-term contracts. Then, it is actually compensating for the indirect costs of CO2.  I would remind you that this report is not just that of Edward Martin, even though it bears my name. We visited ten European countries. Each time, we have met with business leaders, local elected officials, trade union organisations and NGOs and, with a few exceptions, everyone agrees that it is time for Europe to defend its industry more firmly today through these measures, which are shared by the collective as a whole. As recently as last week, IndustriAll, the European Federation of Metallurgical and Steel Trade Unions, effectively validated its support for the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1946, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you very much again for giving the Commission the opportunity to address Parliament on this extremely important topic of the European steel industry, which is also extremely important for us and for me personally. Let me start with the own-initiative report by Mr Martin on developing a sustainable European industry in base metals. The Commission welcomes the interest of the European Parliament and the work that has already been done. The report offers a very interesting perspective for the current debate on how to support the sector, something that is really vital for our economy. The report also highlights fundamental issues that have been at the centre of the Commission’s report. These include energy – including both energy supply and the design of the energy market – fair trade and climate policy, with a view to reducing emissions while taking competitiveness into account. It also gives some interesting proposals, and I can assure you we will think about them and try to come back to you with some solutions. These policy areas are also among the Commission’s top priorities and are included in our main initiatives like the Energy Union, the follow-up to the Trade and Investment Strategy and fostering a stronger and high-performing industrial base. The Commission created a high-level group on energy-intensive industries to tackle challenges together with all the stakeholders and Member States concerned. We look forward to continuing the dialogue with the European Parliament on the topic of the metal industries as well as on many related policies, which are also extremely important. I also wanted to mention that the Luxembourg Presidency has paid great attention to the metal industries and called an extraordinary Competitiveness Council on 9 November to discuss the specific situation of the steel industry. Let me now address the use of the trade defence instruments in the steel sector, which are the competence of Commissioner Malmström, but I am also very much involved in finding solutions in this area. To address the current crisis facing the European steel sector, the Commission is willing to use the trade defence instruments to the full legal extent. We will open an investigation into every product on which we received a complaint with sufficient evidence of dumping and subsidisation causing injury to our industry. In this context, the Commission is also willing to consider opening investigations based on the threat of injury. However, the legislative requirements for a case based on threat of injury are really demanding. There has only ever been one case in which measures were imposed on this basis, a case currently subject to court proceedings. The Commission is also ready to begin the registration of imports in investigations with a view to the retroactive application of duties where this is warranted and the legal standards are met. The registration of imports could ensure that the situation of the European industry does not further deteriorate. As regards opening cases, there is nothing to be gained from this time-wise, as it still requires the existence of sufficient evidence, and this can only be furnished by the industry. Trade defence action is triggered by applications from industry. This should remain the case, given that only industry is in a position to know the state of the market and the effects of imports. With regard to imposing measures more quickly, the most important step will be the agreement by the co-legislators on the Commission’s modernisation proposals, which are already on the table. Given that this is a legal process subject to scrutiny not only by the Member States but also by the courts – and in some instances the WTO – time is needed to ensure that any action taken is in line with the legislation and our international obligations.

In Europe, we have set a very noble, correct target of reducing CO2 emissions. At the same time, however, we are aware that in Europe we are in a world of competition, and perhaps this objective that we have set is somewhat at odds with our need to maintain our competitiveness in the world.  I will talk specifically about one industry: the steel industry. We know that the steel industry is not from clean industries. We know that. However, our steel industry employs a total of around 300 000 people in Europe, and in general we are the world's second largest producer after China. So if this industry becomes uncompetitive, we will also use steel when buying it from elsewhere.  The car industry, shipbuilding, building construction – steel is absolutely everywhere in our lives. So there is a request to the Commission, looking at what you are doing, particularly with the emissions trading scheme, to carefully weigh up the target of reducing CO2 emissions, as well as the need to keep European industry in Europe.

I believe that we all agree on the timing and importance of this document, both in the context of the current situation in the Member States and in the case of the revision of the ETS. High prices in Europe and dumping by third countries result in rapid deindustrialisation of the steel sector. The employment rate in this area decreased by 20% compared to 2007, and demand for steel produced in the European Union decreased by 28%. Ironically, Commissioner, many decades ago those who built the foundation of the European Union started with coal and steel. We risk very quickly, perhaps even during your term of office, to talk about steel that is no longer produced in the European Union and about coal that has already become history. The State aid compensation scheme for indirect costs has given rise to a new source of unfair competition in the European Union single market between producers whose activity is based on the massive use of electricity. I believe that this compensation should be harmonised and granted at European level in order to ensure a level playing field against global competitors and European producers, and to also ensure effective protection against carbon restresses. Steel is not, moreover, the only sector facing significant problems, several industrial sectors in the European Union are suffering from global overproduction, low prices and behaviour that distorts honest walking.

Demand for steel is still 25% below pre-crisis levels, yet Chinese exports have risen by 28% this year alone. Excess supply has flooded our markets, often sold at a loss. Many countries around the world have reacted to this threat, including the United States, India and Brazil. Sadly, the EU has not. This month’s meeting of EU Ministers, called by the UK Business Secretary Sajid Javid, showed strong agreement on the need to take concrete action. These problems also extend beyond the steel sector. Since 2007, despite rising demand for aluminium, 11 of the 24 smelters in the EU have shut down. EU climate policies are at fault here, hurting competitiveness, raising prices and ultimately driving industry out of Europe. I do not believe the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism proposed by Mr Martin in his report is the answer. I fear it will invite retaliation and encourage protectionism around the world. I suspect it would be as successful as extending the ETS to the airline sector proved to be. The steel sector now needs action, not proposals that have no prospect of success.

Mr President, I would like to thank the First of all, I would like to stress the importance of this report and thank you for the good cooperation, especially with the rapporteur. The base metal industry in Europe, especially the steel industry, is in a very critical state. A variety of factors contribute to the further decline in the competitiveness of this sector, while costs continue to rise. We must be aware of the seriousness of the situation and create a competitive environment for this sector in Europe. These include, in particular, driving the modernisation of industry in Europe, facilitating access to new markets, bringing about the completion of the Energy Union and using and modernising trade policy instruments. However, one of the most important challenges in the near future will be the reform of the European emissions trading system, which we are currently dealing with in Parliament. Here we face two difficult tasks: on the one hand, the fight against climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy, on the other hand, the competitiveness of the global market and the viability of our industry. However, I believe that we need to see these problems in a broader context and also to resolve them. In our view, this report is not the right instrument for this. We are currently at a critical stage with regard to ETS in particular. Firstly, the global climate summit in Paris begins next week, which I hope will finally lead to a breakthrough at international level. Secondly, the legislative process for reforming the fourth stage of the ETS is under way in Parliament. I therefore see major problems with a report such as this, which both contains detailed reform proposals for ETS and calls for alternative instruments such as CO2 frontier levies, although these are clearly not desired by industry. Instead of creating even more confusion in an already difficult situation, we should concentrate on the essentials: the legislative implementation of a functioning ETS reform in a separate report and the strengthening of competitiveness for the industry of base metals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1951, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Paloma López Bermejo", "mepid": "125047", "text": "  GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, thank you to the rapporteur for the work and cooperation we have been able to maintain. The metal industry is a strategic sector whose problems are those of the European industry as a whole. We need an industry that minimizes its environmental impact, that dumps territories and is capable of generating quality employment. To this end, the European Union must develop a real industrial policy that does not take competition policy as dogma but implements it in favour of the cohesion and employment objectives set out in the Treaties. Public investment and planning are necessary for European regions to maintain their industry and not to be abandoned to seasonal and speculative sectors. It is also essential for emission reduction that a global regulatory framework be developed and environmental dumping is fought, and that mass deind industrialization of traditional production areas in Europe be prevented from being used for production expansion in countries with lower emissions and labour rights standards. The metal sector is central to Europe and has a great future ahead of it with the right technological innovation, which makes us the cleanest industry in the world, the development of recycling and the circular economy in reconversion industrial areas, and improvements in energy efficiency. Only a real future-oriented economy can help overcome the present crisis and create quality jobs.

Frankly, neither climate policy nor the general electricity prices in Europe are a problem today for the steel industry. British prices for electricity are twice as high as in Germany and in Scandinavia: twice as high. This has much more to do with splendid isolation and the fact that the British market is not interconnected with Europe, because in Scandinavia and in Germany power prices are much lower. So we should stop blaming the European climate and energy policy. The problem we have in Europe with steel is that demand has broken down. That has to do with the Lehman Brothers crisis and our overstretched austerity politics in Europe. When people buy fewer goods, when we underinvest in infrastructure, then we do not create a steep demand for steel, and that is the problem. We have to have a reinvestment strategy for Europe. The second issue is then, of course, how we deal with China and its huge overcapacity. The question to the Commission, but also I think to our British colleagues, is: who is advocating giving China market economy status? The Commission wants to give it, Cameron wants to give it, but then the question is: how do we organise anti-dumping if we give market status to the Chinese economy?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1953, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "David Borrelli", "mepid": "124796", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Martin, for his work and for his commitment to the drafting of the report on the European base metals industry. I am pleased to see in the final text the reference to harmonisation of indirect costs at European level. I am also pleased with the reference to environmental protection, compliance with occupational safety and hygiene directives and increased attention to local populations.  However, the European steel industry is asking us to take immediate action, especially to take measures against imports from China which, with a production overcapacity of 340 million tonnes, is invading the European market at rock-bottom prices. The conclusions of the Competitiveness Council of 9 November are not satisfactory. That is also why I have tabled an oral question to the European Commission asking what it intends to do in the immediate future and whether it is considering taking timely action, such as implementing countermeasures based on consumption and the actual amount of CO2 emitted during production. These measures would be fully compatible with European industrial, trade and climate policies and could immediately ensure greater global competitiveness. It must be clear that the European Parliament is seriously concerned about the devastating consequences that any recognition of China's market economy status would have on European industry, particularly manufacturing industry. We talk about steel, wood, glass, chemistry, textiles, footwear, ceramics, paper, bicycles and more. I therefore call for the Committees on Industry and International Trade to be regularly involved in this debate from now on. We are opposed to unconditional and automatic recognition, because it is clear that China does not meet the five criteria laid down by the European Union, such as the absence of state intervention in business privatisation operations and the existence of a state-independent financial sector.

Voestalpine has an annual turnover of 11.2 billion euros, employs 47,500 people, 23,000 of them in Austria, and has already invested 550 million euros this year in the construction of a direct reduction plant in Texas. A further 25 billion euros will be invested in new locations in the USA and Asia by 2020. In other words, strategic growth has long been taking place outside Europe. And here Voest is representative of many steel companies in Europe. The Chairman of the Board of Management gives clear reasons. These are: excessive climate and energy policies in the EU, high energy costs and high labour costs. As recently as September, a study by the renowned Economic Policy Institute showed that up to 3.5 million jobs are at risk as a rising number of jobs from the deindustrialisation of Europe. High energy and labour costs, increasing shortages of skilled workers, a weak economy in Europe and highly subsidized Chinese cheap steel are endangering Austria's production location.

I would ask you to show a great deal of ambition and not to wait for complaints from individual companies, but to be very active in the anti-dumping policy and at the same time to be very ambitious with regard to climate policy and energy policy.

Unilateral protectionism at the border is always dangerous.

The metal industry sector is very important in Europe – particularly in some European regions, such as mine, Galicia – but this sector is currently facing serious threats to its competitiveness. I highlight, among them, the price of energy, generally higher in European countries than on other continents.  Other factors affecting this industry include the flight or relocation of industrial investments to third countries or, as has been said above, unfair competition from third countries through dumping or export subsidies. But we cannot afford for this base metals industry to disappear from Europe: the prosperity and employment of Europeans would be badly undermined.

I ask you, Commissioner, to examine with the greatest attention, to analyse this proposal, this battery of measures from the report which we will adopt tomorrow.  Of course, the price of energy is a key sector. I am thinking, for example, of the production of aluminum.

Europe cannot be a continent dependent on external production. It would be weak without its excellence and fragile, because it is at the mercy of the external powers.  We have already known the process of deindustrialisation and relocation. It has affected us, it has impoverished employment and productivity, it has reduced our GDP. Now is the time to open our eyes and react, leading a new process of defence and equity of the sustainable production system in the global reality, starting with the most complex and strategic sectors such as steel, and I thank Mr Martin very much for this work. Increasing and often unfair non-European competition, I would sometimes like to say with illegal practices, lack of investment in innovation and production, lack of access to raw materials, rising and anticompetitive energy prices and environmental sustainability are the main challenges for the sector.  If we want to talk to each other clearly, the things to do are quite obvious, and also the things not to do. Europe must be proud of its steel industry: it must defend it with innovation measures, with energy policies for supply and prices, but also with stronger trade policies. Martin used a brave word \"aggressive\": I would also like to say aggressive.

It happens that basic metallurgical processes are moving from Europe to emerging countries along with greenhouse gas emissions, emerging countries that are not subject to European standards. In contrast, countries in Europe are increasingly importing intermediate steel and aluminium products, reporting reductions in greenhouse gases.

I think we need to have this debate right now. 328,000 jobs are directly linked to this industry and they are at massive risk. The crisis in the sector can be summed up almost in one word: overcapacity. When up to 350 million tonnes of mainly Chinese cheap steel enter the world market, there is little room for competition.  In order to support the European steel industry, we need to use three levers. Firstly, industry needs a reliable legal framework. That is why we must ensure clarity at the highest speed with regard to the reform of emissions trading and the design of the carbon leakage list.  Secondly, China is not a market economy. As long as the People's Republic does not meet the five criteria set out in the EU definition, it cannot be recognised as a market economy. Article 15d of the WTO Accession Protocol also supports this argument. Thirdly, the crisis must not lead to a downward spiral – with a one-sided focus on austerity and plant closures. If know-how emigrates and no longer invests in innovation, we have no chance of competing in global competition. The EU can support this by applying a set of measures, some of which were also addressed by the Competitiveness Council on 9/11: the EFSE, the exploitation of the revised aid guidelines, the rapid development of the Energy Union and the consistent application of modernised procurement law for the purchase of sustainable steel.

The result will be further deindustrialisation of Europe, loss of experience and professionals, and the abandonment of advanced scientific research, and yet steel blanks, anti-corrosion-coated thin sheets, thick sheets, wires and rods are the basic material material of all material production – that is, the production of cars, washing machines, refrigerators, etc. It is also worth considering the rapporteur's proposal to respond already at The Union's borders to dumped prices of metallurgical products, as the ways so far are insufficient.  On the other hand, the Commission's assumption that the smelting of steel scrap can replace primary metallurgy is extremely naïve, due to a lack of technological knowledge. Steel contaminants, especially copper, increase with each melt cycle. High-quality steel products require a full production cycle in one process string, and also the so-called process heat is saved, which cannot be done when importing raw steel ingots.

Firstly, I want to say very strongly that we need strong European industry. We need a strong European steel industry. We need strong, modernised and innovative European industry, and this is the basis for all of our actions. Of course, the steel sector that we are talking about today is a really broad economic issue. It has to be tackled both on the national and the European level. You are right that price differences are really extreme in the Member States. However, Member States have to deal with energy taxation, and what some of you were mentioning is true. Industry needs stable energy prices, and we are working on this not only in the energy market union strategy but also in all of the documents and actions that I am taking. I also agree that we need a massive effort to support the modernisation of European industry. Everything shows that we really must not – and it would be stupid if we did – become dependent on steel from outside of the EU. We need a much stronger anti-dumping policy, but I also have to mention that we are today using trade defence instruments – for example, steel anti—dumping and anti-subsidy measures, registration of imports, threat of industry – but we have to be very much stronger and very much focused on this. I am quite sure that if the steel industry – or any other industry – disappears from Europe, then research, development and innovation expenditure will follow, and then the services will follow. So we have to do all that we can, together with the Member States, to keep them in Europe. As regards giving China free market status, I know that the issue is very sensitive and that we have to be very careful about it. This topic is now under legal analysis. The debate in the college has not started yet. I repeat: I will be very careful about it. I am fully aware that it will have a major negative impact on industry in all sectors, so we will have to carefully balance, in the College, geopolitical considerations with our industrial interest. We are currently implementing a lot of measures from the steel action plan. We will keep you updated on this, but we are also analysing the state of implementation in the context of the High Level Group. The next meeting of the High Level Group on Energy-Intensive Industries is foreseen for 18 December – in a few weeks’ time – and it will be an occasion to discuss the issues raised today during the debate and by Mr Martin’s report on the base metals industry, as well as the use of the trade defence instruments. We really have to study very carefully the proposals included in the report, and we will do so. I also want to mention our finishing work on the circular economy package. I am responsible for this, together with Commissioner Vella. Adoption by the College is foreseen for 2 December. One of the actions will concentrate on secondary raw materials. I think it is important to let you know that we also have a lot of things related to the steel industry in this package. We have to make more use of our secondary raw materials, and we have to make full use of recycled metal. This, I hope, will help our industry to produce at lower cost. In line with the conclusions of the Extraordinary Competitiveness Council on Steel of 9 November, I will convene a special high-level stakeholder conference. We should address at this conference, with all of the stakeholders, the very critical issues such as investment – including the role which the investment plan will play in these sectors – energy, the circular economy package, trade and, last but not least, research and development, in order to secure the future of our industry. I am very eager to use all possible tools that we have. I will try to coordinate the use of them.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this very rich debate. I will try to speak softly, but I would have to be given a few more seconds, please.  I've heard some some implausible things. I would just like to point out that, since 2008 - and it is not Mr Tajani who will contradict me - Europe has paid a heavy burden on the steel crisis. We have closed the equivalent of 40 million tonnes of production. Forty million tons! I repeat: \"Do we still want to keep the 170 million tons?\"  But in this report we are not just talking about steel, even though we are facing a steel crisis, it has been pointed out; we are talking about aluminum, copper, zinc, etc. These are all metals that are essential to our economy. I was also surprised to hear a few colleagues, including Mr Fox- it is a pity, he has already left - saying that carbon adjustment at borders was not a good answer. Others said that it was almost a protectionist measure and therefore did not want it. I will be very clear: if we do not accept carbon adjustment at borders, we will indeed take protectionist measures, but we will protect others. We will protect India, China, Russia, Brazil, etc. Because what is carbon adjustment at borders? It is not a tax, it is the idea of the polluter pays. Can you imagine, a few weeks before COP21, we Europeans are going to send the following message: will pollution only be paid for by European productions? Polluters outside the European Union will be exempt from paying for their pollution as well. That is the message we are sending.  Do we want to take it collectively? I don't!  I will conclude by simply saying that now the ball is in the court of my colleagues, of the rest of us. We will be voting very soon. Therefore, everyone will have to take responsibility and choose their vote.

At the same time, policies to decarbonise the economy impose a burden of additional carbon costs and high energy prices, which worsens the competitiveness of this industry. Taking into account the huge production overcapacity in third countries and the dumping of foreign players, the trends become even more gloomy. Decisive action is needed to prevent a new EU external dependence on steel and base metals. The fight against climate change must be crowned in Paris by establishing a common environmental regime to reduce emissions in order to prevent the phenomenon of carbon emissions shifting outside the EU.

Mr President! Occupational safety and health is one of the areas where the EU makes a noticeable and positive difference to ordinary people across Europe. There is a need to address both new and existing risks. Every year, more than 150 000 people die as a result of work-related illnesses and accidents, and millions of people suffer from musculoskeletal disorders, mental health problems, the consequences of asbestos and a sea of suffering as a result of their work. This is not a good situation for workers, businesses or the slunks of the Treasuries. In the process of debating the report, I have also seen a very positive attitude towards all these rules across political divides in this House. I would therefore also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their very good cooperation on this report. There are many good reasons to be ambitious when it comes to the working environment. In the long run, there is no doubt that we all win through an ambitious approach. Workers are becoming more productive, which is obviously beneficial to themselves and to the companies they work for. Older workers are not involuntarily forced out of the labour market because of ill health and national social security systems are becoming more sustainable. And last but certainly not least, we can help the millions of European workers who suffer from a poor working environment. In fact, I think that the Commission has done a good job of identifying a large part of the risks that we need to address. However, if these risks are to be addressed, concrete action is of course necessary. On the other hand, I think that the Commission has been a little more restrained in recent years. However, To my great satisfaction, I have also noticed that Mrs Thyssen has a strong focus on the importance of this area.  First of all, there is a need for much better protection for European workers against exposure to carcinogens. That is why we want more binding occupational exposure limit values to be added so that we can reduce the number of work-related cancers. Secondly, it is necessary to present a proposal for a comprehensive action on musculoskeletal disorders, so that we ensure a more effective prevention of the causes of these disorders. We also need to start paying more attention to the changing forms of work and new technologies that characterise the European labour market. In particular, we know that precarious work is too often associated with negative consequences for the working environment of employees, just as posted workers are too often treated worse than their counterparts in the countries in which they will work. That is why more needs to be done and for the kinds of precarious work that we cannot be served by to be put to an account. Unfortunately, asbestos is still a major problem in Europe. To take a frightening example, we now see in Denmark, where I come from, women who have washed their spouse's work clothes are now suffering from mesothelioma. It is hardly clear how important it is that we ensure that these fates do not affect another generation in Europe. One final point I would like to highlight is the need to address psycho-social risks, which can, for example, result in stress, burn out and depression. The human consequences are enormous and the actual cost has just been made up.

In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Christensen, for putting forward such a rich and balanced report. This will definitely contribute to the successful implementation of the EU occupational safety and health (OSH) strategic framework. The Commission shares Parliament’s views on the importance of strengthening risk prevention policies and promoting a culture of prevention in all companies across Europe, irrespective of their size or area of activity. This is indeed about fundamental rights as well as competitiveness. In the Commission work programme for 2016, adopted on 27 October, we committed to reviewing the existing occupational health and safety legislation based on a detailed ex-post evaluation. Our ambition is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the European legislative framework for protecting workers while making the rules simpler and reducing regulatory burden and red tape, in particular for small and micro-enterprises. In addition, we need to enhance the protection of workers’ health and safety and reflect recent scientific advances. I share your sense of urgency on the fight against work-related cancer. We cannot stand by whilst hundreds of thousands of people per year die from work-related cancers. There are substances for which a decade ago we did not know yet that they cause cancers, but now, with what we do know, we need to act and to protect workers from being exposed to excessive doses at work. Mid-next year I intend to table a legislative proposal to extend the list of substances for which there are occupational exposure limits in place. European Union policy in this area, of course, goes beyond tabling new legislative initiatives. The report draws attention to a number of issues and formulates a number of recommendations on which I would like to comment in particular. First, I do share Parliament’s view on the importance of improving the implementation record of European and national occupational health and safety legislation, as only effective results on the ground can make a real difference for people in their daily working life. The report highlights the role of the EC Senior Labour Inspectors Committee as a platform for the exchange of information and collaboration between Member States and the importance of sufficient resources for labour inspectorates, but effective implementation and workplace compliance with OSH regulation and legislation is not only a responsibility of enforcement bodies. It is in the first place a common responsibility of employers and employees, and social partners too have an important role to play in the design and implementation of preventive measures. The tripartite European Occupational Safety and Health Agency is in Bilbao and is doing excellent work in promoting health and safety campaigns and supporting implementation through user-friendly tools, in particular for SMEs. I welcome Parliament’s support for this work. Secondly, I endorse the impetus that the report gives for more awareness of gender issues in health and safety, in line with the ILO Decent Work Agenda. The European Strategic Framework acknowledges that specific risks affecting women deserve particular attention and require targeted action. In this area also, the Bilbao Agency promotes the identification and exchange of good practice on ways to improve OSH conditions for women. Thirdly, I share your concerns about psychosocial risks in the workplace, including stress and depression. Report after report points to stress and depression as a growing cause of absenteeism and of what one has started to call ‘presentism’, a physical presence at work but sub-optimal output because of stress-related factors. The human and economic costs are enormous. One of the priority actions foreseen in the European OSH Strategic Framework is the identification and dissemination of good practice on preventing mental health problems. The Commission has recently published a new study on mental health in the workplace which provides practical guidance for workers and employers on how to deal with this issue. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work is active in this area, for example, with its pan-European awareness campaign on stress and psychosocial risks carried out in 2014 and 2015. The emergence of new risks does not mean that we should not continue to pay attention also to traditional health risks, such as the prevention of work-related muscular-skeletal disorders. We will pay particular attention to this in the context of our ongoing ex-post evaluation of the European legislative acquis and possible subsequent initiatives. As I have underlined before, my aim is to provide maximum protection on the ground in the most sensitive and sensible way. Last but not least, I would like to thank Parliament for its efforts to conclude the trilogues on the platform for the fight against undeclared work. I welcome the agreement found by the co-legislators and I do hope that the platform can start its work as soon as possible next year. As Parliament’s report on health and safety recalls, undeclared work unfortunately often brings with it also precarious health and safety conditions. Fighting undeclared work will thus also help us tackle some of the most dangerous and unhealthy working conditions. Let me assure you once again of the Commission’s commitment to high health and safety standards for workers in the European Union and to modernising and simplifying the rules with a view to adapting them to new developments and better implementation on the ground. I really do appreciate your support in this endeavour.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1993, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Biljana Borzan", "mepid": "112748", "text": "   Rapporteur for the opinion of the FEMM Committee. – Mr. President, as a occupational health specialist, I have often encountered poor working conditions. The economic crisis has worsened working conditions and it is important to include gender differences in the strategic framework for the coming period so that employers also take this dimension into risk management activities.  In society, there is a stereotype that women do less risky jobs resulting in fewer preventive measures. However, precisely because of their psychophysical peculiarity, role in society and household, women often get sick, primarily from musculoskeletal diseases.  The second most common problem is stress, often associated with sexual harassment. It is behind almost half of the working days lost each year, and its cost to society is valued at €240 billion a year.

We need additional data on psychosocial risks such as stress, depression, burnout, but also on new technologies such as nanotechnology and biotechnology, as well as on digitalisation and demographic change.

Currently we have 24 separate directives making up the occupational health and safety (OSH) acquis. In the UK, the Health and Safety Executive claims that simplification could help lift the admin burden on 220 000 SMEs, with no impact on health and safety protection.

Employees working in a safe and healthy environment will enjoy not only their lives but also their work, and thus they will be more productive. Therefore, investing in safety and health at the workplace is a win-win situation for both the employers and the employees. To achieve this we need clear and simple legislation and its enforcement. Today we have 24 directives which regulate this subject, yet the number of accidents and work-related diseases is extremely high. This discrepancy is mostly the result of red tape inherent in a heavy, overlapping and burdening legislation. It is undeniable that there are many work-related risks, both traditional and emerging, but I strongly believe that the focus should not be on adding new pieces of legislation to the pile of existing ones, thereby overloading the employers and resulting in the end in a very low level of compliance. 85% of European jobs are created by SMEs, yet they are the most encumbered by the legislation as it is today. Compliance requires allocation of resources, financial expertise and time—wise ones while trying to stay competitive and generate jobs. This status quo is counterproductive. Our emphasis as legislators should be on elaborating a simplified and efficient framework that is easy to understand and implement, that does not necessarily involve great financial costs for employers, and that is ultimately beneficial for employees, the economy and society as a whole.

The participation of workers cannot therefore be limited to declarations, but must be ensured at all levels of decision-making, from the level of the undertaking to the level of the State, levels at which workers' unions and social partners have direct and active participation.  New forms of work must also be taken seriously in the health and safety debate, in order to ensure that jobs are of quality and ensure both health and safety at work, as well as workers' social security, their permanent employment and their participation in collective bargaining and collective agreements.  Finally, we consider it a very positive development that Parliament's report makes no reference to the interconnection of life expectancy with work, which is unfortunately highlighted in the Commission's report.

The issue of health and safety at work is of paramount importance not only for workers themselves, but also for the eu market as a whole and for the competitiveness of European companies. In this situation, it is worrying that some Member States have still not ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 187 or are delaying the implementation of EU legislation in this area. To address these other problems, the European Commission has developed a strategic framework for health and safety at work for the period 2014-2020. Unfortunately, I am afraid that this strategy may not bring about a significant improvement in health in terms of accidents at work or health diseases, and these – I would like to remind you – cause the deaths of almost 20 000 Europeans a year.  If we want to achieve the europe 2020 targets and promote active ageing, real and effective action is needed. Without these measures, we cannot expect people over the age of 60 to continue to be able to function effectively in the labour market. Specific initiatives need to be taken at Union level in order to avoid that less protection of workers' health becomes an incentive to maintain the competitiveness of businesses in some Member States. Health and safety at work is also a major challenge in the context of flexible forms of employment, as so-called atypical forms of employment allow entrepreneurs to react efficiently to changing economic conditions and are an essential element of a modern economy.

Remember, every year workplace accidents cause more than 4,000 deaths and probably more than 150,000 life-threatening illnesses. In the face of these staggering figures, let us not give in to the temptation and ease of responding to our turn with other figures, that is, standards and quotas that would be added to those already existing. The results have shown that this policy is disconnected from reality and therefore ineffective. Some policies put in place by Member States are proving to be more job-destroying than protective of workers. Indeed, certain rules are unenforceable and represent a brake on entrepreneurship and thus on the economy and employment. I will cite the French example of the penalty account, a real gas plant that cannot be worked.

Let us remember that job insecurity is one of the biggest problems, especially in the new Member States of the European Union, which has a negative impact on occupational safety and the rules associated with it. The European Commission needs to draw attention to the increased number of workers with chronic and long-term illnesses and are disabled in order to ensure an accessible and safe workplace. Measures to integrate and rehabilitate persons with disabilities should also be encouraged. It is for these reasons that the European Parliament should show more initiative on this important issue.

A healthy and satisfied worker is more efficient at work, and this also has a good impact on the company's productivity and competitiveness.

In this respect, I agree with you that a gender pension gap of 40% is entirely unacceptable. With a range from 4% to 46% in different countries across the European Union, it is clear that policies do make a difference. We must reform, and we must pursue equal-opportunity policy goals in several fields long before people reach pensionable age. We are already doing this, and I will take further action to that effect. Before the end of this year, we will present a strategic engagement on gender equality. This will establish an overall platform for European initiatives aimed at improving gender equality, including by addressing the underlying causes of the gender pension gap. As you know, in 2016 the Commission is to present a ‘new start for working parents and care-givers’ initiative to address the challenges of work/life balance and women’s under- representation in the labour market. We believe that such a new approach can bring benefits for all: for working parents and other care-givers who seek a better balance in their work and life commitments, and also for women in terms of supporting their participation in the labour market, allowing for greater sharing of care responsibilities between women and men, and strengthening gender equality. The consultation with the social partners and the open public consultation on these issues have been launched. Beyond improvements in leave arrangements, the initiative should aim to promote flexible work arrangements and affordable, good-quality care services, while removing tax and benefit-system disincentives for women to work. By addressing women’s lower labour-market participation and career breaks due to care responsibilities, the ‘new start’ initiative should also help to address the gaps in pension coverage and opportunities to build pension entitlements between women and men. The Commission is also undertaking a number of policy and awareness- raising measures to address the gender pay gap. In 2016, it plans to allocate EUR 4 million to Member States, under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, in order to raise awareness about the gender pension gap and its underlying reasons. As regards measuring the pension gap, we will continue our monitoring of gender differences in pension outcomes and pension adequacy. We have already agreed with Eurostat that the figures on the gender pension gap will be updated regularly. We will also continue our work with the Member States in the employment and social protection committees on methodologies, in particular to assess the extent of gender differences in pensions, and we will, of course, use various estimates and indicators of gender difference in our work on the European Semester. Here we will look at other key indicators such as the gender gap in old-age poverty. Data on the so-called gender pension gap derive from an indicator which the Commission asked its network of academic experts on gender equality to develop. The most recent data, based on an improved methodology, have been used in the 2015 Pension Adequacy Report, prepared with the Social Protection Committee. The pension gap indicator measures how prior gender differences in employment, pay, working hours and length of career have influenced the gender differences in current pension entitlements. To some extent, pension systems can alleviate the full impact of past gender differences in employment: care crediting, minimum and guaranteed pensions and survivor’s pensions all offer extra pension protection to women – and, of course, without these extra protection schemes, the gaps and the exposure to risks of poverty would be larger. Therefore, beyond improving gender equality in employment, we also need to preserve and improve these safeguards. To conclude on a positive note, I want to stress that, as a result of the steady increase in female employment rates in most Member States over the past three decades, the wider gender gaps in many countries are set to reduce, in some cases substantially. Yet unless we manage to eradicate gender differences in employment, they will continue to show up as gender gaps in pension provision. The Commission will therefore not merely continue to address the gender pension gap but will intensify its efforts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2022, "date": "2015-11-24.json", "name": "Agnieszka Kozłowska-Rajewicz", "mepid": "124889", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for It is extremely unfair for women to work out decent pensions unless they sacrifice their private lives. That is why I am very pleased, thank you for talking about the pension gap today. I would also like to thank you for all your declarations and initiatives that have already been taken, as well as those that are planned. Because the pension gap is a cumulative indicator of the inequalities that women experience in relation to their working lives as a result of their participation in the labour market. And as such, the cumulative inequality indicator is very good for assessing the effectiveness of equality policies and can, in my opinion, also be used in the European Semester.  The pension gap should be addressed by looking at its causes and not at the symptoms. And these reasons lie in women's participation in the labour market, because retirement is the result of seniority and earnings, so I would not look for reasons in pension systems, but would absolutely focus on women's participation in the labour market. And if we want higher pensions for women, then we need to enable women to work out such pensions, and I am not just thinking about reconciling roles, this work-life balance, but also the issue of educational pathways, so that they do not lead to sectoral segregation later on the labour market, as well as to the promotion path.

I hear that childcare should become better and more affordable, working hours should become more flexible and men should be given more incentives to participate in care, in family work. That's nice, but it doesn't solve the basic problem. Indeed, it is about wage differentials. We need to fix them. We also have to turn on other adjusting screws. We need binding action plans for equality between women and men in the labour market, we need reports on equal pay, and these must also be compulsory for employers.

The figures on the gender pay gap and the pension gap are really a cause for huge concern. In my own country, Ireland, the gender pay gap is just over 14%, the overall earnings gap between men and women is almost 35%, and the pension gap is 40%. Now those are shocking statistics, and I suppose the questions that we must answer here this evening are, first of all, how can we narrow the current pension gap and, secondly, what can we do to ensure that the pensions of those now in employment are adequate and sustainable? I was very pleased to hear you mention a number of possible solutions. For example, you mentioned survivors’ pensions and also the idea of minimum pensions or some kind of minimum income for those past retirement. I fully support those proposals. Earlier we had a debate on healthy workplaces and healthy workers, and we need to ensure that we maintain those workplaces, promote a good work-life balance and try to ensure flexible arrangements within working time so that, if people want to stay on working longer, they can. You specifically referred to credits for some kind of involuntary absence from work, whether that be for illness or for caring duties. I think we have a very fundamental question to answer at EU level and national level, and it is this: is it acceptable that those who take time off to care for those who need care will be condemned to a much greater risk of poverty in old age? In my view it is not acceptable, because society, as we have constructed it, relies on family and unpaid carers.

We know the pension gap results from the cumulative impact of factors, including the pay gap, but we must also acknowledge when we talk of preventative measures and tackling the gender pension gap that austerity policies are exacerbating, rather than reducing, this inequality. Policies implemented by successive Irish governments since 2008 have worsened the situation for women in Ireland. The government reduced pension entitlements for new employees in the public service, and specific sectors dominated by women – teaching and nursing – have been targeted by other measures, reducing their salaries and pensions. We also have one of the highest levels of low-paid jobs in the developed world, after the US, and more than 60% of low-paid jobs are held by women, a trend that we see across the European Union. Yet childcare costs are among the highest in the world, and more than 40% of the average wage in Ireland. This has the effect of entirely excluding some women from participating in the productive economy and forcing others into precarious low-paid jobs that prevent them from paying into any sort of pension scheme.

There is, as you said, discrimination in employment as soon as you enter the labour market, there is the issue of part-time work, which is not compensated at the time of the calculation of the pension, there are careers, which are related to maternity leave with maternity leave, but also parental leave which is not accessible in the same way for men , and so there are these inequalities. There are difficulties in reconciling private and work life, which require withdrawal from the labour market. There are also the women's sectors called poor sectors. We talked about the wage gap, but there is also the fact that in women's sectors there is no second and third pillars of pension that are constituted, so all of this actually leads to a situation where there is an impoverishment of women.

It would be right and fair to improve the social status of impoverished older women. This, too, should be open to the Commission.

The lower labour market position of women than men, the years spent at home with children and, in the over-64 age group, the lower level of education has also led to lower levels of pension than men. It is also a question of narrowing women's self-determination. When your own income is low, the possibilities also narrow. As we age, the need for care increases, but financial opportunities also restrict access to services in many Member States. Unfortunately, in addressing the pension gap, the Commission's and Parliament's tools are scarce. I encourage the Commission and the Member States to continue the debate on promoting equality between women and men. The best remedy is to address gender inecompetents in education. Family leave and family services also play an important role in enabling women to work – if day care is not arranged or expensive, it is natural that it is natural that it does not seem attractive to families to continue working for a mother after having a child. However, this is not in the interests of the mother, the child or society. An ageing Europe needs more manpower. The best abilities must be introduced into the labour market, regardless of gender. For example, the World Bank has calculated that restricting the participation of women in the labour market and in companies will slow down global economic growth.
