Those who knew him remember his dedication to the service of citizens and his great openness and listening skills. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our condolences and our closeness to the family and to the whole city of Danzin. A month ago, the cowardly attack on Europe's heart in Strasbourg cost the lives of Pascal Verden, Kamal Nagchband, Anupong Suebsamarn, Antonio Megalizzi and Barto Pedro Orent-Niedzielski. Unfortunately, we are once again crying out as victims of hatred, extremism and radicalisation in Europe. The European Union was born first of all to guarantee peace and combat all forms of violence, yet just a few months before the elections in May, we are seeing increasing tension in several Member States. There have been attacks on political representatives in the UK, Germany and Hungary in recent weeks. There have also been disturbing incidents of anti-Semitism in football stadiums, but it is not enough to condemn these incidents firmly, we need everyone to take responsibility. The debate between ideas and opinions, which is at the heart of democracy, must take place with respect for the adversary, who must never be turned into an enemy. All too often we have experienced how verbal violence can result in physical violence. We must have a different language, eliminating any incitement to hatred, which is not compatible with the model of peaceful coexistence of our Union. My appeal is for everyone to lower their tone, even on social media. The attack in Strasbourg shows that we cannot let our guard down. The European Parliament will continue to fight relentlessly against terrorism of all kinds and we will not forget any of the victims. This week, as many of you have requested, I will discuss with the Mayor of Strasbourg how we can pay tribute to the victims in December. As early as this evening, I will be proposing to the Bureau that our radio studio be named after the two journalists killed in the attack, Antonio Megalizzi and Barto Pedro Orent-Niedzielski.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has Today we are discussing measures to ensure the health of our 500 million citizens in Europe. Parliament's special committee has thoroughly scrutinised the EU's authorisation procedure for plant protection products. Protection for the user and the consumer was our highest priority in the preparation of the report now before us.  I grew up on a farm myself, i used pesticides when I was young, so I know how important the right application is and the importance of plant protection products for agriculture. At the same time, I want your and my children to continue to be able to eat fruit and vegetables from Europe without worry. Two questions have therefore been of particular concern to me during this special committee. Firstly, how do we continue to ensure that the food on the table in Europe is safe? Secondly, how do we ensure that our European farmers can produce these foods in the long term?  After nine months of thorough consideration, what have we found? Three times you can advise: that the EU's authorisation procedure is the strictest in the world! Good news. But the principle always applies: even the best can still improve. Our motto was therefore: evolution instead of revolution, development instead of overthrow. In order not to reinvent the wheel, our focus was therefore on three points: firstly, science, secondly, transparency and independence, and thirdly, innovation. Firstly, science. For me, it was and is crucial that the authorisation procedure is science-based. On such an important issue, scientific research is the be-all and end-all. In my view, interests or ideologies have no place here. This decision must not depend on day-to-day politics or emotion. Secondly, independence and transparency. It is crucial that the procedure remains independent and transparent. In future, therefore, the EU Commission, and no longer industry, will decide which Member State is responsible for testing an active substance. This strengthens the independence of the process. It also aims to increase public access to studies, while at the same time preserving the competitiveness of our European industry. Thirdly, innovation. I want to encourage innovation. New, more efficient products are the key to a more sustainable application. This must be supported by a smooth authorisation procedure. Allow me to take a brief look into the future: the way agriculture looks will once again be radically changed by digitalisation. It contributes to the farmer's need for less resources. We have to stay on the ball here. Conclusion: We in Parliament have dealt intensively with the European authorisation procedures for plant protection products. I am convinced that our recommendations will make our European authorisation procedure more efficient, transparent and robust. Why? We create a high level of protection for consumers and users. At the same time, we guarantee reliable processes for industry and agriculture and promote innovation. Let us launch these recommendations by a large majority on Wednesday. I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, Bart Staes, very warmly for the good cooperation and also for all the other shadow rapporteurs. I look forward to the vote on Wednesday and now the discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Bart Staes", "mepid": "4751", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, 1,070,865 citizens have asked us, through a European Citizens' Initiative, among other things, to look at the decision-making process on the authorisation of pesticides and to reform it. This report by the Union Special Committee on Pesticides admissions procedure shows that we take this question seriously. I am very satisfied with the result. It is essentially about restoring public confidence in our decision-making procedures. Citizens should be able to blindly trust that when we make a decision, it is done in the name of the public interest and not in the name of the private interest of private individuals, private organisations or industry. Here are some of the recommendations.  What Mr Lins, my co-rapporteur, said is true: we recognise that the current decision-making mechanism is one of the strictest in the world. However, improvements are possible, both on the regulation and on implementation. The basic principles are, firstly, the application of the precautionary principle and, secondly, ensuring that the decision-making procedure on pesticides is transparent, independent and objective. Only then will we be able to regain the trust of European citizens.  As far as glyphosate is concerned, our committee says that the controversy over this has not yet been resolved. We have not been able to resolve this in our committee, but that is why we are asking the Commission's scientific advisory mechanism – which has even offered this – to carry out a systematic evaluation of all available studies on the carcinogenic or potentially carcinogenic properties of glyphosate, so that a review of the current authorisation is necessary.  Transparency and independence. Transparency: we want to oblige the applicant to include all studies in the public register. We want to ensure access to that register for all citizens, so that they can consult all supporting data, all studies and in such a way that independent scientists can also check whether the correct procedures have been followed and the right conclusions have been drawn. We also ask the Member States and the Commission for full transparency when it comes to the functioning of the Standing Committee to which the Member States come to decisions. We want a transparent overview of the minutes. We want full disclosure of voting.  As far as independence is concerned, we as a committee want the applicant to no longer be allowed to designate the rapporteur Member State himself: only the Commission can do so. And only Those Member States which have sufficient technical scientific expertise, have the resources and also have internal procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest may be designated as rapporteur Member States. Moreover, we want sufficient resources to be provided for EFSA and ECHA in such a way that they can guarantee and guarantee full independence. We also ask Horizon to fund programmes for independent research into both the impact on human and animal health and the impact on the environment.  Finally, there is the problem of possible plagiarism. The fact that the rapporteur-Member State is taking over evaluations, copy-paste of the applicant, and which is reflected in the final report without attribution. We want this takeover of data to be done as little as possible. And if it happens at all, that it happens correctly and is also indicated as that.  In our report, particular attention is paid to the long-term effects, the ecotoxicological effects of pesticides, the impact on weak groups, cocktail use, the synergistic effects of pesticide use and multiple pesticides at the same time, and the cumulative effect.  In addition, we want the cut-off criteria of Article 5 to be applied unabated. We have found that this is not always the case. We also want to include the whole discussion about endocrine disruptors. We also want glyphosate not to be used in parks, public gardens, sports and recreation areas, school grounds, playgrounds and areas close to care facilities. Finally, Article 53 is the article providing for exceptions. This article is now widely used as a permanent exception. The exception should be exception, nothing more and nothing less. Finally, to Mrs Hazekamp of the GUE/NGL Group: we must apply the three V's in the field of animal testing.

However, while ensuring food safety remains an imperative, it is no longer sufficient in itself. Increasingly, citizens have concerns about how their food is produced, about the sustainability of the food system and about environmental protection. We can only meet these expectations if we come together, learn lessons from recent challenges and move forward in the interests of all citizens. In this context, I would like to thank your House for having set up this excellent Special Committee on the Union’s authorisation procedure for pesticides (PEST) last year, notably following the Commission’s report on the implementation of the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, the European Citizens’ Initiative and the debate on glyphosate. The Committee’s work is very important as we all aim to ensure transparency and an evidence—based food safety system, dispelling any doubts European citizens may have as to the neutrality of science, because the main challenge is how we can we guarantee that the science is excellent, perfect and neutral, and not biased. So I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the PEST Committee’s report with you today. This Special Committee was set up in December 2017, following the renewal of glyphosate’s approval for a further five years. Its mandate was to analyse the current EU system of approval for active substances and authorisation of plant protection products. It was also asked to identify areas for possible improvements. One of the key outcomes of the PEST Committee’s assessment is the need to restore trust in the EU system, in particular trust in the scientific evaluation of a substance and trust in the risk management phase. A high level of transparency is critical to this: firstly, making all studies used as a basis for risk assessment publicly available, and, secondly, the utmost transparency on discussions and positions held in the regulatory committee which decides which active substances to approve. I think that it is safe to say that we have come a long way since last year. The Commission’s proposal of April 2018 on the transparency and sustainability of EU risk assessment in the food chain aims to rebuild trust in the system. It addresses many of the PEST Committee’s recommendations, notably, firstly, transparency during risk assessment, secondly, the quality and reliability of studies, and, thirdly, improving risk communication. As I already stressed last December during our debate on the proposal for a revision of the General Food Law, European citizens have expressed in recent years such a clear and repeated demand for more transparency in the way risk assessments are conducted and I have been carefully listening to them and active since the beginning of my mandate on this issue. I have also carefully read the resolution on glyphosate that you voted on a year ago, where you stressed that the European Union’s authorisation procedure, including the scientific evaluation of substances, should be based only on published studies. I believe that it is through greater transparency that we will increase the confidence of citizens in the risk assessment system. Transparency can help us to avoid potential bias in science. It is crucial to improve trust in the EU evidence-based food safety system and in science in general. I am confident that, when adopted, this proposal will greatly help in this respect. On this proposal, I thank you once again for your plenary vote last month and for the constructive first trilogue, which I am pleased took place this afternoon. Given the importance of this issue for European citizens, I know you will work actively to make progress in the discussions with the Council to allow an agreement to be found in this legislative term. You can, of course, count on me and my services to work energetically with you to achieve this objective in our role as an honest broker, and I know that DG SANTE and the PEST Committee have had a very good collaboration in the whole period of building this report. This would allow the new Regulation to apply as soon as possible, including in the pesticides sector. But, even before this proposal, in the area of pesticides, I had taken a number of steps to increase citizens’ trust in the decision-making and risk management process. For the most sensitive files, such as glyphosate, neonicotinoids and endocrine disruptors, the Commission now has dedicated websites. These sites list all the different versions of the draft proposals and detailed minutes of the discussions held with Member States. Equally, the Commission receives a high number of requests for access to documents on pesticides. Since last April, all documents to which access is given have been made publicly available. In addition, with the proposal revising the Comitology Regulation, the Commission aims to increase voting transparency at the Appeal Committee level, making the votes of Member States’ representatives public. In its report, the PEST Committee rightly notes that the EU has one of the most stringent systems in the world to regulate pesticides, but that, of course, it needs to be improved. I agree. There is no such thing as a perfect system. It is always possible to improve procedures to approve active substances and authorisations of plant protection products. With this in mind, we are currently carrying out a Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT) to evaluate our pesticide legislation. This includes both the Regulation on Plant Protection Products and the Regulation on Pesticide Residues and will soon be finalised. Its objective is to identify areas where improvements are needed. I want to take this opportunity to welcome the Parliament’s focus on this issue. In addition to the PEST Committee’s forthcoming report, the Member of the European Parliament, Pavel Poc, has also examined the implementation of the Plant Protection Regulation and the Parliament’s research services have already produced a study on this topic. We also have the Scientific Advice Mechanism’s (SAM) opinion on pesticides and the findings of the audits conducted by the Commission services in the Member States. Please be assured that all of these outputs will feed into the Commission’s analysis as we move ahead, and the PEST Committee report will provide valuable input for this exercise. While improvements within the current legal framework can be put in place swiftly, given the timing it will be for the next Commission to decide whether to propose changes to the legislation that ultimately would have to be adopted by the Parliament and Council. To conclude, I would like to stress that we all share the same goal: to maintain food safety, protect citizens’, animals’ and plants’ health, and to safeguard the environment. I want to thank you once again for the PEST Committee’s engagement and the valuable work undertaken by the PEST Committee and your House. In particular, I would to thank the Chair, Mr Andrieu, the Vice-Chairs, the co-rapporteurs, Mr Lins and Mr Staes, as well as the shadow rapporteurs. I look forward to the final adoption of the report on Wednesday and I assure you once again that all your precise, detailed and specific conclusions will be duly taken on board. We will continue to work tirelessly on increasing transparency, building trust and improving the sustainability of our food safety system.

In committee we have been working for months, listening to the experts and analysing the procedures for the authorisation of pesticides, both the Community and those of the Member States. I understand and share the objectives of transparency, of ensuring the level of protection of human health, increasing consumer confidence or reducing administrative burdens. However, the results of scientific opinions must be avoided from being questioned on the basis of ideological factors that condition the capacity for innovation and competitiveness. Due to the increasing mediatization of pesticide decision-making, this debate needs to be translated into the technical and scientific field. Decisions on pesticides should be made solely and exclusively by scientific criteria, without political and ideological interference. I would like to point out – as a person of contact with Parliament and EFSA – that this agency is independent and scientifically irreproachable, and that its work is in full application of the regulation in force. But it should not be forgotten that the procedure used by the Union to authorise plant protection products is one of the strictest in the world. What happens is that zero risk does not exist, and the use of these products also carries their risks, which can always be minimized; and I'm talking about dosages, the time of application or the application procedure. In conclusion, Commissioner, I think it would be very interesting for the Commission to prepare a communication with a view to talking and discussing the revision of legislation on plant protection products, in order to unify criteria and approve risk analysis procedures.

The report, which has already been voted on by a large majority in committee, has in fact sought to respond clearly to the millions of citizens who in recent years have raised the lack of transparency of the system, through the Stop Glyphosate initiative. In order to ensure the confidence of the whole system and to ensure that the protection of human health and the environment are the main objectives of EU legislation, the essential points we have fought for are, first of all, transparency, independence and the absence of conflicts of interest in EFSA's scientific panels. We have provided that each member will have to submit a declaration of interest. Secondly, the allocation of sufficient financial resources to the risk assessment authorities and, finally, appropriate expertise for the approval process. The final report covers a number of other aspects that have already been listed in previous interventions and which will have to be taken into account by the European Commission in its work on the revision of the regulation, such as the call for the creation of a post-marketing surveillance mechanism, capable of monitoring the real-life effects of the use of plant protection products. For the S&amp;D Group, particular attention should be paid to risk assessment for the most vulnerable groups, and I am thinking in particular of the use of pesticides in the vicinity of schools, hospitals or public parks. It is also essential to invest in innovation in order to develop alternatives to plant protection products. In this context, specific regulation for pesticides with low biological risk will also be necessary, as Parliament has already requested.

Despite hearing from a range of experts and authorities, the report has been prepared in a very selective manner with many of these experts’ contributions being intentionally disregarded. The content doesn’t reflect the opinions we heard, instead it regurgitates the same beliefs and myths that we heard at the start of the process, even when these have been clearly and unanimously dispelled by experts: a supposed weakness of the rapporteur Member State system, allegations of plagiarism in assessment documentation, apparent failures of the zonal system... these have all been shown to be wide of the mark by invited experts. Yet many of these remain deliberately uncontested in this report in order to provide a platform for campaigning MEPs ahead of the elections in May. So the report is very disappointing and it reflects poorly on our institution, and that’s why we have presented plenary amendments to ensure that colleagues will be able to vote to support the real content of the committee hearings and not just the selected opinions of certain parliamentarians. We should support a fact-based and science-based approach to policy-making, and I hope that this Parliament will see the value of this approach and support the amendments presented by the ECR. Our current system isn’t perfect, it can be improved. We can act to improve transparency, which the Commission has already done in its proposal to revise the general food law. We can encourage innovation. We can support the development of new farming techniques which reduce pesticide use, and new active substances which will make older, more persistent, chemistry obsolete. The invited expert from Greenpeace said at the final hearing that it’s not flaws in the legislation that we need to address, but rather it is improvements to the implementation that are needed.

Mr President, our PEST committee has carried out nine months of work, eight meetings, three missions abroad. It had a clear mandate: to scrutinize the malfunctions, or not, of our pesticide licensing system and, above all, to chart a course for the future. All of this came, it has been said, in the wake of the controversial renewal of glyphosate at the end of 2017. I would like to thank our two rapporteurs, Mr Staes and Mr Lins, for the excellent cooperation with them and also, I would like to say this, Eric Andrieu, an expert president, a demanding president and an empathetic president. So this is an ambitious report that we are debating tonight. The recommendations we make are strong and urgent. The report, which is widely supported in the PEST committee, takes the health of Europeans into account as a priority. We have scrupulously analysed the current shortcomings in the pesticide authorisation system and propose a list of recommendations immediately applicable to the Commission, Member States and EFSA.  Our first requirement is for the European Food Safety Agency: experts working with industry must be excluded from the pesticide authorisation process. Equally important for transparency is the creation of a public registry that records data and studies used by industry. We also call for Europe to increase EFSA's budget to strengthen its independence and effectiveness. I recall a figure that is often forgotten: today, EFSA's budget is four times lower than that of the European Medicines Agency. Food security deserves better than that. With regard to the coformulants, who, as we know, were at the heart of the dispute over glyphosate between the International Cancer Research Centre (IARC) and the European agencies, my question, Commissioner, is simple, in essence: when do you intend to apply the law and publish the first negative list, that is, of banning, of coformulants? However, we know today that the addition of adjuvants and synergists is at the heart of the toxicity of the products. Europe must also promote a zero pesticide policy in public spaces, nurseries, schools, hospitals, playgrounds and, finally, extend the ban to other bee-killing neonicotinoids than those already banned. I'm thinking here of thiaclopride.  In conclusion, Europe has no choice - I conclude, Mr President, I assure you - it must follow the recommendations of the PEST committee.

But at what cost do we use the pesticides here, when we have dead soils, when we then have a loss in biodiversity, when we then have explosive problems in the health system? All of this, too, ultimately demands economic costs, and it is a high price to pay. There is no doubt that some pesticides or many pesticides pose unacceptable risks, cause damage to the environment, to the citizens, but also to the farmers who use these pesticides. In order to increase the control and scrutiny of pesticides in the authorisation procedure with transparency and with the control of the corporations and in the future, taking greater account of health and environmental aspects, I would ask you to vote in favour of this report. Mrs McIntyre, you say that this report reflects the opinion of a single group, an ideological opinion. I think you mean us Greens. What do you think: how does a compromise with the European People's Party, social democracy, the GUE, the liberals come about?

Mr President, Europe's approval of Monsanto's glyphosate is and remains a major scandal. It is now more than a year since Monsanto, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the food authority EFSA and the European Commission together pushed this approval through to the EU Member States.  This decision was taken on the basis of dubious, manipulated and industry-supplied studies. Europe is taking unacceptable risks to the health of more than 500 million citizens and animal health. Europe is allowing more and more of this poison to be pumped into our environment, our waters, our food and our bodies. In response to the glyphosate scandal, the European Parliament set up this special committee of inquiry into the authorisation procedure for pesticides. The recommendations of this special committee on pesticide authorisation are promising. Europe must become more transparent and, independently of industry, determine whether agricultural poison is safe for use. Less poison should be used in its entirety. The use of agricultural poison in public places should be prohibited. And animals should no longer be abused to demonstrate the so-called safety of poison. As the rapporteur has just pointed out, the Union Special Commission authorisation procedure for pesticides wants animal test-free testing methods.  All good recommendations that the Party for Animals wholeheartedly endorses. I therefore assume that these recommendations are embraced by the European Commission, but also by the European Council, and that they are included in general food legislation.  All that remains is the cleaning up of remnants of the past. Glyphosate should be directly off the market, because there is no basis for the issued approval. That is also what one million citizens have asked of us. I also believe that European agricultural subsidies should be abolished.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Mireille D’Ornano", "mepid": "124750", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD group. Mr President, Co-ministers, Commissioner, in March 2017, the US federal court declassified more than 250 pages of internal documents from Monsanto. Their contents proved that the agrochemical firm was seriously concerned, 20 years ago, about the mutagen risk of glyphosate, the most widely used plant protection molecule in the world. However, on the eve of these revelations, the European Chemicals Agency published a report that considered glyphosate to be neither carcinogenic nor mutagenic. Unlucky: the \"Monsanto papers\" scandal had just erupted and was about to have global repercussions. At the end of 2017, the European Commission declared the European Citizens' Initiative entitled 'Baning glyphosate and protecting the population and the environment from toxic pesticides' eligible. It was signed by more than a million citizens. Shortly thereafter, the European Parliament established a special committee on pesticides. Co-ordinator for my group, I attended all the hearings organized in the presence of the actors involved in the authorisation procedure. I was, I must say, particularly surprised by the ambiguity, even the lies assailed in some pseudo-scientific responses of pesticide advocates and agrochemical lobbies - all this was edifying. In any event, 1,141 amendments were tabled in committee, probably because of a draft report that did not go far enough and prompted totally antagonistic positions. Today, in plenary, 152 amendments are now tabled, the vast majority of which are in favour of pesticides. The majority of these amendments propose to remove the troublesome passages in the text and consist in a way of rewriting them. For my part, I have tabled only one amendment, which seems to me to be of extreme urgency and which deals with a subject of difficult questionable gravity: it is a question of amending the regulation to ensure the effective protection of vulnerable groups. The aim is to put an end, without delay or derogation, to the application of pesticides over long distances near homes, schools, nurseries, playgrounds, hospitals, maternity wards or health care facilities. It should be noted that I have garnered the support of most political groups to co-sign this amendment, proof of its consensual and balanced nature. If the pro-pesticide amendments were to be adopted and thus to distort a text that was already very timid and very disappointing as to what to do, it will be clear that this is yet another victory for the lobbies. On the other hand, Members can emerge from this vote by adopting amendments that are geared towards the protection of vulnerable people and, more generally, public health.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Philippe Loiseau", "mepid": "125684", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group. Mr President, this PEST committee was set up as a result of the Monsanto papers. The aim was therefore neither to try pesticides nor to exempt them from any harm, it was in fact to identify loopholes and collusions in the European process, and of course to remedy them. As is often the case here, the mountain has given birth to a mouse. As is often the case, the desire for consensus has replaced political firmness and listening to peoples. A prominent member of this assembly, Bruno Gollnisch, said about this search for consensus at the expense of substance, I quote: \"This is the house of gifts. Everyone and especially his brother must be pleased, except of course when his brother is part of the Europe of Nations and Freedoms group.\" The result is logically a catch-all text, where the only ideas that emerge actually aggravate the situation. My proposals, in line with the desire of the peoples, who demand more national sovereignty, are obviously victims of a political sectarianism, which is fortunately dying.  In substance, the goodwill of the two co-owners was drowned out by the blindness of the smug Europeanists. A great French writer, Bossuet, said: \"God laughs at men who deplore the effects of which they cherish the causes.\" This maxim seems to have been written for the European Union, for its supporters, and I think even for this committee on pesticides. Most of my colleagues agreed on one point: EFSA was the problem, through its obscure governance, its expensive financial management and its proximity to the big industry. Unfortunately, these same purveyors of an all-powerful agency finally want to strengthen its means, its power and its influence. In other words, when the European Union creates problems, more European Union is needed to solve them. The Eurosceptic wave in Italy, Austria or Poland, the yellow vests in France, Brexit: all these upheavals are very clear. People don't want to see their states die. They do not want more Europe. They refuse standards unrelated to their needs.  Our amendments were therefore based on simple ideas about the process of authorising substances. It must go back to the States as a whole, it must take into account the experience, of course, of farmers in a new pesticido-vigilance system, it must also be more transparent, it must finally be more consistent with the european Union's trade policy. That is, if a substance is banned in Europe, of course it must also be banned from importing products containing that substance.  Finally, EFSA must take responsibility for its actions. The joke, I think, lasted long enough.

With the final report of the Committee on Pesticide Registration, we want to strengthen our attitude towards food quality and restore citizens' trust in European institutions. It is about time that pesticides stopped poisoning our fields and meadows, and it is also time for pesticides to stop poisoning our political debates. Health first! The time before each election is particularly receptive to quick solutions, which prefer to refer to simple slogans and generalisations rather than facts, and the upcoming European elections are no exception. I therefore welcome the PEST report, which calls for a systematic review of all studies on the impact of glyphosate on human health and the environment, which will form the basis for our follow-up.  However, I think that much more needs to be done to restore people's trust in European institutions. Different agencies have given us different results in terms of the carcinogenicity of glyphosate and other pesticides. There are still concerns, and time is running out of facts.  The use of chemical pesticides in the preparation, in food production, harms both air, water and soil, as well as biodiversity and human health. It is no longer just a question of restoreing public trust, it is increasingly about respecting the knowledge of science and insisting that, even as politicians, we no longer agree to compromise at the expense of health.  As chair of the Group of Members on Combating Cancer, I can say that, as a society, we are understandably busy finding medicines and methods of treatment in the fight against this increasingly common disease, and we are not doing enough to address the causes of it. Cancer is not just a private matter for doctors and patients, cancer is a political and social problem. If we are to achieve positive changes in health, we need to change our European development paradigm, including agricultural policy.

My report on the implementation of the European Regulation on plant protection products, which was kindly mentioned by the Commissioner and which was adopted by this Parliament by a majority last year, has made it quite clear that there are cracks in our system of authorising, which ultimately result in a lack of protection of public health and the environment. Today, therefore, thanks to the work of the Special Committee on the table, we have really excellent comprehensive recommendations on how to substantially improve this European authorisation system for authorising pesticides and restore citizens' confidence in our decision-making. I am therefore quite shocked that my colleagues in the ECR Group are trying to completely devalue this joint work with plenary amendments. Their proposals erase entire passages aimed at ensuring better protection of particularly vulnerable groups, such as children, pregnant women, seeking, among other things, to block proposals to assess developmental neurotoxicity, the long-term effect of pesticides, exposure to sub-limit amounts of several pesticides at once or a combination of these substances.

The proposal to place more responsibility in EFSA's hands sounds like a good idea – but only if the Agency has sufficient resources to do so.

But what I am afraid of – besides that we are always questioning science – is that the appreciation for the farmer is also coming under increasing pressure. Whichever agricultural system you use, in the production of food you intervene in nature and you have an environmental impact.  What we forget is that farmers have already minimized their environmental impact in recent decades and are keen to invest to further reduce the environmental impact. And if you're producing food, you need farmland. You get that from nature. To protect your crops, you still have certain resources. If you don't, you lose your harvest, you have food waste and you need more land for your agricultural production.  What I want to do here, and what I want to do, is to give farmers adequate tools to protect those crops properly.

We are talking about health, that the topic is important, it is supported by people signing a petition, and we know that when we take care of our health, we intervene in medicines. The less they need to be used, the more we see them, and the same is also the case in agriculture, where it is necessary to cut down on pesticides for plant protection. All technologies are smaller in both conventional, integrated agriculture and organic farming, where this use is small, smaller but exists.  What matters is what has been said, that we are talking about evolution, that we are not talking about revolution. The agricultural sector is changing, and I know exactly what farmers have to do, how this has changed over the last 30 years and how it goes towards greener use of pesticides, less pesticide use, greater transparency.

Not only is responsible use of herbicides vital in the production of food, it is also beneficial in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable farming. The EU rightly champions high standards in food production and the importance of protecting public health, and I agree with all of that, food safety and the environment. The best way to do this is by formulating a policy based on scientific evidence. I agree with you, Commissioner: how do you guarantee some of this?

This is also the case with regard to agriculture, which many want to pass on as the sector responsible for a less correct use of these products.  This is totally false. Not only are pesticides used by a wide spectrum of society and the most varied professions, but farmers are the main ones interested in responsible use of them. I would remind you that, according to the most recent study on the presence of pesticide residues in the agri-food sector, it showed that 97.2% of samples in Europe were within the legal limits of EU law, which shows an extremely strict and safest food production system in the world.

The negative public sentiment in this case stems primarily from a court ruling in the United States in August 2018 that monsanto glyphosate caused lymphoma in an American gardener and ordered him to pay nearly $300 million.

This is what I have been advocating for more than three years in this Chamber, and I welcome the fact that the report has reached the same conclusions. We need to work towards a greater understanding of procedures by citizens. We must restore confidence in national and European agencies, but also in our institutions.

The farmer I am, who has been campaigning for more than ten years for the alternative to plant protection products and the use of plant protection products, can attest to this. Be demanding, yes, but while guaranteeing our food sovereignty. We must give ourselves the means of our ambitions. We need to support research and innovation. Let's not be naïve, if we don't allow companies to do research, innovation will come from their competitors. We must also support professionals and the agricultural sectors to move towards ever more environmentally friendly practices.

I cannot highlight all of them here - I do not have time for this - but I would like to emphasise three pieces: one is that we have chosen to emphasise the need for much more transparency in the approval procedure.

Firstly, allow me to state that I welcome the work of this committee and the opportunity for Parliament to scrutinise this issue. As the Commissioner pointed out earlier, it is an issue that has received much attention and about which we have all received many questions and concerns from constituents.  I come from Ireland south, a rather rural and agricultural constituency. Every day I speak to farmers about their work and pesticides, especially glyphosate, has been at the forefront of their concerns. Farmers are understanding of the problem but are frustrated at the same time because of lack of alternatives.  Let me be clear: it is crucial to safeguard the value and authority of the scientific institutions. We cannot allow science to be guided by politics. Our citizens depend on stable, legal and safe rules and frameworks. We must ensure that there is trust in the system, as Mr Nicholson pointed out, otherwise we might as well have no approval process in place, as there would be no trust in it. The EU approval system is one of the safest in the world. However, there are ways to improve it. We must ensure that we safeguard the highest standards for the health of our EU citizens, the environment, but also ensure the survival of EU farms. This is the balance that can and must be found.  It is vital that we consider the reliance our farmers have on certain products. In Ireland, for example, the practice of desiccation, i.e. the application of a herbicide to a crop shortly before harvest, is vital to some of our famers, particularly our potato farmers. We in Ireland have a temperate oceanic climate. We do not have the weather conditions for drying crops in the sun, and therefore desiccation is necessary. Alternatives need to be found to put new and better equipped products on the markets, and any restrictions on this in the years ahead, in the absence of viable alternatives, would be detrimental to the tillage sector.

Concerns about transparency and conflicts of interest highlight the need to improve the authorisation regulation for its application. The report by the PEST Special Committee highlights the need to focus on citizens' health, the environment and food safety, ensuring that EFSA has adequate financial resources, independence from lobbies, no conflicts of interest and adequate expertise in the approval processes.

As of December, we discussed with Member States the first list of unacceptable co-formulants, including those already identified by the Member States, and discussions are ongoing. Speaking about products coming from third countries and maximum residual levels that MEP Marias just raised, in principle the same maximum residual levels apply for imported and domestically produced food and feed commodities – absolutely, crystal clear. Where no maximum residual level exists for a commodity not produced in the EU or because a substance is not approved, so-called import tolerance can be requested for commodities produced in the third country. However, such import tolerances can only be granted if confirmed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), following a thorough scientific evaluation that the risk to consumers can be excluded and therefore the high level of protection in the EU is fully ensured.

The court found that 46-year-old gardener Dewayne Johnson, who had been using Roundup for years, had cancer of the lymphatic system due to exposure to glyphosate.

The court's verdict points to crushing evidence of the harmfulness of glyphosate. Germany's Bayer intends to appeal against that decision. However, if this judgment persists, it could lead to a wave of similar decisions as a precedent.

The proposal that we will vote tomorrow on the use of driverless hire vehicles in road freight transport - included in the first mobility package - aims to adapt a directive which has been in force for 25 years and thus gradually accommodate the market for the use of these vehicles, obviously adapting it to the needs of industry operators and taking into account the developments in the transport market itself. What we propose is that Member States should not limit the use of a rental vehicle by a company established in another Member State within its own territory, provided that the vehicle obviously meets the needs and standards of operation and safety. In this way, we have unlocked the potential of a rental and leasing market, which is composed, as you know, mostly of small and medium-sized enterprises and which obviously prospects the possibility of creating more jobs.  However, in order to avoid market distortions, obviously due to the existence of different levels of taxation, member states can limit, on their territory, the use of vehicles rented by an undertaking established in another Member State or in a period of time or in the total number of vehicles rented, provided that it authorises at least four consecutive months the use of this vehicle in their territory or , on the other hand, limit the number of vehicles rented to 25% of the total fleet of this company. And if the fleet consists of more than one or less than four vehicles, authorise the rental of at least one vehicle. For the correct implementation of this legislative act, we propose that all information on the rental vehicle be placed in the national electronic registers and that the exchange of information between Member States be carried out through the internal market information system, as well as the proposal found in other dossiers of the mobility package itself. With this proposal we will allow the single market to be implemented in this particular area, without doing so abruptly, and also by achieving compliance with social rules and market rules, especially in the transport of Goods from the Union. That is why I appeal to all colleagues is that they do not support amendments that discriminate against own vehicle rental vehicles and create even more obstacles to the development of this sector and the realisation of the single European transport area. to say \"no\" to exceptions blocking a greener, greener, safer fleet, such as restrictions on vehicles weighing more than six tonnes; to say 'no' to measures that block operators' needs to be able to respond on seasonal peaks and say 'no' to proposals on workers, because we are effectively referring to a directive that explicitly says 'no drivers'. Moreover, all vehicles put into circulation in the Union must comply with the established emission limits and we must therefore not create European legislative redundancies that say 'no' to the amendment of legislative acts, through this we cannot change them through others and tomorrow we will vote on this report for the transport market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) and particularly Ms Monteiro de Aguiar and the shadow rapporteurs for this overall balanced and well-drafted report on the Commission’s proposal to update the rules relating to the use of hired goods vehicles. The use of hired vehicles instead of vehicles owned by transport operators increases the efficiency of these operators. It represents an attractive alternative to the purchase of potentially under-used vehicles. What is more – and this is an increasingly important aspect – hired vehicles are usually newer, cleaner and safer than the vehicles owned by the operators. The average age of hired vehicles is significantly below the average age of the vehicles that are owned by the operators. They usually meet the latest environmental and safety standards. Hired vehicles are hence good both for road safety and the environment. The revision of the rules relating to the use of hired goods vehicles aims at removing outdated restrictions and those facilitating the use of these modern and clean vehicles. In addition, we want to ensure that operators may also use vehicles they have hired outside their countries of establishment and give them legal certainty when they do that. When you hire a vehicle, you should be able to use it anywhere in the EU and not be subject to different restrictions depending on where you are operating. To avoid unwanted consequences such as the large-scale flagging-out of fleets, the use of vehicles hired in another Member State may be limited to some extent, but those limitations should still allow operators first to meet in particular short-term, seasonal or temporary demand peaks, or to replace defective or damaged vehicles whenever this occurs. These are examples where our research has found that the possibility to use vehicles hired abroad would be most needed. Ms Monteiro de Aguiar’s report is right in moving possible restrictions on the use of hired vehicles from Article 2 to Article 3 of the Directive. This ensures that Member States will not be able to restrict the use of a hired goods vehicle on their territory if the use of that vehicle is allowed on the territory of the Member States where the operator using it is established. In other words, as long as you can use a hired vehicle in your home country, you can use it everywhere in the EU. The amendments that have been tabled for the plenary vote tomorrow are to a large extent also acceptable to the Commission. However, I have to mention specifically two amendments which could destroy the delicate balance created by Ms Monteiro de Aguiar. First, one amendment would allow a Member State to restrict the use of hired vehicles by a foreign operator that do not meet the latest environmental standards. One of the arguments in favour of the use of hired vehicles is that they are usually newer and cleaner than other vehicles. This should hence not be a big issue. However, such a provision would destroy the legal certainty created by Ms Monteiro de Aguiar’s report, as it would allow Member States to apply different restrictions to hired vehicles. You would first have to check where you could drive with your hired vehicle depending on where you want to use it, while no such restriction would apply to vehicles owned by operators. Another amendment which raises concerns is the one allowing Member States to restrict the use of hired vehicles for own-account operations. We have found that in the few countries where such restrictions are currently applied we have more empty runs. Moreover, this provision leads to a patchwork of legal rules in the Member States and has no legal certainty for companies using hired vehicles. Having said this, we can accept all the other amendments which increase the information provided to drivers and which strengthen compliance with and enforcement of the directive. I am looking forward to all the comments from your side.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 74, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Theresa Griffin", "mepid": "124961", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, on behalf of Lucy Anderson, hired vehicles are an important and growing part of the EU road transport sector and one that touches on a range of public policy. This plenary has already taken an initial view on the revision of the law on hired vehicles, but it is right now that we reconsider the matter urgently, not least in the light of the controversial mobility package proposals. We must put safety, environmental concerns and consideration for truck drivers at the top of our list of priorities for this sector. The S&amp;D has tabled a number of important amendments and these are supported by many MEPs from other political groups. Despite repeated attempts to find compromise solutions on issues such as the training of drivers, the environmental impact of hired vehicles or on the level of liberalisation of the market, the rapporteur has shown little willingness, I’m afraid, to accommodate different views, leaving us with a weaker text. I would urge everyone to support our amendments in the vote tomorrow in order to tackle the deficiencies of the proposal and provide a good basis for negotiations with the Council. It is essential that we ensure that hired vehicles are in compliance with the most applicable emission limits laid down in Union law. In the light of safety considerations and different circumstances in the Member States, it is right they should be allowed to decide whether or not to continue hiring restrictions on the heaviest goods vehicles. We strongly urge support for a sensible amendment to ensure that drivers receive the necessary information for using hired vehicles. Penalties applicable for infringements of this directive should be adequate, effective and dissuasive. And finally, breaches of the law regarding hired vehicles should be regarded as serious infringements of EU road transport legislation, leading to potential action being taken against the licences of infringing transport operators.

It pleads for the rapporteur that she has found this balance right. The further liberalisation of the internal market will be accompanied by the necessary conditions.

Moreover, rented vehicles are often newer, cleaner and safer, so the use of rented vehicles contributes to sustainability.  I am therefore in favour of a further liberalisation of the European market for rented vehicles. In this way, we can promote a level playing field and fair competition between European companies and remove unnecessary constraints and administrative burdens.  I would like to stress that proper registration of registrations of rented vehicles is essential, for example in order to enforce the rules on cabotage. Information should be able to be exchanged between authorities in different Member States, so that it is always clear what the carrier's country of establishment is. The text that we are voting on tomorrow includes a very good provision for this.  The same applies to the possibility of limiting the use of rented vehicles from another Member State. For example, to prevent rental companies from moving to countries with a more favourable tax environment.

I hope we all agree on that. I would like to also stress that this proposal really supports higher safety of drivers and higher road safety altogether, and it contributes directly to the decarbonisation of transport.

First, on effective controls service: the number plate of all vehicles at the disposal of transport operators will be recorded in the national electronic register of road transport undertakings, which is part of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009.

A proposal that will benefit companies because it will allow them to invest in other areas of development and not in the fleet itself, which is often underused due to rental rules that are different from country to country. We do not need to differentiate from own car rental vehicles, because in the Union the regulatory framework is clear and all vehicles in circulation in the Union must comply with the emission limits established through European legislation.  We must not maintain the restriction of more than six tonnes, because its implementation goes against the general objectives for the development of the single European transport area.

This solution has been criticised in the European Union, including Poland. It is right, then, that we refrain from it. In addition, the use of a vehicle taken in another European Union country is to be allowed for up to 4 months so that companies can react quickly to the temporary increase in demand for their transport services, which happens, for example, seasonally in the transport of agricultural crops.

Gender mainstreaming, as we all know – or at least those of us who are in favour of it – is a globally accepted strategy for promoting gender equality. Gender mainstreaming is not an end in itself, but it is a strategy, an approach and a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. Gender mainstreaming involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all – and I would really would like to reiterate this – activities: policy development, research, dialogue, legislation, planning, implementation and monitoring of spending programmes and projects themselves. In 2019 I think it is unacceptable that, although the population of the European Union consists half of women and half of men, the composition of this House of the European Parliament does not mirror this balance, as only 36.1% of all MEPs are female. As the standing rapporteur for the gender mainstreaming report, I therefore encourage the European political parties and their party members to ensure a gender-balanced representation of candidates for the elections of this year’s European Parliament election by means of a zipped list or other methods such as parity lists. The same goes for the Secretariat of the European Parliament. Although women constitute 59% of the staff of this Parliament, they are still under-represented in all ranks of management, and the number of women in senior management positions has even decreased since June 2017, while the number of women in middle management roles increased only slightly. I regret that female representation in Parliament’s key decision—making positions at political and administrative levels still remains low and I urge Parliament to work towards a gender-equal distribution of decision-making positions. I am very confident that the pool of very capable women eligible for such posts is in fact big enough to successfully fill the vacancies when they arise. We need to change the conceptual and behavioural attitudes towards a culture of equality. Moreover, the European Parliament must live up to its values and promote inclusiveness. This report calls for an active inclusion of the rights and the well—being of the LGBTQI community. The European Parliament must pay attention to the rights of all gender identities. On the fight against sexual harassment, the report emphasises that sexual harassment is a serious crime, an extreme form of gender-based discrimination and one of the biggest obstacles to gender equality. I strongly regret the slow and inadequate progress in the implementation of the recommendations of Parliament’s resolution from 2017, such as mandatory training for MEPs and staff on preventing sexual harassment and the setting-up of a task force of independent external experts to examine the situation of sexual harassment in the European Parliament and the functioning of its two harassment committees. In this context, I would like to stress once again that gender equality is not just a women’s issue. In fact men may have a greater responsibility to work towards it as a group with collectively more power and influence in the European Parliament than women. A strong continued commitment to gender mainstreaming is needed in order for the European Parliament to support the promotion of gender equality at all levels. Therefore, I really hope for your support and a positive vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 91, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Ms Mlinar for her second report on gender mainstreaming and the work of the European Parliament for this legislature. For the EU and its institutions, gender mainstreaming is not a choice. It is an obligation. It is in the Treaty. It is in the acquis. It is in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Gender equality is still not a tangible reality for all. Indicators are stagnating. If there is any change towards more equality, it is often quite marginal. This also true unfortunately for EU institutions. The gender balance among the Members of the European Parliament has hardly changed since 2009, from 35% to 36.4%, and women currently account for 32.1% of European Commissioners, or nine out of 28. Within the European Parliament, the share of women in senior or middle management positions also remains low. In a democracy, gender equality in political office matters. More gender balance in EU institutions can increase citizens’ trust in the EU and improve the functioning of our democracies. Indeed, as Ms Mlinar has stressed, this year political parties and the Member States have a chance to show their commitment to gender equality and ensure a balanced representation of women and men in the European Parliament and in the top positions of the European institutions. I reiterate my plea for gender balanced nominations. Public administrations must be in tune with the people they serve. At the beginning of the mandate of this Commission, President Juncker set an in-house target of 40% women in middle and senior management by the end of the mandate. By 1 November 2018, women accounted for 37% at senior management level in the Commission, while at middle management level, the target of 40% has already been met. The progress comes after sustained efforts to identify, develop and support female talents through targeted initiatives. Besides taking stock of the progress during the legislature, the report sets the scene for the next one, and I very much welcome this forward-looking approach. As you know, the Commission’s strategic engagement for gender equality has been our framework for promoting gender equality and gender mainstreaming in the EU and beyond. It ends in 2019, together with the term of this Commission. So in 2019, we are also taking stock of the progress, identifying gaps and contributing to setting priorities for the future. In this context, the views of Parliament are very welcome.

I would like to mention that in October 2017 I had the opportunity to condemn the case that became known here in this House as \"the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the consequences of which have also reached this Parliament. But despite the various civil society movements that have been denouncing situations identical to this, the fact is that we continue to silence situations of sexual harassment by colleagues and staff members in this Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the time has come to say enough, and to do so, I hope that strengthening the powers of the Advisory Commission on Sexual Harassment can help to end the still-remaining culture of fear and that we finally have a genuine zero-tolerance policy in the face of this kind of behaviour. If it is true and absolutely necessary to recognise that, at the root of these behaviours, the marks of inequality persist in the relations of power between men and women, it is also crucial for me that recruitment and selection for places with decision-making responsibilities are made on the basis of merit and competence and not only, or mainly, on the basis of criteria of positive discrimination.  Although there have been some differences between the various political groups during the preparation of this report on systems such as the imposition of gender quotas on the lists for this year's European elections and the inclusion of the gender perspective in all dimensions of the European Union budget, the truth is that the final document we will vote on tomorrow is quite ambitious and balanced and mirrors our conviction in a fairer and more fraternal Europe , where equal opportunities are not only a mirage but there is something we can be proud of.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Mlinar and all those involved for a very good report. It addresses most aspects that are directly crucial to parliament being able to be fully equal between men and women at some point in the future – that this House can be made equal, but above all that the policies and decisions we take are fully equal. It is therefore very important that the studies ordered by Parliament, the panel discussions organised by Parliament and the dossiers produced by Parliament are fully equal, so that we parliamentarians can take the most informed decisions possible. It is therefore very important that the whole of Parliament is integrated into the equality of gender equality. We must also take action against sexual harassment, and right now. Sexual harassment is a crime and an extreme form of gender discrimination and must not occur in this house at all – and nowhere else for that matter. If there is one thing we have learned since the Me Too roll-up, it is that we must take the issue very seriously. It must be compulsory for all Members of the European Parliament to attend training against sexual harassment, and that is the least we can ask for. I myself attended the training on 7 December and was the only MEP who was present. It's really embarrassing. I think there were 33 people out of 751 Members who joined this. All Members must assume their responsibilities and that is very important – we must make education compulsory. Parliament must also have a fully independent working group to examine the situation of sexual harassment in Parliament. It is a job that Parliament cannot do itself, we need external help and expertise. I can also add that I call on all Member States and political parties to have intersthed lists, because it is very important for it to be equal.

Because concrete measures are proposed here to make the European institutions an example in terms of equality, not just for what they say, but for what they do. Therefore, incorporating more knowledge, sincerely and honestly evaluating what we do inwards, and driving another way of doing with political and budgetary commitment to foster parity is essential to truly become a reliable benchmark with full legitimacy. The reflection that is defended here and the measures that are realized are a necessity, they are not a whim. Because in these seats there is no balanced representation between men and women; because we also do not see this parity in the selection and appointment of the people who lead our administration; because we continue to record some incidents of harassment in which the sexist component, along with abuse of power, detract from our efforts with reports and legislation to make the effects of inequality disappear; because we continue to fail in the basics of our institutional communication. I myself had to write to the President of Parliament because the iconic representation of European citizenship that starred in a very visible campaign, which was placed in Luxembourg Square, was basically male. Here, in short, the problems that sexism produces in areas such as labour, social rights or security are represented. Moreover, this report is not just a collection of successful proposals. It's a commitment to real leadership: another of our institutional missions. Inequality is the result of internalized values in many subconscious. It is the result of stereotypes that prompt many people to consider normal aberrant situations. Driving change needs a committed attitude from each of us and us who dismantle these outdated schemes based on proposals, actions and results. In short, credible references, initiative, coherence and continuity of our institutional action. Let us hope that the far-right populism, which wants to return us to the past, which openly defends inequality and underestimates gender-based violence will not succeed in turning this project into wet paper in the coming elections.

Gender equality is about empowering people to realise themselves and the inner potential that everyone possesses. It is intimately linked to good society, which must undoubtedly be based on gender equality. Discrimination, harassment and violence in close relationships are a major cost to the individual and to our societies. Active citizenship is required, good education, solidarity, but also to be able to see these power structures and have the courage to change them. Men are, of course, also harmed by inequality.

Above all, I believe that the European Parliament must express its thanks to the feminist movements which, in history and in this present, are fighting for justice and a policy for all and for all, for all human beings, for all those gender identities that still suffer discrimination and violence. They are the inspiration and foundation of every institutional achievement, on human rights, on labour rights, on the fight against discrimination. I think it is very important to highlight a fact, which I strongly wanted in this report, and for which I express my satisfaction: there can be no conscious use of gender mainstreaming at institutional level without the places that produce the authority and self-determination of women. I am talking about those feminist spaces, such as the International House of Women in Rome, such as the Casa Lucha y Siesta in Rome, which produce feminist thought and politics. The Femm Committee of the European Parliament has recently been able to visit them, places that are suffering a very strong attack from local and national institutions, it is an attack aimed at erasing their history and disasing their value in the name of accounting and debt logic.

Madam President, Commissioner, this report, as is often the case when it comes to gender equality, is completely lunar.

At the same time, you are sorry that the legitimacy of women in politics and in Parliament is being challenged. Are you so blinded by your parity ideology not to see this reality? It is clear, however, that our credibility as women is being violently challenged with such measures. How can you trust a recruiter when he chooses under the constraint of absurd quotas? How can you be a credible elected official in the face of citizens who say ,\"she was elected because she is a woman\"?

I have no doubt that gender mainstreaming, or mainstreaming, is crucial for us to achieve the objective of equal treatment between women and men , an objective that is enshrined in many points in the Treaties, in many European directives and regulations. If we want to achieve this objective, if we want to effectively encourage nation states to make an effort in this area, it is clear that all the EU institutions with the European Parliament at the forefront should lead by example, show how the implementation of the principles of equal treatment can look like in practice for a particular institution.

At a time when conservative forces are allying against women, girls and LGBTIQ+ people, it’s important to redouble our efforts towards achieving true gender equality.

A gender perspective is also important for LGBTIQ+ people whose experiences are often silenced and ignored in policy-making. We still have a long way to go in terms of diversity in the European Parliament. White, middle-class people remain unacceptably over-represented in our institutions. The EU needs to adopt real policies fostering diversity and inclusion in order to create a real democracy where everyone is represented.

I will use the opportunity to also go beyond it and to present the main principles which the Commission and myself keep working on gender equality topic. The most important principle in my view is equality in opportunities – nobody says that men and women are the same. We speak about equality of opportunities, breaking the stereotypes which stop women from getting to managerial positions, and we all know that this is still an issue. So equality in opportunities. Then we come to zero tolerance for discrimination and violence against women. We have alarming statistical figures which show that both open discrimination and violence are problems which need to be solved. And the third principle, we have to unleash the potential of women in both the political and economic sphere, because this will be to the benefit of the whole of society. Again we have a lot of evidence which shows that it is a short-sighted position of society not to enable women to have managerial positions, to use their qualifications, because 62% of university leavers are women, young women who want to take over part of the responsibility of the development of our societies. And you mentioned many times that one of the issues which women face is insufficient conditions for working mothers to combine their work and family duties. That is why, keeping these principles, I want to continue until the end of my mandate and I very much count on the support of this Parliament to finish some of the things which we have started. Speaking about legislation, first of all, there is the work-life balance initiative, the combination of legislative and non-legislative measures which should create these better conditions for the working women and for working parents if you want to have this gender neutral, because we also here speak about the better possibility for men to share more duties at home and to give a wider spectrum of choices for families to use these better conditions, if they wish. We have to do everything we can to fight again discrimination, as I said, also by supporting civil society institutions. The equality bodies which we are proposing to strengthen their possibilities to represent the victims of discrimination in the courts for instance, to be concrete. We are doing a lot of things through the funding of various projects which should decrease violence against women. I am in permanent contact with the law enforcement authorities in all the Member States, where we have common clear understanding that violence against women, especially domestic violence, is a crime which has to be punished. I think we are doing everything possible to achieve the accession of EU to the Istanbul Convention. We are doing our best in promoting women to managerial positions through diversity charters, and are still also negotiating the possibility of the adoption of the women on boards directive. So there is still a lot of work ahead of us. We are still not at the end of the mandate and it will be very important that in the next mandate, here in this House, will be a lot of women and men who will understand that gender equality is not a choice. It is an obligation and that we have to solve this problem not as a problem of women but as a problem of our society. So let’s hope the elections will bring a lot of enlightened people to this House, but also to the Commission, who understand the core principles and the things which need to be done, either the continuation of what we are doing now or new ideas and new visions, and hopefully workable measures to be accomplished or to be used to solve the problem.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 126, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Angelika Mlinar", "mepid": "125026", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, the Committee on Women’s Rights (FEMM) is a non-legislative committee.

One way of promoting gender equality is to integrate the gender dimension into the work of the European Parliament. Gender mainstreaming is a generally accepted strategy for implementing gender equality. It is not a very objective, but a tool for ensuring gender equality, where a gender-based approach is guided by the design, development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, regulatory instruments and spending programmes. The EU recognises that gender equality is a fundamental right, a common value for the EU and a prerequisite for the Union to achieve its objectives of growth, employment and social cohesion. Gender mainstreaming should therefore be seen as a continuous process supported by systematic efforts to integrate the gender dimension at all levels, into all areas and at all stages of policy-making and implementation processes.

As always, Parliament’s views and inputs are crucial to ensure effective European support for this important project. The energy transition and the fight against climate change constitute some of the greatest challenges we face today. In this context, it is essential to develop a low—carbon, environmentally friendly energy source that can work as a complement to renewables and fusion; as an energy source it holds a lot of promise. ITER, a device of unprecedented scale and sophistication at global level, hosted on European soil, is getting the best world expertise. The project aims for key scientific breakthroughs in the development of fusion as a low-carbon and virtually inexhaustible energy source that should support the EU’s objectives to fight climate change. It is already bringing many concrete benefits for the European economy and society at large, not least through enabling the European industry and research community to enter new markets and develop international cooperation. It is also extremely promising in fulfilling the other dimensions of our energy union to make energy secure for our citizens while supporting growth and job creation.  We want to ensure that Europe continues leading the way on fusion energy. This is why it is so valuable to have the support of Parliament for the project. Thanks to this leadership in the construction of ITER, Europe will be in a privileged position to reap the benefits of constructing and cooperating the first generation of fusion power plants.  The proposed report comes at an important time for the project. In recent years ITER has undergone significant management improvements, which have produced tangible results. The construction of the project needed for the start of experiments is now around 60% complete and the assembly stage of the project will soon start, paving the way for the first experiments in 2022. And to respond to Ms Rivasi’s contribution: it is true that the fusion will not be commercially available before the second half of the century and therefore does not enter into the portfolio of low-carbon technologies for our climate mitigation strategies up to 2050. However, climate change and decarbonisation of energy production are long-term challenges that will require viable and sustainable solutions, also post-2050. From that perspective fusion does offer attractive prospects for sustainable low-carbon energy strategies for the second half of the century, when fusion could come to represent a suitable complement to renewable energy sources.  The expected advantages of fusion in terms of low-cost fuel abundance and low environmental impact make its development worth pursuing from such a long-term perspective. All the international stakeholders in ITER are working hard to ensure that the project continues to make steady progress in accordance with the revised schedule that was set in 2016 and endorsed by the Council last year. With the continuous support of the European Union for the project in the next multiannual financial framework, the project should therefore reach crucial stages, contributing to building the energy, security and low carbon economy of tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  This item on the agenda is closed.

We need to bring in more and more energy sources, while our current consumption is not sustainable.

Such a radical challenge is likely to be answered only by a radical solution, since fine-tuning the existing system is probably not enough.

This is in order to allow the provision of services and to ensure the correct implementation of European policies of solidarity, cohesion and development. In my opinion, the promotion of e-government in relations between administration and the citizen is particularly important.

From Croatian experience, I can say that the procedures for reaching European funds have been further complicated at the national level.

We also fully agree on the importance of well-coordinated support, exchange of best practices and close cooperation with the Member States. The Commission has already recognised several suggestions in Parliament’s report and is working to follow up on them. For example, by appointing the structural reform support service as policy coordinator for public administration and governance, we will be able to ensure an even higher coherence of the Commission’s work in this area. The service will also work on a benchmark for administrative quality, on pooling and disseminating knowledge and good practices and on a closer dialogue with the Member States in this area.  The Commission is managing and will manage a number of technical support activities and reform projects in the area of governance and public administration. Specific support is also provided under cohesion policy to improve the administrative structures of the Member States for the management of the European Structural and Investment Funds.

Mr Figel'. I would like to express my sincere thanks, above all, to the political groups, but also to the co-rapporteurs for supporting my initiative for Parliament to address the issue of freedom of religion and belief in the world, with recommendations for change for european Union policies in this area. The situation of freedom of religion and belief in the world is very special. It is deteriorating and it can be said that even we could say that the 21st century is also the age of the instrumentalisation of religions for political purposes. In 2018, we started work on the report, five years after the Council adopted guidelines for promoting and protecting freedom of religion or belief. We also had our own contribution, because Laima Andrikienė prepared a report. In a way, today we are also referring to progress in this area. It has also been two years since President Juncker, in response to a European Parliament resolution of February 2016, appointed a Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion and Religion. This function is performed by Ján Figel'. It is also the year in which we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The European Parliament's draft report recalls the importance of the declaration of the right to freedom of religion and belief as a recognised international human right, a right defined in Article 18, which is also protected by Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The legal order of the European Union itself should also be mentioned here. This year marks 10 years since the Entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Article 21 is human rights in external action, including freedom of religion and belief. Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises the status of churches and religions and establishes an open, transparent and regular dialogue.  The report is systemic, horizontal. However, we pay particular attention to two cases, and here I thank you for supporting my amendments, which highlight the drama of the 2010 death sentence for alleged blasphemy against Islam by Christian Woman Asia Bibi in Pakistan. After her recent acquittal, we expect the Pakistani authorities to ensure her and her loved ones' safety. We hope that all this will be successful. We also condemn the imprisonment of the 2015 Sakharov Prize winner Raif Badawi for his alleged insult to Islam and call for his release. The main message of the report is that we are fighting for freedom of religion and belief for all. I would like it to sound good – freedom of religion and belief for all, because those who are most persecuted can benefit the most from it. Hard figures show that christians are the largest persecuted group. It is said that even more than 200 million. About 170,000 a year are killed. Parliament acknowledged this in its 2016 resolution on the mass murder of Daesh, describing it as genocide. Similarly, the US Congress has also confirmed this. This also applies to other minorities, such as the Yazyds. We also mention the Rohingya ethnic group in Myanmar. Many of these examples could be given here. We have adopted a number of recommendations in the report – first of all, we appreciate the achievements of the Special Envoy since 2016 and call on the Council and the European Commission to review the special envoy's mandate and provide adequate support to move from annual mandates to a multi-annual mandate, and to support the development of cooperation networks in all Union institutions and Member States. We also call for more effective implementation of the European Union guidelines, increased funding, training in the Union institutions for national diplomacy and also for Member States' diplomacy. We recommend that churches and religious associations be included in this process. We appreciate the financial support for projects dedicated to the promotion and protection of freedom of religion and belief from the Union budget, but we also point out that, in addition to the European Instrument for Democracy for Human Rights, these projects can be financed in the framework of conflict prevention, support for education and culture. We also call on the Council and the Commission to maintain adequate funding in the next financial perspective.  We note carefully the initiatives aimed at establishing an official International Day of the United Nations, which commemorates the victims and survivors of religious persecution. It is worth it for the European Union, whose founding acts place freedom of religion and belief among its fundamental values, to join an increasing number of countries supporting this initiative.

We very much share its spirit and the call to deepen our work on freedom of religion or belief outside the EU.  As the report stresses, freedom of religion or belief is dramatically under attack across the world. People of all faiths are being persecuted because of their beliefs. As the report stresses, discrimination based on faith is widespread. Legislative hurdles for registering religious groups are proliferating, as well as blasphemy and apostasy laws criminalising freedom of thought. As many of you stressed here, these are first and foremost violations of fundamental human rights embedded in the Universal Declaration that was approved just over 70 years ago. Faith cannot be imposed and it cannot be prohibited. The report stresses that these violations also undermine a society’s resilience. They hamper development and they foster instability and war. For these reasons, in the past year we raised our concerns about violations of religious freedom in more than 20 human rights dialogues with countries from the Middle East and North Africa and from several parts of Asia. Both the EU Special Representative for Human Rights and the Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief have been actively promoting this right worldwide. They both conducted several missions to engage with governments and religious actors.  I want to highlight the multilateral dimension of our work on this issue. The report underscores the necessity to keep working actively within the United Nations system and praises the current EU engagement. I can reassure you that in 2019 we will continue to honour this commitment. In all our dialogues we stress that all human rights are connected and that freedom of religion and belief must go together with freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, but also with women’s rights and LGBTI rights.  The report calls for stronger interinstitutional cooperation. Since the elaboration of the EU Guidelines on freedom of religion or belief in 2013, this has been a constant goal for our action. The best way to foster coordination is to have a common understanding of the tools available and the challenges we face. As the report emphasises, in order to achieve our common vision, we have multiplied training for our staff both in Brussels and delegations. In line with the report’s recommendations, we will keep engaging actively with religious leaders, scholars, faith-based organisations, non—believers and human rights defenders. The overall picture is not at all rosy, yet we still witness signs of hope. For instance, we have seen in 2018 some prominent freedom of religion and belief defenders freed from jail. In different parts of Africa faith leaders have led reconciliation dialogues. As we fight against the violations of freedom of religion and belief, we will also continue to support these signs of hope all across the world.

As much as he could within the possibilities he was given, and they are really not great.  The fact is that this mandate is only advisory. It is a contractual arrangement without regular salary, without staff and without a budget for work. I consider it essential to institutionally strengthen the mandate of the EU Special Envoy to promote freedom of religion or belief outside the EU. The lives of millions of Christians are at risk every day, they need concrete solutions and active actions from the EU.

It was an honor to have worked with these people specifically. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different parliamentary groups for their contributions and willingness to negotiate.  Gender inequalities in the European Union are a sad reality. Several times in this House are addressed and numerous resolutions have been adopted that identify the various dimensions of inequality between men and women and appeal to their fight. But let's be realistic. To combat them you need to have a gender perspective in all policies and not just statements of intent that change nothing.  One of the key areas for this fight is taxation. Women are under-represented in the labour market, with an overall employment rate 12% lower than men's, and of women working, a third do so only part-time. The gender pay gap is 16 % and in retirement pensions this inequality is 40 %. Years and years of cumulative effect of the various disparities. Not only do they earn less, but women are the ones who interrupt their careers the most and are the women who are most dedicated to caring for their children or family members with disabilities or permanent support needs. In the European Union, 80% of care is provided by formal carers of whom 75% are women. Direct and indirect taxation policies are also unfavorable to women. The regressive policies we have seen in recent years with regard to the taxation of labour, societies, consumption or wealth have weakened the redistributive capacity of tax regimes and have resulted in an increase in income inequality, as well as a structural change in taxation that has shifted the tax burden to lower income groups, particularly affecting women. With this report, we present specific recommendations to governments to address these inequalities in four distinct areas. Firstly, in direct taxation, whether in the taxation of the income of natural persons, in the taxation of companies or in the taxation of capital and wealth. Secondly, in indirect taxation, in particular VAT schemes which burden women when goods of first necessity and hygiene continue to be taxed as if they were luxury goods. Third, the impact of tax evasion and avoidance that directly affect the resources available to public services promoting equality par excellence. Fourth, finally, the integration of gender equality into tax policies, notably through regular assessments of the impact of gender tax policies. In this report nothing is impossible to execute if there is a real political will for women and men to be treated equally. That is the signal that should be given by Parliament tomorrow when it votes on this proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 164, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Ernest Urtasun", "mepid": "124972", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to begin by paying tribute – before entering the matter – to Pawel Adamowicz – the mayor of Gdansk, who has just died killed as a result of yesterday's attack – a true defender of rights and freedoms in this Europe threatened by the emergence of dark forces. Your murder is a European tragedy, and I want to begin my speech today by paying tribute to you and saying that your fight for freedoms and rights is the fight, and it will continue to be the fight, of all. I would also like to begin by thanking Marisa Matias for the preparation of this report, as well as for the teams that have made it possible for us to put, for the first time, a central issue, such as taxation, at the heart of gender equality policies. We cannot follow another minute in such a fundamental area, that it defines our model of well-being and our resources and how we deal, how we raise and how we spend our resources, without this being done without any gender perspective. And it's important because it allows you to go on the offensive on a gender equality agenda that must be extremely ambitious. I have to say that in the four years I've been here, we've had an extremely timid equality agenda. Most of the equality directives are stopped in the Council, either the Directive on the representation of women on the boards of directors, or also the whole process we had to carry out with the withdrawal of the Maternity Leave Directive, and also the difficulties we are having with the ratification of the Istanbul Convention. We have had an extremely timid equality legislature. And we need to be aware that, at the moment, there are forces emerging in a brutal way at European Union level, that fundamental principles are being questioned, such as gender-based violence, by political formations that are having a lot of votes in the European Union, such as, for example, we have just seen in Andalusia. And, by the way, I would like to congratulate all the people who will take to the streets in Spain tomorrow, in solidarity with the Andalusian women, after the aberrant agreement reached, which is also for the participation of that party is a real shame in the face of equality of people. But these forces are putting the fundamentals into question. We cannot be re-discussing whether or not gender-based violence exists. We need to go on the offensive, with a gender equality agenda that is really ambitious, combating violence, combating wage inequalities and including new forms of discrimination that have never been addressed. For example, taxation, which is what this report is about. And so start having public policies that analyze how our tax systems, both in direct and indirect taxation, address inequality is very important. And this report, for example when we talk about the issue of direct taxation, sets out how in many Member States of the European Union we have seen that the obligation to do so, the possibility of making taxation on joint income discourages the second supplier of that declaration from entering the labour market. And that is direct discrimination that encourages women to have difficulties in accessing the labour market. Or, if we are talking about indirect taxation – and that many movements, in many countries, in France and in other countries have pointed out – how can it be that, at the moment, products that are of first need for women are charged with luxury VAT? This is absolutely intolerable. And also, another of the things that report points out, which is very important. Let's see what the different consumption patterns are between men and women. And if you look at them, it's very clear that women currently endure more VAT on average than men. Therefore, neither the European Semester nor all the debates we are having on taxation, which have been very important in this mandate, can continue to become absolutely blind to the issue of gender equality and taxation. And that is why this report, and with this I conclude, calls for us to tackle this phenomenon in an ambitious way in the next parliamentary term and to recover that ambitious and courageous gender equality agenda, which is what the European Union needs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Michaela Šojdrová (PPE).", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   – Madam President, I understand the intention of colleagues who are trying to establish gender equality, who want to reduce the gender pay gap, but colleagues, this is not a good path that you have chosen.

Education and dignity shouldn’t be affected owing to zero access to basic health products.

That is, to give 3% of Greek GDP to lenders every year until 2022. In addition, an increased value added tax on basic foodstuffs, especially in the Aegean islands which are remote from mainly Greece.

Of course, a woman and a man are equal partners to me. However, in the case of tax policy, it is clear that their revenues are simply shared, and that is what the report also points to.

As was mentioned many times, taxation is a key element of public policy and is central to securing an efficient and stable economy in a fair and inclusive society.  Fairer taxation in the single market has been at the core of the Commission’s mandate. Also, gender equality is one of the fundamental values and objectives of the European Union. The current strategic engagement for gender equality includes a strong dimension aimed at mainstreaming gender policies throughout other Union policies, including taxation, without calling into question sovereignty and subsidiarity in this sphere. Parliament’s recommendations on how to take the gender perspective into account in taxation matters will contribute to modern tax policies capable of responding to the common challenges of an increasingly integrated economy with a clear social dimension. The importance of tax disincentives has been highlighted, especially in the Commission’s Communication on work-life balance which was adopted in April 2017. As set out in the Communication, the Commission has included the issue in the annual tax policy survey and considered it in the context of the analysis of labour taxation and its impact on inclusive growth. Supporting gender equality is an important element of the European Semester tool which is discussed in depth in many country reports. Several Member States received country-specific recommendations to tackle gender gaps in terms of employment rate and pay and pension levels.  This also covers addressing disincentives for second earners, usually women, to work or to work full time, including through taxation. This is currently identified as a challenge under the European Semester, notably for Germany and Belgium, to be specific. Taxation has furthermore a role to play in supporting gender equality, for example as a funding source of essential public services. In that context, we appreciate the support of Parliament. Direct tax policies cannot be based on the belief that households always pool and share their funds equally. On the other hand, indirect taxation depends on consumption patterns. It cannot be the aim of VAT or excise duties to encourage or discourage the consumption of specific products just because they are consumed more by either women or men.  Female hygienic products are obviously an exception. They are only consumed by women and they are a necessity. Therefore, Member States have the possibility to apply a reduced VAT rate to them, as they can do for food or care services.  That being said, the gender gap is often caused by a lack of adequate care services as well as working time arrangements or family leave, which allow those with care responsibilities to combine work with private life. Also, it is important to ensure an equal sharing of care responsibilities between men and women. Therefore, more needs to be done beyond tax policies to tackle gender equality. A comprehensive approach is needed based on a combination of legislative and non-legislative measures, and this is the approach of the Commission, for instance in our work-life balance package and the strategic engagement for gender equality. Let me conclude by emphasising that the Commission in its actions remains committed to promoting equal economic independence for women and men, closing the gender pay gap, which is still quite high in several Member States, advancing gender balance in decision-making and gender-based violence and promoting gender equality beyond the EU. Taxation is one of the important areas for achieving this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 171, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  This item on the agenda is closed.

Firstly, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, but above all the rapporteurs of the IMCO Committee and the Committee on Legal Affairs, both of whom have given a good opinion on my initiative report, which I will return to in a moment.  I would like to point out that this initiative report is not only about cars, but also about other means of transport, for example the metro, the train and the self-driving barges. This is an industrial development that we can certainly embrace. This is also a matter of European industrial policy, and in particular the spin-off to other sectors, as we have seen in space, is of great importance in the development of self-driving vehicles. This dossier is certainly also linked to the Europe 2030 innovation programme. At the same time, the united States, China, South Korea and even Israel are competitive here. They are all working to develop self-driving vehicles as soon as possible.  Another important aspect of this issue is road safety. I know that your colleague, Mrs Bulc, is very concerned about road safety: 90% of road accidents in Europe are caused by human error. When you talk about road safety, you also talk directly about the question of liability. Who is liable for the self-driving vehicle? And that is what our Committee on Legal Affairs has said valuable things about.  Another important point in this dossier is the psychology of the self-driving car. In other words, is the individual European citizen ready to surrender to a fully self-driving car? That will require some upheaval and some changeover from that citizen. I also call attention to the workers here. There are many employees in the automotive industry and associated companies who are concerned about their work on a fully self-driving vehicle.  I ask the Commission to pay special attention to the regulations. It is of the u-important importance that we in Europe should have one regulation so that self-driving vehicles, whether a train or a boat or a car, can leave the Member State without border problems. And I refer to the Amsterdam Declaration of 2016 and the work in Geneva to achieve world regulation.  Finally, the dates. There is a lot of discussion, including in the Committee on Transport, about data protection. On the one hand, we talk about the protection of personal data, the data of the car manufacturer and the data of the aftermarket. I invite the European Commission to develop a full balance for this.  Finally, of course, I invite the new Commission to include a good passage, a good chapter, on the development of self-driving vehicles within the European Union in the 2019-2024 programme.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 174, "date": "2019-01-14.json", "name": "Stanislav Polčák (PPE).", "mepid": "124704", "text": "   – Madam President, Commissioner, I note, of course, that automated mobility has the potential for many sectors by offering new business opportunities for start-ups, of course SMEs, which are at the heart of our interest, and also for industry and businesses as a whole, particularly in terms of creating new mobility services, as well as the potential to create jobs , which, however, also has the potential to potentially reduce it.

We must act now to shape this change and to make European mobility more sustainable, safer and more accessible. Action is necessary if we are to make European industry more competitive and European jobs more secure. These realities are very well reflected in the report prepared by Mr van de Camp, which supports more action, including at EU level. Let me say a few words about how to achieve sustainability. Transport is a major contributor to both greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Our commitment to fighting climate change thus requires the decarbonisation of our mobility. Cooperative and automated mobility is part of the solution, as it enables smoother traffic flows. My thanks for your support for this objective. Now on road safety. Not so long ago, Vision Zero – no road fatalities on European roads by 2050 – seemed an ambitious but distant vision. With the adoption of the Commission strategy on cooperative intelligent transport systems, we have reached an important milestone. With Mobility Package III, in addition to our fresh, safe system approach for road safety, we proposed a strategy that should help make the EU a global leader in automated mobility. This strategy is based on three pillars. First, a legal framework that creates a single market for automated mobility. Second, financial support for a sector-wide approach to research and EU—wide deployment. And third, an in-depth assessment of the socio—economic and ethical aspects of automated mobility. Vehicles become increasingly clean, connected and automated and ultimately driverless, with zero-emissions. At the same time, citizens’ demands in terms of mobility are growing and their attitude to mobility is changing. They want to shift seamlessly between different transport modes and enjoy easy access to travel information. Vehicles can become an integral part of multi-model mobility, providing first- and last-mile services and inclusive solutions for the elderly, the disabled and young people. But before we get there, we need to tackle issues related – as you mentioned as well – to security, data protection, fair and equal access to data, liability and ethical implications and the integration of automated vehicles into existing traffic, public acceptance, and our Skills Agenda. To progress on all these issues, I would like to highlight three elements for the many actions we have defined. Creating a single platform for cooperative, connected and automated mobility where all stakeholders come together to advance our ambitious agenda. The second pillar is setting up a joint undertaking for this cooperative, connected and automated mobility combining public and private efforts to accelerate the development and deployment of innovative mobility solutions. I have noted, and I thank you for, your support on this as well. Third, we propose to revise EU rules on vehicle safety and provide the relevant EU framework for the approval of automated and connected vehicles. Here too, I would like to thank you for your support, but I really call for discussions on the legal text to be finalised by the end of this Parliament. We really have no time to waste. As you can see, the future of mobility and the place of the end-user in it are at the centre of our thinking and our actions.
