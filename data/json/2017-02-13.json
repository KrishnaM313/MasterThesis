This resolution was passed by a large majority in committee. I also thank the Commissioner for taking part in today's debate in person, and I believe that his presence will be of great benefit to our subject. The use of pesticides affects us all. This problem is a problem that is, today I would say, many eyes in the European public, and it is rightly so, because in 2014 alone, according to Eurostat, over 395 000 tonnes of active chemicals used in conventional fuels were sold in the European Union. plant protection products. Not the preparations themselves, but 395 thousand tons of active substances, this is necessary to realize. Of course, pesticides are, of course, primarily intended for controlling plant or animal pests. So it is not surprising that they are mostly toxic substances. What is worse, however, is that they are also carcinogenic in many cases and are often capable of damaging human health and human reproduction. Undesirable pesticide residues are found everywhere in Europe today. In water, in soil and consistently, of course, in our own food chain. And some groups of the population, especially pregnant women, children and adolescents, are exposed to this chemical cocktail and have very little resistance to it. No one - not even me - will argue with the thesis that European farmers must be competitive, but no one must - and I believe will not - argue with the thesis that this must not be at the expense of the health of the European population. It is therefore clear that the most dangerous substances need to be regulated and phased out, while offering agricultural tools alternative tools. The agricultural sector can and must be given a range of tools under the integrated pest management system, including low-risk plant protection products. But our progress in this area is unfortunately too slow. This debate and the proposed resolution therefore focus specifically on one type of low-risk pesticide, namely biological pesticides, which can be a functional alternative to conventional plant protection products and can contribute to achieving sustainable and efficient agriculture. Theoretically, these pesticides are already part of EU legislation and should be preferred by this legislation, but this is unfortunately only on paper. As far as I know, only seven active substances classified as low-risk are currently approved in the European Union, and six of them are biological active substances. The long pre-market approval and registration process creates a major economic barrier for manufacturers. We believe that there is a need to increase the availability of low-risk pesticides in the Union, and in particular products of biological origin. Of course, the resolution also calls on the Member States because, under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, active substances are authorized at Union level, but the authorization of plant protection products themselves containing these active substances already falls within the competence of the Member States, namely it is necessary to realize. And Member States should include the use of low-risk, low-risk biological pesticides in their national action plans for the protection of the environment and human health than they have done so far. The motion for a resolution calls for greater use to be made of the various instruments, including pesticides of biological origin, in accordance with the principles of integrated pest management. The resolution also emphasizes, of course, that consumer demand for safe food that is affordable and produced in a sustainable way must be met. Barriers to an accelerated procedure for the assessment, authorization and registration of low-risk pesticides of biological origin are known. We know that the situation should change as soon as possible, and the proposal therefore calls on the Commission to present it by the end of 2018 a specific legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 beyond the review in the context of the REFIT initiative.I am aware, Commissioner, of your positive role in this area, and I would therefore like your answer to the following questions to be heard in this debate: What legislative and non-legislative measures are currently being discussed or adopted by the Commission to increase the availability of low pesticide biological pesticides?risk?What measures does the Commission intend to take in the future and what will be the possible timetable for these measures?Thank you in advance for your answer and I look forward to today's debate on low-risk biological pesticides.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2017-02-13.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to discuss with you today the topic of biological low-risk pesticides. Let me start by stating that biological pesticides are fundamental innovations that may provide our farmers with sustainable options to protect their crops and preserve biodiversity. For that reason, we in the Commission, like you in Parliament, all support this excellent objective. As you know, the Regulation for Placing Plant Protection Products on the Market requires a rigorous risk assessment of all plant protection products, and those of a biological nature are included in this assessment. Of course, assessing plant protection products means that biological substances are not automatically considered to be low risk. Indeed, micro-organisms and other natural substances can also be a danger to human health, so we need to look carefully at their properties and properly assess their risks in order to ascertain their safety. To obtain the strict status of a low-risk product, biological substances must meet additional specific low-risk criteria. The regulation provides for specific criteria and requirements for micro-organisms. It contains incentives to facilitate the placing on the market of low-risk products. The extent to which these incentives are sufficient will be assessed in the evaluation of the regulation, which, as you may know, we have started under the REFIT programme. The lack of availability of low-risk products depends on various stakeholders, from farmers to national authorities. Member States, in particular, have the responsibility of managing the sustainable use of pesticides and promoting greater use of low-risk pesticides and of all tools enabling the move towards greener agriculture. They should create better conditions for this to happen, and in particular they should launch awareness campaigns. As for the Commission, we share the view that it is important to take action to increase availability of low-risk products and to expand the toolbox for farmers with more sustainable options to protect their crops. To do this, we have assumed our own responsibility and we are currently working on three actions. The first is the funding of research and innovation in plant protection. Over the years, more than EUR 100 million has been invested in this area, and the Commission will continue to commit funding to the pursuit of sustainable solutions under the future research programme. The second concerns two regulatory acts. One is a Commission decision issued last September which prioritises the assessment of potentially low-risk substances for the renewal of their approval. When substances meet the criteria they will benefit from the relevant incentives in the regulation. The other is an amendment of the system for identifying low-risk substances. It will facilitate the identification of low-risk substances while fully safeguarding the high level of protection of health and the environment set in the EU regulation. I expect this amendment to be presented to the Member States for vote in March and then passed to the Council and Parliament for scrutiny. The third area of action concerns the follow-up to the implementation of current measures. In 2016 the Commission supported the initiative of the Netherlands Council Presidency to draft an implementation plan to identify key stakeholders with a view to increasing the availability of low-risk plant protection products. This plan was endorsed in the Council last June. It contains 40 actions for Member States, the Commission and stakeholders. Given that the authorisation of low-risk products is the responsibility of Member States, it is important that they play their part. The Commission is committed to working together with the Member States to implement the plan. Since the question which triggered this debate raises the issue of efficacy, let me highlight one of the actions identified in the implementation plan. The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation is working on a standard for assessing the efficacy of low-risk products. It aims to guide Member States on how to take account, in the efficacy evaluation, of specific benefits of low-risk products. The Commission encourages the creation of this standard and its implementation by Member States. To conclude, I am confident that the range of actions taken by the Commission will help to secure more sustainable alternatives for European farmers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 20, "date": "2017-02-13.json", "name": "Norbert Lins", "mepid": "124808", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.

Our aim is not to devalue conventional pesticides, but to support the availability of alternative pesticides of biological origin. Because plant protection products of biological origin with a low risk can represent a viable alternative for both conventional and ecological agriculture. The problem, however, is that there are lengthy approval and licensing procedures that must be followed before low risk pesticides of biological origin can be placed on the market. And this represents a considerable economic risk for the producers, who are often small and medium-sized companies and not chemical giants. The current approval procedures for plant protection products of biological origin with low risk are lengthy and take up to ten years.

However, my concern with this resolution is the narrow scope, with the focus only on biological low-risk pesticides when the resolution should be looking at all low-risk pesticides, in line with the Plant Protection Products (PPP) legislation. I would also highlight the fact that there are genuine concerns about efficacy. Many biological low-risk pesticides are just not very effective and this is why they struggle to get authorisation. I do not support fast-tracking these products through a simplified authorisation procedure if they do not work. The point of a pesticide is to kill the pests, and if farmers use a pesticide believing it will work and it does not work, the fact is that, in the seasons it takes to realise that, the pest can take hold, as we have seen with cabbage stem flea beetle in the UK, particularly with oilseed rape.

We must of course respond to this growing concern in Europe about the use of chemical pesticides and the risks they pose to health and the environment. It is time, it is urgent even to offer a more varied choice to farmers, hobbyists or Sunday gardeners. That is, in essence, the message we are sending with our resolution on low risk pesticides, whether microbial, plant or animal. Nothing justifies, indeed - and this was said by Mr. Poc, in particular -, that only six biological active substances classified as low risk are approved in the European Union. For comparison, there are over 300 in the world right now - in the United States and Japan, basically. We insist in our text on several points to unblock this situation, concerning the legal framework in particular. Our request is clear: firstly, that the Commission present us with a legislative proposal to put in place an accelerated procedure for the approval of biopesticides before the end of 2018 and, therefore, to make a more varied offer available to farmers who choose sustainable; second - and for home gardeners this time, but it is important too - to make biopesticides the preferred option alongside other non-chemical methods.

We have actually put six concrete demands on the table with colleagues and I would like to hear the Commissioner's reaction on this in a slightly more specific way. First, there is a need for an increase in the use of pesticides of biological origin. They must be available to a greater extent. Second, more research and development needs to be done, as they can be an alternative to conventional products. The Standing Committee for Plants, Animals, Food and Feed should actually accelerate the adoption of criteria for low-risk active substances. Third, the Commission, together with the Member States, should actually speed up the authorization, evaluation and registration of such low-risk plant protection products. Fourth, Member States should include the use of those low-risk biological pesticides in their action plans. That happens far too little. Fifth, the REFIT program that will review the Pesticide Regulation must not infringe food and public health safety.

Those who produce niche products and those who use them, it is not right that they face the same administrative and bureaucratic burden as those who do not pay for the passive externalities of their work. With molecules and pesticides of natural origin, it is possible to reduce the overall impact of treatments, thanks to reductions in emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases during production and a reduced impact on biodiversity and non-target organisms and human health.

Paradoxical of a regulation intended to promote them, these low-risk substances nevertheless struggle to obtain the necessary authorizations.

This is the reason why only seven – of course, six of them are biological – low—risk substances have been identified and have been in force from January 2016. However, the majority of potential low—risk substances approved under Directive 91/414 have been prioritised for a renewal assessment, which will be carried out in the next three years.

Representatives from this Parliament and the European Union Member States are working together with the Commission services and the European External Action Services towards a new European Consensus on Development. This would represent a paradigm shift in development cooperation under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and enable us all to better respond to the more complex and interconnected challenges the world faces today. This resolution, ably prepared by the Development Committee, is an important contribution to that discussion.  The European Union’s global leadership in development is nowadays needed more than ever, as underlined in the EU global strategy. The rest of the world expects ambition from us in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its sustainable development goals: an Agenda based on openness, multilateralism and the objective of shared prosperity. An ambitious new European Consensus on Development would be a very important part of our wider implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It will also contribute to supporting the implementation of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change.  I was glad to see this House calling the revision of the Consensus timely and necessary. The Commission presented its proposal for a new European Consensus in November, which provides the basis for the discussions ahead. A proposal for a shared vision and framework for action in development policy for the European Union and its Member States.  The Commission is looking forward to a successful conclusion of the discussions between the institutions within the first half of this year. This would allow for signature at our flagship event, the European Development Days in early June, and would provide the opportunity to present our new Consensus internationally at the United Nations High Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development in July.  Your resolution, like the Commission’s proposal, contains a strong affirmation on poverty eradication as the primary objective of EU development policy. This needs to come up clearly in the new Consensus. The resolution also recognises the challenges and opportunities posed by changes in the development landscape, including global trends, increased fragility and instability, and the 2030 Agenda. These would also need to be systematically addressed by our new Consensus. The resolution notes the changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty, which puts the objectives of development policy in the framework of the Union’s broader external action. In this context, among other things, the resolution highlights the necessity to find new ways of achieving development priorities in fragile and conflict-affected countries, including by linking up more closely with humanitarian actors.  Under the setup of the Lisbon Treaty, which aims at ensuring greater coherence of the Union’s policies and coordination with Member States, the principles of development effectiveness and policy coherence for development and the links with other policies, such as migration, security, energy, climate, gain ever greater importance. There is so much here that we can agree on. There are also issues which we will want to discuss in greater detail in the context of the upcoming tripartite discussions.

We know that DG DEVCO has a small unit on tax issues, but I wonder how much the wider tax issues of development are understood across the Commission, and how are you working across the whole Commission to get a proper tax policy that will deliver on the SDGs?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 53, "date": "2017-02-13.json", "name": "Charles Goerens", "mepid": "840", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the European consensus of 2005, which remains an essential reference in the field of development cooperation, is a collection of more or less precise principles and objectives, depending on the case. Let us also remember that the consensus is an interinstitutional agreement, approved by the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, which aims to give development policy a solid basis allowing the European Union to build a common future with its partners in the South. . Respect for the principles of the rule of law, non-discrimination and policy coherence, which ensures that action in the field of development is not frustrated by interventions in other fields, is at the heart even from the report that our colleagues Neuser and Wenta presented. The problem is less to agree on commitments in this area than to ensure that they are kept, and this is precisely where the shoe pinches: what is the commitment to bring official development assistance to 0.7% of GDP if it is not held? Would it not be wise to provide, in addition to the funding objective, a political mechanism capable of ensuring that it is respected? Failure to provide for this mechanism is to perpetuate the Arlesian approach, which consists of always announcing the same event, knowing that it will never happen. Likewise, policy coherence will remain a dead letter until an arbitration mechanism is put in place to decide when two or more departments diverge in an important area. Finally - and I should have started there - do we all have the same idea of ​​what \"the development policy of the European Union\" means?

So the European Consensus on Development must be based on three points. One, reinforcing the coherence of development policies, because these policies cannot remain a watertight compartment. We must be transversal, understand that all our policies have an effect on the global south, that is, we must be consistent. For example, our trade and investment policy must stop impoverishing and worrying only about the benefit of a few. We must bet on fair trade in line with human rights and with the benefit of all. Furthermore, we must develop binding human rights frameworks, that is, laws that ensure that everything that reaches European markets, for example, is not manufactured under exploitative conditions or stained with blood. As a second pillar, we must strengthen financing for development. And here we say that it is unacceptable that we have not yet reached the historic commitment of 0.7%. We must also support fair, progressive and redistributive tax systems in a universal way, and combat, once and for all, tax fraud. And finally, do not mislead the taxpayer, because official development aid has two objectives: one, the eradication of poverty, and two, the reduction of inequalities. Any other use, such as the control of migratory flows or outsourcing border control, is the misuse of public funds.

And if the Commission and the Member States have their way, in future development policy should serve migration and security policy, because since the migration crisis only our interior ministers have decided on Europe's foreign policy. Funds will be taken from the poorest of the poor and should now be available for the military and for border controls. Parliament cannot simply stand by and with this report is sending a very clear signal. The goal of development policy must remain the reduction of poverty. There are other instruments and other budgets for borders, for security, for the military. If we shift more and more funds and keep adding new priorities, what will remain for long-term projects in the future, what will remain for education, how much for agriculture? I'm afraid: not much. The report by Norbert Neuser and Bogdan Wenta also makes it very clear that the principle of policy coherence for development must continue to apply, as stated in the Lisbon Treaty.

This is happening while the European Union is addressing all the challenges caused by migration flows and while the European Union is under pressure. Development policy is about development. This might sound strange, but we have to repeat this concept, now more than ever. We have to repeat that development funds have to be used exclusively for development causes. We have to repeat that ODA cannot be used to finance security expenses, border control or military support. Of course terrorism must be fought in the most effective way, and of course borders have to be controlled, but not by diverting the funds devoted to development. Otherwise, poverty will never be eradicated, development will never be assured, and the root causes of migration and terrorism will never be tackled. It will be important to repeat this in the strongest and clearest manner during the structured dialogue involving Parliament, the Commission and the Council.

I did not believe we would get here if I am being very frank. Just before Christmas, when we were contemplating this being a committee vote, I really did not think we had the vote at all. And yet, lo and behold, here we are. And coincidentally, it is my birthday. It is not for me to suggest that passing this would be a perfect birthday present. But I might just hint that that would be a useful thing for us to be doing tonight. It is important to stress again that is 197 days since I was given this particular dossier to move forward. Many of you here will remember I resigned as well during that process but you did not accept my resignation. So here I stand and again I am very appreciative of all who helped that be achieved. I should also again give thanks to the former chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr La Via, whose wise counsel at various points stopped me going slightly off the rails, which was very helpful. I should also of course, as I look toward the front of the room and I see in the form of Mr Cañete, a gentleman I once described as the Father Christmas of the College of Commissioners because again he brought back from Paris quite an extraordinary agreement. And let us keep to the fore of our minds during both this debate and the vote that follows that we have indeed got to stick with Paris. How do we ensure that we can stop the rise in the temperature of the globe? It is a simple as that. We often lose sight of it, and I have more than once lost sight of it, in various amendments, in various elements of this particular package. But what we are really focused upon, and I believe we must be focused upon, is making Paris a reality. I know that the Council conclusions are not there yet. I know the Council is not yet ready to embrace this; but they will because they have to. And I hope that the agreement that we secure by passing this report will help move it in that direction, will help remind those Member States they have a commitment which they have signed up to, that we must deliver against the Paris ambitions. It is also important for me to stress each of the elements of the package. I have been describing it to others a bit like a Jenga tower. I am not sure if Jenga exists in all the Member States of the EU but broadly, it is a tower of various blocks, and again the game is for you to pull out different blocks, hoping that the whole thing does not topple over. Well here we are folks. The question is which blocks are you going to try and pull out of the agreement right now and will the tower remain standing? I do not know the answer to that. That rests, I suspect, more in your hands than it does in mine. But what I do stress is as you pull out each block, just remember: if that tower topples, we have to rebuild it and we will rebuild it in a much less favourable climate, literally, and will also rebuild it in a much more challenging way. So please be under no illusion, when you are considering which amendments you wish to pull out or push in, that we need to deliver a package that works for everyone together. It is important, I suspect, for all of us here; each of us has particular constituencies and constituency issues, but nonetheless we must come together to deliver what is required for the climate and indeed for the European Union. Let me also stress that we must make sure that the agreement is Brexit proof. But I will say no more about that but leave that for the negotiations themselves. This is bigger than Brexit, it is bigger that the EU. Let us get it right. Final point again. I have been very blessed by an assistant system called Ross McKenzie, who helped me deliver this particular package. He is soon to be leaving my team, which I think is a bit of a shame.

As rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in respect of its opinion and shared competences on a few of the sections relating to the EU ETS, I must say that I am pleased by the team’s devotion to delivering a broad majority in committee, where the report was supported by more than 80% percent of the members, as one of the main tasks for us was to make sure we did not trigger the cross-sectoral correction factor and that we did deliver a strong voice for the forthcoming negotiations in the Environment Committee. We can see that we have done that. The vast majority of the proposals we had in the Industry Committee’s opinion were actually accepted and on board in the Environment Committee proposal, and we are grateful for that and also for the cooperation we had with the Environment Committee team. It is good that we made sure to keep the carrot in front of the industry. They were pushing for more innovation but, at the same time, it is a fragile proposal, as Ian Duncan was saying. If we start taking bits and pieces out of this, it will not add up in the end. We will not create stable conditions for industry, and we will not meet the climate targets.

Also, as you said, we live in crucial times for climate policies, and following the historic achievement of the Paris Agreement, the European Union now needs to lead from the front. We need to deliver and put our commitments into a clear and binding framework.  The Commission has put several legal proposals on the table of the co-legislator, but the revision of the emissions trading system (ETS) was the first and has been debated the longest. The heads of state and government agreed in 2014 that the ETS is the European Union’s flagship climate policy and it is now time to show our citizens, our businesses, our society and the world that we are serious about making the ETS fit to meet our Paris commitments and our 2030 climate and energy targets.  We need to learn from experience and agree on a workable system that will do three things simultaneously: deliver the required emission reductions in a cost-efficient manner; protect vulnerable sectors in European Union industry; and support the clean energy transition where most needed.  This is the only way for the European Union to be credible when we are discussing with China, South Korea, Mexico and other G20 countries about carbon pricing and carbon markets. This is the only way to lead by example, showing how to drive emission reductions at the least cost to the economy, creating new opportunities for jobs and growth through innovation, and maintaining a competitive edge in Europe. Parliament has been working on this important file for more than a year and I am pleased to see the report is scheduled for a vote on Wednesday.  Forging agreement on the different aspects of the European Union ETS revision has been a very challenging task. I therefore again express my gratitude for the fine work undertaken by many of you present here this evening in Parliament. Multiple committees have been actively involved in the process. All views and angles have been discussed and weighed. The same topics are being discussed with Member States in Council. On some issues we can see signs of convergence between the co-legislators, which will be helpful in defining the final deal later on. The Council is also busy working towards establishing its position, enabling it to enter into interinstitutional negotiations. I am convinced that the political momentum is there to take decisions that will enable both co-legislators to start discussions. We need to bear in mind three key aspects which the revised ETS Directive must deliver and I welcome the fact that Parliament intends to send strong signals on all of these.  Firstly, we need to ensure that the ETS is fit to deliver the emission reductions to honour our Paris commitments, and Parliament is sending a clear message on the need to strengthen the European Union ETS via the doubling of the feeding rate of the market stability reserve. I see the importance of considering measures to strengthen the EU ETS which can ensure the carbon market functions and delivers the necessary emission reduction and innovation incentives. This is to restore the role we all want the ETS to play.  Secondly, we want to continue to build on our success in preserving the competitiveness of our industry and avoid the carbon-leakage risk and Parliament is enhancing in many ways the aspects of the Commission proposal catering for our businesses. We see the merit of the overarching objective of these amendments.  A notable aspect of this is the update of the benchmarks for free allocation. The report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety keeps the architecture of the Commission proposal with the flat rates and further enhances the role of verified data. It therefore rewards faster moving sectors by setting a maximum contribution and it ensures that the slower moving sectors also play their part by requiring a minimum contribution of 0.25%. Last but definitely not least, we want to increase the innovative power of the European Union ETS as a driver for investment in low-carbon technologies, and Parliament is discussing to send a clear signal on the need to boost the Innovation Fund for the benefit of European companies and to ensure that the Modernisation Fund spurs decarbonisation in lower-income Member States. When looking at these funds we need to be mindful of their effects on Member States auction revenues and favour elements that would bring the Council and Parliament together.  Thus Parliament is on track to set a constructive agenda for the interinstitutional negotiations. I encourage Members of the European Parliament to be constructive and to take the final step on Wednesday.

Thank you very much for that, Mr Duncan. This reform is key in terms of our commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It gives incentives to stakeholders from industry and the power sector, and it supports the best performers – those performers that strive for innovative and sustainable production techniques. But, at the same time, the new Emissions Trading System (ETS) and, in particular, the additions made during the vote by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, give guarantees to those sectors that are confronted with fierce international competition. Currently, a lot of attention is focused on the so-called carbon adjustment mechanism and, in particular, the fact that it will be targeted on particular sectors such as lime and cement. You will not be astonished if we say that we are not in favour of this particular proposal for several reasons. One reason is that it would be damaging for those cement and lime producers which export to countries outside the European Union. What is worse is that it would be implemented by means of a delegated act. For every true Member of this Parliament, I think that should be a no-go. Therefore we propose to support the proposal adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which is moderate and could be acceptable to all. Let us not forget that the cement sector continues to fall under the general system, meaning that the allowances will be attributed only to the 10% of best performers. So, as the Commissioner has said, the momentum is there to find a broad majority for a robust and balanced ETS. Let us choose the moderate option. Let us not jeopardise this proposal by focusing on one particular sector.

Thank you to the rapporteur Duncan for both your friendly way of leading the work and for all the humor you have shown and a big congratulations on your birthday. I hope that other groups will also listen to your important calls before the vote to keep this compromise together. On Wednesday, Europe will declare color. We have a historic opportunity to show that we are serious about our work against climate change and global warming. We have the chance to show now that Europe is serious, that we want to take the lead in a sustainable climate-smart society, built with new world-class fossil-free and smart technologies, that we understand that good climate work and economic growth are not opposites, but on the contrary belong together and are interdependent. Emissions trading ETS is the EU's single most important climate policy tool for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. ETS is absolutely central to our success. This means that ETS now plays a key role, not only for Europe but also for the world and for how we will live up to the Paris Agreement's ambitions to limit the temperature increase to well below two degrees. ETS is not a perfect system. None of us say that. Over the years, we have seen a number of errors and shortcomings in this system that need to be addressed, but that is what we are working on now, for a strong system that delivers. For us Social Democrats, there have been three principles that have been guiding: 1) to ensure that the ETS is really in line with the Paris Agreement and delivers for the climate, 2) that it is more fair and precise for the industry, so we get rid of the imbalances we have seen in the historical ETS and 3) that we also ensure that workers have the chance to be part of the transition to a climate-smarter society, so that it is fair. For us Social Democrats, the ETS is the single most important part of delivering after Paris. To do that, we must burst the emission bubble and then emission rights must be reduced by at least 2.4 percent each year. 2) At the same time, it is important for us that the industry is given the right tools to switch to climate-smart production without losing competitiveness, but on the contrary is strengthened. That is why we give more money to innovation so that companies can invest in greener solutions. 3) It is also important that climate change is solidary and does not increase class divisions. It must not be the case that those who already have the least are the ones who fall behind when society is modernized and becomes climate-smarter. That is why we Social Democrats demand a special social adjustment fund that provides support so that workers in all sectors and regions covered can follow this important adjustment in society. The vote on Wednesday is a baptism of fire for the EU's climate work. It is now that the EU must show that it is willing to act not only with nice words, but also with concrete measures to keep the Paris goals. For us Social Democrats, this is a matter of course and before the vote on Wednesday, there is an agreement that all political groups have signed. It is a compromise where everyone can give and take, but as a negotiator for the Social Democratic group, I know how sensitive such a compromise is. We take responsibility now and stand up for the compromise and think it is important on Wednesday. We stand up for the climate and ensure that the ETS becomes the climate legislation it should be and this is so important so now I got my last word ...

One in particular for us is the issue of Member States having final say over the use of their receipts from this scheme. In order to ensure their continued commitment, we would be rejecting the issues of fiscal sovereignty.  I firmly believe that any legislation should be based on robust evidence. Parliament should not simply add new components that have not been impact-assessed. If we are serious about reducing greenhouse gases, then the policy framework must be evidence-based and encourage industry to invest in low-carbon technology. Moving the goalposts or, at worst, scoring an own goal, will not do any good in lowering emissions in the long run.  We are particularly concerned about the late inclusion of a border-adjustment mechanism, added days before the vote in the Environment Committee, with no study on its impacts or costs.

With these words attributed to Winston Churchill, Secretary of State John Kerry made a very impressive speech in Marrakesh during the COP 22 last year. He made absolutely clear that we have to do what is required instead of just doing our best.  Those words went through my head many times during our negotiations. Are we doing our best or are we doing what is required? I am afraid we have not done that. Yes, we did improve the original Commission proposal here and there. We increased the ambition with a higher linear reduction factor. We do intend to cancel 800 million allowances and we found a way to limit the amount of free allowances given to industrial sectors with low trade intensity without endangering their competitiveness internationally.  But we have to be honest; we also watered-down parts of the original proposal. We lowered the annual benchmark, we lowered the threshold for qualitative assessment and we opened a door to lower the auction share.  The package that came out of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for me, is far from ideal, but it is the best that we could get out of it. Does it pass the Churchill test? Is it doing what is required? I doubt it.  Let us make clear what is in the Paris Agreement: two degrees and even if possible stay close to the one point five degrees. Two degrees means that we have only 20 years left of current global emissions. One point five degrees, we have less than five years left. That is close to nothing.

As a Green, I was happy to see how from the left to the right of Parliament they were embracing Paris. Well, we are now discussing the only climate tool we have for European industry. That is what we are discussing here, so this is now the moment when all those nice words on Paris should be translated into action.  Let us see what those words were worth, because we know that the current system is not functioning well enough and that is why, for example, one of the crucial elements is raising the linear reduction factor, which brings us a bit closer to Paris, just a bit. We are now at the low end of the two degree scenario. So that is what we are doing.  Anyhow, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety they managed to strike a deal spanning the political groups, from GUE to ECR – a broad agreement in the Environment Committee – and they all said yes to this package, and yes, it has higher ambition, which makes it good for us, but it also has a lot of additional protection for industry. It protects, in addition, the fertiliser and the steel sector. It has a higher innovation fund. It gives new benchmarks. It provides a compensation fund for indirect costs; all kinds of things added. This has all been put together now, and yet this package is being attacked again. Why? Because of one sector which is complaining.  Maybe, first, everyone should realise that the rule is auctioning. When we single out sectors we do that by making them free allowances. That is singling out. We want to do that for those sectors which have international competition. Looking at the cement sector, they have increased their exports because of the free allowances. They halted their innovation because they are dependent on those free allowances and therefore keep to high carbon cement, and they earned windfall profits of EUR five billion in the last phase.  That is what cement did with innovation, and that is what we are now going to address. We will put them back where they belong, outside free allocation. But we are giving them an alternative and that is the border adjustment measure. We are giving an alternative. We do not leave them on their own. That is exactly what we are doing.

But there has been very little debate on the real effectiveness of the ETS in reducing emissions. No one has explained to us, for example, how we can be sure that by applying a percentage reduction, the so-called linear reduction factor, i.e. the gradual reduction of the emission quotas assigned to the plants, a real reduction in emissions is achieved. I repeat a real reduction and not a virtual one. In fact, given that real emissions are known only the year after they occur, the only certainty that can be had is that plants that emit more than they are allowed will simply have to purchase additional emission permits to those previously received. Here is the most absurd, insane and distorted application of the \"polluter pays\" principle. But let's console ourselves since at least the ETS produces money by selling the shares. But whoever hopes that this money will be used to finance measures to compensate for emissions that are already in the atmosphere, are mistaken, it is just an illusion, there is no obligation for Member States on this. Not to mention the trading of securities on the financial market, which will continue to represent a mere profit for speculators. But there is more: we asked the industry what CO2 price was convenient, according to them, to invest in structural improvements to apply the best technologies, considering a CO2 price subject to fluctuations. Everyone, without exception, admitted that they are unable to make these assessments and that they have no incentive to make major investments in the absence of stability.But wasn't the ETS supposed to incentivize low-carbon innovation?In short, the system does not work.From our point of view, the more ambitious and binding targets on renewables, efficiency and energy savings could bring much more concrete and immediate results.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 91, "date": "2017-02-13.json", "name": "Mireille D’Ornano", "mepid": "124750", "text": "on behalf of the ENF group. - Mr President, we reject the reform relating to greenhouse gas emission quotas, both for legal reasons and in principle.

A climate ambition, first. Contrary to what the Commission boasts, the Emissions Trading System (ETS) has so far failed to decarbonize our economy at a lower cost. The variations in greenhouse gas emissions came mainly from the economic crisis and from national energy transition choices independent of the ETS. Moreover, everyone agrees that the current price per tonne of CO2 is very insufficient to encourage low-carbon investments in manufacturers and electricians. This strongly depressed price responds to the gigantic surplus of allowances in the system - between two and three billion tonnes. This is why it is important, in the name of consistency with the commitments we made in Paris, to tighten the tap more strongly by voting a linear reduction factor of 2.4% and removing a quota of 800 million euros. tonnes of surplus allowances. An industrial ambition, too. I come from the working-class world, I know the quality of our industries and the competence of our workers, but it is wrong to claim that it is by the simple extension of the status quo, that is to say by widely distributing quotas free, that we will relaunch investments.

Very often - too often - the proceeds from the sale of these quotas received went directly into the pockets of shareholders. We must therefore put an end to these abuses.

First, the exclusion of the cement sector from the list will make many Member States' exports uncompetitive vis-εκτός-vis countries outside the system. In particular, the Greek cement industry, with 13,000 employees and a trade intensity of 45%, ie more than multiples of the 10% limit, will lead to withering and disappearance. Secondly, the eligibility of new projects to be financed by the newly established Modernization Fund must be based on 2015 or at most 2014 in order to reflect the current economic reality in the Member States. Thirdly, with regard to the integration of shipping into the emissions trading scheme, any regulation at regional level is likely to have an adverse effect on the industry at European level. Our goal should be the timely establishment of a similar system at the level of the International Maritime Organization.

The present report provides for the energy-intensive stone and ceramic industries to be removed from the carbon leakage list and for border adjustment measures to be introduced. Changes are necessary here and I would like to give you an example of why these changes are necessary. The purchase of emission certificates alone costs the Austrian cement industry EUR 80 million a year. That is a cost increase of 20% of the total turnover in the industry, even though, according to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Austrian cement industry has the lowest CO2 emissions and by far the highest level of utilization of alternative fuels and is the leader in innovative technologies for reducing emissions. It can be doubted that immature and untested border adjustment measures offer sufficient protection and compensation against imports from third countries. It is also questionable whether this measure is WTO-compatible at all. And one thing is clear: The competitiveness of cement, lime, brick and glass products compared to building and basic materials is falling, and the price of the products is rising. Carbon leakage is therefore also investment leakage.

In principle, the report does both. But we have a big exception with cement and some other products, and that gives us stomach ache. We therefore urgently want a change at this point. The mechanisms that have been proposed, and which some colleagues now support, are shaky. We do not know whether we can enforce it. At the same time, we also do not know whether such a tightly tailored border tax adjustment only for cement, on the basis of a delegated legal act, is not going to fall short. If we do that, then maybe we should reserve it in case other nations, like the United States, pull out of climate protection completely.

Let me make a few points which are worth making. The Emissions Trading System (ETS) is not working well right now: that is the first point. The second point: Paris changes everything. The third point: we need to offer to our industry sensible protection but we must expect from them sensible efforts as well. It is also important that this is a stepping stone to a serious trilogue. I was trying to think of a way of combining all of these points with regard to their urgency. I too was in Marrakech for the climate change talks.

Halfway between the conference centre and my hotel I was faced with a serious choice: I could try and go backwards and hope that I made it in time or I could try to go forwards to get to my hotel and try to make sure that I got there without soiling myself. In fact, that is what we have before us right now. The real challenge is to get to our hotel and get to that lavatory because we have got to avoid making a mess.

It is in this spirit that the concept of the Modernization Fund has been formulated, according to which those Member States that will be exposed to the most additional costs due to the new rules will be entitled to a share of the proceeds from quota sales to develop and modernize their obsolete assets. In my opinion, the administrative structure for the Modernization Fund set out in the ENVI Committee is opaque and dangerous. A well-prepared system of criteria can adequately enforce common expectations, and an overly complicated administrative structure is unnecessary. It also violates the principle of subsidiarity and creates further tensions by entrusting parties not involved in the assessment of projects, thus separating decision-making and implementation.

However, in addition to ensuring that environmental objectives are met, the legitimate interests of the productive sector must also be taken into account throughout the negotiations, as the displacement of energy-intensive sectors could put Europe at a competitive disadvantage. It is also important to avoid placing a disproportionate burden on some players in the European industrial sector, while giving others undue advantages. I hope that the plenary vote will lead the report in the right direction and that a balanced parliamentary mandate will be adopted before the trialogues, properly reflecting the above considerations.

In my opinion, this time we have managed to create a comprehensive, very substantive report, which is an excellent complement to the material of the European Commission, with many suggestions and comments. The report reaffirms the role of EU competition policy as an essential tool for creating a strong and efficient internal market, as well as a key policy for economic growth, innovation, resource efficiency and the European social market economy. Europe's future is based on these elements, and guaranteeing a level playing field is critical. The report, which covers a number of topics, also shows two points, namely across chapters. One is the social dimension, as we considered it important to remind Member States of the extent to which strictly complied with but also socially sensitive competition policy rules can have a positive impact on the lives of European citizens, consumers, workers and businesses. The other is the subject of tax justice. We reaffirm our commitment to tax justice, which is essential for the integrity of the European single internal market, and emphasize that all market participants must pay their share of the tax, where that profit has been made. The report acknowledges the need to put an end to unfair tax competition between Member States, as well as to aggressive tax planning, illegal tax optimization and selective tax incentives that make it impossible for the main sources of innovation, small and medium-sized enterprises. I am glad that the pursuit of tax justice has become such an important part of the report, as it is an essential condition for a fair competitive environment. In addition, the text calls for fiscal convergence, which would significantly strengthen the Union's economic cohesion and competitiveness. In addition to tax issues, we also focus on the digital single market. We also underline the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in the digital single market, which is why the report commends the Commission's investigations into anti-competitive practices by internet and telecoms giants. With regard to the digital single market, I considered it important to highlight the issue of shared businesses. This economic model has been in place for a number of years and offers a number of innovative products and services to EU consumers. It is not an easy situation for the Commission when many people want to mix the same services together. And although we all know, but for the sake of example, I will mention that Uber is not a taxi and Airbnb is not a hotel. These are platforms, which, however, would have to pay tax in the same way as the service providers who use them. The report also advocates the paramount importance of net neutrality and confirms that, although a very important step, the elimination of roaming charges within the EU is not enough: intra-EU calls must be regulated at the same level as local calls. That is why our report calls on the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal to regulate calls within the EU. With regard to state aid, the report emphasizes the increased responsibility of Member States to the Commission for aid granted without prior notification. In addition, we emphasize that temporary state aid in the financial sector was needed to stabilize the global financial system, but it must be reduced as soon as possible or completely abolished and monitored as soon as the banking union is fulfilled. I also consider it important to underline some other points in the report. Corruption in public procurement procedures has a serious market-distorting effect on European competitiveness. Energy and in the case of environmental investments, they may be particularly detrimental and adversely affect the proper functioning of the Energy Union and the achievement of the Union's environmental objectives. Accordingly, we urge in the report that all state aid related to energy and environmental investments and all irregularities related to public procurement procedures, such as the disputed expansion project of the Hungarian Paks Nuclear Power Plant, be closely monitored and thoroughly investigated. The report also discusses the importance of transport infrastructure and addresses the interests of consumers and producers, thus taking particular account of the special situation of the agri-food sector and paying close attention to enhanced cooperation between national competition authorities. I therefore believe that the text points as far as possible to the shortcomings of competition policy, both to the Member States and to the Union. I am convinced that, through the recommendations and calls, the Member States can make a significant contribution to economic growth, the creation of quality jobs, innovation, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and tax justice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 136, "date": "2017-02-13.json", "name": "Margrethe Vestager", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the House very much for inviting me here today and I would especially like to thank Mr Szanyi for his draft report. I think it sums up very well why competition matters. As it says, competition policy is the cornerstone of the single market. It should make it work. State-aid rules give every company a fair chance to compete, and anti-trust and merger rules make sure that the markets serve the public, not just big companies. Last year we found that four truck companies, well actually five truck makers, which together sold nine out of every ten medium and heavy trucks in Europe, had colluded for 14 years to raise gross list prices and delay the launch of green technology.  This sort of cartel can make a lot of money for the companies involved. It is their customers who pay the price. So it takes firm action to make sure that companies have nothing to gain by breaking the rules. That is why we fined those five companies, five businesses, nearly EUR 3 billion, the largest cartel fine in the Commission’s history. Meanwhile, our case is continuing against a sixth company that would not settle. But enforcing these rules throughout Europe has to be a team effort, involve national competition authorities as well as the Commission and that can only be effective if everyone has the powers that they need. So I fully agree with your recommendation that we should propose EU legislation to make sure that they have the right powers. We have had the same message from our consultations and our impact assessment. So we are now working on a proposal that I hope to be able to present before summer and I firmly expect that we can fully involve Parliament. As well as anti-trust cases we deal with mergers that are reshaping global industries, like the one that will now reduce the six biggest producers of seeds and pesticides to just three. These transactions can affect each and every one of us because seeds and pesticides, crop protection, they are the beginning of the food chain. It is important that this sector continues to develop new products that correspond to the regulatory requirements in Europe and that they will sell these products at competitive prices. It is important for farmers, for the consumer and obviously for the environment. That is why my services are looking into these mergers in great detail. Each of them will be assessed on their own merits and will only be allowed to proceed if they do not impose any impediment to effective competition. When it comes to state aids our cases on tax rulings show that no company, however big and powerful, can avoid paying its fair share of taxes. I fully share the approach in your draft report. We have taken four final decisions, so far, that deal with illegal state aid through tax rulings. Of course, these decisions are based on the evidence and the rule of law. And we have taken forward more cases involving Amazon, McDonald’s and Engie in exactly the same spirit.  At the same time we will continue our investigation into tax rulings in every Member State. And we are always ready to work with Member States to make sure that state aid does not come up in the future. It is good to see that Luxembourg has brought in much stricter rules on the taxation of financing companies. We were happy to discuss that with the national authorities and we are happy to do that with anyone that wants to. When it comes to banks our state-aid rules are there to support troubled banks when it comes to the same terms throughout Europe. We apply the same rules, in the same way, to every bank, in every Member State. Now European banks are far more stable than they were a decade ago. But in spite of the improvements some banks in Europe are still struggling to deal with non-performing loans from defaulting borrowers and the Commission is working with those Member States and banks where non-performing loans remain to help banks gradually reduce them. European banks need to put the legacy of the crisis firmly behind them. Last but not least, renewable energy is important – just thinking about the debate you have just had. Competition can help us bring down the cost of our transition. Since the start of this year all new support for large renewable plants has had to be given through a tender. Pilot tenders have already shown how much we could save. In Germany tenders have brought down the price of supporting solar energy by 25% in the last year and a half.  Meanwhile the sector inquiry report on capacity mechanism, which we published in November, will help Member States to keep down costs on making sure that there is electricity when demand needs it.  If the costs of funding renewable energy would make an energy intensive sector like the steel sector uncompetitive, well, state-aid rules do not stop a Member State compensating that part of the cost, because the competition rules are here to support European competitiveness, not to undermine it. An open single market with fair competition, well, that helped to cut the cost of input and it helped businesses to grow big enough to compete throughout the world and this is what we want to see and to do. And through our free trade agreements, including the agreement with Canada, we are encouraging countries around the world to reduce subsidies and to use subsidies more responsibly because competition works.  This is the message of our enforcement work and I think it is also the message of your report. I welcome it and I am very happy for the support. Because the Commission will keep working to enforce the competition rules, taking forward the three Google cases and continuing to work on the case against Gazprom so consumers and businesses do not pay inflated prices for gas. We will use all our powers to make sure that the single market remains open and fair and in that, of course, we need to work together.

Colleagues, you may think Formula One is just for petrol-headed adrenaline junkies but actually it is important for our economy as well. In ‘Motorsport Valley’, which stretches from the southeast of England into the Midlands, motorsports provide around 40 000 jobs. These are at risk. A few weeks ago, one team, Manor Racing, became the latest to collapse after administrators could not find a buyer. Smaller teams in Formula One are punished by rules that guarantee bigger teams prize money, even if they finish last.

In 2008-2009, special state aid rules were approved by the European Commission, which must allow Member States to rescue their banks. This European Parliament has actually been asking for six years that we end this temporary state aid completely. That is also the logic of the new rules of the banking union, that we will opt for bail-ins instead of bail-outs in the future. Because what are we seeing in Italy today? That the rules were first bypassed and now they are even simply ignored. And that creates a lot of annoyance among the population, a lot of anger about those bail-outs of the banks. But what do we see? That enormous profits have been built up in the past and that they have ended up with the wealthy bankers, while the losses have to be borne by the common people, by the taxpayers, and that is no longer possible. Look, I don't mind if people earn a good living by working hard, but then they also have to bear the risks and the losses. We need more responsibility.

But I want to focus here on the Google case because, seven years after the Commission announced allegations of antitrust violations by Google, we have a spent a lot of time on this. Certainly, EU regulatory time does not correspond to the necessity and urgency of the companies in the real economy.  I am aware, Commissioner, that a lot of time was lost by your predecessor, Mr Almunia. These years of unproductive settlements, discussions and delays in the still-ongoing investigations have left competitiveness in the online search market severely damaged. But, at a certain point, a decision has to be made one way or another. That is why, in this report, we call on the Commission to finish all Google antitrust investigations. Let me recall two recent facts. Last December, Foundem, the first complainant in the shopping case, had to close its shopping comparison website, and Yelp also closed its European businesses. This is how the behaviour of Google impacts on companies. Ms Vestager, may I suggest to you that your provisional decision, which I hope will come in the next weeks or months, should impose a record—breaking fine on Google. You need to show companies that they cannot be rewarded for losing time because, in the last two years, Google’s attitude and behaviour has caused more damage to complainant companies. When it comes to remedies, may I suggest that all companies sit down with their technological experts, together with the Commission, to try to find non—discriminating future-proofed remedies.

This has been a priority of our Group since the beginning of the legislature: the fight against oligopolies of distribution and commercialization companies, which obtain juicy profits at the cost of food speculation and the exploitation of small farmers. As pointed out in the report, tighter supervision of agricultural markets, with the participation of representative organizations, is necessary to stop the plundering of the European countryside. We value positively the references to the fight against fiscal dumping, the denunciation - once again, at our initiative - of the plundering of Spanish preferentialists, or the need to fight against the pharmaceutical oligopoly. But nevertheless, I think the report is too accommodating. I am concerned that, dazzled by the fight against tax deals - which are limited, for the moment, to a handful of companies and which have not demanded political responsibilities from Messrs Juncker or Dijsselbloem - we are whitewashing the reality of a policy that, Today as yesterday, it was designed to deregulate and privatize markets, leaving large companies, and not the public sector, to define the future of strategic sectors.

Indeed, these are important areas that we have to deal with. I would like to point out three other issues. The first is a question that will come to us, that will come to you, Commissioner: the Bayer-Monsanto deal that is coming up. If that happens, the world's largest seed and crop protection company will emerge. Then we have to quickly check whether a monopoly situation arises here, which would mean a major problem for agriculture, for farmers, for seeds, for diversity and not just for competition. I would ask you to come here for the exam in 2017 very quickly. The second case is Paks, the nuclear power plant, where it is still not clear whether the aid, the loan that Putin is granting and which is to be repaid, violates competition law or not. We should come to a decision as quickly as possible in the interests of the whole of Europe. The third topic that is close to my heart is booking.com, the booking platform that distorts competition in the hotel sector in Europe. Individual nation states have already undertaken tests.

But I believe that, once again, the opportunity has been lost to go to the general problem, to the structural problem of competition within the European Union. Within this system, the term competition translates into the ruthless competition of the strongest who makes the rules and molds them according to his own system on the weakest. Competition within this single market is highly distorted by the rules and has destructive effects on the economies of weaker countries. Some examples: the first, the most obvious is the single currency which creates distorted competition between countries that enjoy a devalued effective exchange rate and therefore, to help their industrial system, can export their products more easily and more affordable, and countries that have to operate with a real exchange rate that is too high for the strength of their economy. Another issue where competition is distorted is that of banks, on state aid. A country like Italy is criticized for the weakness of its banking system and has to knock and deal with the Commission for a few billion euros, to save citizens' savings and instead, before and after 2008, larger countries gave hundreds billions of euros to save their banking systems: four hundred billion in Germany between direct and indirect guarantees, about 200 billion in France and the United Kingdom. This is not fair competition. Even on the issue of banking union, there is no competition. A distorting system of rules that rewards a more risky business model, such as that of derivatives and level 3 assets, which are not adequately considered by the Commission and that of credits which are instead punished.If the European Union goes on like this, destruction is inevitable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 147, "date": "2017-02-13.json", "name": "Ελευθέριος Συναδινός (", "mepid": "125072", "text": "NI). - Madam President, the Union's competition policy has achieved representative results, such as Brexit, the Volkswagen, Ferrostaal, Deutsche Telekom, Siemens scandals and the Luxembourg tax haven. It flooded Europe with illegal immigrants to find cheap labor, without insurance and employment rights. This is not a Union, but an amateur factory. Unfair competition between companies prevails and policies are imposed in the interest of specific states. It pushes small and medium-sized enterprises to move their headquarters to other countries, as is the case with many Greek companies. A framework for business development support must be created, without abusive terms. This leads to balance, prosperity and peace. A simple example is the implementation of a low corporate tax policy, with tax rates on profits and a grace period for new or innovative businesses.

Competition not only gives consumers more choice but should also provide the level playing field that is needed so that start-ups will scale up in Europe and not elsewhere. The online world is expected to create more competition in Europe. Therefore, it is crucial to improve access to goods and services, to eliminate unlawful obstacles to online competition and to ensure that online shopping is barrier free. Only then will we be able to stop the building of monopolies and prevent illegal access to content. Ending unjustified geo-blocking practices is one concrete step in the right direction but I believe it should be done in a way that does not hamper SMEs and start-ups, and does not raise prices for consumers, especially in newer Member States. This is one of the many reasons why I believe national competition authorities should work together with the Commission.

Competition rules, especially for state aid, should not be applied on a one-size-fits-all basis – that still holds. But during this mandate the need is arising to highlight new precautionary signals.  Firstly, European competition policy should avoid the appearance of a frontal contest with other administrations via the application of huge two-way fines on a tit-for-tat basis. Secondly, applying state-aid rules to the tax policies of Member States may help to combat tax avoidance, but it overrides the tax sovereignty that Member States still have under the Treaties. The flexibility of Member States in setting their tax policies has to be confirmed. Thirdly, there should be concern about a competition policy that is administered through an agency which defines such policy, investigates alleged breaches and itself decides on them with the power to set fines. Fourthly, given the ongoing current political and economic changes in Europe and beyond, competition policy needs to be kept under constant review.

There are areas where cartel fines cannot be imposed, but where we may be able to provide better consumer compensation.

Furthermore, I would like to recall the demand made on several occasions by Parliament for the establishment of a legislative framework to combat unfair commercial practices. It is urgent that competition law no longer poses a threat to farmers and their producer organizations. This is the responsibility of the European Commission.

We first called on the Commission to conduct a proper inquiry four years ago. Even years later, the Commission itself is beginning to admit that double quality can be an unfair practice and therefore contrary to EU law.

Unfortunately I will not be able to give each and every one an individual answer. One of the important things for me is for our rules to be an enabler. For instance, when Mr Schwab calls for tourism in state aid we will be more than happy to give guidance on where state aid is absolutely allowed, where it is no economic activity but allowing people to be acquainted with the region, to know what to do to find the businesses who do have the economic activity. That, I think, is the important thing. I also very much look forward to the debate with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development because I think that we can meet one other to ensure jointly that we have a very competitive sector in which we use the means of competition and, at the same time, allow for a more balanced approach in sectors where many, many small suppliers are facing very heavy-duty negotiators on the other side of the table. I look forward to addressing these issues. Some of you have mentioned the tax issue. It is, of course, obvious that every Member State is sovereign in setting the level of their corporate taxation. If we want European tax legislation it will be through the front door, via the Council, with unanimity. In the same treaty that gives Member States the serenity to set their own tax level, we have very strong rules that say you cannot give a company, or group of companies, selective advantages. Selective advantages, paid for by taxpayers, ruin fair competition and, in particular, do not give small and medium-sized businesses a fair chance of making it in the market. Therefore, obviously, the Commission will also continue its work in relation to fiscal aid – a.k.a. tax and state aid. Some of you have been asking about the ongoing merger control procedures in two of three mergers in seeds and pesticides, or ‘crop protection’ as they call it. We will, of course, be as firm and as insistent as always to make sure that we have competition in this sector both for seeds and for pesticides. This is the very basis of our food chain and obviously we need competition there as well, and we will thoroughly investigate these mergers, including that of Bayer and Monsanto if we are finally notified of this. On the Google case, I very much appreciate the insistence, because these are important cases. We are dealing with fast-moving markets and, as was mentioned, we have companies which suffered while the investigation was ongoing. Therefore, we are doing our utmost to deal with the responses that we now have had to the statement of objection, and to examine them in detail to make sure that we give this company, like others, the right to defend itself, because that is important. As was mentioned, there is, of course, also a need for checks and balances when it comes to the Commission competences in enforcing competition law, and for the Court to be able to overrule our decisions. Therefore, our work should be thorough and expert, while, of course, speed is a very important challenge for us, precisely because, as was mentioned, these are fast-moving markets. Last but not least, we hope that the digital single market will not keep being mentioned as a separate part of the single market, but will come to be seen as a fully integrated part of the single market, because it offers a lot of choice for consumers. As you may know, we have opened three new cases in the field of digital business in order to make sure that every business has a fair chance of making it. These are in video games – part of the holiday business – and our aim is to make sure that consumers get the choice they should have.

It has been a great joint work in favor of equal rights. When we talk about gender inequality, we tend to think of the embarrassing salary gap, the ridiculous presence of women in decision-making positions or the great scourge that shames us: gender violence, whether physical or psychological. But we seldom think about how this inequality affects our daily life, our well-being, our health and especially our mental health. Did you know that biomedical research and clinical trials on drugs and treatments do not take into account that half of the population is women? That they do not take into account the biological, physiological and psychological differences between men and women, beyond their reproductive systems? I became aware of this problem some time ago when, on a visit to a hospital, a nurse told me about her experience. Hospital staff were concerned because she did not understand why many patients who had survived a heart attack returned to the hospital after a year and died shortly thereafter. The same hygienic conditions, the same monitoring mechanisms ... Medical histories, family precedents and other risk factors had been taken into account. But it took them time to realize that most of the patients who relapsed and died were women, because cardiovascular disease is more common in women than in men, and previous research lacked that approach. In mental health the problem is very well observed. There are considerable gender differences in patterns of mental illnesses, especially the most common ones: depression and anxiety, for example, mood disorders that any of us know firsthand, are almost three times more prevalent in women than in men. One in ten workers, for example, in the European Union has asked for a depression leave: that costs about 92 million euros a year. Mental health is also linked to employment and investment. The report we are discussing today fearlessly addresses these issues and others equally relevant, such as the devastating and lifelong effects that gender-based violence has on the mental health of victims, such as the prejudices that still exist against LGBTI people and that they condemn deteriorating mental health or as the urgent need to apply the guidelines on protection and support of the mental health and psychosocial well-being of refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in Europe. But when we talk about gender equality and health, it is imperative that we speak openly about abortion. Conscientious objection by physicians cannot endanger the health and freedom of a woman who requests a voluntary termination of pregnancy. It is simply unacceptable that in Italy, for example, more than 70% of doctors refuse to practice it today, despite being protected by law. We want to ensure that there is a minimum number of health professionals available to perform these medical interventions, which guarantee access to sexual and reproductive health services in all countries of the Union in accordance with current legal standards. The European Union is bound by its Treaties to guarantee the protection of human health as part of all its policies and to collaborate with the Member States to improve public health, prevent diseases and eliminate sources of danger to physical and mental health.

It is clear that we need to take gender into account in mental health.

But the rapporteur has produced a very bad report on this topic here. A large part of this report is based on fake gender ideological claims. It certainly is not scientific research; for example, recital O, which says that ‘whereas transgender identities are not pathological, but are deplorably still considered mental health disorders’, and that this is a diagnosis that causes distress to those receiving it. True scientific research should be carried out which is examined by specialists and not used for political ends. Politics should not dictate what changes are made in medical text books. Recital R refers to ‘gender-variant prepubescent children’. What are we doing confusing our children by encouraging them to choose their sex? This is a recipe for mental health problems. It is true that suicide is a huge problem among young men especially, but the cause is not the stereotyping of the two sexes.

I hope that we share the very fundamental principle of equality between men and women, which was established in the treaties as one of our most important goals. The Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019 is the Commission’s commitment to specific measures to promote gender equality. We are particularly grateful to this House for raising awareness of the differences between men and women in the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders and health in general. As you know, the health programme explicitly provides for the mainstreaming of gender equality in all actions promoted by the programme. Thus the Commission supported Member States’ cooperation on mental health with a Joint Action on Mental Health and Well-being under this programme. It resulted in a European Framework for Action on Mental Health and Well-being. This framework addresses gender differences, highlighting for example the different prevalence of depression between men and women. A recent call under the health programme invited proposals for projects on improving access to mental health care and mental health literacy. The Commission is also organising, on behalf of the Parliament, a pilot project to improve the understanding of sex and gender differences in chronic diseases, using coronary heart disease as one example. We fully agree with the resolution that mental health needs to be enshrined in a holistic patient-centred approach, for example addressing the impact of cancer and other major chronic diseases on patients’ mental health. In relation to research and innovation, we need to do more to address the gender dimension as reflected in Horizon 2020, the EU Research and Innovation Programme and, in particular, the work programme and the health—related calls for proposals. Over several EU research programmes the Commission has founded many research projects, specifically addressing diseases affecting women, such as breast cancer, osteoporosis and endometriosis. The Commission also founded several research projects under the Seventh Framework Programme with over EUR 5 million devoted to supporting endometriosis research, to which the report specifically refers. We must also continue our work to eradicate all forms of gender—based violence, including female genital mutilation. In addition, the new Clinical Trial Regulation, which will become applicable in 2018, provides that subjects participating in a clinical trial should represent a population group likely to be treated with the medical product under investigation in the trial. This includes gender, age, and, where relevant, subjects with specific needs. A further initiative that I would like to mention here is the Horizon 2020 Birth Day Prize that was launched in 2016. The Horizon Birth Day Prize will be awarded to a solution that best demonstrates a reduction in maternal or newborn morbidity and mortality or stillbirth during facility—based deliveries. Such a solution needs to be novel, safe and replicable because we need innovation here, as elsewhere. Finally, a word on the under-representation of women in health research. I readily acknowledge the significance of this issue. I understand, however, that the situation is now rapidly improving and I sincerely hope that this upward trend will continue. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to present the Commission’s approach to promoting gender equality, including regarding mental health and health issues in general.

And while much of the focus on the detrimental effects of patriarchal societies is targeted towards women, one serious issue targets men – the issue of suicide and mental health. If we raise our young men in societies where they are told that ‘boys don’t cry’, that they should be strong as opposed to weak, and stoic as opposed to emotive, then we will continue to perpetuate the stigmatisation of mental health. But while such ideals may be well intentioned, the phenomena has led to a major difference in suicide rates between men and women. In general, the rate for males is five times higher, and in some EU countries alone the differentiation between genders can lead to a figure of 52 males per 100 000 persons to 8 females per 100 000. This is a highly worrying phenomenon, and if even we as European leaders shy away from the topic, then we will continue to perpetuate the stigma within our own societies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 170, "date": "2017-02-13.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  The next item is the report by Constance Le Grip and Maria Arena on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the EU priorities for the 61st session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women [2017/2001(INI)] (A8 008/2017).", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 171, "date": "2017-02-13.json", "name": "Anna Maria Corazza Bildt", "mepid": "96674", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, I am proud to be here today to give our priorities to the Council for the upcoming session of the United Nations Commission on the status of women. We cannot miss this opportunity to join forces and stand up together for women’s dignity worldwide, to combat stereotypes and any form of discrimination, going beyond rhetoric with concrete actions. Much more needs to be done everywhere to empower women and girls and achieve gender equality. We want to give a voice, especially to the millions of women that are excluded, marginalised, vulnerable women, women with disabilities, migrant and refugee women.  First of all we have to prevent and combat violence against women with a zero-tolerance policy to domestic violence, honour killings, trafficking, sexual abuse and exploitation, female genital mutilation, forced marriage. Let us face it, many women and girls are the new slaves of our times. Behind every victim there is a heartbreaking story of a broken life. We therefore call on the Member States to ratify and enforce the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention on violence against women. Second: education. We need to ensure access to school for all girls and keep them safe and empower them, then promote women in the labour market, in particular women’s entrepreneurship; recognise that women are an asset for our economy and growth; eliminate the gender-pay gap and ensure equal pay for equal work and more representation of women in decision-making everywhere. We need to work towards shared responsibility, a life and work balance between men and women in the care of children, and ensure that women and girls have universal access to health care, including sexual and reproductive health and rights. The UN Commission in March is an important opportunity for Europe to show the world that we are responsible and credible in women and girls’ rights.  We are at the crossroads. As the US seems to be retreating from global responsibility, Europe should step in. As the US seems to withdraw support for multilateralism, Europe should renew its support for the United Nations and international cooperation. As the US seems to be turning its back on women and girls’ health, Europe should show leadership in gender equality and women’s health.  We firmly condemn the recently reinstated global gag rule in its most extreme form yet, expanded to withdraw funding not only from reproductive health services but from an organisation’s entire health budget if they provide information about interruption of pregnancy. This will encompass all the United States’ global health funding from Africa through Asia to Latin America. There is an outcry, a chorus of concern turning to Europe for help, notably from the United Nations, other aid agencies, children’s rights NGOs, research institutes, foundations, charities. We Europeans are not going to abandon the thousands of women and girls depending on those donations.  I welcome the initiative of the Dutch Government to mobilise funds in order to compensate for the US funding and the Belgian initiative to hold a donors’ conference on 2 March. More countries and organisations should join the initiative to save the life of hundreds of thousands of women and girls in developing countries. The gag rule’s consequences are serious. They will affect many programmes: Zika virus, lifesaving services, pre-natal and post-natal assistance to babies and young mothers, women that are raped. It will increase mortality. More women and girls are going to die in birth and complications. I call on the UN and the Member States to give a clear, united response against this setback, sexism and Trumpism, and let us also support the women’s march and movement in the US.

The declaration and the program that had been adopted at the time - Program of Action for the Empowerment of Women - was considered to be the main global policy document on gender equality, there is over 20 years. The Beijing +20 session in 2015 welcomed the progress made in this area through this global instrument, but UN member states were nonetheless called on to carry out assessments and take further steps to accelerate the implementation. implementing these actions for equality. And yet, today, in 2017, we see that equality between men and women as well as the rights of women are again called into question. Around the world, policies aim to undermine the goals that should be supported not only by Europe but also by the United Nations in terms of equality between men and women. In response to these regressions, citizen resistance movements are organizing across the world. At the 61st session of the Commission on the Status of Women at the United Nations, we, the European Parliament, therefore ask that the Council can take the measure of its role within the international community to act in favor of equality between men and women, as it has always done at European level. This commitment, we ask that it go from the promotion of education to the fight against violence against women, and particularly to the adoption of the Istanbul Convention, through the guarantee of universal access to healthcare. sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, as well as access to sexual and reproductive education. The participation of women in the labor market, without discrimination, as well as their participation in political and civic life are also essential for their empowerment. Dear colleagues, at the time of this 61st session, we can only condemn the attitude of the Trump administration, which has decided to cut funding to NGOs, as my colleague Corazza Bildt said, which practice or recommend family planning or access to abortion services, even in countries where abortion is accepted. This is a real violation of women's rights, which will have disastrous consequences for HIV programs, for the mental health we just mentioned, for the health of children. All of this will affect the whole world. Colleagues, we have had the opportunity to speak out and condemn the Trump administration when it promotes economic protectionism. When it comes to the economy, everyone stands up to say, \"But what's going on in the United States?\" On the other hand, when it comes to human rights and women's rights, we should be silent. No, Ladies and Gentlemen! Again, when it comes to human rights, we have to say that what this administration is doing today is not acceptable. We must say this to the United Nations and Europe must be at the forefront of this fight, quite simply because Europe must show that it is a pillar guaranteeing fundamental rights and that these fundamental rights - which are the rights of man - should not forget half of humanity that are women.

The high-level group Cars 21 consisted for the most part of representatives of the automotive industry. The Commission listened to them, but the warnings from environmental organizations against possible fraudulent software hardly got through to the offices of the same Commission. For years the European Parliament has been fighting against the dominance of the lobbyists of large companies in expert groups, but it was only after Parliament had frozen some of the funds intended for the expert groups that the Commission wanted to talk. I then had an informal dialogue with the Commission together with a group of like-minded MEPs. All that was during the previous mandate. After the European elections in 2014, there was an impasse. The Commission felt that we should just show which expert groups were unbalanced and then the Commission services would take action afterwards. That is of course the upside-down world. This is understandable when you consider that only one official was available at the secretariat of the Commission to supervise compliance with the then existing rules for expert groups. But it must of course be the Commission that detects possible wrongdoing. In the Committee on Budgetary Control we then decided to have our own research carried out. The results were not easy. The large companies still dominate in expert groups and they were not very transparent anyway. Minority views were not presented, nor was the course of the discussions. When discussing this investigation, it appeared that the Commission was already tightening up the rules. Good news in itself, of course, but it was a shame that there was no informal or formal consultation here had been over. After all, the Commission was fully aware of our intention to draw up a formal report with resolution on the expert groups. In the end we managed to adapt a sleeve here. I prepared a working document and the Commission services responded in writing. A few points of difference remained, which we subsequently discussed informally with Vice President Timmermans. That conversation went well, but unfortunately many points were not included in the new rules and hence this report. The main requirements we have are: One: clear criteria for the expertise the Commission is looking for. Two: definition of which interests according to the Committee should be represented in the specific expert group and what a balanced balance is between those interests. Three: a good system to handle complaints about the criteria and the definition of “balanced balance” among individual expert groups. Four: not only reimbursement of travel and accommodation costs, but also of opportunity costs. Think of an SME who has to incur costs to keep her business open when she herself participates in an expert group. Five: opening up expert groups of national NGOs, so that they also receive the mandate of a European umbrella organization. Six: unless a qualified majority of the members of the expert group objects to this, disclosure of agendas, background papers and minutes with clear guidelines on how detailed we should be. Seven: Avoiding conflicts of interest among participants on behalf of the academic institution, law firm, or think tank. And finally: sufficient staff to supervise compliance with the rules. I sincerely hope that after the unanimous acceptance of this report in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Commission will become somewhat more proactive.

I think it is a thing that we share, that these rules are of the essence for the legitimacy of the advisory and expert groups. This Commission has paid very close attention to the role which expert groups play in our policy making. And we have laid down tougher internal rules in order to make sure that these groups carry out their function in full transparency and accountability exactly as asked. Let me stress just one thing, because this is very basic. Expert groups provide very useful contributions to the work of the Commission in many different policy fields, of which many are highly technical and of a specialised nature. But I think it is very important to recall that no matter what advice is given by expert groups, they have a purely advisory role. Whatever their advice may be, the responsibility for any decision or measure adopted remains the Commission’s and the Commission's alone. But when this Commission took office we decided that the rules for expert groups needed to be reviewed so as to better reflect the Commission's commitment to be more transparent and accountable. Before adopting a new set of rules, we listened to this Parliament, the European Ombudsman and civil society organisations. After a full year of consultation and intensive preparation the Commission adopted new rules in May last year. We consider these new rules, which are binding for all of the Commission services, to improve significantly the management, the balance and the transparency of expert groups and we also consider that they provide a positive response to many suggestions made by this House and by the European Ombudsman. Just let me give you a few concrete examples.  The new rules confirm – reconfirm – the Commission's commitment to strive for a balanced composition of expert groups. The Commission’s departments must do their utmost to guarantee a balanced representation. This does not mean balanced in a mathematical sense, which would be difficult to define and achieve in all cases; it means maximum balance in terms of expertise, interests, gender, and geographical origin. The new rules also bring significant changes to boost transparency. We have set up a new register for expert groups. This register is accessible for the public and provides more accurate information and more documents drafted and discussed by expert groups. In particular, the Commission will henceforth publish the register calls for applications when it selects stakeholders’ representatives as well as expert group members appointed in their personal capacity. This is a major step forward and has been a long-standing request from this Parliament. In other words, we have made the selection procedures fully transparent and inclusive, which ultimately benefits the balance of the composition of expert groups. Second, registration in the Transparency Register has now become a precondition for stakeholders’ organisations to be appointed to an expert group. This means that where particular interests are represented in an expert group there will be full transparency as regards the nature of these interests. Third, every document that an expert group produces must now be put on the register of expert groups. Minutes will have to be provided, which makes complete and meaningful sense. Moreover, expert groups can also decide to open up their meetings to the general public. Last but not least, we have taken tough measures to avoid conflict of interest in expert groups. Under the new rules, independent experts can only be appointed on the basis of standardised and detailed conflict-of-interest assessment based on the declaration submitted by these experts. Only if the Commission services conclude that there is no conflict of interest may those experts be appointed in their personal capacity. In addition, all declarations of interest of independent experts are published in the register of expert groups. These tougher rules we have put in place to ensure – and I do hope that you find that we, the Commission and this House, share the objective – a high degree of transparency and accountability for the functioning of expert groups.

Investigative journalists do a good job of discovering and reporting such wrongdoing. It also regularly happens that concerned members of the Committee on Budgetary Control receive letters from citizens about cases of alleged fraud and corruption involving European funds. And often they put a name under the letter with all the details so that they can be contacted. Investigative journalists and concerned citizens are taking risks. In the European Union, we have regulated the protection of trade secrets, but not the protection of whistleblowers. The anti-fraud service of the European Commission has a protocol on how to deal with whistleblowers and most European institutions now also have implementing rules for internal staff to protect them when they report abuse. But beyond that, you depend on the goodwill of the officials or politicians who receive your information. Someone recently responded: “Surely the citizen who wrote to us is not asking for confidential treatment at all? Then why should we not be able to mention his name? ” We do not know at all how it is regulated in the Member States. Even if we have good rules in the European institutions, whistleblowers can still be sued at national level. Just think of the fate of the whistleblowers who have to go to court in connection with Luxleaks in Luxembourg, when their sole aim was to denounce tax avoidance by multinationals and Luxembourg's role in it. My report contains a large number of proposals to protect whistleblowers finally organizing properly. Better procedures within the European institutions themselves, counters with people who know how to handle information from whistleblowers and who safeguard the confidentiality of personal data. Whistleblowers are also entitled to advice. In the Netherlands we have set up a house for whistleblowers for this purpose, and an initial investigation is being carried out there into the information that whistleblowers provide. Whistleblowers then receive advice on how to proceed. Such a house is just as badly needed on a European level. You soon become entangled in the forest of the European institutions and before you know it, it is not the abuses that are dealt with, but you yourself. Of course, the European Parliament can take steps itself. In theory, we could set up such a house for the whistleblowers themselves. But it is much better to have one house for all European institutions. It is fine and even necessary that information about wrongdoing reaches Parliament, but the European Commission and the agencies can also benefit from that information. And let us not forget the important role of the European Court of Auditors and the European Ombudsman. Article 325 of the EU Treaty provides a good legal basis for the regulation of protection at national level. Precisely by concentrating first on whistleblowers who report wrongdoing in which the financial interests of the European Union are at stake, I believe we meet all subsidiarity requirements. Surely no one can be against protecting people who stick their necks out to report wrongdoing with our tax money? In that case, it is important that we make legislation that, while preventing abuse, really protects anyone who has a reasonable suspicion about the accuracy of his or her information.

They play an extremely important role in fighting fraud and corruption. According to a study from 2016 analysing more than 2400 cases of fraud in 114 countries, about 40% of all detected fraud cases are uncovered by whistle-blowers.  The Commission therefore strongly supports the objective of protecting whistle-blowers and this is why specific guidelines were developed back in 2012. This is also why it has been included in protective measures in the European legislation on anti-money laundering, market abuse, collective investment in transferable securities and trade secrets.  Recent leaks, such as the Panama papers, have once again highlighted the importance of whistle-blowers for journalistic investigations and, in this particular case, for exposing tax avoidance and tax evasion. Strengthening the fight against tax evasion, avoidance and illicit financial activity, promoting good tax governance, is one of the Commission’s top priorities, as you all know. The Commission is currently assessing the need for horizontal or further sectoral action at EU level, with full respect for the principle of subsidiarity. We are carrying out an impact assessment study and a public consultation will be launched at the end of February. Both will inform our assessment of the next possible steps. I count on your support to encourage a wide range of citizens and stakeholders to support and participate in this consultation.  We all agree that the protection of whistle-blowers is vital.

Our exports to the UK are about 17% of our total exports, much higher than any other Member State, and 41% of those exports are in the agri-food sector, leaving it open to catastrophic impacts in the event of a hard Brexit. Our land border stretches 499 kilometres from west to east. We have strong cultural, social, economic ties with Northern Ireland, and our peace process is underpinned by cross-border cooperation in all sectors.

It is illusory to expect that deficit fulfillment or subordination to the debt burden will result in some kind of mercy on the part of the markets and their political representatives. If we exclude interest on the debt, Portugal has a primary budget balance of more than 4 billion euros. Devoid of monetary sovereignty, the euro's periphery is totally dependent on the options of the ECB, which it does not control, or on the blackmail of rating agencies. In other words, the euro has stuck the periphery between the blackmail of the troika and the blackmail of the financial markets. And the solution is not to yield to any of them, it is to recover monetary sovereignty and exit the euro from Member States that consider their permanence unsustainable, as well as renegotiating debt, terms, interest and amounts, preferably in the framework negotiated at European level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 215, "date": "2017-02-13.json", "name": "Gilles Lebreton (ENF).", "mepid": "124738", "text": "- Madam President, the European Union does not have a coherent trade policy towards China.

Almaraz is an obsolete plant, an authentic time bomb that should have closed in 2010, but which saw its life extended until 2020. The Portuguese, 40 years ago, in Ferrel, were massively opposed to the construction of a nuclear plant in their territory, as well as to the nuclear projects that Spain has been carrying out over our territory, in violation of the international obligations to which it is bound. The licensing of the temporary warehouse in Almaraz, due to its enormous storage capacity, clearly demonstrates Spain's camouflaged intention to collect not only Almaraz waste after 2018, but also that of the other six Spanish nuclear power plants. It also demonstrates the willingness to extend the operation of Almaraz until the age of sixty, as it happened last week with the decision to reopen the Garoña nuclear power plant, which is sixty years old.
