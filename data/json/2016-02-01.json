Mr President, today our Parliament is carrying out a top function provided for in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which is to exercise democratic control over the action of the European Central Bank. Because an independent European Central Bank does not mean an uncontrolled European Central Bank. The European Central Bank must therefore provide accountability to the European Parliament, the only EU body directly elected by the peoples of the Union.  In previous years, the process of discussing the European Central Bank's annual action report in the plenary session of the European Parliament has been limited to wishful thinking, with no criticism of the leadership of the European Central Bank and its actions. In this report we put the finger on the type of sun. Although a particular effort was made by specific political groups within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with joint compromise amendments, to remove important cutting-edge points contained in the report I drafted, although some have tried to round the corners, even though the 'Crown Heraklions' have proved to be more 'drags' than Mr Draghi, the key points at the top of the report remain.  The European Central Bank must take important steps to ensure that in the performance of its mission there is no conflict of interest due to the quadruple action that has turned the European Central Bank into a state in state. This is because the European Central Bank is supposed to be an independent monetary policy institution, while overseeing Europe's 130 largest systemic banks. At the same time, the European Central Bank is the big loaner of the countries of the Union, having bought bonds of the euro area states in the context of quantitative easing, and finally, it is a member of the Troika that has bankrupted and impoverished the countries of the Memorandum.  For this reason, the report recalls the important and at the same time innovative judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union C-62/14, which sets out the conditions and conditions under which the European Central Bank must carry out its quantitative easing programme. A court ruling that essentially calls for the European Central Bank to be evicted from the Troika. At the same time, our report calls for transparency and control of the Troika, and therefore of the European Central Bank, in the implementation of the so-called rescue programmes, namely the Memorandums. Mr Draghi, unemployment remains extremely high, especially for young people and the long-term unemployed, with rates particularly divergent, from 6.4% in Germany to 26.6% in Greece. All this, while the European Central Bank and the Member States have spent several trillion euros to deal with the crisis since 2009. At the same time, the ECB is particularly welcome in pursuing a tough fiscal and austerity policy, but has not been able to reduce unemployment or reduce public debt. The report even calls on the Member States to carry out a debt audit in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1782/2003. 472/2013. Furthermore, we believe that a policy is needed that will boost public and private investment and fuel growth. This requires increased liquidity and financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. Although the European Central Bank launched an ambitious quantitative easing programme of EUR 582 billion at the end of 2015, of which EUR 17 billion was spent by the Central Bank of impoverished Greece, however, Mr Draghi, neither deflation, unemployment nor underdevelopment was adequately addressed. In the face of the European Central Bank's obsessions with the deconstruction of the social state, the report recognises the limits of monetary policy and points out that the Union's economic problems can be addressed by structural reforms, but which must be socially balanced.  From then on, quantitative easing and low interest rates could not even contribute to the increase in private investment, while at the same time we saw problems arise in the insurance funds which saw their reserve yields be particularly low. The report assistes the European Commission's proposed pan-European deposit guarantee scheme, but also highlights the important steps taken towards the creation of a Single Banking Supervisory Authority.  In this context, it also needs to be examined whether the European Central Bank, and why, imposed a credit suffocation on Greece since the beginning of 2015 that eventually led to capital controls. Therefore, greater transparency is needed in the mode of operation of the Emergency Liquidity Facility. In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their positive contribution to this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 24, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Mario Draghi", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Central Bank. – Mr President, we are undoubtedly at a point in time when the cohesion of Europe is being tested. Many of the challenges we must confront are European or even global in nature, and these challenges demand a strong European response. I am therefore grateful to be back in this assembly – a symbol of the need for European debates and European solutions. Today we are discussing the Annual Report of the European Central Bank for 2014. In that year, the Governing Council adopted a series of measures to respond to the impairment of our monetary policy transmission channels and to the low inflation environment. These measures included two reductions in key ECB interest rates, the announcement of targeted long-term refinancing operations, and two purchase programmes for asset-backed securities and covered bonds. 2014 was also marked by the start of the activities of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the completion of the comprehensive assessment. But rather than looking backwards, allow me to focus on the challenges that still lie ahead of us. First, I will briefly explain our current monetary policy and why we will re-assess our stance at our March meeting. Second, I would like to discuss the economic challenges we face and what it takes to address them. I am acutely aware that the focus of policymakers lies elsewhere for the moment. But let me be quite clear: economic success is also part of the solution in other fields. Therefore, mitigating economic risks deserves to be high on the political agenda. It was about three years ago that inflation started moving away from the ECB’s medium-term inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%. Since October 2013, inflation has been below 1%. Throughout 2015, headline inflation in the euro area was very low or even negative, remaining under the influence of low commodity prices. Euro area annual HICP inflation was estimated at 0.4% in January this year. In parallel to this trend, we had to continually revise our outlook for inflation: while at the start of 2015 our staff was forecasting inflation to reach 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017, in December they projected a rate of only 1% for this year, and 1.6% for 2017. Against this backdrop, the ECB decided in December to act again. Our assessment of the monetary policy stance had two parts. First, we noted that the measures put in place since the summer of 2014 had been very effective. The monetary stimulus that they introduced led to a broad-based easing of financing conditions, stimulated credit provision and has since provided substantial support to the euro area recovery. Without these measures, the euro area would have been in outright deflation last year and prices would have fallen at an even quicker pace this year. Growth would have been significantly lower. Second, while our measures were deemed effective, they were also judged to be insufficient in view of the deteriorating outlook for price stability. There was a concrete risk that without increasing the quantitative stimulus, the date by which inflation would settle around levels below, but close to, 2% would once more be pushed back beyond any relevant definition of medium-term. Therefore, we decided to recalibrate our monetary policy stance. We cut the deposit facility rate further to -0.3%; we extended the envisaged end-date for our monthly purchases to the end of March 2017, while maintaining its conditionality on the inflation outlook; and we announced that we would reinvest the principal payments of our purchased assets once they mature, for as long as necessary. We also decided to continue conducting the main refinancing operations and the three-month longer-term refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2017. Since our meeting in early December, conditions have once more changed. A moderate recovery of the euro area economy is under way, driven mainly by domestic demand. But downside risks have increased again and there is heightened uncertainty about emerging market economies’ growth prospects, volatility in financial and commodity markets, and geopolitical risks. Inflation dynamics are also tangibly weaker than we expected in December. While the most recent wave of disinflation is mainly due to the renewed sharp fall in oil prices, weaker than anticipated growth in wages together with declining inflation expectations call for careful analysis of the channels by which surprises to realised inflation may influence future price and wage-setting in our economy. Therefore, at our last meeting in January we judged that it would be necessary to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next monetary policy meeting in early March, when the new staff macroeconomic projections will be made available. Our monetary policy is working, and the ECB is willing to contribute its share to ensuring that recovery remains firmly on track. But there are risks that – if they were to materialise – could undermine its course. The policy challenges we face are fourfold. They relate to the global environment, the situation of the financial system, the economic and fiscal policies of Member States and the political uncertainty surrounding the European project. First, as regards the global environment: growth prospects are slowly improving in advanced economies, but the outlook in emerging markets is more subdued. Overall, growth is low by historical standards. Moreover, emerging markets are facing economic and financial risks: some are suffering from structural impediments and macroeconomic imbalances, while others have to adjust to lower commodity prices. They remain vulnerable to an abrupt shift in risk sentiment that could tighten financing conditions. A key issue is how emerging markets will be impacted by tighter financing conditions and the ensuing capital outflows, and to what extent this will have repercussions for euro area foreign demand. Against this background, ensuring the continued resilience of the euro area economy is paramount. Second, there are policy challenges related to our financial markets. The euro area financial system weathered several episodes of stress in the second half of last year. This is a sign that a lot has already been achieved with the establishment of banking union – which, however, is not complete yet. To make our financial system truly safe and sound, we need to progress in two main domains, which complement each other. On the one hand, we need to finalise and implement the work we started when establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism as the initial pillars of banking union. This includes further regulatory work to harmonise our rules for supervisory action and to ensure a consistent application of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive’s (BRRD) bail-in provisions. On the other hand, we need a common public backstop for the Single Resolution Fund to strengthen its credibility, and we need to ensure that confidence in the safety of deposits is equally high in all euro area Member States by establishing a European Deposit Insurance Scheme. ‘Risk-reduction’ and ‘risk-sharing’ measures are two sides of the same coin and should be pursued in parallel: they are all essential to protecting the stability of the European banking sector. Third, there are challenges related to the fiscal and economic policies of Member States that require decisive policy action. Fiscal policies should contribute to the economic recovery. At the same time, they should be in full compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is important to maintain confidence in the European fiscal framework and in the sustainability of public finances. Moreover, countries would benefit from a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. This involves greater efficiency of public sector services and moving to a more growth-friendly tax system. But the ongoing cyclical recovery in the euro area should also be supported by effective structural policies, particularly actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure. Such actions are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. If reforms are credible, carefully chosen and well designed, their positive effects can be felt quickly, particularly in the context of our supportive monetary policy stance. Fourth and finally, there is still political uncertainty surrounding the European project. This is true in the broader context of our Union. A solution that would anchor the United Kingdom firmly within the EU while allowing the euro area to integrate further would boost confidence. The Economic and Monetary Union architecture also remains an unfinished construction. Citizens and markets are too often unsure about our capacity to act jointly in a spirit of common responsibility. We should prove them wrong. Let me conclude and come back to the subject of our debate: your resolution on our Annual Report for 2014. Let me assure you that we are reading this document closely. It reminds us of our duty as a public institution to conduct our business in a transparent and accountable manner. The publication of the diaries of Members of the Executive Board that starts this month is only one example of this. I am looking forward to the debate and thank you for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, first let me thank the rapporteur, Mr Marias, and his colleagues on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), for their work on this report. This ex-post assessment of the European Central Bank (ECB) activities by the European Parliament is an important part of democratic accountability and a necessary complement to the ECB’s independence. The Commission shares Parliament’s view that the ECB’s independence, in the conduct of its monetary policy as enshrined in the Treaties, is crucial to safeguard price stability. The monetary policy in the euro area is the exclusive competence of the ECB. With its monetary policy measures over the past years, including interest rate cuts, a series of targeted long-term refinancing operations and an expanded assets purchase programme, the ECB has acted to address the risks of an excessively long period of very low inflation. These measures include bank lending to the euro area non—financial private sector to help reduce financial fragmentation. They should support the economy and bring inflation closer to the ECB’s target of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The EU economy is continuing with a moderate recovery, and it is supported by certain tailwinds, such as low oil prices, the aforementioned accommodatory monetary policy and a correspondingly lower euro exchange rate, which is favourable for European exporters. At the same time we are also facing headwinds from geopolitical tensions in our neighbourhood – both our southern and eastern neighbourhoods – and from the slowdown in emerging markets. The global GDP growth forecast has also somewhat deteriorated. It is against this backdrop that we will be updating our economic forecast on Thursday with our winter economic forecast. The Commission fully shares Parliament’s view that Europe cannot only rely on monetary policy and a favourable external environment to lift GDP growth and to raise our economy’s growth potential. Member States’ governments must roll up their sleeves and implement necessary structural reforms. Structural, fiscal and monetary policies each have to play their role for a consistent, growth-friendly approach acting both on the demand and supply sides of our economies. On the fiscal side, adjustments undertaken in recent years have reduced deficits and stabilised debt levels in the euro area. But Member States continue to face different fiscal challenges which call for a differentiated path of fiscal adjustment going forward. The Commission agrees with the European Parliament that fiscal adjustment, using the flexibility that is built into the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, needs to go hand in hand with the implementation of structural reforms: reforms of product, services and labour markets that increase productivity, help regain competitiveness, improve the business environment and reduce inequality. Stimulating investment remains one of the Commission’s policy priorities. The investment plan for Europe will help to reverse recent downward trends in investment by supporting strategic projects and SME financing. European Parliament support for a European Fund for Strategic Investments initiative has been instrumental in laying the ground for decisive and swift Union action to address the main investment needs in Europe. With all the governance bodies in place since early January, EFSI is now up and running. The take-up so far by the market and public authorities leaves us assured that we will meet the EUR 315 billion investment target well within the three—year deadline. The Commission also shares Parliament’s view on the Capital Markets Union. It is our common objective to support diversification of funding sources, promote cross-border investments and improve access to finance SMEs in particular. Implementing the Capital Markets Union action plan is an ambitious objective. The Commission therefore counts on Parliament’s strong support and commitment, in particular – but not only – for the upcoming legislative procedures. At the same time we agree with Parliament that we must remain vigilant with regard to risks in all areas of the financial system arising in the current market situation. Let me conclude by underlining that I see much common ground between your views and the Commission’s. It is reassuring to know that we can count on your support in building the foundations for sustainable growth and job creation in Europe.

The heated discussions already showed that your monetary policy is a hot topic. \"Super Mario\", \"Magic Mario\", \"Helicopter Mario\", you seem to get a new nickname every week.  But I can imagine that you would rather not get that attention, that you prefer a stable European economy, which does not need unconventional measures. That you also prefer an ECB that has the confidence to fulfil its mandate in all independence. That is why our report calls on national ministers not to interfere in this policy by voting. Because trust remains the most important lubricant of the economy and the central bank deserves this trust, together with the governors of the national banks.  Of course, a debate on the policy pursued remains very important. There are clear arguments pro and contra quantitative easing, but the discussion must remain intellectually honest. Shouting that the poor saver, for example, is the victim, while reckless investors and debt collectors celebrate, that's the truth. Of course, no one is just a saver. Many of my peers, for example, are just enjoying very low interest rates today as a mortgage borrower. Employee, employer, pension saver, we all have an interest in the economy picking up faster.  We must remain vigilant about the risks of this policy - I am the first to say it today - but we must not be paralysed by it.

Mr Draghi, welcome, your presence in plenary is always welcome, because it strengthens, among other things, democratic legitimacy. Firstly, we recognise the efforts you are making and welcome your policy, especially with the quantitative easing programme, in an extremely difficult environment, for inflation and a return to growth.  Nevertheless, the euro area is still a fragile and heterogeneous field with political and social divergences. That is why we welcome recently the statement by Mr Cœuré, who spoke of the need to address economic divergences in the euro area and spoke of those states that will have a surplus and will have to make more public investment. That is why I would like your statement on this matter.  Secondly, financial fragmentation is a major problem in the euro area. Borrowing costs for small and medium-sized enterprises remain higher than large ones, in particular, in those Member States that are in economic crisis and things are becoming doubly difficult. And here I would like your view on how to provide low-cost loans to the real economy.  Another issue is cooperative credit institutions which play an important role, both because of their particular operating principles and their mission. The supervisory authorities should bear in mind that there are specific principles that should be respected, and we would also like your comment.  Finally, with two short schools: first, non-performing loans. What is your position, should there be an appropriate mechanism, as in Spain and Ireland or something else?

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Colleagues, i would like to thank you for your excellent work. The report is a balanced assessment of the ECB's activities. For the first time, however, there are criticisms in this report.  Firstly, it is important to emphasise all the medium- and long-term instruments that should affect europe's economic recovery and which would meet the need for a sustainable recovery of the real economy in all – not in part – the 28 countries of the European Union. It should also be stressed that although the ECB is implementing its efforts to maintain favourable financing conditions, private and public investment in the euro area remains well below pre-current crisis levels. So it is desirable to increase access to finance primarily for small and medium-sized enterprises.  When considering the annual report on the ECB, I would also like to draw attention to, in my opinion, a very important point. This is, firstly, respect for the independence of the ECB's decisions, but also an appropriate separation of the ECB's supervisory role and its decision-making functions within monetary policy. The combination of the two functions should not give rise to a conflict of interest for the ECB.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Cora van Nieuwenhuizen", "mepid": "125019", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Marias, and my shadow rapporteurs for their pleasant cooperation in this report. In this report, Parliament expresses strong concern about the effects of quantitative easing, with €60 billion of financial growth hormones pumping into the economy every month.  Mr Draghi, you have said it many times and repeated it again today: monetary policy alone is not enough to get the economy going. It also requires economic reforms and sound fiscal policy. You mentioned it in your speech today as a third point. Do you agree with me that things are not heading in the right direction in these areas? In many countries, the labour market is still locked. It seems as if in several places the mental transition from a job for life to a life full of jobs still needs to be made. Adjusting the retirement age is not yet in order and there are mainly large countries that have the highest debts and the largest deficits, combined with the lowest growth and also the lowest inflation. These countries, on the contrary, are trying hardest to get out of the budget agreements. Not a good development! All this, i wonder whether it is wise to continue and develop quantitative easing in these circumstances. This concern is reinforced by the strongly negative side effects of this type of monetary stimulus for the stability of pension funds and financial markets in Europe. If we do not take the extremely low oil prices with us, inflation is not so dramatically low at all. I therefore wonder whether it is necessary to add another scoop of quantitative easing. Once again, in the light of the fact that the much-needed structural reforms and a sound fiscal policy are still lagging behind, do you still think it is justified that you should pull the cart alone with your quantitative easing, which you should then continue to do?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Fabio De Masi", "mepid": "124858", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr Draghi has calmed financial markets for a while with \"whatever it takes.\" However, the bad loans in the Italian banking system and the attempt to sell off the toxic waste to the taxpayers with a lot of lametta shows that the euro crisis is continuing! For the majority, every day there is a euro crisis in their wallets, and there are reasons for this. Mr Draghi himself named it in Jackson Hole: there is a lack of public investment to support monetary policy. Banks make little credit by cutting wages, pensions, and government spending because of a lack of investment demand – despite zero interest rates. Quantitative easing thus only leads to financial bubbles, rather than money ending up in the real economy. As a result, the ECB regularly misses its inflation target of around 2% per year. The Financial Times is already mocking the fact that German central bankers have an inflation target of 0 to 0.2%. The ECB also has a responsibility to do so. In Ireland, the ECB threatened to turn the euro down unless the ailing Anglo Irish is bailed out by Irish taxpayers. This was corrupt, not monetary policy.  In Greece, the ECB forced further cuts in wages and pensions. A blind man with a crutch sees that structural reforms have only made things worse. Freely after Bill Clinton: It's the austerity, stupid. The investment strike can only be overcome by public investment.

Thank you, today, for your presence. Mr Draghi, this Parliament has welcomed many of the measures it has taken in recent years, such as unconventional monetary policy measures, or its willingness to maintain sovereign bond-buying programmes, which, even momentarily, has put an end to the sovereign financing crisis. However, Mr Draghi, I have to say that these programmes — and in particular the quantitative easing programme — were late in some cases and poorly designed. We know that the volume of quantitative easing is insufficient. So much so that it's hardly having an impact on the price level, as my partner previously pointed out. And we are also concerned, Mr Draghi, that this programme is not a programme focused on being able to reach the real economy directly — something we have asked for on several occasions — and that we are currently more fuelling speculative bubbles and generating processes of inequality than by making a programme that can truly reach the real economy. And we know that monetary policy doesn't have to do everything; that the lack of policies to sustain aggregate demand is, today, a problem. And that's not your responsibility. But it also seems to us that some of these programmes, like TLTRUs, the results of which we have at the moment, also because of the data we have, are very scarce — have not worked as they should. And finally, Mr Draghi, I have to say that, since we are evaluating your work in recent years, we need to talk about Greece. We are very concerned about the lack of a clear legal framework for mechanisms such as the provision of emergency liquidity; we are concerned that you would make decisions in a totally arbitrary way, depending on whether one Government was one colour or another, especially when compared to what happened in Cyprus; We are also concerned, and with this end, the independence of the European Central Bank, having taken decisions by its Governing Council almost in parallel over time with the Eurogroup, seriously jeopardizing the credibility of the institution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Marco Valli", "mepid": "124778", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ECB's work in 2015 follows what is a long-established political plan.

All the peoples of Europe who no longer control their own currency and banking system must realise that they are peoples who have been deprived of fundamental rights in order to determine themselves democratically and who are under dictatorship in Brussels and Frankfurt. Since the entry into operation of the first pillar of the Banking Union at the end of 2014, the ECB has been managing both bankruptcy monetary policies, inflating banks and supervision of banks themselves, in total conflict of interest. The ECB continues to profess political indications that do not fall within its control, austerity and reforms, paving the way for major stakeholders, investment funds, large tax avoiders, those who pull the strings of this political project and who are strategically disjouring public resources at balance prices with privatisations. Strong shocks are expected in 2016, due to the global economic slowdown and the migrant crisis.

I also agree with President Draghi's assessment of further developments in the macroeconomic framework. On the one hand, we are seeing the strengthening of the domestic economy, driven mainly by consumption, and, on the other hand, we are seeing a weakening of the world economy, caused both by the slowdown in emerging economies and by increased uncertainty on the financial markets. Our ability to influence the global economy is limited. However, we can influence what is happening in the euro area, first of all by continuing and adapting the monetary policy measures in place. From this point of view, it is very positive that the Governing Council of the ECB has unanimously declared itself ready to reconsider the monetary policy stance if it does not prove sufficient to achieve the objectives announced. Of course, monetary policy alone cannot guarantee the transition from a cyclical to a structural recovery. For this to happen, it is necessary to continue along the path of socially balanced structural reforms aimed at increasing the growth potential of our economy and, at the same time, budgetary policy, at aggregate level, must go hand in hand with monetary policy, and not against it. Countries that have fiscal space must use it, and the fiscal adjustment of those with less space must continue at a sustainable pace, applying all the rules of the Stability Pact, including the flexibility it contains.

The consequences are a destabilization of the oil industry and of the European economic and financial order. The impact of crude oil prices is central to the level of prices and partly explains the high risk of deflation opposed by the European Central Bank. However, the 50% drop in prices in a few weeks is not the effect of supply and demand on the physical oil markets, but the result of speculation in the derivatives markets.  Each barrel of oil traded on physical markets is traded 200 times on the same day in derivatives markets. Under these conditions, it can be predicted that the sharp decline of recent months will soon recur, but in the opposite direction, as soon as speculators bet on the rise. These large-scale movements directly complicate the ECB's monetary policy and the achievement of its target of 2% inflation.  This volatility on systemic banks has unexpected risks to their solvency as well. Framing speculation in commodity derivatives markets was one of the main priorities of the French G20 presidency, which wanted to moralize capitalism, but five years later we are still at a standstill.

Let us hope that the Council and the Commission will also keep their commitments in the same way. But the truth is that today we have a unique banking supervision, since November 2014. We have had a single resolution for a month and all these elements of stabilisation of the banking union are not operational. And while the single European resolution has not yet actually intervened, the experiences of implementing the new European Resolution Directive ABERD have proved highly problematic, especially in the case of the weakest economies.

Contrary to what was intended in this transitional period, the relationship between banks and states seems to me more complicated, intense and dangerous than ever before and is only in the hands of the State, and of those fragile states, the containment of brutal systemic risks. This leads me to ask a number of questions, but in particular the following: who is monitoring these impacts? Is the ECB accompanying you on the systemic risk board? Can the Capital Market Union help deal with the problem of non-performing loans of badly overt credit? And who has the global vision - I end up now, Mr President, thank you very much - who has the global view of the banking system of countries? Is competition policy in the hands of the Commission or is the SSM supported and coordinated by the European Central Bank? These are questions that need to be answered because a bad start to the Banking Union can destroy it and that would be fatal for European stability.

In the eurozone, too, there is uncertainty not only because of this global volatility, but uncertainty about the impact of the European Central Bank's monetary policy, uncertainty about the impact of the huge bond-buying program under quantitative easing, which has not led to a relevant rise in inflation or to a boost to the economy. Inflation remains low, with 0.4% in January this year close to zero – good for consumers and purchasing power in the short term, but difficult in the long run. Lending to the private sector is also not starting. In December, banks lent just 0.3% more corporate loans and 1.4% more loans to households, which is disappointing!

I do still welcome the measures taken by the ECB to address this problem. These include negative interest rates and targeted long-term refinancing operations. I am also happy to see from the early evidence in this year’s report that parallel policy initiatives were relatively effective, especially when it comes to reducing financial stability risk and giving banks funding.

A total of EUR 400 billion has been introduced into the banking system through five refinancing operations, but bank corporate lending has only experienced a very moderate growth.

What is needed to consolidate the recovery in the eurozone and the EU are economic reforms at national level.

Speaking of price stability, so far core inflation is not heading upwards. The impact of the slowdown in China and other emerging markets is not to be underestimated on the European markets, as you also rightly stated. Given the extension of quantitative easing, the ECB has to provide more information about how it will exit the programme again without having major consequences on inflation targets, on price stability and – most notably – on financial markets. Finally, President Draghi, you said that policy-makers now have a bigger challenge to think about than the euro, as the refugee crisis is more urgent.

By the way, some of the statements or questions were inherently political, and so the best equipped to answer are the national governments and the national parliaments, and perhaps your own Parliament. Let me just try to focus on the main points. I take from many of the questions that were asked that many of you have doubts about the effects of our monetary policy measures. Let me try to explain why I have said several times that our policy measures are actually working. All the quantitative indicators show improvements in the provision of credit and financing conditions. To give you an idea, bank lending rates in the euro area have fallen by 80 basis points on average since mid-2014. We should also recall that the report you are addressing is 2014, but many things have happened since then. So let me give you an updated picture with respect to the report. The lending rates have fallen by 80 basis points since mid-2014 and by up to 140 points in the countries that were hit hardest by the crisis. Second, these improved conditions have translated into higher credit and investment in the euro area, supporting economic growth and inflation and strengthening the resilience of the euro area in the face of adverse global developments. To give you an account of this, in May 2014, before the announcement of the credit-easing measures, the loans to the non-financial corporations, to firms and companies, contracted at an annual rate of 2.9%, but since July 2015 the contraction stopped and loans have started to grow. Third, actions to ensure price stability bolster confidence in the euro economy as a whole and also support the ongoing recovery. We reckon that, if we had not taken our measures, the euro area would have been in outright deflation last year and prices would have fallen at an even quicker pace this year. To give an example, our staff has calculated that, in the absence of our credit measures and QE, growth would be one percentage point lower in the years 2015-2017. Inflation would have been thoroughly negative in 2015, and certainly much lower than we are projecting now in 2016. When some of you – several of you – asked ‘what about the SMEs: how is all of this impacting the SMEs?’, well here I can repeat what I said in a press conference: that the pass-through of our measures into the real economy has been significant, if not spectacular, and the credit-easing package in June 2014 seems to have particularly benefited the SMEs , because the lending rates for small loans declined more than for large loans. Regarding the recent surveys, there are two types of survey. One is the bank lending survey, where we ask banks what they plan to do and what are the major factors that they consider in deciding whether to give credit or not. The response is that, basically, there is no limiting factor today. Then there is the Commission’s survey – if I can quote it – and that says the last survey on SMEs’ access to finance reported an improvement in the availability of bank loans for SMEs and also in the willingness of banks to lend in the six months from April to September 2015. However, we have to acknowledge that lending rates for very small loans remain higher than for large loans, in particular in the vulnerable euro area countries, and that of course reflects the higher lending risk to SMEs to some extent. But certainly we want to overcome this situation. So there have been improvements. Have the improvements been as much as we would like? Not yet; we have to do more. We have to make sure that the SMEs’ credit conditions improve further. As far as monetary policy stands, I did say in my introductory statement that, in view of the increased downside risks to price stability, we stand ready – and the Governing Council stands ready – in accordance with our mandate to review, and possibly reconsider, our monetary policy stance in early March if warranted by incoming information. Several of the questions and statements dealt with potential risks associated with low interest rates and our unconventional measures. These concerns relate, in particular, to a perception that low interest rates negatively impact on savers and that our policy may threaten financial stability, with respect especially to pension funds, insurance companies and savers in general. I have discussed these concerns on several occasions, but let me, however, stress the following. For savers, it is true that nominal rates on many types of savings in the euro area are currently very low by historical standards. I also explained that the low-interest-rate environment is actually a reflection of the current economic and structural conditions. So when I am asked how long this will last: it will last until the economic environment improves. So the low remuneration of savings is a symptom, rather than a cause, of the sluggish recovery after many years in which the economy has operated below its potential and unutilised resources have accumulated. Imagine that we were to depart from the current accommodative monetary policy stance. What would happen? Well, it is not difficult to imagine. We would further curtail economic dynamism and ultimately contribute to prolonging the period of low interest rates through further recession. But we should also note that deposits are not the only way in which savers invest their savings. So, if one takes a comprehensive view of the financial returns of a household, we see that other financial assets provide a buffer to counteract the low returns of bank deposits. Let me quote a recent study by the Bundesbank that showed that the real return on a typical German household portfolio since 2008 has been around 1.5%, which is certainly lower than the pre-crisis average – but it is certainly higher than many periods during the 1990s, for example. So I do not think we can talk about the expropriation of savings, as some have done – not today, but on other occasions. Finally, the possible implications for savers have to be put in a broader context. Savings are made out of incomes that must be earned. By supporting employment and encouraging investment in the context of continued sluggish demand conditions, our accommodative monetary policy therefore supports the capacity to save. Concerns were also expressed on financial stability and how our monetary policy could have an impact on financial stability. Of course, price stability – our objective – is the prerequisite and the basis for financial stability, and we have to stay focused on delivering price stability. At the same time, we are aware that monetary policy measures may have unintended side effects on the financial system, for instance, if low yields invite excessive risk-taking. But to address this we need macro- and micro-prudential measures as tools, not changes in our monetary policy stance. Let me now just briefly mention comments made on the ECB’s involvement in the macro-economic adjustment programmes in general, which was another point that has been raised. When the Troika was set up in early 2010, the European Monetary Union was not equipped to deal with Member States losing market access. In the run-up to the first Greek programme, Member States saw an advisory role of the ECB alongside the Commission and the IMF, and it was considered to be a useful complement to assure a strong programme. In short, the Troika was created to draw on the diverse experience of the institutions. There was not only a good reason to ask the ECB to provide its advice in the context of the programme work, but also a good case for the ECB to accept this request. Successful programmes had to repair the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and to safeguard financial stability. Let me stress that this set-up was codified in the ESM Treaty and by the co-legislators in the Two-Pack, and the Court of Justice confirmed its legality. In line with this, the ECB has since provided its advice in programmes in five Member States. But we should not forget that the final responsibility for decisions on the programme design and financing lies with the Eurogroup and with the Eurogroup ministers in their capacity – and the ESM – and not with the institutions involved in the programme. As I have said on other occasions, the ECB may not be part of the Troika forever, but I believe the right timing for changing the current set-up needs to be carefully considered, and this is not for me to decide upon. A few remarks dealt with our transparency, and I can only say that this past year has been a year full of decisions that were meant to improve our transparency. Certainly what we have done has strengthened our commitment. The publication of the account of our Governing Council meetings, and the calendars of my fellow Executive Board members and myself and the Supervisory Board Chair, were two further major steps towards increased transparency. But our readiness to provide further information on topics of interest also underlines that the ECB is a transparent institution. To give you some examples: since September 2015, national central banks can publicly communicate about the provision of ELA to the banks in their respective countries in cases where they deem such communication necessary. We also provided further information on our plans regarding the collection of granular credit and credit risk data, better known as AnaCredit. So I can assure you that the ECB monitors developments in the area of governance and access to documents with a view to further enhancing its transparency and therefore its accountability. Let me now comment briefly on completing the European Monetary Union. As some of you have acknowledged, the Five Presidents’ Report outlined a clear roadmap for moving ahead with euro area integration, and I certainly welcomed the Commission’s proposals for short-term measures which should now be fully implemented. For the ECB, of course, the completion of the banking union is of the utmost importance. On the one hand, this means that commonly-agreed rules need to be implemented. The most prominent example of where further progress should be made is the transposition of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (DGSD) in all euro area Member States. We are still missing a common backstop for the Single Resolution Fund. We also need progress on the necessary, still-missing third pillar of the banking union, namely the common European Deposit Guarantee Scheme. Why is it important? Because only such a system will ensure that depositors’ confidence is equally strong across countries and across the whole banking union, which is vital for the future of our economic and monetary union. Implementing the short-term proposal of the Five Presidents’ Report is important and may be necessary, but it is not a sufficient condition to completing the union. So I am looking forward to the proposals for developing the long-term issues. Let me also recall, as I have done on other occasions, that for the euro area to prosper, the recovery cannot continue – and here I certainly agree with some of the statements today – to rely on monetary policy only. Our monetary policy provides the room – as I said, it is an essential condition but is not in itself sufficient – for this recovery to become structural from what it is today, namely cyclical. There was one question about high-denomination banknotes. Let me say that the Executive Board of the ECB has been considering this issue for some time now, and technical work is under way to look at high-denomination banknotes. We have not made a decision yet. There are questions on how to best implement a decision and how to communicate this. We want to make changes, but we want to make changes in an orderly fashion. But rest assured that we are determined not to make seigniorage a comfort for criminals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 70, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς", "mepid": "125069", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, I would like to thank colleagues for their participation in the debate. Mr Draghi, I agree that we need to look to the future, but this presupposes that the ECB must see the mistakes it has made in the past. The ECB underestimated the risks of deflation, and it was only in September 2014 that it woke up and resorted to unconventional instruments, planning quantitative easing which it finally began to implement from January 2015. You have also been slow to cut interest rates as the Fed did in good time and you have not answered, Mr Draghi, because unemployment is still soaring. At the same time, you continued to insist on tough fiscal policy and austerity. You did not reply, Mr Draghi, to the measures you must take to stop the conflict of interest within the ECB. Finally, when are you going to leave the Troika, Mr Draghi, as the Court of Justice of the European Union pointed out to you in judgment C-62/2014, and indirectly, just now, you yourself accepted it? Finally, how can we explain, Mr Draghi, that the borrowing Greece is lending eur 17 billion to its lenders through quantitative easing - with the Bank of Greece? Where did Mr Stournaras get 17 billion euros and the Bank of Greece participated in quantitative easing in 2015?  You do not reply, Mr Draghi, to the way in which the Memorandums are implemented. You wash your hands as Pontius Pilate, and you blame the Eurogroup. But you tried and imposed credit suffocation on Greece in 2015 and capital controls were imposed. Your blackmail policy and the support of lenders to bent the \"no\" vote of the Greek people in the July 2015 referendum is recorded as a black spot for the ECB. As an unacceptable violation of popular sovereignty in Greece, as the catalysis of the European Republic.  Mr Draghi, in order for the eurozone to actually have a solution to the contradictions, the Eurozone must cease to be a Union of Lenders. The issue of public debt must be resolved and this must be done by writing off the shameful debt and reciprocity of the debt. The above points were in the original proposal, but the PRE, S&amp;D and ALDE groups took care to remove criticism of the ECB.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ACS remains unknown to the general public, even though it has been negotiated since 2013 with 23 countries which account for 70% of trade in services.  We will soon be subject to its rules, whether it is when we take our phone, our credit card, the various means of transport abroad, when we surf the social reasons, on the online shopping sites: no sector, from digital to transport through financial services, will escape it. Therefore, we have no right to make mistakes.  That is why, although the Commission is conducting the negotiations on behalf of the Union, Parliament - which controls the Commission - will draw up very clear guidelines. As evidenced by the report on which this House will vote on Wednesday, the stakes are such that MEPs have joined ranks, across political divides, to change the direction of Europe's trade policy, both in form and in substance of the negotiations. On form, first of all, it's a real break. For a long time, the negotiations were conducted in a vacuum. Since the 2014 elections, things have changed, with the main political groups constantly monitoring every round of negotiations, as well as an intense dialogue within Parliament, with the consultation of no less than eight parliamentary committees, and outside the institutions, with civil society, among others.  At our request, the Council's mandate and the European Union's proposals for commitment have already been made public, and I would like to thank the Commissioner for her help in this regard. With this report, we want to go even further in transparency. In substance then, the change is just as radical. As elected officials, it is our responsibility to delineate which ACS we want and which we do not. Our message is clear: we want better international regulation, fair and robust regulation.  Specifically, this report contains blue lines: more reciprocity in access to foreign markets, especially in the telecoms, transport, public procurement sectors, more rights for consumers against abuses such as roaming charges or spam, more benefits for our SMEs, and finally more participants at the negotiating table , where we can imagine having China as well. Our red lines are just as numerous. Our public and audiovisual services must be explicitly excluded, our right to fully regulated, our fundamental rights and the right to data protection safeguarded, the movement of people limited to the temporary movement of qualified personnel under a contract. Finally, offensive and defensive interests are often wrongly opposed. They are inseparable. There can be no agreement without protection or protection without agreement. Concentrating 25% of world exports and a trade surplus of 160 billion, the European Union can and must make a difference by establishing fairer and stronger international rules. Colleagues, you will have the opportunity on Wednesday to send a strong message to the negotiators that these negotiations will take the right direction, in the interests of our businesses, in the interests of European citizens.  To vote against the report is to vote for the status quo, that is, for the lack of reciprocity, for the absence of rules. To vote for the report is to vote for change, that is, for transparency, for the defence of our values, our interests. To vote in support is to bind the Commission by a clear parliamentary mandate. So let's take responsibility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 75, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission would like to thank Parliament for the broad engagement – so many committees engaged in the TiSA negotiations – and, of course the rapporteur, Mrs Reding, for the work she has done on this, as well as the shadow rapporteurs. It is very important for us to make sure that we negotiate this in close cooperation with the European Parliament. As you know, services account for about 70% of our GDP, but they represent only 25% of our external trade. So TiSA is a tool to try to redress that imbalance and open up foreign markets to EU suppliers. This week, as we speak, negotiators from 23 WTO members are meeting in Geneva for the 16th negotiation round of TiSA. We welcome the progress achieved to date, especially in the autumn: a lot of progress has been made, and we hope to continue on this positive track. I had the possibility to meet almost all ministers whose countries are engaged in TiSA in Davos. We took stock of where we are. There was a positive atmosphere, and many countries wanted to bring these negotiations to an end this year. This is an ambitious, realistic tool, but, of course, for us the content is more important than speed. Having a very ambitious work plan ahead of us, we appreciate the support and recommendations that the European Parliament has included in the draft resolution to be voted on Wednesday. We would certainly take your views into account, as much as possible, as the negotiations progress. As you point out in the resolution, TiSA aims to unleash the untapped potential of more integral global services markets. It could give us a unique possibility to address the existing barriers to the international trade in services that are impeding the expansion of services export. We aim to develop strong, transparent and effective rules across the different sectors that are crucial in enabling global services trade in TiSA. This is also an important contribution to the multilateral trade agenda, in particular in a situation where plurilateral deals are meant to play an increasing role in the post-Nairobi context. So we fully agree with you – and this is important for me personally – that there should be as broad a participation as possible in TiSA so that we can work towards future multilateralisation. As you know, today 23 countries participate in the negotiations, and that represents 70% of global services trade. But we should keep the doors open for more applicants, notably towards large, emerging economies such as China. It would bring TiSA towards the critical mass required for the multilateralisation of the deal. With this in mind the EU has been leading the efforts to design the proposal and the architecture of TiSA so it would be fully compatible with the GATS agreement and thus facilitate future multilateralisation. I am pleased to hear that the European Parliament has appreciated the efforts of transparency. Thank you for pushing on this, and we will continuously try to enhance that. You now receive all negotiation documents, as does the Council. The chief negotiator regularly delivers extensive briefings to the INTA monitoring group led by the rapporteur Mrs Reding, and we are in regular dialogue with civil society. In addition we have ensured that all the reports from the negotiating rounds are available on the internet. I would like to reassure you on some of the points that you raised in the resolution and some of the concerns. The draft resolution calls for horizontal carve-outs accepted by all TISA participants on public services and an assurance that TiSA parties subscribe to the ILO Conventions. However, if we want to see TiSA multilateralised in the framework in the future, we need to base it on the scope of the GATS, and GATS does not contain such broad carve-outs or requirements to subscribe to other international conventions or law which developing and emerging countries would want to see if they joined TISA, and they will have difficulties to subscribe to this. But that does, of course, not exclude us in other fora working with countries for them subscribing to the ILO Conventions. Secondly, and this is very important, public services, culture, labour rights – it is my firm intention, and this is for the whole negotiating team, to ensure that we remain able to unilaterally, here in Europe, decide on the level of protection we want to have. In particular, the EU will never compromise on the essential role of the widest discretion of national, local and regional authorities in providing, commissioning and organising public services as guaranteed in the EU Treaty. This is our approach and that will remain. Third, I note that the draft resolution recommends limited trade liberalisation commitment in cross-border trade: the so-called Mode 1. We will pursue a very cautious approach here, for instance, in some sectors such as financial services. However, in other sectors like digital services, which represent growth potential – especially for us, it is an offensive interest – the cross-border nature is so inherent to the technology that it would not be in the EU’s interest to limit our commitments. Fourth, data protection is a fundamental right of the EU. TiSA will not jeopardise it. Finally, let me say that we have come to a compromise on the e-TiSA architecture as a result of very difficult negotiations, and any changes to ratchet and standstill clauses here would bring us back to day one. But be assured that these clauses only apply to a right to discriminate between foreign and domestic companies – what we call national treatment – and not to liberalisation, meaning market access commitment. In addition, we also deploy broad carve-outs for sectors which we consider genuinely sensitive. So I consider this resolution as a strong signal of support by the European Parliament to continue and to conclude TiSA negotiations. You have clearly marked your red lines and your input here, so allow me to thank you for this and also for all the opinions given by the different committees and to pledge my full cooperation with the European Parliament in the future as we push for a conclusion of this agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 76, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Thomas Händel", "mepid": "96851", "text": "   Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

In this respect, with regard to financial services too, the European Parliament is calling for the implementation and application of international standards to be promoted, without, however, making new commitments that could jeopardise European Union regulations in the financial sector. The TiSa must also be used as an opportunity for a global system to combat tax fraud, evasion, aggressive tax planning and money laundering in the financial services sector.

First, a question about the objective, because a free trade agreement is not an end in itself. It only makes sense if it is favourable to European businesses and citizens and this requires simple principles: the conditions for fair competition, reciprocal access to markets and, above all, the maintenance of the possibility of legislating in the direction of the general interest.

In this House we have the power to veto any trade deal, and if we use this power wisely in the negotiations we can deliver a more democratic EU trade policy that works for people and not just for profit.

We want a full, unambiguous exclusion for all public services. We need rules to guarantee public authorities’ right to regulate and, while we are good at exporting services in Europe, which is creating and maintaining millions of jobs in the EU, we should do what we can to create new opportunities for our economy.

It is great that she is here in what is going to be a vital debate that is actually one that is going to affect tens of millions of jobs in the European Union. The Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) has the potential to add GBP 20 billion to the annual GDP of the EU, and with services accounting for 70% of our EU economy. The UK is one of the biggest exporters of services in the world, and so my Member State has a keen interest in the advancement of talks at a plurilateral level. And we have managed to attract very broad support in the committee for this report, which shows that many of my fellow colleagues also understand the significance of this trade agreement. On the one hand, we must ensure that TiSA is an ambitious agreement that tackles the modern-day issues of the 21st century, such as trade in digital services and recognition of and help for the inclusion of small- and medium-sized enterprises in global supply chains. But, on the other hand, we must take on board public concerns about trade deals and their perceived threat, which is why the committee has included the language on the protection of public services such as the NHS and continuing to allow Member State governments to manage the services as they see fit.

We expect the sector to become even more important. Our service providers are competitive, as the EU itself is already very open and foreign companies are treated equally on our market. There is therefore a lot to be gained by seeing more countries reciprocally opening up their markets to EU service providers and having a level playing field across a larger group of countries. In fact, we would ultimately like TiSA to become a multilateral agreement. Similarly, services are being developed in new areas, such as the digital economy, which will require the rules to be updated. Everyone with internet access could in principle offer a service in a third country. The Trade in Services Agreement should contribute to clear rules to ensure that principles such as fair competition, but also fundamental rights, are respected. In today’s report the Parliament calls on the Commission to aim for an ambitious agreement, especially in sectors such as e-commerce, telecommunication, financial services, procurement and transport. I think – and this is important to underline amidst all the concerns that also have to be addressed today – that we have every reason to be self-confident. This Parliament does confirm existing legislation and standards are not lowered and free trade should follow rules. Therefore, public services and audiovisual services are also confirmed to be excluded in our report, and TiSA cannot force national governments to break open monopolies on the provision of, for example, water or electricity.

The negotiating mandate does not reflect the views of the public and indeed not the views of this Parliament. The public interest has not been sufficiently taken into account. Europeans are opposed to the liberalisation of public services through TiSA. They are opposed to ratchet and standstill clauses and other measures that may limit our democratic rights to regulate in the public interest. Challenging the Commission’s negotiating strategy on TiSA is therefore an important achievement of this report. But for this Parliament to really be taken seriously as a voice of the people in this negotiation, we have to become bolder. We have to clearly reject any agreement that is not firmly based on a positive list approach. We have to be consistent in the criticism formulated in this report and demand the EU negotiating mandate be changed to adopt Parliament’s position. If that does not happen, then the Commission has to be sure that we will be prepared to reject TiSA. There are still no convincing reasons for abandoning the multilateral approach in favour of closed-door negotiations between individual countries. These agreements put developing countries at a disadvantage because they do not have a seat at the negotiating table. Civil society has even less access to the TiSA negotiations than on TTIP, and in their analysis they have had to rely quite heavily on leaks. Leaks of the e-commerce chapter in particular have raised many red flags. We must not let TiSA undermine the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. We must not let TiSA undermine our ability to ensure fair competition and consumer protection, for example through rigorous net neutrality provisions and the right of users to use any technical equipment they choose to access the internet.

We therefore have a reduction in state intervention and at the same time the interests of both citizens and small companies are being affected at the expense of large multinationals.  In addition, the State is obliged to keep records of these companies and to bear their costs. Moreover, if some elements proposed by the UNITED States are adopted, then the state will not be able to give pensions to its citizens.

TiSA can be good for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, those which find non-tariff barriers more difficult to overcome than bigger enterprises do.

But the agreement that we are trying to impose in countries is even worse than the general agreement on trade in services. This is called, in WTO jargon, \"an agreement.\" This means that once again we will open up all the services. For it is wrong to say that public services will be protected, because within these services there are already systems that allow them to be opened up to foreign actors.  So today very clearly...

TiSA is an opportunity to create a global playing field for trade in services. That has great potential for the economy globally but especially for Europe, because the European Union is quite open to other investment – but we need as well to ensure that our companies can also invest abroad. The GATS Agreement really needs to be updated in order to take into account the new global realities and create, as some of you said, the legal certainty that is so important to get this right. Because I absolutely agree, free trade is not something good per se; free trade is a means to create jobs, goods and investment. But of course it needs to be surrounded by certain regulations and certain rules. The aim is to make this a multilateral agreement. I fully share your concerns on this, and that is why the EU has been so eager to try to make the architecture as open and as inclusive as possible, so that gradually more countries will join, so that we can bring it under the premises of the WTO. It is a fact that the GATS Agreement does not contain obligations to sign up to the ILO, but that does not mean that we are not pushing for this. The European Union is always pushing for countries, in all kind of relations – including trade, of course – to sign up to the key WTO conventions, and we are continuing to do this as well. Public services – audio-visual services – are always excluded in our agreements. That is very clear in the mandate we have from the Member States. It is very clear from what you have said today, but also earlier on this. Public services such as education, health, water supplies and audio-visual services are excluded. They do not need to be privatised, and if they are privatised there is nothing in this agreement, nor in TTIP or in any other agreement, that will prevent the local, regional or national level if there is a political decision to bring it back to the public sector if that is the political decision. Also the right to regulate in a non-discriminatory way is not affected. Authorities on all levels can legislate on, for instance, environmental and health standards as they wish, and this will not change. On transparency, as you have seen, we have really tried to make the EU contribution to this as transparent as possible. Most of the EU proposals, and a summary after each negotiation round, are on line. You as MEPs have access to all documents. But this is a negotiation that we lead together with 22 other countries, and there is no way we can legally publish the proposals of Peru, Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, Pakistan, etc. That has to be their decision. I deplore the fact that they have not chosen to be as transparent as we have, but we cannot publish this, and that is why sometimes proposals, even draft proposals from a given country, appear on the internet, leaked. That does not mean that they are actually part of the negotiation; it is a proposal or a draft for one country. Many of these – you referred to some of them – have been immediately rejected by us and others as well. But we will continue to try to see if we can make this even more transparent and to make sure you are as included and as engaged as possible. In the end you will, of course, like the Member States, have your say on this. We are negotiating TiSA based on the mandate given to us by 28 countries, and you also had your say on this when it started. I am very mindful of the concerns that you have expressed here – we are taking them on board and we will continue to do so – and of the concerns that that many people have outside this whole House. But I am also very mindful that we still have huge unemployment in this European Union, that millions of people are still without jobs, and TiSA and other trade agreements are a way to create jobs and investment and growth in Europe, which desperately needs it. So we need to find a balance there. I think that with your input in the resolution, the debate we will have and the continued negotiations – as I said, there is a round as we talk this week, and we will debrief you from that immediately when it is over – jointly we can make this agreement that finds the right balance that so many of you are asking for , and I will be happy to continue to engage with you.

In this Protocol of Accession there was Article 15, which provided for a 15-year transitional period with regard to the use of pricing in anti-dumping and anti-subsidisation cases. This transitional period will expire on 11 December this year. In this respect, we must now, in fact, give us quick thought. There is no question that our anti-dumping and anti-subsidisation procedures are usually linked to China. About 80% of all procedures have to do with China, because pricing is distorted internally and we use pricing from third countries in our anti-dumping and anti-subsidisation procedures. In this respect, we must now think very carefully about what it means when the transitional period expires on 11 December and that China – as it is called in technical Chinese – should be granted market economy status. On the other hand, we cannot, of course, hand over our levers for sensible protective instruments. I am a little concerned about whether everything will still work out in time, because a legislative proposal obviously takes quite a while and the Council and Parliament, as legislators, have to agree on this. In this respect, I wonder where these fifteen years have actually remained. You could have gone to work a little earlier. There are three options: let it run, i.e. give China market economy status almost automatically, thereby giving up the anti-dumping and anti-subsidisation possibilities. Australia has done that, with a clear negative effect. You can look at that, they have hardly any opportunities to defend themselves – so I think that's out of the way. The second option of saying a clear 'no' would automatically lead to a complaint to the WTO. Perhaps there is a third option, because if you look closely at the protocol, there is also scope for alternative methods: with regard to the question of the pricing of third countries, which is being used, but also with regard to the obligation to provide proof. I believe that this should also be analysed very carefully as to whether we are making progress here, so that we also have a sensible trade protection mechanism procedure after 11 December. And that also means, of course, holding talks with the Chinese partner in order to find a sensible solution here. Talks must be held anyway, because it is unacceptable that overproduction should be created through state subsidies, which are then sold on the European market, as is currently the case in the steel sector. Talks need to be held here, that cannot be the case. On 18 February, there will also be a large demonstration of the steel sector in Brussels. We are at our core: anti-dumping and anti-subsidy have something to do with jobs, and we need a clear impact analysis of the effects of these three options and how to ensure that jobs are not at risk and that industrial development in Europe – we want to ensure 20% of gross domestic product – is strengthened, not weakened.  I cannot quite understand the Council – which is not really there today – because, on the one hand, it has been failing to reform trade defence instruments since April 2014 and, on the other hand, it is shedding crocodile tears on the question of whether or not to give China market economy status. So, we need to set clear lines, and that is why we are asking you, Commissioner: what do you want to put on the table, when do you want to put something on the table, and what will the content be?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 142, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lange for giving me the possibility to discuss this issue in depth with the honourable Members. I am happy to update Parliament on where we are on this file. Let me start by stressing that the question is not whether China is a market economy or not. It is not – at least not in the way we understand the term. The question is whether the EU should change the method it must follow to calculate dumping in EU anti-dumping investigations. The debate is, as Chairman Lange said, about the expiry of the 15—year transitional period following China’s accession to the WTO and about the application of certain anti-dumping methodologies and the implications for our jobs and our industry. Anti—dumping actually only affects 1.38% of all our imports from China, but it can provide essential relief to individual companies or sectors suffering from unfair trading practices, dumping or subsidies. We are, in fact, analysing the three options that that Mr Lange referred to. First, not to change EU legislation. China obviously expects the EU to apply the WTO protocol and change its methodology, as of 11 December this year. Not doing so might have an impact on our trade and investment relations, in addition to potential legal challenges. This situation could have a cost for EU business, including in employment terms. These effects are, of course, very difficult, if not impossible, to estimate in advance. We can only speculate. There is a risk that this option would put the EU in breach of WTO obligations, with possible economic effects. There are, indeed, different interpretations of Section 15 of China’s accession protocol, but there are solid interpretations saying that at least some of the provisions will expire. The second alternative would be to remove China from the list of non—market-economy countries in our legislation without further conditions. This would be economically damaging to many EU industries and politically unrealistic. A preliminary estimation of the effects of this option has been circulated to you in an information note. Third, to remove China from the list of market economy countries while, at the same time, introducing mitigating measures by strengthening the EU Trade Defence Instrument to reflect the full extent of the numerous distortions that still exist in the Chinese economy, thereby maintaining an effective anti-dumping instrument. We are of course aware that all these options have economic and social impacts and need to be properly assessed. No matter what path we choose, the Commission remains committed to maintaining a strong anti-dumping instrument to protect our industry from unfair trade while respecting international obligations. The legal advice we have received indicates that the current method of dumping calculations need to be changed on the date of expiry of the transitional period. Even under an alternative interpretation, there is a broad understanding that this so—called analogue country approach, as provided for in our current legislation, cannot be used as such anymore. So these are the basic options. They are all very technically complex and have effects. We are indeed carrying out a deep impact assessment. The paper you received is just a preliminary first assessment. The commitment is, of course, to keep you fully informed. We submitted this paper to you with preliminary findings, and this is part of the transparency we need to have with you. Another issue is cooperation with other stakeholders. The Commission is in regular contact with our main stakeholders, particularly EU industry, and they have all shared opinions with the Commission. Regarding the preliminary findings on the impact on EU industry and employment, we have based the study on robust methodology and existing data from the ongoing 52 cases that we have with China for the moment. This study estimates the following potential negative employment effects of changing from the current non-market economy methodology to the normal anti-dumping. They are estimates, and with each scenario it follows that we have made no mitigating measures. So this is the worst-case scenario. In the sectors covered by anti-dumping measures now, we estimate that between 34 000 and 77 000 jobs could be lost. In the longer run, if we look at other sectors that could also be affected, the study points at between 73 000 and 188 000 jobs. If you take into account the possible effects on downstream and upstream industries, we are talking about between 63 000 and 210 000 jobs. This is a lot, and it is important, but it is much lower than suggested by some other studies by, for instance, the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute. And, again, these estimations are made without any mitigating factors, so you should bear that in mind. We need to take these risks seriously into account, and this reminds us of the importance of the issue. Regarding one of the other questions on coordination with other countries, we are indeed in contact with other partners on this. Yet we must bear in mind that all WTO members have to abide by their legal commitments and consider appropriate actions. Some of our main trading partners do not have to amend their laws. We have to amend our laws, and that takes some time. Some countries can make a decision in five minutes, so that makes us a little different from other partners such as the USA, for instance. So we are in a unique situation in that we are the only country that explicitly lists China as a non-market economy for anti-dumping. So should we choose to change our anti-dumping methodology – and we are not there yet, we are assessing all the alternatives, as I said – this would then require a change of legislation. In that legislation, you would of course be full co—legislators. It would be a proposal from the Commission to the Council and to Parliament, so you would have a full say in that process. But we are not there yet, and this is a way to update you on where we are. I am happy to continue this debate to see if there are any remaining questions.

Since there is a need to amend the EU legislation, granting the MES to China is not automatic. There are economic consequences, since there are hundreds of thousands of European jobs exposed. We expect the Commission to conduct and present a deep and comprehensive impact assessment. The geopolitical context, in both ways, and the EU—China strategic partnership are in need of more cooperation and less antagonism. In conclusion, a legally-sound WTO-compatible solution has to be proposed by the Commission. We see a clear need to keep functioning EU trade defence systems in place. The solution delivered by the Commission has to allow anti-dumping cases against China in the future as well.

We want good relations with China, and we understand that China feels that in December, market economic status should automatically be granted to it. But China should also understand that in 2001 we had a real expectation that by 2016 China itself would be a market economy. It is clear that it is not, and the Commissioner herself has made it clear that China is not a market economy. Therefore, there can be no automatic granting of market economic status to China. We cannot allow China to solve its overcapacity by dumping on the European market. Steel might be capturing the headlines at the moment, but, as the Commission again points out, we have 52 ongoing investigations on dumping, so the impact is much wider than just the steel industry.

Firstly, following the opinion of Parliament’s Legal Service, the Commission has to be conscious of its commitments under WTO law on changing its anti-dumping regulations to take account of the expiry of Article 15a under China’s accession protocol. On the other hand, I am more than aware of the importance of this issue, given that my own Member State’s steel industry is currently on its knees and may never recover. This is largely due to Chinese steel being sold on the world market. It is therefore vital, whatever action is taken about the protocol, that EU anti-dumping law retains the ability to take swift and effective action to tackle anti-competitive market practices. Therefore I call on the Commission to include, as part of its strategy over the coming months, a detailed impact assessment on the changing of the methodology for anti-dumping duties, but also to look at the full remit of the trade defence instruments we have at our disposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 146, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Marietje Schaake", "mepid": "96945", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, dumping products on the EU market under the market price is not allowed and should be met with appropriate measures. The question is how the EU can best address the inevitable expiry of the protocol on China’s accession to the WTO that was signed 15 years ago. The question before us is not whether we believe China has a market economy where prices are set by supply and demand: it does not. The question before us is how we should address illegal trade practices by a country that is also an important trading partner. My group believes we must address this complex and technical matter with a cool head. Some people have already taken very emotional positions; others wish to use this moment to enforce their wish-list of protectionist measures. But they seem to forget that there are both importers and exporters in Europe, and that the economic angle is not the only one to consider. I believe we need a thorough impact assessment and a legal analysis, and that we must strengthen the rules-based system of trade. Particularly in relation to China, it is key that we too, on the EU side, practise what we preach and that our solutions should be WTO- proof. It does mean that we need effective trade defence instruments to address subsidies, dumping and other illegal practices by China or any other country for that matter.

Our discussion should not be bogged down in the question of whether China is a purely market economy. Globalisation requires political regulation of market forces. It is important for us that the annual increase in the minimum wage of 12% should be decided politically in China, to the displeasure of European financial investors. It is already higher in China than in Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic and Lithuania. This reduces wage pressure and strengthens purchasing power for imports from Europe. What is at stake is how we can respond to dumping. We want to preserve jobs in Europe, but also in China. For this we do not need a dispute over calculation formulas, but a political agreement with China. That is why we put our question to you, Commissioner.

I am prepared to recognise a non-market economy as a market economy, as long as this does not result in serious damage to our market economy being caused by the dumping of the non-market economy.

We in the European Parliament do not want to be blue-eyed at the expense of European jobs. This Parliament should not unconditionally comply with Chinese demands; rather, we should make an offer.

Highly subsidised Cheap Chinese steel, which floods the European market directly or through imports from third countries, is partly responsible for the current steel crisis in Europe, which is leading to production relocations and, ultimately, the loss of thousands of jobs. Since 2014, the Commission has opened 16 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy proceedings, six of which concern the Chinese steel industry. In August last year, imports of cold-rolled flat steel products from China and Taiwan were subject to punitive tariffs of up to 25%, and of all the anti-dumping proceedings initiated in recent years, 44%, or almost half, concern China. Despite this background, China is now demanding automatic WTO status by 11 December this year.

Since its accession to the WTO in 2001 in 15 years, China has failed to take legislative and structural steps that would make it a standard market economy. If market economy status is granted to China, the European Union will lose any form of control and ability to protect itself against the disproportionately growing imports of various types of Chinese goods into the European market.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which We have been negotiating with African states for a long time in order to shape the partnership agreements in such a way that they are ready for signature and are also being ratified by Parliament. We want this because we really want to strengthen the economic development of the partner countries in Africa, including regional development.  As far as West Africa is concerned, we know that many countries are also very dependent on exports and that regional value chains are not developed. In this respect, we have introduced many asymmetric aspects there, safeguard mechanisms, we have completely excluded certain sensitive areas from the agreement, and the objective of strengthening regional added value is, I believe, very clear. If you look at the fact that about 80% of the cocoa beans we consume come from West Africa in particular, but only 4% of chocolate, it is clear that there is a need to increase value creation here. However, if you look at West Africa, of course, there are also some issues of sustainable development. Once again, on cocoa, we know that child labour is the rule when harvesting cocoa beans, and I cannot imagine, however, that if we consume children's chocolate, we run the risk of promoting child labour. That is why we need to focus on the issue of sustainability, especially as far as West Africa is concerned. And that's where a special weirdness comes into play. We have already concluded a partnership agreement which is also more or less working, namely the CARIFORUM agreement; David Martin is the expert. And there we have many very positive references, especially as far as the sustainability chapter is concerned. And if you compare that now with the West Africa Agreement, Commissioner, you have to say that there are many white papers. And that is why we are asking these four questions. In other words, how we really want to ensure that the issue of human rights and workers' rights is implemented. The CARIFORUM agreement provides a clear link with ILO standards, in particular the issue of forced child labour. The second question relates to the consultative body to be set up. Here, too, the agreement lacks a clear description of tasks – also a major difference from the CARIFORUM agreement. So the questions: How are the tasks defined? What resources does this body actually have? What are the procedures? Will third parties also be involved? The CARIFORUM agreement, for example, includes the ILO and also the question of how dispute resolution is concerned: what mechanisms are working? That, too, is behind the second question, and the third question is once again a matter of principle, how the Commission as a whole, DGTRADE, and the External Action Service, want to ensure that civil society organisations and their opinions are adequately involved. And, of course, we would like to know how these three elements will be embedded in time, so that when we ratify the EPO with West Africa, we are also sure that sustainability is adequately guaranteed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 204, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the ‘Trade for All’ communication that the Commission and I presented to you last year stresses our commitment to ensuring that trade agreements deliver concrete results, including on sustainable development, and that our values are always promoted in our trade relations. This is the case for the Economic Partnership Agreements. They are anchored in the principles and the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. That means the overarching sustainable development objective, including its social, economic and environmental components. It also means the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement, including human rights, and thirdly, it means specific provisions on trade and labour standards and environment. These objectives and principles will shape the implementation of the West Africa—EU EPA, from the entry into force and throughout its existence. To make sure that the EPA lives up to its ambition, the Commission will pay particular attention to monitoring it – including as regards sustainable development aspects. A jointly-agreed competitiveness observatory will monitor and assess the overall impact of the EPA, including the way in which the sustainable development objectives are achieved. As for the agreed time frame for the EPA implementation, it is a long-term agreement under which a joint review will take place every five years. This will allow the parties to regularly evaluate progress and address outstanding challenges. Let me insist that, from the Commission side, we will pay particular attention to human rights, labour standards and environmental protection in those reviews. Depending on the results of the monitoring and review, specific measures can be taken. Those measures should consist of adjudging EPA implementation or even proposing amendments to the text in close cooperation with our West African partners. In the case of issues regarding the respective commitments defined as essential elements of the partnership, including human rights and core labour rights, the Commission will use the instruments and the mechanisms that are provided for in the Cotonou Agreement. That starts with political dialogue and ends with appropriate measures, including the last-resort option of suspension of market access preferences. The EPA stakeholders and institutions have a role here in monitoring. The Commission has already started preparations with West Africa for the early constitution of a Joint Consultative Committee, foreseen under the EPA, which shall have broad civil society representation. The EPA also foresees financial support to the institution, including the Consultative Committee. The Commission has earmarked funding possibilities in this respect under the European Development Fund and the partnership instrument. The EPA clearly provides that the Consultative Committee will work in consultation with the EPA Council, or on its own initiative, and make recommendations on all issues falling under the scope and objectives of the EPA. Within the EPA Council and the implementation committee, the parties will carefully consider any EPA—related issue brought to their attention, be they concerns regarding a possible infringement or other issues. The Commission will take careful account of the civil society contribution within this institutional context and seek policy change when appropriate. The objective is to promote sustainable development consideration in all relevant areas of the EPA. Achieving the outcomes we are striving for will, of course, require partnership, cooperation, effectiveness and policy coherence and a central role for domestic actors and policies in West Africa. It would be very good if Parliament started now to engage in preparations with West Africa in order to set up the Joint Parliamentary Committee as soon as the EPA enters into force. This would be a key organ to monitor the impact and effectiveness of the EPA. It is very important to make the link with domestic reforms and to engage in a policy dialogue. It will also be a valuable tool for us in the Commission to make sure that the dialogue on the implementation is monitored. Thank you very much.

The first has already been put forward by David Martin: it concerns the reference to the Cotonou agreement. This reference in the agreement with West Africa says: \"We will refer to relevant provisions of Cotonou\". I think that talking about relevant provisions introduces a particular legal interpretation. Moreover, when the Cotonou agreement expires, what will be the legal basis for achieving the provisions on dialogue and sanctions? The second question is about the benefit to African countries. Of the West African countries, 12 out of 16 states are LDCs, i.e. not affected by EPAs, and only 3 countries are in GSP. In January 2012, the South Centre calculated the difference between the EPA and GSP, and this study concludes that for most West African countries, tax losses are greater than gains.

Combined with development assistance and other foreign policy tools, it can really contribute to improving living conditions, creating jobs and possibilities for people. The economic partnership agreements (EPAs) are, as you know, asymmetrical free trade agreements. We open up for them but we do not ask the African countries or the ACP countries to open up to the same extent, because we know that some sectors are very vulnerable. They are included in very long phasing-out sections in order to help them to diversify their economy. Ms Arena, I was in Nigeria just before Christmas and I spoke to many people from Nigeria, and I think this would indeed benefit Nigeria enormously – precisely because of its economic problems – to help diversify its economy, to make sure that it can rise in the value chains, if we can help them to develop assistance so that that they can have standards and qualifications on their products , for instance in agriculture, and also to support regional integration, because that is a very important part of the EPAs: regional integration and the development dimension. Together with my colleague Neven Mimica, we are working very closely to make sure that there is a lot of development assistance in the EPAs. Sustainability and human rights are indeed key to all our trade agreements. I agree with Ms Keller that we could have done even more in this area. It is not always easy, but we are trying to find ways. You know that the way for the European Union is to start with dialogue, not with sanctions, because if you start with sanctions, those who will suffer are not the regime – the authorities; it is the ordinary people who benefit from the contacts. The EU model is to start with dialogue, try to set up different forums, engage with civil society. Then, of course, there is the sanction possibility in the end, but there are lots of steps that can be taken. Our African partners in the West African Agreement were not ready to go as far as we would have wanted them when it comes to sustainable development formulas: this is under negotiation. That is why there is a rendez-vous clause where we have agreed to see if we can pursue that even further. But anyway we will, as I said in my introduction, pay specific attention to implementing, monitoring and making sure that we follow up on labour, environmental and human rights in the different forums that we are creating here, and the European Parliament has a very important role to play here. Cotonou indeed expires, Mr Martin, and we are engaged to see what will come after Cotonou. But whatever happens to Cotonou, the provisions there are still valuable, and the principles will not be changed, whatever happens to Cotonou. Also in Cotonou we have monitoring possibilities with human rights dialogue, etc. We firmly believe, in the contacts we have had with the ACP countries – today we are talking about West Africa, but we have other ongoing or almost-closed negotiations – that this is something that has been done in partnership. There you take and give, but this is something that will be truly beneficial for, in this case, West Africa, but also for the other ACP countries in order to help them to develop, to create new possibilities, growth, jobs, and indeed possibilities to sustain their families in these countries, and also to promote a bigger impact on regional integration, which is something that is really lacking in this part of the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 215, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The Treaty is a coherent link between the European Union's trade and foreign policies. EpAs, if properly implemented, are in fact an excellent opportunity to promote sustainable growth and respect for human rights through the tools typical of trade agreements. The most delicate phase is precisely that of application. Experience with development aid and the implementation of trade treaties has shown that promises are all too often disillusioned. While recognising the fundamental contribution of the Cotonou Convention to cooperation and the active promotion of respect for fundamental rights, the lack of specific forecasts in the text is of some concern. In order to promote real development and social progress in West Africa, I believe that the political dimension of the agreement must take precedence over the trade dimension. I would therefore like to ask the Commission what mechanisms it will have in terms of the involvement of civil society and to establish a permanent and decisive dialogue with the partners in the area.

On top of the overwhelming intrinsic value of nature, biodiversity offers unaffordable socio-economic benefits. One in six jobs in the European Union depends on nature. The added value of Natura 2000, the European network of top nature, is many times greater than the management costs and missing out on the biodiversity strategy will cost us EUR 50 billion a year. Biodiversity loss is therefore rightly regarded as one of the greatest global threats, and it is.  Nevertheless, we are seriously failing in the implementation of the European Biodiversity Strategy and today we are far from halfway through achieving the 2020 targets. Despite encouraging points of hope that targeted efforts do indeed produce success stories and that the objectives are achievable, the overall picture remains extremely bleak. Only 23% of species and 16% of habitats are in good condition. Without considerable additional efforts, we cannot avert a scenario such as in 2010 and we will miss the appointment again in 2020. The central message of my report is therefore that more political will is urgently needed to turn the tide and that is at all levels of policy. Better implementation, stricter enforcement and further integration of biodiversity into other policy areas are essential. In addition, all stakeholders should be involved in this story up to and including the individual citizen.  Colleagues, the bird and habitat guidelines are a crucial link in this story. My position in front of the ongoing fitness check of the nature guidelines is crystal clear. The directives should not be revised. On the contrary, they must be fully implemented. A revision of it would jeopardize the biodiversity strategy itself, would entail a long period of legal uncertainty and potentially weaken these milestones of European nature policy. Moreover, I am convinced that a revision would not provide a solution. The possible problems do not lie with the legislation itself, but above all the incomplete implementation and enforcement of the nature directives.  I'm not alone in my position. The Committee on the Environment supported my report almost unanimously. And I strongly believe that tomorrow the entire Parliament will also send a clear signal to the European Commission. Moreover, more than half a million European citizens spoke out against a review of nature guidelines through the Nature Alert Campaign. Ministers also expressed their explicit support for the nature directives at the Environment Council on 16 December and stressed above all the importance of better implementation. Finally, the initial findings of the fitness check confirm that the nature guidelines are effective, efficient and relevant when implemented properly.  I like to use an example. Mr. Commissioner, Mr. Vella, last Friday I visited the port area of Antwerp with you. We have seen in concrete terms how nature and economic development can go hand in hand through a network of core areas, of green corridors, the interests of Europe's second largest port are reconciled with the protection of fragile fauna and flora in and around the port and the Scheldt. The area-oriented and proactive Antwerp approach confirms that a revision of the nature directives is absolutely not on the agenda, but that we must make a full commitment to facilitating the process of implementation. The Commission must play a crucial role in this, in particular by proposing improved guidelines that enshrined best practice and by ensuring that these guidelines are fully recognised and fully supported. And I call on the Commission to listen to all these signals and, above all, to stop the uncertainty about the fitness check. We cannot afford to waste any more time if we are not to miss the 2020 agreement, we must do everything we can to fully implement the nature directives.  I also expect the Commission's efforts for additional actions, for additional innovative solutions to halt biodiversity loss in Europe, such as the concrete development of a trans-European network of green infrastructure, such as initiatives to prevent biodiversity loss outside the protected areas and through actions to protect pollinators.  Ladies and gentlemen, loss of biodiversity means loss for nature, for man, for the economy. In the interests of the health, well-being and prosperity of future generations, I count on your support to safeguard nature. All that remains is my colleagues, my colleagues. to expressly thank shadow rapporteurs for the very constructive cooperation. It was a privilege and an honor to work with you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 219, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first and foremost, I would like to thank my colleague, the rapporteur, Mark Demesmaeker, for his report on the biodiversity mid-term review. It is an honour for me to contribute to this discussion on the EU’s progress towards achieving its 2020 biodiversity targets. The European Parliament’s report, which is being put forward for adoption tomorrow, delivers a strong message about the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services for human welfare and socio-economic development, but it also delivers a message of concern about protecting this essential natural capital. I believe that this report can help steer and accelerate progress towards the difficult task of achieving our 2020 biodiversity targets. The Commission’s biodiversity mid—term review revealed that, while we are mid-term – and here I agree completely with Mr Demesmaeker – we are not mid-way to achieving our targets. We are continuing to lose biodiversity, and this has very serious implications for our ability to ensure food security, for our quality of life and sustainable socio-economic development, and for mitigating and adapting to climate change and delivering on our international commitments, including the recently-adopted Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. Without any doubt, the Commission will carefully consider Parliament’s recommendation for action at EU level. I agree that, in addition to completing the EU policy framework, there needs to be much strengthened implementation on the ground. We need to mobilise the efforts of actors at all levels and across many sectors in order to deliver on our biodiversity commitments. We need, in particular, to fully implement the EU nature legislation, focusing our efforts on completing the Natura 2000 network, especially for the marine environment, and on ensuring effective management and financing of Natura 2000 sites. The ongoing fitness check of the EU nature legislation provoked the highest ever number of responses – over half a million – to a Commission public consultation, demonstrating the level of importance of nature and biodiversity to European citizens. It has also generated a huge amount of evidence. Here I would like to stress that the fitness check is an opportunity to consider how we can better ensure that the nature directives, which are key instruments in achieving our biodiversity goals, are both effective and efficient. There are issues about implementation, resources, sharing of knowledge and experience, and also the issue about the engagement of all stakeholders. All these issues deserve our full attention. I would like to inform this Parliament that the Commission is on track to deliver its conclusions on the fitness check exercise in the spring and to propose follow—up action later this year. Yes, the nature directives play a central and critical role in halting biodiversity loss in Europe, but they are not enough on their own. We need to do more to effectively protect and restore biodiversity and ecosystem services both within and beyond the Natura 2000 network. Focusing on the positive economic gains through recognising and accounting for biodiversity will also be key. We must deliver on the broader goals of the EU biodiversity strategy, and this will ultimately depend on society’s commitment to sustainable production and consumption. It is very clear that we need to raise awareness about the value of nature and biodiversity, not only because nature and biodiversity are valuable in themselves and important for citizens, but also because they underpin our well-being and socio-economic development. This must be better understood and integrated into planning and decision—making. Our mid—term review particularly highlighted the importance of agriculture and forestry, which together cover no less than 80% of the EU landmass. It also highlighted the importance of marine fisheries development and trade policies. These sectors must therefore be at the heart of any solution to halting biodiversity loss. There are many excellent examples of local improvements as a direct result of good practices, and these carry an important message about the achievability of the 2020 biodiversity targets. I would like to note that the adoption of the EU Regulation on Invasive Alien Species was a very significant achievement, and its implementation will enable the launch of targeted measures on the ground. This will go a long way towards tackling one of the main causes of biodiversity loss in the European Union. As you all know, the Commission wasted no time in developing a first list of species of Union concern and is already carrying out preparatory work with a view to updating this later this year. Finally, at global level, we need to deliver on our international financial commitments whilst addressing the underlying causes of global biodiversity loss, including the impacts of EU consumption, production and trade. I hope that we can do all of this together so that by 2020 we will have a positive result, which will be a significant stepping stone towards our 2030 sustainable development goals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 220, "date": "2016-02-01.json", "name": "Jordi Sebastià", "mepid": "125053", "text": "  draftser of the Opinion of the Committee on Development. – Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the author for his work.

We must never finance economic strategies that harm ecological diversity.

Given this worrying trend, we cannot afford to waste time by opening up our legislation, which is recognised globally to be the gold standard in environmental protection, as it protects our biodiversity – namely, the Birds and Habitats Directive. Thanks to the Natura 2000 sites across the EU, thousands of species enjoy protection. These sites generate environmental and socio-economic benefits worth around EUR 300 billion annually. Revising the directives now would lead to years of legal uncertainty and would further divert us from reaching our biodiversity targets.

It is necessary to ensure that those localized and dangerous invasive species, in accordance with EFSA reports, are eradicated before they expand around the Union, through the development of comprehensive implementation measures supported by appropriate means, as envisaged in the report itself.  The challenges posed to us by invasive species will be increasing and we must be prepared to be able to alleviate and contain the negative effects that may also have on European economies.

That is why I believe that the greatest danger to our biodiversity is not agriculture and horticulture. The greatest danger is misunderstanding and lack of knowledge. There is not one solution to preserving biodiversity, but by farming modernly we are reducing the pressure on our natural resources and needing less land per kilogram of food.

However – and I believe that we all agree on this too – there is still a great deal of effective work to be done throughout Europe, particularly in terms of implementation, in order to achieve these objectives in the final analysis. I therefore particularly welcome the better implementation of the existing directive. A revision – and here too I am very glad that the majority of the House sees it that way – should by no means be debated, because it simply does not help in the long term. A fundamental problem – and I believe we need to focus much more on this – is that farmers are far too under-involved when it comes, for example, to the designation of Natura 2000 sites. Years of monocultures are less likely to be placed under conservation at some point, but those farmers who really work and operate very responsibly and do so in and with nature very often suddenly get a notice that more or less forces them to stop using and implementing the existing incomes they have.

No matter how many beavers, how many wolves and how many bears roam our waters and forests, they are definitely worth protecting, regardless of whether they really contribute to biodiversity. I come from an area in the Alps where, in recent years, wolves and bears have in fact made life difficult for farmers and increasingly made them impossible. It is becoming increasingly impossible to keep animals in the pasture. Unfortunately, we are now also experiencing very serious incidents with people, and this is far from pleasant, especially in the tourist areas. We have little insight into this, we stubbornly stick to the programmes and believe that large predators can be re-established everywhere. I think we simply need a political debate on this issue.

I believe that, once adopted, this timely solution – together with the Council conclusions delivered last December – can very much help steer the EU towards achieving its biodiversity targets. The Commission’s mid-term review, the Council conclusions and Parliament’s report all send a consistent message about the critical importance of the effective integration of biodiversity objectives with, and into, all the other sectors. The European Parliament has a very important and crucial role to play in reaching EU biodiversity targets, both in raising awareness of the value of biodiversity by actually integrating biodiversity objectives into other EU policies and by actually transforming the calls for this resolution into concrete decisions on EU policies and funding. I could not agree more with the comments that we need a broader and full support of all stakeholders. This is very important. Any legislation without enough support is probably the hardest to implement. I also agree with a number of Members who expressed their opinion that the Member States have an important and most responsible role to implement. Member States, as was said by Catherine Bearder, have to step up their implementation. Ms Boylan asked me whether I can declare my position. I have to say that any position on this will not be the prerogative of only me, Commissioner Vella, but will be a collegial decision of the Commission based on the evidence gathered in the fitness check exercise. My objective is not to undermine existing legislation but to make sure we have all the necessary tools in place to achieve the 2020 target. I took note of what Ms Auken said. We have worked together in the past and I truly know how genuine she is. I can assure her that all members of the college, including First Vice-President Timmermans, are as much in favour of nature and biodiversity as are all of us. To the many comments from the honourable Members who pointed out that we have to involve farmers if biodiversity targets are to be achieved: yes, I agree. We have been talking about implementation, but let us not forget that the state of the environment report, the state of the nature report, and the mid-term review itself, identify and point to a number of causes, not simply implementation. One of the causes which all the reports have identified is not agriculture but some of the bad practices in agriculture. In the implementation of the current CAP, the emphasis in the next years should be on ensuring that the potential of biodiversity support measures is used fully at the national and local levels. Given their role in managing landscapes, farmland and nature, farmers should be supported and rewarded for protecting and restoring biodiversity, and for the services they deliver to the public. Achieving the EU biodiversity targets is, after all, as important for society at large as it is for the farming sector itself. I think, as Ms Köstinger said, farmers have to be part of the solution. I would like to finish on a positive note. The conclusions of the biodiversity mid-term strategy give grounds for both concern and optimism. While it is critical to reflect and act on the causes of insufficient progress, we should keep sight of what has been achieved. We have put in place important policy frameworks to build on. We have accumulated a true wealth of positive experiences to learn from and an increasing pool of knowledge to underpin decision-making. We have a growing network of stakeholders and citizens who are very committed to protecting and enhancing biodiversity. We need to capitalise on this to put the EU back on track to reaching our biodiversity targets. My last thought is that the directives that we have been discussing are not an end in themselves. They are a means to an end, the end being achieving our 2020 targets. Whether we review our directives or not, I believe that we have to work harder.

In addition to that, we now get extremely bad news, according to which the Commission labels the ECI as a threat.
