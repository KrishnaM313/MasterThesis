It will be the first meeting to be chaired by President Charles Michel and, pending your approval of the new Commission tomorrow, it will also be the first one for Ms Ursula von der Leyen in her capacity as President of the Commission, and for the new High Representative, Mr Josep Borrell. The agenda will be dominated by two pressing issues – climate change and the multiannual financial framework.  Let me start with climate change. You will all recall that in June the European Council came close to an agreement on climate neutrality by 2050. However, a few Member States felt they needed more time to assess the efforts and costs linked to the transition to climate neutrality before committing to such ambitious targets.  The European Council therefore asked the Council and the Commission to advance work on the conditions, incentives and the enabling framework, and pledged to finalise its guidance before the end of the year with a view to the adoption and submission of the EU’s long-term strategy to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in early 2020. In December, the European Council will aim to commit the EU to reaching climate neutrality by 2050 and identify the enabling framework that will allow us to reach that objective.  The Presidency has worked intensively with other Member States and the Commission in order to facilitate this decision. The discussion in this plenary yesterday again highlighted the need for the EU to act decisively in order to remain a world leader in climate issues.  This brings me to the second topic on the European Council agenda: the multiannual financial framework (MFF). The Finnish Presidency will submit a finalised negotiation box with figures prepared on the basis of the exchange of views that took place in Council preparatory bodies, as well as bilateral discussions with all delegations. We intend to submit the negotiation box in the coming few days.  We are nearing the end stage of negotiations. I believe it’s in all our interest to reach an agreement on the next MFF soon in order to make sure our citizens, regions, farmers, universities and other beneficiaries can continue their work uninterrupted. The Presidency’s job in this respect has not been easy, the individual positions being wide apart. With the Brexit cut. the status quo is not an option. We will have to pay more and, unfortunately, some will have to receive less. The leaders’ discussion therefore should identify the most important issues and prepare the ground for the future compromise.  I am glad to say we have had many fruitful exchanges with Parliament during the course of this process. In this plenary we have discussed the MFF already and I am glad that we could organise an informal breakfast discussion last week in Brussels between the Member States and the negotiations of the European Parliament. The Member States found this exchange useful and timely. Thank you very much for that.  Without going into full details of the Presidency’s proposal, I am pleased to note that the positions of Parliament and the Council converge in several important areas. First of all, the next MFF should be able to deliver on the policies set out in the strategic agenda – ambition on climate policy, commitment to just transition, increasing the investments to research and development and a comprehensive management of migration are just a few key policies the next MFF will be able to address.  As in the Commission proposal, the Presidency is committed to renewing and modernising the EU budget by giving modern programmes the largest share of EU funds. However, we also note the importance of cohesion policy to the unity and success of the Union, as well as the need to devote sufficient funds to our farmers so that they can continue to develop sustainable agriculture. The Presidency will also propose to make a strong link between protecting the EU budget from generalised deficiencies in the area of the rule of law, and furthermore new own resources should be decided in order to diversify the financing of the EU’s budget.  We have no illusions that there will be disappointments in our proposal. That is inevitable in a process seeking to find common ground. Not everybody can just get what they want, but it is our sincere belief that our proposal represents a balanced way forward. The European added value and our political priorities will guide us to deliver results over the next seven years.  The European Council will give further guidance to the Union on the way forward, with the objective of reaching a final agreement. It is furthermore possible that leaders will discuss certain external affairs issues in the light of developments on the international stage. In any event, following the Normandy Format Summit scheduled for 9 December in Paris, the European Council will assess progress in the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and decide whether to renew the economic sanctions against Russia for another six months. As we also mentioned, there will be a Euro Summit in an exclusive format to take stock of progress made in the Eurogroup on the implementation of the June Euro Summit statement.  Finally, Brexit will again be on leaders’ agenda. On Friday, the European Council is expected to have a short meeting in its Article 50 format. Leaders will discuss the next steps in light of recent developments.

Mr President, I have to start by saying that this is the last time I come before you as stand-in for President Jean-Claude Juncker, and I want to use that opportunity to thank him for his leadership over five years. But most of all, from my perspective, to thank him for his friendship, for his wisdom, for his wit, his endless source of anecdotes. Jean-Claude is, what in the Jewish tradition is called, a mensch. And I will miss him, as I think we all will, and we owe him, I think, a big debt of gratitude for what he has done for Europe in the last five years. (Applause) Es ist unsere Chance und Verpflichtung zugleich, die Tagung des Europeischen Rates zu einem europeischen Thursday and Friday for Future zu machen. Wir sind es unseren Kindern schuldig, mit unserem Planeten sorgf-ltig umzugehen. Denn dieser ist die Grundlage fer unser go Zukunft. Europa hat sich deshalb als Beitrag zum 'beeinkommen von Paris dazu verpflichtet, die Treibhausgasemissionen in der EU bis 2030 um mindestens 40% zu reduzieren.  Doch Europa kann, will und muss mehr erreichen. Als European Kommission werden wir uns dafar einsetzen, dass der European Rat ein ehrgeizigeres Ziel beschliet. Europa sollte bis 2050 zu einem klimaneutralen Kontinent werden. Denn wir haben nicht nur Verantwortung fer die nechste Generation, sondern wir messen auch eine Vorreiterrolle in der Welt einnehmen. Unsere europeische Strategie muss ein Signal an die Klimakonferenz der Vereinten Nationen senden und andere Vertragsparteien ebenfalls zu ehrgeizigeren Zielen anspornen. Fer Europa er-ffnet dieser Ehrgeiz auch eine wirtschaftliche Chance. Schlie-lich bedeutet ein klimaneutrales Europa nicht, dass wir Industrie oder Autos abschaffen, sondern dass unsere Fahrzeuge und unsere Industrie zukunftsfit sein werden. Wenn wir jetzt auf gràne und innovative Technologien setzen, sichert das langfristig nicht nur unseren Planeten, sondern auch unsere Wirtschaft.  Es lohnt sich also fer Europa in jeder Hinsicht, Klima-Weltmeister zu werden. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is it necessary to make it clear that our ambitions, however laudable and necessary, will remain a dead letter if we do not have sufficient financial resources to make them a reality? For example, to achieve the paris agreement alone, the European Union will have to unlock hundreds of billions of euros of additional investment every year until 2030. That is why we are committed to investing at least 25% of our next budget, in the long term, in climate issues, because it is our responsibility to ensure that there is no left behind in the transition to a more modern economy with a cleaner and cleaner European energy system. In Europe, this transition will be made, but for it to succeed, it must benefit all Europeans and promote social justice, economic, social and territorial cohesion and solidarity between member states and between generations. Our compass must be the future of our fellow citizens, our students, our businesses, our researchers, our regions, our cities and our countryside. This future is not waiting, time is running out. Any delay in the negotiations of the next European budget for the period 2021-2027 is increasingly likely to jeopardise the timely implementation of EU policies. The December European Council must therefore be an opportunity to give decisive impetus to these negotiations so that we can reach an agreement by February 2020 at the latest. In May 2018, this Commission chose a reasonable budget that represents 1.11% of the EU's gross national income at 27, foresees moderate cuts in the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy, and reflects the new policies that will determine our future. If we want money for research, the fight against climate change, the future of our young people, digital, better management of migration, there is no room for reductions. Let's be serious! How can it be surprising that, in the next budget of the European Union, national contributions are increasing because, in both cases, this is mainly due to inflation and economic growth? And how can we not accept that it would be much fairer for all to remove the rebates that some countries receive for historical reasons? Finally, let us not lose sight of the fact that the discussion on net balances is a false discussion because, with the European Union budget, everyone benefits, since we are doing together what we can no longer do individually. I would like to finish with a few remarks ahead of the Euro Summit. We can't talk about Europe's future - our efforts to ensure sustainability and the right budget to meet our citizens' needs - without the understanding that strengthening our economic and monetary union is a fundamental component for our success. The good news is that there is a consensus on the main elements needed to continue doing this and even better news because progress on this important work is well within reach. This includes the first-ever budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness in the euro area, the main features of which have now been agreed. Secondly, on the European Stability Mechanism, which by its very existence already increases resilience in the euro area, the legal framework still falls short of the political reality which must also include its role as a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund. And thirdly, on the completion of the banking union. On this last point, I would like to underline that when the banking union was launched, it was always going to be based on three looters: supervision, resolution and the third, missing looter - a European deposit insurance scheme. It has been four years since the Commission made a proposal and two years since we proposed pragmatic solutions to find a compromise between Parliament and the Council. Progress is long overdue. I want to welcome the ongoing work of the High—Level Working Group in this regard and, on behalf of the Commission and my colleagues Dombrovskis and Moscovici, I look forward to seeing an outcome of this work and an agreement on how to put this into practice. We may be subject to political cycles. I said something about this at the beginning. That is the nature of democracy. The same should not apply to our economy. Here we need to ensure stability. Over the last five years we've been deepening the Economic and Monetary Union, precisely because doing so is making our economy stronger and more resilient to stress. In the face of increasing pressure in our external environment, we need this resilience at home. We are before the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced and we need to prepare for it well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the president for his excellent work and for the work he has done I would like to begin by thanking Frans Timmermans for referring to Jean-Claude Juncker.  For us Christian Democrats, too, he is in line with De Gasperi, Schuman, Helmut Kohl and other strong Christian Democrats who have shaped Europe. I think we all wish him a good recovery now after the serious operation he has undergone. Changes are now also in the way of changes in the Council. We are getting a new President-in-Office of the Council, and perhaps in the first preparatory debate on the first Council meeting under Charles Michel we will be able to express a few wishes as to what might happen next. I would like, for example, to see a Council that is reliable for the citizens of Europe. The MFF discussion is at the heart of this. Millions of farmers, students and mayors expect clarity, expect planning certainty. That is why our aim now is to create urgency, not to postpone, postpone, postpone, in the hope that the German Presidency will resolve this. No, progress must be made in December, and the Croatian Presidency must then reach a solution at the beginning of the year: reliability. The second is that we need fairness. For us, this means that the next European Council should now give the green light to Northern Macedonia and Albania. What we experienced last time is a tragedy, a historic mistake. It is unacceptable that, on the one hand, we continue to hold accession talks with Turkey and, on the other, we should say to Northern Macedonia that it must not become a member of the European Union. That's crazy what we're doing. The citizens no longer understand this either. I would like the next European Council to speak plainly. In Malta, for example, a Member State of the European Union, we now have the fact that corruption is in the highest levels of government and is also associated with the death of journalist Daphne Galizia. That is what we are witnessing in Malta at the moment. Yesterday, the Labour Government in Malta prevented there from having a debate in the national parliament on these matters. That is not acceptable. I would like the Council to discuss issues such as those in Malta. I must also say that I was surprised to see president Macron's comments on Viktor Orban, because we have all activated Article 7 together and are concerned about what is happening in Hungary. I read in the newspaper that Macron says about Orban: 'I had a very long discussion on this subject' – so on the future of Europe – 'with Viktor Orban. He's quite close to our views and has a key intellectual and political role within the Visegrad Group, which is important'.  I would like to know from Renew how to deal with it. I would like the next European Council to finally discuss issues relating to Article 7 in Hungary. And that we should put this on the table, how to deal with fundamental rights in Europe in the future.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she I would also like to see another wish for the Council's deliberations, namely the CO2 debate. We in Parliament agree that we want to be ambitious. We are even proud that Europe has been the leading continent in the world – already in recent years. Now we want to be ambitious, but also realistic. The task we have is to achieve the goals, but not to leave people behind. On the one hand, there is respect for Greta Thunberg, who is the ambitious voice of the young generation. But there are also the yellow vest demonstrations, where people are worried that they cannot afford the higher fuel prices. And there is the fear of coal workers and car workers about how their industry will continue, whether their jobs are safe. Bringing this together is the task that Europe must tackle. Finally, I would like to see an ambitious proposal from the next European Council on the issue of foreign and security policy. That will dominate the next five years, so away with unanimity in the Council of Foreign Ministers, and an ambitious proposal on a defence union is needed.  I know that this is a wish list. I know that much of that will not happen.

It is also the first moment to move forward decisively with the commitments made at the last European elections. Hopefully, the new leadership of the Commission will have been able to start work by then and this summit – the European Council – will be a genuine new start to the work of the whole of the next five years. Climate change is an issue where Europe has already been a pioneer so far. But it is equally clear that it was the big demand of the European elections for all of us that we are capable of implementing a real programme for the transition to a carbon-neutral Europe. This is unquestionably the most important issue of the forthcoming European Council. We must listen to the citizens, and this change must be implemented in a fair way. It is therefore important that social justice is an important factor in responding to climate change when the Council discusses the necessary measures. There really is no more time to waste with regard to the financial framework. We must prevent a situation in which decisions are taken so late that many programmes do not have time to start. It is therefore time for the financial framework to make the necessary compromises. But here, too, it is important that we respond to new challenges. Action against climate change needs funding. Research, product development, building a new Europe requires funding.  European border guarding, which is an important part of our common security, also requires more resources. The same applies to the development of joint European defence cooperation. In all of these, we expect the right solutions to be found in the financial framework.

Mr President, Madam Minister, we are preparing for a new presidency of the Council. The Council's multi-year budget outlook is once again on the Council's agenda, alongside our climate ambitions. Europe is not just a question of budget, but the budget is the translation of our political ambition. The Council will have two fundamentally linked issues on its agenda: the budget outlook and the climate. Climate change is one of the best examples. If we want a Europe that is both carbon neutral and with a dynamic economy that creates jobs, we must ensure and support this transition. This is the meaning of the Green Pact: to combine the environment and the economy. However, this cannot only be done with political words and statements. I regret that the discussions have so far focused on the spending limits that Member States would like to allocate to European projects, negotiating up to the second decimal point of the comma. Are we capping the part of ourselves that bears our European identity? Is it an end in itself to limit Europe to an insurmountable course? I do not believe that, and my group, which aspires to a European renewal, cannot subscribe to this vision. Let us talk about what Europe can and must do, and collectively put the means on the table so that Europe is not synonymous with additional spending but with more efficient use of public funds, because Europe can be more efficient than our Member States taken separately. Tomorrow we will elect a new Commission with an ambitious programme of work, so we must be consistent. Let us not be afraid of European spending, as it is usually accompanied by lower national expenditure. Of course, the European Union is not free, it is also accompanied by values, which must be shared. For my group, two subjects are fundamental: the reform of own resources and the conditionality of European funds, to ensure that these values are truly respected. This is the only way to give consistency to the European project. Before we ask others to do so, we must ensure that in our political families these values are respected and that all members of our political families respect them as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, the Heads of State and Government are going to meet in Brussels right after the Madrid climate summit. I hope they take some of the Madrid spirit along with them, because I’m sure they will have heard a lot of urgency from other governments of small island states, of coastal states and of countries and continents that are not as wealthy and prosperous as the European Union overall. So, I hope they take along that urgency and then put it and convert it into some real action, because after Madrid the real action has to start. As it stands right now, not a single one of the European Union Member States has submitted a national greenhouse gas reduction plan that would be adequate or in any way sufficient in order to reach the Paris Agreement targets. But the EU targets are also far from sufficient. In fact, they were agreed in 2014, so before the Paris summit. Clearly, we need to step up the game because, right now, Europe does not lead the game. We are looking elsewhere; we are telling other countries that they should do something. But that doesn’t work. We need to act ourselves; we cannot wait for others to act. A stable climate is not just a nice thing to have, it’s absolutely vital in order to have a liveable planet for the younger generation and also for future generations. It’s vital for security and for peace worldwide. And also, if we’re lagging behind, as we’re doing right now, we’re also losing out on technologies, on climate jobs that, right now, our competitors elsewhere in the world are developing. It is time to act and the Member States need to finally agree on the climate neutrality target of 2050. But, let’s be clear, and let’s keep in mind that that is not a very ambitious target. We should actually do much more to follow the Finnish example and be more ambitious, because 2050 is really late. But having targets for some time in the future is anyway not enough; we need to have concrete measures right now. We need to make sure right now that we will, at some point, achieve and reach targets. And what better way to use as a concrete measure our long—term budget? This is where we decide where we put our money, and we should put our money where our mouth is. That means that we should have a Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) that invests in renewable energies and in ecological agriculture and not, as it is foreseen at present, in agricultural mass production and in fossil fuels. We need to change our priorities. If we don’t change where the money goes, then nothing will change in terms of the actual policies. The EU has to play its fair part in a fair transition and that also needs resources for the European Union. Otherwise we have a lot of demands but not the resources to implement them. And that’s why we, the Greens, fully subscribe to the Parliament’s position of having at least 1.3% of the GNI as the overall amount. But on the income side we also need to be sustainable. A plastics tax or a carbon border adjustment tax is not just a revenue; it can really be a means of how to shape policies and make sure that we have policies that protect the environment and support a fair transition. And of all of these elements, the European Council can, but also really should, deliver. Because in order to stay credible, the EU has to lead with ambitious targets and we have to deliver them at home. If not now, when? So, I wish the best of luck to the Finnish Presidency and really hope that all the groups here can contribute by urging governments to actually play their role and say yes to climate neutrality, yes to an ambitious MFF and not just continue with business as usual.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Jörg Meuthen", "mepid": "190518", "text": "  On behalf of the ID Group, I would like to make a i-see of the Mr President, I would like to thank the We are talking about the next European Council in December. You have proposed 27 Commissioners for the Commission, one Commissioner per Member State, as you usually do. But if nothing deceives me, the EU still has 28 Member States, not 27. This is one too little, mathematics like from the Takka-Tukka country. The new Commission will not be operational until the UK nominates a Commissioner. Because the UK is a member of the EU – one of 28 – and every member is entitled to a Commissioner. That is the legal situation. Once again, you are breaking your own rules. And don't come to me with the need to create work ability. The old Commission is capable of working! It is only a matter of the new one having to wait a little longer before she takes office. They trample the law underfoot, whether on the whole – as in the case of the rescue of the euro at the time by breaking the non-assistance clause – or, as is the case here, on a small scale, when the new Commission started working. A Union in which practical arbitrariness replaces the jointly negotiated law is built on sand. Another: the cost to the EU is skyrocketing. The European Council has just approved, as far as possible, the European Parliament's budget proposal for 2020. They are inflating the already far too lavish EU budget. The EU budget is to be increased by a further EUR 850 million for the coming year. Any thriftiness is completely alien to you. Why? The citizens pay for it and do not even notice it. The EU is being fattened further, while the German taxpayer is being put on a diet, and not just the one. It is significant that German Members of the so-called Liberals and Christian Democrats also welcome this. Both parties are basically selling everything they once stood for. I can only hope that, at a lucid moment, the Council will remember something better and that it will not support the agreement on the budget. Unfortunately, however, there is probably the same inspirit of meaningless waste. They want to provide an additional EUR 500 million to climate policy projects. This is a classic subsidy policy, pure satisfaction with ideology, complete misallocation. Have you forgotten your milk lakes and butter mountains from that time? This economic governance from above did not work at that time, and it will not work in the future. The still gigantic proportion of the agricultural budget should be a reminder enough to you. I would be angry when I look at the ECB and the EIB, in addition to direct subsidies from the budget. The EIB is now to become a climate bank. It will create a series of investment ruins, because it will override the price mechanism with its promotional loans. The ECB should direct its monetary policy in favour of the climate, when it is not even in a position to normalise interest rates. Industrial and environmental policy is not the task of the European Central Bank, I ask you! Mrs Lagarde is already calling for an expansionary fiscal policy. Its mandate relates to the ECB's monetary policy. The German nomination of Ms Schnabel for the ECB puts the crown on the whole. I really do not understand how Germany could nominate someone who undermined the position of the Bundesbank even before its appointment. We will keep this to the federal government for years to come. Unfortunately, this will not benefit the German saver.

I would like to insert a political reflection, which we pretend to keep out of this House, but which accompanies all these summits: the Council is firm because there is an underground, which is beginning to emerge, clash between France and Germany over an overall future vision of the European institutions, talking about NATO, talking about defence, talking about economic issues. This is a major issue which has so far also paralysed the Work of the Council. I therefore think that all the issues that we are going to discuss and on which we are making fine proclamations today, in the hope that the Council, with the new Presidency, will be able to address these issues, we know that, starting with the MFF, that is, starting with the fundamental budgetary instrument, there are a number of glaring contradictions. Climate change is a top priority, it is certainly an important priority and we would miss something else, it is a fundamental issue. It should be remembered, however, that European emissions account for 9 % of global emissions and that this issue is therefore an important battle on a global scale, otherwise it could be very limited in the very small context of our continent. Above all, it is also very important to link it to the other financial issues, which we are pretending not to mention.  With regard to the request for additional resources, I would like to include the reflection on the European Stability Mechanism, on which a strange system of automatism is being created between the request for aid for debt restructuring, which leads to the countries that, in a substantial and main way, contribute to the creation of this fund, perhaps preventing them from using it. These too are requests for resources from the individual States which must be considered in the overall batch. When we talk about a number of considerations on the subject of the MFF and say: let us not reduce cohesion policies, let us not reduce resources to agriculture, imagine that climate change policies will be disproportionately increased for a major environmental programme. principle with respect to concrete facts. I will end with an example, which will not be touched on this occasion by the European Council, recalling the many proclamations made on immigration and recalling that, while it is no longer mentioned, hundreds of people die in November – an absolutely unexpected period – who leave North Africa illegally, and all this happens with indications from the various intelligence agencies of the countries , which signal the inclusion and risk of infiltration of jihadism. All these considerations are considerations for which this Parliament often, but above all the Council and the Commission, find themselves dealing with them when the problem arises, not when there are such serious signals that are indicated.

Mr President, this Friday, shortly before the next European Council, young people will take to the streets and take out their signs that will say 'let's change the system, not the climate'. This Friday, I will be with them in the street and we will shout together our thirst for life and the need to radically change our modes of production and consumption to save the planet. Finally, this Friday, they will put us, Parliament, you Council, you European Commission, before your political responsibilities. While the next European Council must define the long-term strategy that Europe will present to the world at COP 25, the voice of these young people must be heard in the hubbub of table-corner goods. The carbon neutrality target that Europe has set itself will not solve everything because it is based on several haphazard biases. First of all, we do not control the absorption capacity of natural carbon sinks, the terrible tragedies of the Amazon rainforest have reminded us. Second, we cannot base our future on CO2 capture technologies, which we have no assurance that they can be deployed on a large scale. Finally, it would be hypocritical to relocate our greenhouse gas emissions out of Europe, which, of course, would not change the global equation of climate change. This is the case of France, which doubles its carbon footprint. Let's face the harsh reality. According to the European Environment Agency, the measures currently in place in the Member States only guarantee a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions against a 55% target set by our Parliament. This objective is indeed ambitious, but the solutions are within reach provided that the current policy directions are thoroughly reviewed. The announcement of an energy retrofit plan for buildings is a good thing, as is the decision of the European Investment Bank to stop financing fossils, contrary to what the far right thinks, in this case, that it is never on the side of the peoples and the planet. Now we must go faster and further, reorient the common agricultural policy, hold multinationals responsible for deforesting and polluting with impunity, and reject free trade agreements. The European Parliament must play its part in these strategic decisions and in the development of a credible financing plan for the ecological transition; this is one of the key issues of the multi-year financial framework on the Council's agenda, namely that we must give ourselves the means to fight climate change but also against inequalities. For this, we must not undress Peter to dress Paul, cutting in the budgets of cohesion and agriculture, as you have confirmed, Mr Timmermans. Political priorities must be set: climate and solidarity rather than the dangerous and overpriced adventure of Europe's defence. The solution is simple: to get the money where it is, by creating new taxes on the ecological and social balance sheet of imported products, on financial transactions, but also on large multinational companies that do not pay their fair share of taxes. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, some timid progress has been made in the 2020 climate budget, as Parliament has refused to go directly to the Council. It is up to us to be truly ambitious in the ongoing negotiations so that the next multi-year financial framework will finally meet the environmental and social challenges of the century.

We here in Strasbourg and Brussels will be very cooperative, but also very watchful as to checking whether the promises are being kept.  There is a widespread feeling, and I share it, that we need to significantly change our institutional gears and redirect our efforts more decisively towards meeting the expectations of citizens. We must spare no efforts to strengthen the pro-European sentiment among our main constituents, the people of Europe. And among the people I mean also migrants: I mean the British expats after Brexit, those who look for asylum to gain security for the lives, refugees from war-torn areas, and climate refugees soon to come.  The dialogue on Europe and its future with citizens and other relevant stakeholders in European future should be permanent by principle. These are the times when we can again have hope for creating a European demos. And I know that we have somehow forgotten this ambition but we must not divest ourselves of the ideal of making the Union something more than just a convenient meeting place for mutual recognition of Member States’ interests.  We see that this elusive European demos is arising spontaneously, especially among the young people in response to the climate crisis. Our role should be to facilitate the creation of a welcoming and generous space where this nascent demos will not only emerge, but will thrive and not only in response to climate emergency, but in tackling jointly other issues.  There is no better environment than the European Union to construct a sustainable and flexible space to leave to the next generation a better Europe.

Sadly, as a British MEP, I can’t escape the Brexit nightmare and it rumbles on through our election campaign. This means yet more lies and deceptive soundbites, of which the latest is ‘Get Brexit done’. With three and more years of uncertainty and understandable feelings of Brexit fatigue, it is natural that British voters will be tempted by such an offer. But the reality of Johnson’s deal is that it would lead to years of difficult negotiations and the risk of a cliff—edge Brexit at the end of 2020. It must be rejected. As Greens, we know that the climate emergency is a far greater crisis facing us, which is why we are determined that this should be a climate election. Yesterday, the World Meteorological Organization revealed that global greenhouse gas emissions reached a new high last year. Setting a net—zero carbon target of 2050 is totally inadequate and flies in the face of both the science and what our children are demanding of us. Aiming for 2050 means risking runaway climate change, a risk to citizens’ lives that we must not take. This is an emergency. We must act as if we mean that. Leaving it too late to achieve carbon neutrality could literally mean the difference between life and death for millions of people. It could spell the end of human civilization. Safeguarding our planet for future generations calls for urgent action.

If you want to debate the forthcoming Council meeting today and always focus on the climate here, I would say – especially in view of the major problems that exist here in Europe – that this could be something of a mishandling of the issue. With all due respect and appreciation for the need to focus on nature conservation and environmental protection, I see the major political weather situation, particularly in the banking and monetary sectors, as very serious problems that we should focus on. We have a zero interest rate policy in the euro area, which is now moving into a negative interest rate policy. We have a situation where the banking sector could be cleaned up again in the coming year. This means that we have a situation where prosperity on our continent could continue to fall and that we should finally take effective measures in this sector. We discussed some time ago that in the euro area we finally needed something like a Glass-Steagall Act at European level, a separation into commercial and investment banks, in order to ensure the banking sector and our financial cycle and our monetary system accordingly. Unfortunately, nothing happens. Something is happening again on the subject of climate: we are discussing whether new CO2 taxes are coming, whether new restrictions should come, and so on and so forth. In my view, however, there is also a wrong setting of the issues here. What you are currently doing is beating the European car industry, which is also a heart of economic efficiency on our continent – whether that is Germany, whether it is France: these are engines. And if you damage the automotive industry, you are damaging the subcontracting sector. Damage the subcontracting sector, damage families and their incomes. I think that is wrong. Where something could be done by the European Union is obvious, in my view: we have debated that the transport of goods across the continent – if you bring agricultural products from Eastern Europe to Western Europe, then process them, resell them in another country, have animal transport – generates an extreme burden on that continent. These are all things where you could immediately and effectively do something for the environment. Here you are in arrears to generate the corresponding.

A Green Deal for Europe can only succeed if we invest the resources where they are needed.

The outcome of these competitions concerns critical areas of profitability for large groups, such as so-called green investments, digital, energy, which are an apple of contention, and it is precisely at this time that the conditions are laid down for who will ultimately prevail and who will be left behind. Amid these fierce competition, EU money from the new multiannual framework is directed to large monopolistic groups. The ongoing disputes have nothing to do with the interests or the improvement of the position of the workers of the Member States. Your goal is to create a safe environment for monopolies, to get rich with exploitation intensity, entrenched wages and pensions, dismantling the social security system, abolishing labour rights, drastically restricting trade union rights and intensity of repression. This is what the Government of New Democracy in Greece is doing by continuing syriza's unpopular policy, in the context of enhanced supervision of European semesters, bloody primary surpluses, foreclosures and first home auctions. The Council's guidelines have nothing to do with the protection of the environment and the protection of popular interests. The whole debate on climate change is pre-formal, since the destruction of the environment is a consequence of the capitalist economy, which is the criterion of profit-hunting, as a consequence of the imperialist wars. The increasing militarisation, the debate on the future of NATO, the attitude of France and Germany, on the ground of the withdrawal of the largest military force in the European Union, Britain, underlines, moreover, that the contrasts at the bazaar tables are combined with attacks on the people.

The Common Position of the European Parliament across factions is that a proposal for a fair seven-year framework budget should be drawn up by the European Council. Dear Colleagues, allow me to take advantage of today's exchange of views to offer council representatives five clear and unambiguous aspects regarding the forthcoming MFF, i.e. the seven-year framework budget. Firstly, the system of refunds and rebate should be abolished. This system maintains a completely utterly utterly omnised and unfair situation as to the contribution of each Member State to the Union budget in relation to the national total. Secondly, the Council's proposal should take account of the fact that a significant part of the funds received by the Central and Eastern European Member States as cohesion funds will be returned to the Member States that are old from the point of view of 2004 in the framework of economic cooperation. In fact, the cohesion development resources allocated to central and eastern European Member States also contribute to the economic development of the EU-15. Thirdly, it is unfair and unacceptable to reduce cohesion resources, especially given that countries with poorer, more modest economic performance than the average economic development of the European Union should suffer from greater reductions in cohesion resources, whereas in countries that have already attre the average economic development of the European Union or are in a better position, this reduction is much smaller or not. Fourthly, we need a flexible budget. According to the budget proposal of the outgoing Commission and the resources available to us so far, the thinking of the Finnish Presidency continues to show the image of an inflexible budget. Last but not least, on the issue of climate change, I am deeply convinced that, at the moment, it is not a future threat, but a present sad state that our ambitions are empty at the moment. It's not just for young people, it's for the working age and the elderly. It is absurd that it occurred to the Council less than a month ago to ask the Commission to draw up a concrete plan and the common EU funds allocated to the specific plan, what support is needed to achieve the 2050 climate targets. So such a draft budget without concrete measures would be unfair.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Brando Benifei (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124867", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the agenda of the forthcoming European Council calls for concrete progress to be made on two key points: the multiannual financial framework and the fight against climate change, which are clearly linked issues. It is necessary for the Union to have an ambitious road map to deal with the climate emergency, as we have heard from our Commissioner, Mr Timmermans, but to achieve it it will be necessary to allocate adequate resources, without delay, so that climate neutrality can be achieved quickly with investments that allow a fair transition, to create new jobs, to secure our countries hydrogeologically. The green new deal, which the new Commission is committed to presenting, must be able to do exactly that but, as I said, we need resources. That is why Parliament must be clear, it must be inflexible in negotiating an ambitious budget with the Member States that will be able to respond to these needs. I would also like to point out that we are already experiencing a situation of great uncertainty with regard to extreme weather phenomena, which are becoming more and more frequent, with often disastrous consequences. The situation is often dramatic and I appeal to the Heads of State or Government, who are meeting shortly, to draw up an extraordinary strategic plan at European level as a matter of urgency to deal with this crisis. Think about what happened in Venice, it will still be discussed here in Parliament. Look again today at my region, Liguria, and genoa, which is already on its knees and repeatedly overwhelmed by mud, which is increasingly isolated.

I have to tell you: in recent years, President Juncker has indeed shown that Europe can be great if it wants to. We've successfully fought donald trump's stupid trade war. That's what we want, and we actually want more of that. We want Europe to show that it can be great on the world stage: a European story, a European strategy that goes against Xi Jinping and against Donald Trump, men who actually – must we honestly – know only one language, that of brute power.  But in order to achieve this ambition, Europe must also be given the necessary resources. Cooking costs money. Put your money where your mouth is. That is why I am really asking here to provide sufficient resources for security, for defence, for migration, for the protection of external borders, for the faster creation of Frontex. I think that is what the citizens are asking for. And of course climate. The citizens rightly expect us as Europe to take the lead in this, to be ambitious in this, to achieve results.

However, there are two sectors in which I do not see any coherence, two main sectors and a major contributor to CO2 emissions: agricultural policy and trade policy. Unfortunately, nothing in the mission letters of the future Commissioners fundamentally changes the course of these policies. The European Commission continues to urge this House to adopt the free trade agreements that sit on the Paris Agreements. I take the example of yesterday's vote in the Committee on International Trade of an agreement with the United States, where Mr Trump has just declared that he is abandoning the Paris Agreement and the objectives we set for ourselves here in the European Union.

We are particularly concerned about the dogmatic view with which the subject of climate is treated. We see, with total misunderstanding, the pursuit of two irreconcilable objectives: on the one hand, climate neutrality projected for 2050, and on the other, a race for globalization with the proliferation of mega-free trade agreements (CETA, Mercosur, agreements with Japan, Vietnam and, tomorrow, New Zealand and Australia).  Until the cost of carbon emitted to transport imported products from the other side of the world is included in the price, efforts for climate neutrality on our continent will be futile and an additional illusion. Two telling examples: in the flower market in Nice, a rose imported from Kenya costs less than a rose produced a few kilometers away in Italy. I am not even talking about the social and environmental conditions in which roses are produced in Kenya: labour exploitation, misuse of pesticides, drying up of soils. The carbon cost of importing this rose is nowhere to be said. It is a pollution permit given by Europe. To claim climate neutrality by turning a blind eye to such consequences is to commit a lie in the service of globalist ideology. The case of the automobile is the same. By ideology, European manufacturers are forced to abandon diesel and switch to all-electric, without the consequences of switching to uncontrolled technology in Europe. Indeed, rare earths all over the world are plundered by China to produce batteries that we will use; the recycling channels of these batteries are not organised, which leads to over-pollution; components are imported massively using giant container ships, the source of the largest carbon pollution, which remains unregulated. You antagonize generations by having a catastrophic discourse that pits young people against the old, but you do not address the real causes of increased carbon production, namely globalization. In order to respond, the Council will have to make efforts on short distribution channels, promote localism, produce as closely as possible what we consume and not encourage a leak forward, with unbridled free trade, a source of increasing pollution. As for the multi-year financial framework, this technocratic title hides a very raw reality: more for migrants, less for farmers. The budget proposals are marked by a significant disengagement of CAP appropriations, due to the disappearance of coupled aid and the preference given to greening payments. There is nothing concrete in this greening, only words and communication to flatter an ideological environmentalism neither concrete nor reasonable, nor responsible. At the same time, this programme is pushing for an increase in aid to migrants, with the underlying objective of a future communitisation of the right of asylum, by ideology again.

It is the task of all of us to deliver the best policies for the people of the European Union. We may deliver on the details, but we should be united on the task to deliver policy for the people of the European Union, and as of 1 December, with the new European Commission, with the new leadership in the Council and in the other institutions of the European Union, we truly have no more excuses not to speed up our delivering of policy.  One of the best tools which we have at our disposal to deliver for the people of Europe is the budget of the European Union, and my approach here is the following. Firstly, we should ask ourselves what we expect from the European Union in the next decade, in the next 10 years.  We have seen the people of Europe come out and vote in large numbers. Farmers expect support from the European Union. Local communities expect investments in the form of cohesion policy. Students want more mobility programmes, as does youth in general. Researchers, people who work in digitalisation and innovation expect the European Union to stand by their side. Citizens in all corners of Europe want us to do more on security, defence, protecting the external borders of the European Union and people, particularly our youth, who speak united with one voice on combating climate change. If we agree that the European Union should deliver more in the next decade, then this needs to be reflected in the budget of the European Union. We have to be honest with the citizens of Europe. We cannot do more with much less money. This is why our message to the Council is clear: please put your money where your statements are. If we agree to do more, then this needs to be reflected in the budget and I appeal to Minister Tuppurainen to use the December European Council for a high-level political discussion; not details of the negotiating box, but make the leaders, the heads of state or government, agree on the political priorities. Then it’s easier to agree on the numbers.  If we start discussions by discussing numbers, then the discussions will be divisive and it will just be in the market place. What needs to unite us in the beginning is a vision for Europe for the next 10 years and the budget at the service of this vision.  What should our priorities be? A balance between old and new priorities. Just because agriculture and cohesion are old priorities doesn’t mean that they are outdated. They have been our priorities for decades because they are important, but clearly we have to do more in research, innovation, climate, digitalisation and security. Coming to the end of my intervention, we have to deliver now. We have seen several delays in this MFF and we have to be honest – we, the European institutions, were one of the causes of these delays. We adopted the budget late in 2013 for this MFF. We should learn from the mistakes of the past. The sooner we adopt the budget, the better, but in any case no later than spring 2020.

In this sense, we as a Parliament, strengthened by the last election, also have the ambition to play a leading role here, because we, as directly elected representatives, also play a special role here. In this sense, we have seen that there is a german-French non-paper to set a few key points for this conference in the Council. It asks the right questions, it also makes it clear that it really focuses on Europe's ability to act.  What we as a Parliament are particularly pleased about – and also of us as the S&amp;D Group – is that there should be no taboos, that treaty changes should not be further taboo. Here, however, it is important to listen first to the citizens, to go into this debate with them with specific issues and then to really incorporate what is burning on the citizens' nails into the work of this conference on the future of Europe. So it's not just about listening, it's really about dialogue and participation. We in Parliament want to help achieve this and we are counting on you to send out the right signals in the European Council in December.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Charles Goerens (Renew).", "mepid": "840", "text": "   Madam President, the European Parliament would like 1.3% of the gross national product of Member States to be spent on the European budget.

We would like to win the race against the big giants that are China, economically, the United States and others, but gracefully, at zero tariff. We would like to be the champions of research, but of grace, without a penny more in our budgets. Everyone knows that multilateralism is being undermined by the United States; there is a great void here that invites Europe to its responsibilities, but Russia, Turkey, Iran, in fact, the representatives of the old empires are allowed to do so. Most of our Member States are not aware of the historical duty before them. I turn to the second item that will be put on the agenda of the next Council, namely climate change. Of course, we in Europe must do whatever is necessary to achieve carbon neutrality. After Brexit, we account for about 7% of greenhouse gas emissions. So the threat is global, and if the threat is global, our response must also be global.

The climate crisis is not a matter for the next five years, it is a matter for the next fifty years and is one of these urgent issues. The European Green New Deal affects us all. And we all have to get involved in their solution. Fighting climate change will not be the task of one man, not even the task of a single political party; it is a task for all men, women and all political parties. It must be a cross-cutting policy and must be supported by strong majority and stable majority. To make the fight against climate change an ideological issue, to legislate from partisan positions is to condemn the fight against climate change to failure. Either we're all together, behind us, or we're not going to do anything.  Both those who do not want to join the consensus and those who exclude others from consensus are as detriment to the fight against climate change. You don't get better at fighting climate change the more you just are. The best are always the ones who know how to form majority in the face of the challenges of history. Our position is clear. We need a green pact three times sustainable: to have a sustainable climate, to have a sustainable industry and to have a sustainable society.  We need a green pact that combines our climate protection policy with our social market economy; otherwise, we will lose the support of citizens and pay for the thesis of nationalists and populists. If we do not do so, we will not protect those who are already suffering the consequences of climate change: coal producers or farmers in flood zones who are just asking for help.  Defending the weather is neither right nor left. It is simply a moral imperative. And the next few months we will have to face the Brexit after Brexit. If there is a new referendum, we will have to get involved - which we did not do in the first referendum - and if there is no new referendum, Brexit after Brexit cannot make the UK the invisible member of the European corps, the phantom member of the European body.  We cannot react to the UK with nostalgia, but we cannot react with a rematch or a grudge.

Now the frugal four – not to be confused with the Fab Four – the frugal four, that’s Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, seem to have embraced one percent as a kind of new religion. It is driven by ideology and obsession with a small budget and not by a vision for the future because how is Europe ever going to achieve its ambitions on a budget of one percent? Do we really want to compete with the Chinese digital tiger with a one—percent budget, and do we really think that we can be the climate champion of the world with pennies and dimes? Or do we seriously think that we can be a geopolitical force on a shoestring? No, it’s not about spending less, it’s about spending better.  The frugal four do mention the rule-of-law conditionality for receiving funds, which is a good thing, but I would also like to hear the same frugal four then explain why they say nothing when they know that authoritarian leaders, like Viktor Orbán for example, have used EU funds to enrich their oligarch friends and to get political support in return.

It is clear that there is only one reasonable and acceptable proposal, and even for the medium term of the European Union it is not enough, which is Parliament's proposal, and as long as the Finnish Presidency and the Members of the Council continue to want a minimalist budget and rely, moreover, on the Commission's proposal – which unfortunately the Portuguese Government has even accepted, or at least signaled at an early stage – , where countries such as Finland earn more funds and countries such as Poland, Hungary or Croatia lose funds, this is not cohesion anywhere in the world.  And therefore we cannot accept either the budget on the table, and which the Council wants to force, let alone the distribution that was foreseen in terms of cohesion funds to achieve convergence, in the case of the Commission's proposal, the Juncker Commission. They are two bad starting bases and, therefore, Parliament must, point one, clearly force its overall package to be accepted and, point two, that there is also no loss of funds for any of the States in accordance with the criteria that have already been defined in that motion for a resolution in the resolution which was adopted by Parliament. It is essential to do this and it is essential for the Council to realise this, and only from a basis like this can there be a successful negotiation, which, moreover, and in passing, should be as swift as possible, because if the negotiation is not quick and there will be many citizens and many companies suffering the consequences. At the very least, a transitional proposal is accepted that there is no, say, a halt to European support for all citizens and businesses benefiting from it. Finally, on climate change, one thing that is very important: it is that fast steps are already taken but that they are steps that not only take the life of the planet, which is an imperative, that it is an emergency, which is an emergency – I have no doubts about it – but also people, because people must be at the heart of politics , and we what we sometimes see is that socialists put society ahead of people, liberals put individuals ahead of people, greens put the planet ahead of people and what we want is a policy for people, that is, for individuals in relation, to individuals in their context, to families , for the relationship of solidarity.

Secondly, there are two ways of being realistic: that of some Member States, which want to do more with less, and that of Parliament, which considers that any new initiative must be accompanied by additional budgetary resources. The aim is simple: to ensure the quality and effectiveness of European public policies. Let me think, Madam Minister, that realism is more on Parliament's side, because it is certainly very ambitious for Europeans. It is because we carry this ambition that we are hammering home the urgency of advancing the issue of own resources. Today, the predominance of national contributions fuels the logic of fair return and ignores the European added value.

But in other matters we are not working so well, for example not only in financial matters but in very important issues in the area of foreign policy, like the case of Albania and Macedonia, the issues that are making us weaker and can make our neighbourhoods less safe. On the climate issue, I fully support the view that Europe should play a central role in efforts to reduce the climate risk. This is a matter of responsibility, a matter of important transformation of our economy and an issue that can be very beneficial for our future. We should act decisively but we should respect, in my view, some principles.  First of all, our policy should be evidence-based, should be based on the impact assessment analysis and studies. We should favour the market approach and technological neutrality. Second, it is good to set ambitious long-term targets, but it’s even more important to deliver on existing targets because only through fulfilling our promises can we reach the long-term goals.  Last, but not least, predictability and fair conditions for our businesses are very key. If the rules are predictable businesses can adjust and we also should make sure that there will be a level playing field for our businesses, maybe through the introduction of some equaliser like a border adjustment tax. I guess we can succeed. We can employ new technologies. We can, if we set the rules, we will benefit, we will benefit substantially but only if we make a good policy.  Last, on financial issues, I just want to say that money is money but time is also money. I call on the Council to find, as soon as possible, good compromise solutions because the cost of delay is substantial. Let me also say that if climate is the key priority, it should be fully respected in our financial plans.  I hope the Council will act according to the principle that if we act together we are stronger, if not we are weaker. I prefer the first one, I hope the Commission and Council do too.

The Commission has indeed an ambitious agenda in which we recognise many of our proposals, but we won’t come even close to Europeans’ hopes and dreams if we keep stalling everything that is relevant. In one word, we need to put our money where our mouth is. So let us demand from the Council nothing less than an ambitious budget for the next term. It is time to stop demanding more and more from the European policies, while wanting to pay even less for it. We can do it. We can bridge the gaps by bringing own resources to the table. It is time to go back to basics. This Union is about sharing a common dream of peace and sustainable development for all and, in this case, solidarity pays back through the reinforcement of the single market.

And this can be done in two ways, with the help of funds and with the help of the law.  That is why I ask that both the 2020 budget and all subsequent budgets take this into account. Of course, agricultural policy is important, cohesion policy for less developed countries is important, but I ask that at least 25% of the budget is very much financed by the fight against climate change and digitalisation. What I said is that the same is important and what we have in our hands are laws, but not only to legistise, but also to impose sanctions and penalties for those who do not comply with the provisions of all these laws. When we talk about funds, one should think and act with two different funds. One is a fund that enables an energy transition to clean energy sources and the other is funds for remediation of damages to natural disasters because they are already happening.

We therefore want real political and financial efforts to achieve our objectives and respect the Paris Agreement while ensuring a just ecological transition for all. It is therefore not gratifying to consider refusing a MFF if the proposed project does not suit us, but it is our responsibility to remind that this is the expectation of Europeans, and especially of young people, for the next five years. We are at a crossroads and everything is at stake. That is why we deplore the delay already taken in these negotiations, which portends the worst for the final beneficiaries.

And it is truly amazing how, a few years ago, some seem already so forgotten about the lessons of the financial crisis that it was also a euro crisis. Without an investment in cohesion and convergence it is not possible to respond to the discontent of citizens that fuels Eurosceptic populism and threatens the European project.

Climate change requires urgent engagement, i.e. adoption of concrete measures to change global warming trends and abolish carbon dioxide emissions al more fully by 2050. The projects we are already achieving, for example, on islands, through a clean energy transition programme can serve as a good example. The islands may be at the foreman of our actions.

On the MFF, I hope the signal given by this Parliament and the Commission to the Council was clear and in very simple words, I would say it’s an illusion to think that the MFF should be more of the same. We want the same, but more of it, that’s not going to fly. We want the same, but less of it, is not going to fly either, so we will have to find a compromise where we do more on what needs to be done now and less on what needed to be done in the past. For that, we need to have a reasonable budget where we convince those Member States who say they are frugal, that it is in their interest to pool our resources at the European level to meet these challenges and we convince those Member States who still cling to outdated policies, that they should embrace the potential of moving that towards new policies especially linked to climate change. This brings me to my second point, and also triggered by some of the remarks that were made. I want to warn of a false contradiction that’s been put on the table by some here, no longer here but some who were here.

I will convey their messages to the President of the European Council. In concluding, let me outline a few things in particular. May I start with the Presidency’s priority, which you mentioned several times, namely the rule of law. Respect for the rule of law is the cornerstone of our Union and, as such, essential for its functioning. As regards Hungary in particular, we started the Article 7 hearings in September. In December, in the General Affairs Council we will organise a second hearing. As a priority, the Presidency has focused on preventive action and on making our rule of law toolbox as effective as possible. Secondly, as noted in this debate, the European Union needs to continue to spearhead climate action and lead by example in order to help raise global ambition. This means engaging in a long—term transition to a climate neutral economy. Such a transition will bring a profound and radical change in almost every industry and the way we go about our daily lives. We know that we need to provide the right incentives for this transformation and we will have to make sure that we leave no one behind, taking into account national and regional specificities and different socioeconomic circumstances. Within the MFF context, this will be reflected as part of our negotiation toolbox. We will provide just transition. As mentioned by some of you, gender balance is another issue that will be addressed in our negotiations box as a very important mainstreaming element. Thirdly, the leaders will provide us with guidance on the overall level of the MFF. We see Europe developing and we see socioeconomic gaps being reduced, meaning that are our policies are effective. But it also means that the level of support from the EU has to be adapted so a realistic budget should be reflecting this. As the Presidency, we are committed to proposing an efficient and effective budget in line with our citizens’ expectations, bringing genuine European added value.

First of all, I invite you to watch a short video about Oleg Sentsov. (Screening of a video in the Chamber) Ladies and gentlemen, it is a real honour for the European Parliament to welcome Oleg Sentsov, winner of the 2018 Sakharov Prize. Released in September along with 35 other people as part of a prisoner exchange, Oleg returned to Ukraine after serving five years in prison, as part of a twenty-year sentence on terrorism charges, awarded to him by a Russian court for protesting against the illegal occupation of his native Crimea. Sentsov was still in prison in Siberia last year. His empty seat in this House – many of you will remember this – was an eloquent symbol not only of his struggle for democracy, but also of the emptiness left in society by all those who are punished for telling the truth. A void in the daily lives of families, countries and the democratic community in the world. During the political trial against him in Russia, Sentsov said: 'I do not know what value your convictions have if you are not prepared to suffer or even give your life for them.' I was deeply impressed by what you said, but it struck everyone who listened to them. It is true that courage is not a quality of body, but of spirit, and you, Mr Sentsov, have remained firm in your principles and convictions, and that is why you paid for it.  But no one should have to pay a price for their freedom. There are too many defenders of freedoms, on the other hand, who are forced to be afraid of losing their lives, of never seeing their family and friends again, because they are not prepared to conform or remain silent in the face of human rights violations.  Journalists and artists are increasingly being targeted for expressing their political views. Oleg Sentsov has been released, but many others, including bloggers and journalists such as Stanyslav Aseev, are still being held hostage in eastern Ukraine. Together, we call for them to be released. In the same way, we call for the release of other Sakharov Prize winners or finalists who are still in prison. I would remind you, for example, of Nasrin Sotoudeh of Iran, who was awarded the prize in 2012, who, after a previous release, was arrested again this year and sentenced to thirty-eight years in prison. Others, such as the Damas de Blanco, the Cuban 'women in white' movement, which was awarded the prize in 2005, are still being intimidated by public authorities. Still others, such as Razan Zeitouneh, a Syrian who won the award in 2011, disappeared and left no trace. We have not forgotten and we do not want to forget any of them. The European Union is founded on the values of democracy and human rights. When human rights are called into question, when democracy is at risk and the foundations of the rule of law are being lost, we need the bravest among us: human rights defenders, trade unionists, journalists, bloggers, media workers, artists and publishers, all those who dare to give a voice to those who do not have a voice. Democracy cannot exist without a living and pluralist civil society. That is why we must do everything possible to protect it. Mr Sentsov, I pay tribute to your courage, perseverance and determination. It is an honour for me to award you this prize on behalf of the European Parliament. I am happy now to give you the floor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 74, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Oleg Sentsov", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Winner of the Sakharov Prize 2018. – (The following is a transcription of the interpretation of the original speech from Russian into English) Mr President, good afternoon everybody. Andrei Sakharov, Nelson Mandela, Václav Havel. I would never have imagined that one day my name would be mentioned alongside theirs. It is a huge honour, and also a huge responsibility. Thank you for this. I accept and take this prize not as a personal honour, but as a prize for all Ukrainian political prisoners who have ever been in Russian prisons, and a prize in honour of all Ukrainian political prisoners who are still there; all our prisoners who are in Donbass in the hands of the separatists; all our activists who continue fighting for our country. As an honour for all our military men and women who are fighting for our independence, and some of them have even given their lives for our independence. Currently, a lot is being said and talked about: negotiations and a possible peace with Russia. I don’t trust Mr Putin, and I call upon you not to trust him either. Russia and Putin will absolutely, definitely cheat you. They don’t wish for peace in Donbass or Ukraine. They want to see Ukraine on its knees. They do not want to apply lawful European policy. They would like to rule by their own methods, by force of arms. We won’t allow this, we will fight for our freedom and we will fight to the end. You have many internal discussions and differences here in the EU, you have conflicts, you have different views on how to develop, how to reform, how to go forward. As we say in Russian, ‘we wish we had your problems’. Our problems are much more complex and severe: our country’s corrupt antiquated system has not been changed. We are also subject to military aggression. Each week our military men and women are dying. We have a different level of problems. But given all your internal challenges, the EU is developing. I think it is a great institution and you are a good example to all of us. There is a country which is the greatest Euro-optimist in the world today: it is called Ukraine. For us, there is no other path for development and no other way out. For us, this is a question of survival as a nation. So every time any of you ponder how to be friendly with Mr Putin over our heads, please remember the thousands who have fallen in Ukraine. Please remember hundreds of our young men who are still languishing behind bars who might be subject to torture right now as I speak. Please remember those Russian Tatars who could be arrested right now at this moment. Their houses may be searched, families, children, may lose fathers, brothers. Please remember those young men who right now, at this moment, are in their military fatigues, with this kind of sign on their sleeve in the trenches, risking their lives for our freedom – and also for your freedom. Please don’t forget them. Thank you. Long live Ukraine.

Mr President, last week we reached an agreement on the 2020 budget after intense discussions between the Council and Parliament, of course, with the commission's highly regarded role in the whole process. The result of these days-long discussions and this joint effort is that we have come to a budget that, taking into account the budgetary constraints and budgetary discipline that must certainly be respected at European level, is forward-looking and meets citizens' expectations. It is a strong, forward-looking budget, a budget that – and this is very important at this stage – bridges the gap to another multi-annual financial plan in which we must resolutely continue to work towards the Europe of the 21st century. It seems quite obvious to me at the moment, when we look around the world: it will depend to a large extent on that multiannual budget and what we can achieve in it whether Europe will be able to play the leading role in the 21st century that it can legitimately claim, but which it must act on.  We are making a major shift in investment in areas where the EU offers added value, such as research and development and energy infrastructure, in the coming year. A strengthening of programmes in high demand, which have proven their effectiveness very clearly, such as Erasmus, Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility. Security and migration, too, this budget was given the necessary attention to do what European citizens are asking for. We must dare to go in the same directions in the same direction. We must choose a budget that does indeed take into account the needs of our citizens in an explicit, clear and decisive way, a budget which – once again, the points where Europe can absolutely add value to the national level – to innovation, competitiveness, climate, infrastructure, security and migration management.  As chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I would also like to thank all those involved in the drafting and final agreement, firstly the rapporteurs, Mrs Monika Hohlmeier and Mrs Eider Gardiazabal, but certainly Mr Kimmo Tiilikainen, Secretary of State for the Finnish Presidency. Behind these people there is a whole battery of employees who have also worked with a lot of effort and perseverance – I have been able to experience it for the first time and with great pleasure. Of course, I should also like to mention Commissioner Günther Oettinger and his people, who have contributed more than their part to the final result, which I am very proud of in any case as chairman of the Committee on Budgets.  What I think we can still learn from the process we have seen over the last two weeks is that it is indeed very useful to talk to each other in an open, direct way, to make it clear to each other what the respective parties are talking about, and then to reach a compromise from that clarity. There is nothing more difficult than reaching a compromise when the starting points are unclear. I think that perhaps the great merit of the parties involved in these discussions has been that it was very clear from the outset what the objectives were, where they wanted to go, so that there was room for compromise. I think that's happened in a successful way.  Once again, many thanks to all the people involved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 103, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioner, dear Finnish Presidency, dear Kimmo Tiilikainen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has all said. I would like to begin by thanking you. A thank you – forgive me at the beginning – to my colleagues in the negotiating team, in particular to Johan Van Overtveldt, to Eider Gardiazabal Rubial, who were allowed to conduct the direct negotiations with me, but also to my shadow rapporteurs and to the coordinators – Clotilde is looking at me, you, Mr Andresen, are also looking at me. We have really tried to work together, to communicate with each other here. We have agreed on common positions. I would like to thank Kimmo Tiilikainen for the fact that, after we initially fought fiercely with each other, he tried to negotiate fairly with us and we had common priorities with us and now also provide these common priorities financially. It is clear that Parliament would have liked to have had more. It is also clear that some in the Council would have liked to have had less. But I believe that we have reached good compromises. EUR 850 million more for climate protection expenditure in the field of research and innovation, including jobs and competitiveness, youth and digitalisation: that is a great deal that we have been able to achieve together. We have been able to increase the total budget lines dealing with climate protection by EUR 504 million. More than 21% of expenditure is therefore climate-related, and we are very clearly above the 20% target, but we still have a lot of work to do to get to 25% or even higher. Horizon 2020 is up 8.8%. I must honestly say that I was somewhat stunned to read the unilateral declaration by the countries that voted against it – in particular Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden – which states, firstly, that there are not enough margins and, secondly, that it is far above what is needed. I have to say soberly that Horizon 2020 has so many programmes that are completely oversubscribed, where we can only support 7 or 8% of the programmes at all. That is why I simply cannot understand such a declaration and I am grateful to all the Member States that share this compromise with us. The fact that there are no more margins is simply wrong. We still have EUR 1.5 billion in margins for 2020 and the last two years alone, up to EUR 4.2 billion. I believe that we have really met the Council in this respect as well. However, it was important to us to support the issue of climate protection in the area of CEF Energy with EUR 96 million, CEF transport with EUR 37 million, the European satellite systems, which are also essential in matters of climate research, Erasmus – Youth Exchange – with EUR 50 million more, a total of EUR 2.9 billion and an increase of 3.6%, the Youth Employment Initiative with EUR 28.3 million and, if necessary, a further EUR 50 million from June. We were able to increase Life, not as much as we would have liked, but at least. However, we have not left out security issues – the eppO issue, a bit more Europol – that is, we have given the money where it is necessary. We have been in the media sector, in coal regions in transition, in order to answer important questions of climate protection. I believe that we have put together an all-round solid package. I would like to thank my fellow Members most sincerely for their support, and for the Presidency and the Commission together, for successfully completing or deciding on the negotiations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 104, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Eider Gardiazabal Rubial", "mepid": "96991", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, the truth is that when we started these negotiations we had very far-fluer positions and, of course, nothing would foreshadow that we could reach an agreement. When we talked about priorities, it is true that the Council and Parliament were talking about the same priorities, but when we then translated these priorities into figures we made a difference of EUR 4.5 billion. We had two days of intense negotiations, Friday and Monday. We were already on the edge and, in the end, we managed to reach a point of agreement. Above all, and I think it is the most important thing, we were able to send a very clear message about what the priorities were for the future of the European Union and, above all, how we were going to finance them.  And this agreement we reached has allowed us to strengthen key lines with more than 850 million euros in those priorities on which we agreed. For example, the Horizon 2020 programme – the largest research programme in the European Union – compared to 2019 is increased by 8.8%. I believe that this is a good sign for the entire scientific community, and also that one in five euros of this budget will be earmarked for the fight against climate change.  We are a long way from the goals we have set ourselves, but at least we are teaching the way we have to go. And, of course, we send a very clear message to young people, because we have strengthened two policies that are directly aimed at them. We have improved the funding of Erasmus – one of the most beloved programmes in the European Union – and we have also managed to put the youth guarantee programme back on the table. We have managed to allocate EUR 145 million by 2020 and also an extra EUR 50 million if necessary, because the programme is working well. The truth is that from other sections, which was the part that I had to negotiate, there would not be much to point out, although I think we have maintained a fairly balanced agreement and at least we have not cut the budgets of the other institutions. So at least I think this will allow them to be able to carry out their work in decent conditions. In short, I believe that this is a very positive agreement for the European Union, but, as always, there is a but in all this. I believe that we cannot fall into complacency, because we are a long way from the objectives which I believe we have to put on the table for the European Union. We are a long way from that 1.3% for the financial framework demanded by this Parliament and with which we would really have a budget strong enough to mark a turning point in European policies and, above all, to lead certain policies such as the fight against climate change, which really needs momentum from the European Union. And I want to end up doing a thank you. Of course, the negotiating team of the European Parliament, with the President at the helm and with the rapporteur, Mrs Hohlmeier, who defended this Parliament's position tooth and nail; the Commissioner and his entire team – it has been his last budget, but that I believe leaves an important legacy in his work and I want to give him a very special recognition; and, above all, the Finnish Presidency and Kimmo Tiilikainen, because I think he has been a very tough negotiator, but also very empathetic with the positions that the two institutions held.  And he told us a story I'm not going to repeat here because I don't have time. But in the end, we did manage to save that dog that was in danger at the time. And I believe that this story, which may be an anecdote in the negotiations, has been the one that brought together the two negotiating teams and the one that finally made us get this deal.

I would like to express the Council’s satisfaction with the agreement reached by the Conciliation Committee on 18 November – the last day of the conciliation period – after long and intense discussions. The positive outcome of the negotiations shows that our three institutions can work efficiently in a spirit of good cooperation. Together, we negotiated a budget for 2020 which responds to today’s concerns and tomorrow’s needs of Europe’s citizens.  The European Parliament and the Council have worked hard to find a solution that would equip the Union for the challenges of the last year of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The deal we reached reflects strongly our common priorities – climate action, growth and competitiveness, research and digitalisation, young people, security and migration. This year we have made a considerable effort to strengthen the climate relevance of the EU budget and get as close as possible to fulfilling the Union’s 20% climate target to be reached by 2020. To this aim, we have reinforced relevant programmes in the area of research and development, transport and energy infrastructure and the EU’s external action. Additional funds have also been allocated to the LIFE programme. In order to improve the situation of young people and help them integrate into the labour market, we have agreed to dedicate EUR 145 million to the youth employment initiative. The other successful programme, providing opportunities for young Europeans to study, train and gain experience abroad, Erasmus+, will see an increase of 3.6%. Furthermore, programmes and projects supporting competitiveness increased by 7.9% compared with 2019. This means more funds for Horizon 2020, the European satellite navigation systems, EGNOS and Galileo, and the energy and transport strands of the Connecting Europe facility.  In the area of migration and security, a number of key EU agencies, such as Frontex, EASA, Europol and Eurojust, will be endowed with additional staff and funding in view of their in-house mandates. In addition, we have provided ourselves with more means to tackle the root causes of migration and step up the EU’s engagement with our neighbours to the east and the south.  While posting support for EU flagship programmes, we have at the same time applied a prudent and responsible approach in line with sound financial management. The Council insisted on such an approach during the whole budgetary procedure and has continuously stressed the need to take into account financial realities at national level. The final result achieved on 18 November foresees a 1.5% increase in the global level of commitments compared with 2019. The remaining margin of EUR 1.5 billion under expenditure ceilings of the MFF will allow us to cope with next year’s contingencies and uncertainties. In this way, we have together established a realistic budget for 2020, which is focused on a maximum European added value for money and takes fully into account taxpayers’ interests and concerns.  In our official meetings in the course of the year, as well as during our informal contacts, I very much appreciated the positive atmosphere that prevailed in our talks. Both sides of the table were ready to engage constructively to reach an agreement to reframe the discussion around shared interests and come up with solutions. I am glad to inform you that after the successful outcome of the Conciliation Committee, the joint text was formally approved by the Council yesterday. The Council expects the European Parliament to also approve the joint text tomorrow. The general budget for the financial year 2020 will then be adopted within the deadline foreseen by the Treaties.  Coming to the end of my intervention, I would like to thank the Chairman of the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, Mr Johan Van Overtveldt, and the rapporteurs, Ms Monika Hohlmeier and Ms Eider Gardiazabal Rubial, for their positive and open attitude and for the good cooperation during the last weeks and months. Your hard work and enthusiasm can be highly commended. Together we saved the day. I would also like to extend my special thanks to you, Commissioner Oettinger – Gunther – for your contribution to our negotiations for the last time. Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your attention.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tiilikainen, I would like to thank mr Tiilikainen for the work he has done. On the one hand, we had a starting point with a very good chance of agreement, because the priorities were the same for Parliament and the Council: firstly, investment in research, innovation and the future of Europe, the second action against climate change and the third fight against unemployment, job creation, especially for the younger generation. On the one hand, a common starting point, but on the other hand, the deviations from the Commission's proposal – which they wanted to invest in these priorities – amounted to EUR 2.7 billion more in Parliament and EUR 1.5 billion less for the Council, i.e. EUR 4.2 billion difference. This was a starting point in which the difference was greater than in the previous budget discussions. In the last financial year of the budgetary framework, Parliament wanted to invest as much as possible all the available funds up to the ceiling, and the Council wanted – which I felt to some extent to be correct – to build up margins, margins for unforeseen events in 2020 or for the foreseeable – refugees who are currently living in Turkey and to whom we are financing human dignity – for the foreseeable, but this has not yet been taken into account in the Commission's budget proposal. The sense of responsibility and the sense of responsibility of all those involved were good. I would like to thank the chairman of the committee for his sovereign moderation, I thank the two rapporteurs for their knowledgeable commitment and their coordination with important Members from the Committee on Budgets, so that in the end a majority of Members from many political groups was achievable. And I would like to thank the representative of the Presidency, Mr Tiilikainen, who, although I believe has taken a hard line on the Council's line, has always been interested in a result, in a compromise solution, and has worked very constructively towards it at every second. The press wrote of dramatic deliberations in the last hour– it was not so dramatic. I believe that it has already been shown that the leaders did not want to let it fail, but were interested in an agreement. The figures speak for themselves: on the one hand, we have not affected the ceilings in any form, but have complied with them, and on the other hand, we have margins, margins of EUR 1.5 billion in commitments – a total of EUR 4.2 billion with other instruments of flexibility – and are thus prepared for what can be added to the European Union in terms of further tasks and expenditure next year. On climate change, we have significantly exceeded the 20% target in the 2020 budget with a percentage of 21.1%, thus rebalancing a significant proportion of the underspends that have been under-investment in 2014 and 2015. We have Horizon 2020 at a peak in terms of investment from the European research and innovation budget – EUR 13.5 billion, an increase of 8.8% compared to 2019. I would advise all those involved to take this high level of funding for research under Horizon 2020 as the starting point for Horizon Europe and not to fall short of it, because this is where economic strength, competitiveness, investment in technologies for sustainability and climate protection become visible. That is why this step, which is primarily due to Parliament, was a decisive step in this budget, with a further EUR 300 million, in the transition to the discussions on the post-2020 budget framework. Connecting Europe Facility: Energy significantly increased, plus 35%, transport moderately increased. In other words, we are already investing in the future, thereby creating added value that can best be realised at European level. We have a 4% increase in Erasmus+ – a small step towards doubling to triple, if you take Parliament and Mrs von der Leyen as a benchmark, in the financial years of the next decade. We have also provided for some moderate cuts, which I believe are justifiable in implementation – pre-accession aid to Turkey, we have some moderate but important reinforcements at Europol, Eurojust and EPPO, the Public Prosecutor's Office, so that these instruments and bodies for internal security and for the rule of law in Europe and for the fight against corruption are more capable of acting. All in all – I can tell you this from my colleagues from the Commission, the colleagues who are responsible for the portfolios and then implement the budget – the Commission is satisfied with this budget. It is a good basis for the implementation of the von der Leyen Commission's budget. I would therefore like to thank all those involved: the Council, Mr Tiilikainen, rapporteurs and the committee chair. And I would simply ask you to bring the vigour now into the discussions on the multiannual budgetary framework. If the ministers in the General Affairs Council had met once as long as we met, with a working intensity over two weeks until late at 11 p.m., with this intensity of work and not just two hours a month and the same line to take, there would also be movement in the budgetary framework. As a citizen, I hope to read very early next year that the Council and Parliament will achieve a breakthrough for a modern framework of the next decade's budget, and that this will not happen in A.C. until Advent in a year's time. Then we would have learned the lesson from the good experience of your deliberations on the 2020 draft budget with a view to a timely budgetary framework for the next decade and thus to added value that can only be achieved at European level. Thank you to all those involved.

Here is a good foreshadowing: we leave and also leave a good example of the path that must be trodden. The institutions, when they work together, are able to reach agreements that are very positive and this is a good harbinger for the next Multiannual Financial Framework, and parliament will also be overmet, and we hope that the Council, too, can come together and bring Parliament closer together. This is a budget that gives priority to climate, research and innovation and I will point out EUR 302 million in reinforcement and reinforcement, in particular, for the heading of combating cancer, which does not forget youth, the youth employment initiative, the strengthening of Erasmus + and which also favours competitiveness.  A budget that is also a challenge for Member States, and here is a request for all Member States: speed up the implementation of the funds. The implementation of cohesion policy funds is, I don't want to say the word shame, but it is very low. The proof is that the payments of the budget for 2020 are at 0.9 %, below 1 % of gross national income.

We have done a good job, it is the best possible budget. I thank Rasmus and Clotilde, Commissioner Oettinger and Minister Tiilikainen for negotiating hard to reach this agreement. Beyond this annual budget, however, I think that we are all asking ourselves the same questions. What is our ambition for Europe? What is our real ambition for our future and that of our children? If we had a big ambition, we would have a big budget. When Kennedy said, \"We choose to go to the Moon,\" he really decided and put the budget on it. NASA's budget has increased 15-fold in five years, 400,000 jobs have been created and the United States has reached the Moon faster than expected. Today, the goal is not to go to the Moon but to save the Earth, at least to save humanity on Earth, and we all know that this budget is totally inadequate. We're all talking about the Green New Deal, alluding to Roosevelt's New Deal, it's a very nice picture. But when Roosevelt came to power, he gave himself the means of a real New Deal that would create millions of jobs and give hope to the American people. Roosevelt tripled the federal budget in a few years and it worked. In a few years, to win the war, Roosevelt would further multiply the entire federal budget by four. In total, while Roosevelt was old and paralyzed, the federal budget would be multiplied twelvefold. It finances it first through taxation - taxation on the richest and on profits - and then through another use of monetary creation. Were Kennedy and Roosevelt crazy? Did they ruin the United States? Of course not. They were great leaders who had a real plan for their country and had given themselves the means to break taboos and find funding. They have done no harm to their country; on the contrary, they have revived the hopes of millions of people.  What are we waiting for in Europe today? Once again, this budget is good under the constraints, and the Social Democratic Group is happy to vote for it. But we have to go further. To win the climate battle we have all talked about, the European Commission itself says that we are missing 300 billion each year if we stick to the target of reducing CO2 emissions by only 40%. But since our goal - thanks to Ursula von der Leyen - is more ambitious, since we all agree to halve CO2 emissions in the next ten years, the need for funding is obviously necessary. At least $400 billion is needed each year to win the climate battle. We applaud the European Investment Bank for saying that it will stop fossil investment and double its climate loans, that is fine. But that's only 15 billion more each year, when 400 billion are needed. Dear friends, I therefore think that it is absolutely necessary to find new ways. I hope that this is the last year that we are voting in such a constrained framework. Nothing would be worse than a Green Deal without real funding, it would be Green washing. Nothing would be worse than a Green Deal with unfair funding. We would then have thousands, if not millions, of yellow vests all over Europe. It is absolutely and very quickly that much more ambitious and fair funding must be found. Why not take the idea of Jacques Delors? He said that intra-European tax competition had to be tackled. When I was a child, the income tax averaged 45%. Today, it has fallen to 19%. Income tax has been halved while profits are exploding. If we want to have a bigger budget without asking for more money from the basic citizens and the Member States, it is time to move very quickly on own resources.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 110, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Clotilde Armand", "mepid": "197664", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew group. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur of the Renew group, we have found that we have much greater ambitions in the European Parliament towards the representatives of our governments. Many of us are First-term Members and we have intact the enthusiasm with which our citizens have sworn in to bring about change in Europe. We have put at the heart of the negotiations for the 2020 budget programmes that include measures against climate change because the majority of European citizens continue to express this concern as paramount. We have reiterated the importance of a balanced geographical allocation of funds to address the concern of eastern countries that have difficulty connecting to the European area and difficulties in accelerating economic convergence. Europe cannot be a strong pole if a third of the member countries are in an economic gap.  We would also like to give a clear signal that the European Union is making the fight against corruption a priority. We insisted that sufficient posts be provided for the new European Public Prosecutor's Office to become a functioning institution from next year. I have therefore achieved punctual victories in relation to the objectives that I personally set myself. But we achieved a real victory, a symbolic victory, important from the position of newly elected Parliament. It is the largest amount of funds negotiated in Parliament in relation to the proposal put forward by a Council in recent years. We have made clear our priorities: protecting the climate, innovation and businesses from the future, supporting new generations and the continental economic balance east-west. In conclusion, I believe that our message in the 2020 negotiations reinforces our vision for the future multiannual financial framework. This financial framework will depend on the European Union's political guidelines for the next seven years, including cohesion policy so vital to the Eastern European area.

We Greens believe that the tough budget negotiations have paid off. Instead of cuts to the draft budget, there is now a plus. This is a great success for the European Parliament, for all of us. I would like to begin by thanking Mrs and shadow rapporteur Clotilde Armand for many joint initiatives for climate and youth, but, of course, above all the negotiators, our committee chairman and the two rapporteurs, Eider Gardiazabal Rubial and Monika Hohlmeier. Without their conduct, this success would not have been possible. The budget shows us that we can achieve something if we are courageous. And we Greens believe that we must remain courageous now, because we are at the beginning of an economic crisis. We need to do much more to achieve the climate targets. We don't have time for a \"continue like this\". We need to invest massively to make our economy climate neutral over the next few decades and to take all people with us. Our answer to this is a real Green New Deal. Now the intriguing question is: What comes into the Green New Deal, and will it be funded? We Greens believe that investment in better, faster and cheaper rail links, for example, should be included. We need to invest more in renewable energy, we need to invest more in good food, in clean air and in water for all the people on our continent. Negotiations on the 2020 budget have been tough. Every small budget title has had to be hard won by us in Parliament, and some Member States, without making any concrete proposals, have simply tried to block everything. I expressly exclude the Finnish Presidency, but there are others who have not been particularly constructive there. Copenhagen, The Hague, Vienna and, in some parts, Berlin, risk missing our targets, failing to meet the Paris climate targets, and not being able to increase research spending. We believe that this would be a bigger problem than if we were all prepared to spend more money on the EU budget and on our common future.

That is right and that is how it should be, and the fact that there is a great deal of agreement here shows how much has gone wrong. The EU's 2020 annual budget should be a clearly structured budget, a clear overview of spending and financial frameworks. In fact, this budget is the exact opposite. It is an instrument of obfuscation, hidden financing and misleading the European taxpayer. Not only is the EU budget being inflated more and more, by EUR 400 million in 2020 alone; above all, it is becoming increasingly confusing due to countless – sometimes hidden – funds, the use of which and their usefulness are questionable at best and which no one questions. What we are seeing here is not budgeting, it is deliberate lack of transparency. Take the emergency reserve of EUR 1.2 billion. It is currently being converted into another budget title on climate protection, that is, for clientele policy of the Greens and Socialists. This is how we hide the allocation of ever-increasing sums of money for the nonsensical and insecure energy supply that we already have in Germany. But while the liberals criticize this in Germany, they are taking part here. Finally, eu budgeting becomes completely confusing due to the subsequent allocation of funds by another EU institution, the European Investment Bank. Where the EU's budget is not enough to finance any ideology, it acts as a co-financer, with the very large sums and, of course, ultimately, as always, covered by the European taxpayer. So what appears to be a comparatively small budget title in the EU budget can actually be a huge project. However, this cannot be seen from the budget on which we are to talk and decide. But what is the value of a budget that does not show the true distribution of funds, but conceals it? In two words: nothing at all.

I am addressing colleagues from the other political groups in the European Parliament. If we celebrate with a budget of 0.99% of European GDP, below and below 1%, how do you think we will negotiate effectively to achieve the target that you set in the European Parliament, namely the target of 1.3% for the new multiannual financial framework? The truth is that, out of the EUR 480 million more requested by the European Parliament for social and regional cohesion policies, we have achieved an increase of EUR 34 million, eleven times less. This isn't about celebration. That is why I believe that reality shows that the final compromise was stamped by the Council, which unfortunately adopts policies that are inadequate for the future of Europe and, above all, the weakest. That is why the Eurogroup on the left will not vote in favour of the final compromise.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 115, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Mario Furore (NI).", "mepid": "197795", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again Parliament and the Council have reached an agreement which, as far as I am concerned, should invest more in two key points of this European Union, namely the fight against climate change and support for youth employment. We need a stronger and more constant commitment in these two areas, which I consider to be key, and above all I hope that the Commission will be courageous in respecting the will expressed in the declarations during the negotiations. These are the key points of the future and I hope that these negotiations, including with regard to the multiannual financial framework, will take this into account. What has happened in Italy in recent days, with the collapse of a viaduct – the umpteenth unfortunately – shows us that the fight against climate change belongs to us more than we think, and above all that we must invest in prevention, for a strong and shared policy that Europe must promote. I welcome, on the other hand, the agreed cuts in Turkey. I say this because we must support civil society which wants to fight for democracy. We cannot afford to finance warmongering regimes, as far as I am concerned. I will therefore support the agreement reached, despite the fact that the negotiations show once again how difficult it is to find a balance on the one hand for a Union that wants to respect its own budget and, on the other, the Member States that are in the difficulties of having to comply with these constraints.

Therefore, the way of working and the way of negotiating will have an impact on the years to come and, in particular, on the preparation of a new perspective, namely the MFF. This is so important that the question arises as to whether all three institutions think in terms of follow-up. In other words, not from – to, just building a permanent process. Do all three institutions really want to build a sustainable development framework for the European Union, or do they just think in terms of a one-year budget.

In fact, from what I was told – I was a passive and non-active agent – they did an excellent job in the final stages of the negotiations. And why do I say that? I say this because what has been achieved in this budget, compared to the Commission's proposal, has indeed been significant progress and significant progress has been made in what is parliament's priorities.  I start with the very issue of climate, with the issue of research and innovation, but also with young people.

Compared to 2019, we increased the commitment appropriations by 1.5%, bringing the budget to EUR 168.7 billion. We are strengthening the Horizon 2020 research and innovation agenda by making the climate emergency an economic perspective. We are greening budgets for growth, competitiveness, but also transport and energy infrastructure. We defend our SMEs, the real backbone of our economy. Finally, we support digital and Erasmus. To remain competitive with the United States and China, Europe must have an ambitious and responsible budget. Based on the mandate of the European Parliament, we defended our positions with the desire to establish a budget that reflected the expectations of our citizens and we obtained an additional 850 million to achieve our priorities, including more than 500 million for climate.

The first is that the new set—up of Parliament with Renew and the Greens also pushing priorities can lead to a budget which is actually better. I’m very happy with the outcome in that direction.  The second is that a big deal is possible, and I also want to thank the rapporteurs for their great work in having a good negotiation strategy and working in a proactive and deal—finding way, and also for ensuring that we move from the Commission proposal towards Parliament’s position.

We have recently witnessed the unedifying display of little Napoleon himself, Emmanuel Macron, as he parades his global ambitions by humiliating NATO, and now it seems, Angela Merkel. Ironically, the Germans are really going to miss us. Great Britain has historically acted as a buffer between those two old adversaries and a deterrent to France’s imperial tendencies. So when the German chancellor uses an English metaphor of gluing the tea cups back together again after Macron has broken them, you know it’s getting bad. The EU budget is essentially an exercise in Franco-German game theory; even though contributions as small as a percentage of GDP the aggregate of EUR 170 billion is big enough to achieve overtly political goals. That is why we never see any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which absorbs one third of the EU budget and acts as the world’s biggest subsidy scheme for French farmers.

A word about the long-term budget: it must not be delayed any more. This causes concern and causes important things to be postponed. We must also look at the needs. The budget must make a successful long-term budget impossible. We need to look seriously at europe's own revenue capabilities in order to be able to cope effectively and quickly with these tasks.

The left cannot ask for more funds when it is not participating and while it does not require an increase in these contributions through the Member States.  At the same time, I have to say that for us it is particularly important that the funds for Turkey have been reduced. For those countries that violate human rights, that violate the rule of law, that invade countries of the European Union but also that do not respect the principles and values of the European Union, not only must the funds be reduced, but they must also be completely abolished.

Two things are very clear. We need new own resources to finance the goals we want to achieve, and both are connected to climate change and to the internal market. We also need a new MFF centred on well—rooted European policies, like cohesion policy and agricultural policy, but also linked to the new policies like, for instance, the implementation of the social pillar.

The 2020 budget is an opportunity to send the message that the future of Europe is common. We share responsibility for the hard times.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Just three thoughts at the end. Firstly, a response to the honourable Member's spontaneous speech: we have increased the Connecting Europe Facility for Energy by a large majority. When it comes to energy, it is not primarily about LNG terminals, but about the energy infrastructure as a whole. Europe's energy policy has always been made up of three objectives: firstly, sustainability and thus climate protection, secondly, security of supply and, thirdly, energy affordability. It has been a considerable goal in recent years, an expectation from countries such as Poland, Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia that, as long as gas is needed for heat and electricity, these countries will not depend 100% on gas from the Russian Federation, on Gazprom. Hence diversification of routes and sources. Now the new Parliament has to decide – you: what role should gas play in Europe's energy mix in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050? My guess is that as long as we shut down coal, gas will become increasingly important in the next ten to fifteen years, then a decline. There is also green gas – a vision: why not produce green gas from solar plants in Africa, which is fed into the gas grid in European LNG terminals and can thus play a climate-neutral and sustainable role in the energy mix of tomorrow and the day after? It is up to you, the next Parliament. The majority of the money goes across borders to power lines and infrastructure to complete the internal energy market and to bring renewables to where they are needed, electricity from renewable sources, for example, wind power from Ireland via England to the European Union. We will then decide on the specific projects at a later stage, but since the list of applications is long, more resources will certainly make sense. I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency once again, as the second last point. Why? We have cut the budget estimates for administration by means of an amendment, because salaries will rise only marginally next year. And the fact that you, Mr Tiilikainen, did not use the reflex of previous years, namely to demand another EUR 5 or 10 million in cuts to heading 5 at the last second, was sovereign. Thank you very much for that. You can be sure that this will not lead to arrogance in all the institutions – Parliament, the Court of Auditors, the Commission, European Schools, etc. – but that we will examine very carefully what will be necessary for the proper management of Europe next year and in the years to come. One final thought: if you, honourable Members, vote in favour of this 2020 budget tomorrow, this will be the first important decision of the new Parliament, apart from the election of the President and more. Allow me to say that on the subject of 'What role do the leading candidates play?' – functionally, not the people – you did not get a majority. The fact that you have now obtained a broad majority gives us all the courage, and my advice is: keep the objective of achieving a broad majority on the right track for the next decade. Then this 2020 budget may have been a good blueprint for the next seven years.

Mr President, I think it is a fairly correct summary of the speeches we have heard today that there is a clear majority in this Parliament in favour of the compromise reached on the budget. I have also heard many things say: 'It could have been better', and that is of course true, but that is true for any budget in any circumstances in any period of time. Every budget is a compromise. Each budget falls short of individual priorities or priorities of certain groups or groups individually. So in that sense, that is the fate of every budget. But again, I have found that there is a large majority, which is, of course, a happy observation as chairman of the Committee on Budgets.  This comes at a pivotal moment for Europe. The whole world is on the move as rarely before: China, the US, geopolitical movements, technology, climate... The list can be made for a long time. It is extremely important that Europe is firmly in its shoes here. Without doing so in an explicit way, Europe will become a footnote in history, and I think that everyone who is here wants to prevent it in a constructive way. If Europe is to assert itself, it will also require resources and the efficient use of resources. The two are going together irrevocably.

Extreme weather events are happening more frequently, and unfortunately with greater intensity. Droughts and forest fires are no longer confined to the Mediterranean, as we saw in Sweden last year; tropical hurricanes travel up to the coast of Ireland; heavy rain and flash floods occur across Europe. The floods affecting Venice are yet another tragic example, causing immense damage to Venice, its people and their livelihoods – also to the cultural heritage of Italy, of Europe and of humanity as a whole. The European Union has developed tools to provide assistance once natural disasters have occurred. From prevention and preparedness to the recovery phase. On prevention and preparedness, the Commission supports the development and improvement of EU Early Warning and Information Systems. For example, projects funded under Horizon 2020 are improving the prediction of the impact of heavy rain and snowfall on roads. For floods specifically, the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) offers the latest available information on floods in Europe. The Commission also provides guidelines and encourages Member States to compile national risk assessments, which are an essential tool to fight the impact of floods.  For the immediate response in the event of a disaster, our European Civil Protection Mechanism and the new upgrade rescEU structure can be activated at the request of the affected countries to support them in their response to floods. Recent examples include the 2013 support following extensive floods in Central Europe and the 2014 floods in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where extensive response capacities were deployed, including rescue helicopters and boats, teams of experts and response modules. To be noted that in the aftermath of disastrous forest fires in 2017, the European Union, as I already said, adopted rescEU. It is a safety net to support our Member States when they are overwhelmed by natural disasters. For the recovery phase, you know very well that the EU Solidarity Fund intervenes to assist the population in the recovery of essential infrastructure, in clean-up operations and in the safeguarding of the cultural heritage. Now, turning to the EU response to the floods affecting the region of Venice. The European Commission, through its Copernicus emergency satellite mapping system – a very sophisticated and excellent system – has already produced high-quality maps to assess the extent of floods in Northeast Italy. These products are provided free of charge to any affected country, and are used extensively by our Member States. Also, the EU Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) has also been in regular contact with the Italian authorities and continues to closely monitor the situation. The Commission stands ready to support Italy through the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism if needed. So far, we have not received any requests for support. Also, for the recovery phase, the Solidarity Fund could be activated in case total direct damage exceeds a threshold of 1.5% of regional GDP, which in the case of the Veneto region means damage exceeding EUR 2.3 billion. This is our regulation, these are our rules. The Commission has established direct contact with the Italian authorities and is providing guidance and advice on a possible application through the Solidarity Fund. At this stage, it is too early to know the exact extent of the damage on which the possible mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund and the amount of assistance would depend. But we must do more. What happened in Venice is, unfortunately, an example of what is to come as climate change develops. We must be proactive, and this is why in recent years the Commission has been putting an increased focus on prevention, climate adaptation and risk management policies. Here I would like to say that I am really proud of our common achievement to establish rescEU in which one of the most important pillars is prevention and preparedness, and I think we have to continue in this way.

Bridges have collapsed, roads are closed, the region bordering France is practically isolated, ports are blocked and there is enormous damage to the economy. That is why we need strong solidarity on the part of the European Union. Economic proximity but also efforts to try to prevent everything that happens in a country where most municipalities – I am referring to Italy – are born in areas of high hydrogeological risk. More than 80 % of Italian municipalities, 81.9 % of Italian municipalities, are born in areas with a high hydrogeological risk, and therefore a strong prevention activity is needed. In Venice, historical and cultural heritage is also threatened by the presence of the sea, as salt water erodes the foundations. That is why we need to do even more, and I hope that Italy, the Italian Government and the regions, will demand a strong commitment to the European Commission's Solidarity Fund and therefore make use of the availability that exists. We in the European People's Party have asked the European Commission to set up a fund for the protection of Europe's cultural heritage which has been damaged and to prevent any damage caused by bad weather, and therefore even stronger action in the next Community budget. I therefore agree with you and I hope that the next European Commission, which we will vote on tomorrow, will continue along the path chosen by the current Commission but will invest even more in cultural and infrastructural prevention in areas of high hydrogeological risk, which are not only in my country but also in Central Europe, Spain and France.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 158, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Simona Bonafè", "mepid": "124814", "text": "  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the images that have toured the world of high water in Venice, right up to the Basilica where it never arrived, cannot leave us indifferent, just as we cannot be indifferent to the images that come from other European and Italian cities underwater. Of course, it has always happened that in autumn it rains and rains a lot, but today we are dealing with a new phenomenon, climate change, which is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The sooner we learn to deal with it, the better. Our cities are the area most at risk, because that is where the majority of the European population lives. It is our duty first and foremost to protect human lives and our historical and cultural heritage, because in Europe we have the honour of hosting almost 400 UNESCO sites. A wealth that every European citizen feels as his own and for which he is willing to mobilize, as happened in the flood of 1966 in Florence, when boys and girls, then called \"angels of mud\", came from all over the continent to save the works of art, manifesting a first form of European civicism. The question then is: what can Europe do? Increasing aid from the European Solidarity Fund is needed, but it is no longer enough, just as ex post mechanisms are not enough. We can't act every time in the damage count. We need to prevent catastrophic effects first, and that is what I want to focus on. Let's start by saying that we have built too much and badly in our cities. We must start from a great cultural battle, even before the environmental battle, over the consumption and protection of the soil and put the debate on the need for a specific European Union directive back at the centre. In addition, tragedies are avoided if environmental mitigation works are done: one does not expect the river to flood but to build expansion crates and hydraulic regination works. So the sustainable investment plan, which we are waiting for from President von der Leyen, must contain an ad hoc chapter for hydrogeological prevention. Finally, the time has come to open a serious debate on the possibility of offing green investment from the deficit-GDP calculation of the Stability and Growth Pact. On the consequences of extreme weather, the European Union must show its citizens that it is capable of setting an agenda and putting it into practice.

Madam President, Commissioner, Venice is now sinking. Indeed, the phenomenon of acqua alta is intensifying, floods are multiplying, are always more frequent and ever higher. What for? Because for too long we no longer respect the identity of this city that has given itself the sea as a bulwark. The lagoon no longer protects because it is no longer protected. Already, in 2016, the organization Europa Nostra ranked the Venice Lagoon first among the most endangered European sites. If nothing is done to finally complete the floating project that was planned for 2001, Unesco will remove Venice from the World Heritage list. For sixty years, the lagoon of Venice has been undermined by oversized maritime traffic to allow the passage of tankers and also to promote mass tourism. However, if the Heritage disappears, the tourist windfall will also disappear. We Europeans have the opportunity to save Venice and, in the future, to protect the threatened sites. Let us therefore make the protection of our cultural heritage an all part of the European Green Pact. Europe already has successes to its credit, such as Mont Saint-Michel. The European Union, through the Regional Development Fund, has provided EUR 10 million to restore its maritime character to this place, by enshrining it in a sustainable tourism approach. Preserving cultural heritage also means protecting the ecosystems in which they are located, promoting the development of responsible tourism that will ensure the maintenance of activity and employment.

So it is happening now – exactly what climate scientists have warned about. Heat waves are getting longer and warmer, the torrential rains are getting more intense. Periods of drought are also becoming longer and more intense, and thus also increase the risk of forest fires. The seas are rising, just as we see in Venice now. What is happening in Venice now will happen again, more and more often in the future. So far, the world's oceans are only rising by three millimetres per year. It sounds quite a bit, but it will accelerate and it will last for centuries or even millennia to come. Unfortunately, there are simply some things that we can no longer avoid. It's gone too far. That is why we need to work very intensively on climate adaptation, not least with regard to our coasts and all the major cities and ports that lie on our coasts.

True, bad weather has affected several regions of Italy. Today, here in Strasbourg, I express my deep affection for all the people affected and for my land. Venice, however, is unique and belongs not only to the Italian State but to the whole of Europe and the whole world. Venice collects western humanism and eastern humanism, the historical stratification of its monuments, with its imposing St. Mark's Basilica, heavily damaged by this new flood. Seeing Venice wounded and annihilated by the water that invaded it everywhere was a real blow to the heart. Wounded but proudly always with his head held high, as it is in the character of the Venetians: proud, hardworking and never tame. The words of a poem say: \"From the overwhelmed water, from the betrayed sea, once again Venice is wounded\", and then \"Venice, you are alone!\". They also say, \"But the sunrise is near, the day wants you, be strong, Regina, that the sun will come\". Today we have to show that Venice is not alone. Venice needs everyone, it needs Europe. Venice with its territory, with the islands of the Lido and Pellestrina, with the reality of Chioggia and the coast. Well, today I am here to represent, as a Venetian, the high cry of pain that has been raised and that Europe must collect, without wasting time because the further we go, the greater the risks. This time Europe must not turn its head the other way. It is essential that not only messages of solidarity but concrete interventions, certain interventions, with mechanisms that make them immediate and more responsive, start. The work of civil protection, firefighters and volunteers, the expectations and needs of citizens and economic operators demand speed and immediacy from this Europe. The Solidarity Fund must be reviewed today because it is complex in its activation.

Even in 19th-century works of art, for which we are responsible as citizens of Europe and the world, such evidence can be found.

Global greenhouse gases continue to increase, despite efforts to try to limit them. Europe has decided to move towards a green new deal, but its vision must be global and indeed very ambitious. The European states must, in fact, become an example of how development and environmental protection can go hand in hand. Europe can and must become a point of reference and a model of success for newly industrialised states that continue to increase their emissions of polluting gases. And it can only do so by putting in place successful actions, with major investments in green conversion.

Now it is the case that we are already used to dealing with extreme weather conditions in the mountains, and also know what to do then. It must also be said that if in the last few days the damage has been somewhat contained, it is also thanks to the thousands of volunteers – the fire brigades, the civil protection units – who have worked day and night, bringing electricity and water back to people and trying to get to grips with the worst damage.

There is no doubt that Venice is a cultural capital. It’s an iconic city. You look at the Renaissance architecture and all that it has given to Europe in terms of history, politics and culture. So, from that perspective, I do want to convey my deepest sympathies.  Of course, we have to acknowledge that global warming and rising sea levels are now a factor that continually threaten our coastal areas, so Venice is just a symbol of what is happening across the globe. Couple that with the fact that most major cities are in confluences or deltas and coastal areas would indicate that we’re going to face these challenges on a continual basis. The European Union and individual Member States will have to accept and address this particular issue of rising sea levels and how they protect our cities and towns from flooding. From that perspective, I can understand how people in Venice feel, owing to the fact that my own city of Cork in Ireland has experienced flooding on a regular basis.

The images of these storms are striking and show us the need to put in place more effective response mechanisms to deal with natural disasters and protect our cultural heritage. In France, heavy rains across the region over the weekend caused huge damage. Last weekend, I was on a mission and returned Sunday evening to my town, Villeneuve-Loubet in the Alpes-Maritimes, which was totally flooded. The area was hit by a heavy rain on Saturday night and residents were surprised by a sudden rise in water. Despite the existence of a retention pond, the river in my village, the Wolf, overflowed at an impressive rate, causing major flooding. We cannot ignore the fact that because of global warming, the temperature of the Mediterranean water has increased, increasing the frequency and intensity of storms. In the face of these events, cultural heritage is increasingly exposed to natural disasters. Appropriate measures are needed to reduce the risk of disaster. Thus, an integrated vision of cultural heritage is needed to assess the risks to heritage sites before and after a disaster. In addition, integrated disaster risk management involves adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies. For example, there is a need to curb the limitless urban sprawl and the artificialization of soils that make them less permeable.

In the area of Kinetta, with last year's large fires, this is the third time that the same houses of the fire-affected people, who have not even been compensated for the previous disasters, have flooded. Extensive damage has recently occurred in Crete, Evia, Halkidiki, Thassos, Ionian, Rhodes, Peloponnese, Western Greece and elsewhere, and require immediate compensation and restoration projects. In conflict with European Union policy, we demand that those affected now be compensated and that immediate measures be taken against flood defences, civil protection, infrastructure, personnel, with integrated state scientific planning.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 178, "date": "2019-11-26.json", "name": "Sabine Verheyen (PPE).", "mepid": "96756", "text": "   Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Floods, storms, severe fires, but also earthquakes and landslides and other natural disasters are constantly endangering our cultural heritage. Venice, the unesco World Heritage site, was hit by an extraordinary flood in the first weeks of November when the water reached 1.80 metres high. There is also severe severe weather in other parts of Italy. Matera, this year's European Capital of Culture, was also flooded. It was the worst flooding in more than 50 years and, to this extent, not a recurring event. Venice declared a state of emergency and the Italian government pledged €20 million in emergency aid to repair the immediate damage. But it is still difficult to quantify how much damage is actually done. St. Mark's Square, home of St. Mark's Basilica, many museums and cultural monuments, as well as the Venice Biennale, were under water, and the salt water alone caused enormous damage to the cultural sites. The floods are a stab in the heart of Italy, said Italy's Prime Minister, but it is also a stab in the heart for us Europeans, because a primal European task is to protect our cultural assets, and we do so in many places. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has proposed to the Commission the creation of a fund for the protection of the EU's cultural heritage to ensure the preservation of our most valuable historical treasures and to ensure that Europe stands behind its Member States when natural disasters hit them hard. The purpose of this fund is to restore and preserve our cultural heritage, which is threatened and damaged by natural disasters, for future generations.

Extremely high temperatures lead to a significant deterioration of the indoor environment of buildings, overheating, an increase in air conditioning systems, especially in urban agglomerations. In an urbanised environment, the impact of the so-called thermal island of the city should be prevented or reduced by supporting lower albedo surfaces, increasing, for example, the proportion of vegetation areas with soil, the use of water elements and slower water drainage from the urban environment.

The problem of disasters has already been the subject of resolutions by this Parliament on several occasions. It is necessary to follow up due to the recommendations and to pass them on to practice. This is the case with the creation of a financial framework appropriate to disaster prevention which allows, among other measures, the correction of risk-inducing situations. Unfortunately, very little has been done and the European Commission has particular responsibility for this delay.

I would like to say that, once again, recent events in Venice show us that climate change is real, is happening now and is not fake news.  So, at the same time, we need two approaches: a strategic approach called the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and, of course, prevention and preparedness. What we tried to do in the former Commission was what Ms Zovko has already said, rescEU, and thank you so much for your kind words. Yes, we tried to establish and to upgrade the European civil protection mechanism through rescEU in order to deal with natural disasters efficiently and effectively. But we have only taken one first step. We need more and more. So it’s your responsibility, as the European Parliament, to go beyond, as we have already done as the former Commission.  Thank you so much for your support. It is a common achievement, but my sincere advice, through the last five years of experience, is that you have to go beyond the first step in the rescEU field. Otherwise, we will face a lot of problems because the new phenomena due to climate change is so complicated and complex. Nobody can deal with this phenomena alone because it is so complicated. At the same time, many of you already insist on solidarity. Yes, solidarity is the fundamental principle for our Union and this is why, now, some rescue teams, through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, are running and are in action in Albania in order to save lives. I’m really proud of these institutions because the European Union can provide solidarity in very difficult circumstances.  At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity to say more about our EU initiatives that will help us address the challenge over the years to come. First, disaster risk management is vital, in particular for our cohesion policy. Local and regional authorities are the first to face the impact of disasters. Investing in risk management is cost-effective; it prevents future losses and it contributes to sustainable development. Over the period 2014-2020, cohesion policy is investing almost EUR 2 billion in climate change adaptation and risk prevention. As I said, prevention is the main focus of our investment, with actions to improve the modelling of risk, early warning systems, the preparation of strategies and guidelines, etc. In this period we have also seen a large focus on green infrastructure to manage risks. Furthermore, under the Urban Agenda for the European Union, the Partnership on Climate Adaptation coordinated by the City of Genoa is implementing ten actions to anticipate climate change and take appropriate measures to prevent or minimise the damage it can cause to urban areas. The Commission has also launched the European Natural Hazard Scientific Partnership, a network of scientific European institutions and international organisations that monitor natural hazards. They are ready 24/7 to support the European Commission and our Emergency Response Coordination Centre. Besides prevention, we also focus on preparedness with support for equipment, infrastructure and training of civil protection units. We offer flexibility in our programmes. Programme amendments can be proposed and swiftly agreed to shift resources towards areas that are most in need. So, if changes need to be made, we can still do this within this funding period. The second point is that we are promoting initiatives to mitigate the impact of climate change on cultural heritage. That is in particular the case with the support of the Horizon 2020 Programme with climate action, mitigating the impacts of climate change and natural hazards on cultural heritage. At the initiative of the Commission, 27 European countries agreed to work closely together to advance the digitisation of Europe’s cultural heritage in a Declaration of Cooperation launched in April 2019.   The Commission has also been funding the use of digital technologies for the preservation and restoration of cultural heritage. The latest initiative includes a future European Competence Centre for the preservation and conservation of European cultural heritage by using ICT technologies, under Horizon 2020 once again. The intersection between cultural heritage and climate change has also been under the spotlight during the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018 with the report ‘Safeguarding cultural heritage from natural and man-made disasters’.  In the same vein, the European Framework for Action on Cultural Heritage includes a focus on protecting cultural heritage against natural disasters and climate change. In 2021, a group of experts from EU Member States will analyse and share innovative policy measures for heritage sites to mitigate the impact of climate change. With the support, of course, of Horizon 2020, the Commission is investing some EUR 18 million in this field.  So the list of what the European Union is doing to protect our communities against the disastrous impact of natural disasters, but also to preserve our cultural heritage, is long. No doubt much more remains to be done. I know and am sure that we can count on your support and your initiatives in order to be more effective and more efficient.  Thank you so much for your attention and for this very constructive discussion.

I would like to express my strong concerns on this. As you know, the European Commission has been closely monitoring the developments and the accounts of recent events that have reached to the Commission are very worrying.  Particularly last July an equality march organised in the Polish city of Białystok that was intended to be peaceful was met with an avalanche of verbal and physical violence and hate speech directed at the participants. LGBT free zone stickers were distributed by a Polish newspaper. Moreover, several Polish regional and local authorities have adopted declarations, statements or resolutions, banning LGBTI community postulates as an ideology, and declaring their territories ‘LGBT unwelcome’. All this is occurring in a climate of rising anti-LGBTI rhetoric in the run-up to the Polish parliamentary election that took place last month. The European Commission strongly condemns these developments. Any form of discrimination, intolerance or violence based on sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, goes against the fundamental values of the European Union that are founded in Article II of the Treaty. In addition, Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has the same legal values as the Treaties, prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and sex. Some of the Polish authorities that have adopted anti-LGBTI resolutions, declarations or statements, are managing authorities or beneficiaries of operational programmes supported by the EU Structural and Investment Funds, and on 23 October this year, the Commission met with Polish authorities in the framework of an annual review meeting of the regional operational programmes that are financed or co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund and we stressed the need to respect EU law, including the Charter, in the implementation of these programmes, particularly the principle of non-discrimination. By issuing anti-LGBTI resolutions, declarations or statements, Polish managing authorities and beneficiaries of the EU Structural Investment Funds raise doubts of their ability to ensure respect of the Charter. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation in Poland, and we will engage with Poland to make sure incidents of this kind never happen again. Discrimination, violence and hate speech against the LGBTI community must be stopped in the European Union.  Thank you very much for this possibility to have the debate. I’m looking forward to your questions.

Insult, desecration, attempt to desecrate perhaps the most sacred image for Christians, which is the image of the Mother of God. Isn't that discrimination and hate speech? After all, such acts encourage further brutal attacks on Christians, attacks on priests, the lioning of symbols sacred to Catholics.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for This is not a debate on Poland, but it is a debate about what is happening in Poland right now. What is going on is no longer a form of discrimination, as a colleague said earlier here, but it is persecution. We have local and regional representatives and parliaments who adopt declarations and programmes when they talk about 'LGBTQ-free zones' and state that only Christian, heterosexual couples should be allowed to exist. I quote in English: We express our disapproval and disagreement for attempts to promote LGBT ideology, which is against natural law and against our long traditional values and our Christian morality.   This is, to me, a form of persecution. In particular, these anti-LGBTQ forces want to use school as an institution and ban it from promoting the human rights of LGBTQ people or young people's right to free sexuality. I think that most people in here and most people who listen to us at home also understand how dangerous it is for many of us when public representatives and parliaments pronounce and then legitimise a type of hatred and a type of oppression like this.

This was dictated by religious beliefs that, 40 years ago, in my country were dominant. I didn’t believe that one day I would be confronted with that again. It took me almost half a lifetime to liberate myself from that. And yes, it goes on. It is an ideology – of course it is – on the concepts of gender and family. This is what it is all about and the agenda has been hijacked by politicians, by nationalists and populists that want to use it in autocratic regimes, not only in Poland. We see the same narrative in Russia, in Turkey and in other countries around the world. It has not only to do with LGBT persecution, it also has to do with the fight against gender equality and sexual and reproductive rights. it is all connected.

Answering the question on Lithuania: the Commission is aware of a draft law on equal treatment currently pending in the Lithuanian Parliament and related amendments which fail to extend a list of grounds for prohibited discrimination, not including gender identity as such, which might result in transgender individuals having no legal mechanism effectively securing them against possible discrimination in a variety of spheres, such as education or work. We cannot comment on draft laws, but we are looking at this very closely, and we will act if there is EU competence to act. The Commission has, during the last year, support different actions and initiatives in several member countries to improve tolerance and social acceptance of LGBTI persons. There was a conference some weeks ago with the Commission and the Finnish Presidency to take stock of what has been done and what can be done further as well. Exactly what will be done will, of course, be for the next Commission to define in this regard. As you know, in the area of employment, there is a directive prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and the Commission proposed more than ten years ago to expand that scope, also covering other grounds for discrimination based on sexual orientation in education, social security, social protection and access to and supply of goods and services. You know very well that negotiations have been going on for a very long time in Council, but the required unanimity has not yet been forthcoming. This is not an ideological discussion. It is about the rights of LGBTI people and the obligation of Poland to respect and to protect them. As I said in my introduction, the Commission strongly condemns the developments in Poland when it comes to hate speech, declarations of so-called ‘LGBTI-free zones’ and the attacks against LGBTI people, especially under the election campaign. We will very soon – in a couple of days in fact – celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I think it is very important to defend the fundamental values of the EU and, unfortunately, even 10 years after, we are standing here today. All Member States have signed up to these values and have signed up to respect them. It is a fundamental value to love whom you want and to be respected for that, and to be who you want. Discrimination, intolerance and violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity are against these fundamental values. I can assure you that in the future, the Commission and my friend and colleague Commissioner Jourová – who has been very engaged in these questions and who will be incoming Vice—President responsible for the rule of law – will continue to engage and fight for LGBTI rights in Poland and elsewhere.

Honourable Members: thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the debate ahead of the vote on a resolution later this week. I am, of course, very concerned about the recent imposition of tariffs by the US on a range of our agri-food exports. I know from direct contacts that you are too. This imposition by the US on tariffs on food and drink is a regrettable development. Although the US have formally the legal right to impose these tariffs for a long, long time the Commission has been engaging with the US to ask them to freeze or to suspend this in order to find a negotiated solution to the Boeing-Airbus dispute. We made a credible offer in July for a negotiated settlement. As you know, this is a case that has been going on for many, many years. Unfortunately, this opportunity has not been taken up by the US yet.  We believe that it’s time to turn the page on this dispute and focus on de-escalating tensions rather than adding further uncertainty to a delicate world-trade and economic situation. I hope that goodwill will still prevail. We are committed to finding a solution which will keep trade flowing and for workers on both sides of the Atlantic to be able to keep their jobs. This has been the aim during my mandate and I’m convinced that Phil Hogan will continue these efforts. He will go to Washington in early New Year and continue to engage with members of the US administration.  The four EU Member States where Airbus manufacturing is concentrated – the UK, France, Germany and Spain, together with Italy and Ireland – account for 95% of the total food exports of the EUR 3.5 billion exposed to the tariffs. The target products, in order of magnitude, range from wines, spirit, liqueurs, dairy products and olive oils. These products are highly valued by US consumers, and we hope that the demand from them will help resist price pressures.  Addressing directly the calls made in your draft resolution: there are measures available under the CAP that could be used to mitigate the impact of sanctions in the market. We are reviewing the appropriateness of direct intervention at this stage, because you have to take into account a number of considerations. For instance, we need to clearly distinguish between difficulties that are directly related to the US tariffs and those which are related to other issues. For instance, we recently introduced private storage aid for virgin olive oils in the EU, open for all olive oil-producing Member States. The US tariffs have certainly aggravated a very serious situation, but the underlying reasons for the introduction of these measures are not directly related to the Airbus case. We also need to take account of a wider development of the WTO in relation to the US measures, including the possibilities that the Boeing case will present later next year. But our first preference remains a negotiated settlement because we would thereby avoid a damaging trade dispute, and we would also provide a powerful signal to the world market that we want to keep world trade flowing.  When it comes to the specific measures that we could take, promotion policies are often a very appropriate response to tariff sanctions, offering operators the possibility to consolidate the market or to retain their position on existing markets, or even to seek new opportunities, and you mentioned this in your resolution.  The recently adopted 2020 annual work programme emphasises promotion campaigns in third markets by allocating almost two thirds of the available funding to them – that is EUR 180 million. In response to the concerns expressed by some of you here in relation to the US tariff impact on wine: Commissioner Hogan last week confirmed that he is providing greater flexibility in the implementation and management of promotion operations. This seems to be an appropriate response to market disturbances which are likely to affect the wine sector. This flexibility includes a proposal to increase the Union’s financing rate for promotion to 60%, instead of 50% today, which will alleviate the financial burden on producers.  The Commission has reacted rapidly to the urgency and seriousness of the situation and we hope that we can count on your support to ensure a smooth and swift adoption of the required regulation so that this flexibility can be applied quickly, to the benefit of our producers. Other than our promotion policy, the CAP toolbox also includes certain market management instruments such as private storage.  The Commission is aware that additional measures might have to be considered following the conclusions of the analysis that we’re right now doing on the situation of the agriculture markets. We do this with the sectors and with the Member States concerned. And where the analysis suggests we should, we are ready to activate exceptional market measures including private storages. In the meantime, I want to assure you that in this Commission and the incoming Commission, myself and my friend and colleague Phil Hogan will do our best to find a negotiated, balanced, sustainable and compatible solution with the WTO rules, and one that would put an end to the damage suffered by European farmers, including our wine producers.

And I do not say this, says the sectors concerned themselves, those who know their products best, those who know sales best and, at the same time, the impact they are suffering from the imposition of these tariffs. They are already beginning to lose their sales, their contracts, and foresees the loss of thousands of jobs, especially in rural areas, where there are few job alternatives.  They see in frustration how so many years and decades of effort to have that leadership they had gained in the American market are being thrown away overboard.  But today I want to bring your voice to Parliament and communicate to the Commission the main message they have sent us: Commissioner, they do not want aid or short-term solutions. They simply want tariffs to go away. They want to be allowed to remain competitive. And they want to stop paying for the broken dishes for all the trade agreements and disputes that occur. It would be unforgivable for us to consent to farmers being punished for a problem in another sector that has absolutely nothing to do with.

I assume that they think this will be a victimless tariff; it will not. Young male unemployment in rural Scotland is about 20%.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, once again it is the farmers who are paying the bill for a trade dispute that does not concern them. The WTO has decided in the dispute between Boeing and Airbus. The latter received undeclared subsidies of 6.8 billion euros per year. President Donald Trump has therefore intentionally chosen to overtax European food products by 25%: French wines, Italian cheeses, Scotch whiskies, Spanish olive oils, the list is not exhaustive. These invisible subsidies, which are never talked about, have allowed this company to flourish. In April 2019, she wrote a cheque for 33 million euros to her CEO when he left office. In 2018, these disguised subsidies have increased dividends paid to shareholders by 10%. The icing on the cake is that Airbus has moved its headquarters to the Netherlands to pay less tax. Airbus therefore has the kidneys strong enough to support European farmers and the agricultural sector who are ousted from the American market overnight. I therefore ask the European Commission to work towards the establishment of a fund of responsibility and solidarity, abounded by the Member States of this consortium and, of course, by Airbus, which no one disputes that it is a flagship of our industry.

I draw two lessons from this case. Firstly, the European Union is incapable of defending our trade interests. It made a big mistake in violating WTO rules, which it had accepted. Once again, it is the French farmers who will have to pay for its incompetence when they have no responsibility for condemning the WTO. Secondly, the Brussels Commission is a bad negotiator. It had at least one argument to persuade Donald Trump to waive these sanctions, namely that it should have subordinated its decision to import 35,000 tons of American beef per year to a gesture of goodwill from the United States, but the Commission dropped everything without any consideration.

It would be the most logical thing in the world that either Airbus would have to repay this money or, if there are already tariffs, that these duties would then be passed on to that company's products. But no, the soup can be spooned out, at least in part, by making it more difficult for farmers to enter the market for agricultural products in the United States. It is also a problem that farmers are being incited against each other because different products are subject to different tariffs in different Member States, which is, of course, a problem in the internal market. In fact, there should be a huge outcry in Europe. But it does not really exist, and I have the impression that this solution does not really suit the industry very badly. The farmers then have to pay a part. It is now also a bit easy to say: yes, then we will just see that agricultural products are sold somewhere else.  I must now say quite honestly that as soon as there was a threat that European cars would be subject to tariffs in the United States, we did not tell the car manufacturers that you would get a bit of money so that you could sell the cars tomorrow in Nigeria or Saudi Arabia.

As you know, this is an old dispute between the EU and the US –Airbus/Boeing. It has been going on for 15 years. There’s a huge room of papers on only this case in Geneva, and it has certainly paid the wages of many lawyers. WTO has found that both the EU and the US have been guilty of giving unauthorised subsidies to Boeing and Airbus. This gives the formal right to the US now – and to us a little bit later, next year – to impose tariffs. We have made it very clear to the US that we are preparing such a list as well, to have if it is needed.  However, as many of you have said, we already have too many tariffs in this world, and that is why we have been pushing for a negotiated solution. We have provided quite detailed elements of what we could do on both sides for existing, past and future subsidies in this area. Some subsidies have been allowed; some have been condemned; some have disappeared; some are in the process of being disappeared. But it has, of course, to be a balanced process which both Boeing and Airbus dismantles, and this is a process that we have asked the Americans to engage in. I have raised it personally with Ambassador Lighthizer several times. I know that Member States, some of you and others have passed on the same message, so we have been perfectly united there. We have also proposed that, apart from disciplining ourselves, we should set global standards, because the big problem in the future will be other big economies who are already today massively subsidising their civil aircraft. If we could put some global standards here, it would be useful. Unfortunately, the US has not, at this point, been willing to engage. We will keep on pushing, of course, but so far that has not been possible and we are here today, stuck with tariffs that are, of course, disproportionately – and that is totally deliberate from the US side – affecting the agricultural sector. I am aware – and so is Phil Hogan and the whole Commission – of the social and economic difficulties in sectors, in regions, and whole countries that this is causing. This is serious and it is urgent. That is why, since quite some time, we are assessing the situation.  As I said in my introduction, there are several tools at our disposal. Some have already been announced: flexibility and promotion. There might be others as well, but we need to be totally clear on what we do, what the consequences of the US tariffs and the consequences of other market distortions or other problems are, because we need to be able to design targeted, effective measures, and they need to be WTO compliant. That is what we are doing right now.  I would like to firmly reject the notion that the trade policy has been a disadvantage for the agriculture market. On the contrary, there are several independent reports proving that the latest trade deals that we have done with Japan, with Canada and now with Singapore, which is entering into force, and also future agreements with Vietnam, Mercosur and Mexico, are and will be hugely beneficial to the European agriculture sector. We’re opening up new markets for products that are highly in demand from all over the world, and this is, of course, also very important for agriculture. Having said that, I do not in any way want to diminish the problems that farmers and the agricultural and wine sectors are facing here today, and this is why our services in this Commission and the coming Commission will finalise the study and the analysis and come back to you and the Member States.

I would like to thank the European Parliament for taking the initiative to have a resolution on the Appellate Body crisis. It is very timely indeed, and it sends a powerful message to the world and to certain recipients, that the European Parliament is fully on board and that we speak with one strong voice here in Europe. We are approaching, as you know, the moment when there will be only one Appellate Body member left. This is because of the US blockade of the arbitrators. This will undermine the whole WTO dispute settlement system, and, with the Appellate Body paralysed, there will be no access to binding independent two-step dispute settlement in the WTO. This is not a technical matter. This is highly political. What is at stake is the rule of law in international trade relations. Either we have a system where rules can be enforced, where trade disputes can be submitted to adjudicators – even if we don’t always like the result – and where rulings of ad hoc panels can be appealed before standing appeal instance that gives a guarantee of quality and independence, or we will slip into a power-based economic relationship. The European Union – and I think I can count you all in – have made a choice: we support a rule-based multilateral trading system, because that benefits our citizens, our companies, and it creates a predictable structure and a good environment to operate in and to flourish. It promotes growth and creates jobs, and it contributes to orderly international relations. And we want the United States to be part of this system. They helped to create the system, and they have also benefited quite a lot from it. And, therefore, in the last two years, the European Union, together with other countries as well, have led the efforts to resolve the impasse relating to the Appellate Body. This is not a dispute between the EU and the US. This is a dispute between the 163 members of the WTO and the US. Everybody is dependent on this body, even if not all WTO members are frequent users of the system, they depend on a system where it functions. We have previously made proposals to reform the Appellate Body in order to try to address some of the concerns that the US had voiced, because the Appellate Body could function in a better and more efficient way, that is true. And we have also initiated discussions in the General Council of the WTO to see how this impasse can be resolved. We have demonstrated an open, constructive approach, and we have also supported the work of the facilitator, Ambassador Walker, who leads the work in Geneva in this in order to try to unblock appointments to the body. Alas, despite all these efforts, the Appellate Body will very likely come to a halt on 11 December, and that’s why we need to send this very clear message of determination. We will do what it takes to preserve a binding, independent, two-step system of dispute resolution in the WTO. So we will continue to support all the efforts that lead to an unblocking, and we will also continue after it has come to an end in December. So we must prepare and deploy contingency measures that would preserve the right of the EU to the resolution of trade disputes in a binding, two-level, independent, impartial adjudication, even if appointments remain blocked. And that is why we are seeking an interim appeal of arbitration between trade partners as a stop-gap to ensure that our disputes continue to be adjudicated. This is not an alternative system, creating a new normal without the US. It’s an ad hoc solution with certain partners, hopefully leading to a plurilateral system that can work to create some clarity and some predictability for our companies. We hope, of course, that this will only be temporary. We owe that to our companies and to our citizens, because they are the ones benefiting from this system. So you can trust in the Commission – and here we are very grateful for the strong support from the European Parliament, as well as all the Member States – to keep on fighting until the end of the year to see if anything can be done to unblock the situation.

Commissioner, as you can see, there’s a broad consensus in this Parliament on this topic. Let there be no doubt: for our political group it’s essential to find a solution within the WTO. However, we should not be naive. There’s a chance – and it’s up to our people to make sure that we can get a good look at it – that the US will not engage constructively in finding a solution. The Trump administration wants to use the Appellate Body crisis to change some of their long-standing irritations about the way the WTO functions. This is quite a cynical position of the US today. Think about the Airbus case and their tariffs, but also about the new case that they are bringing against India. It seems that President Trump does not want to have the cake, but still eat the cake.  However, having a workable Appellate Body can also be of benefit for the United States, but if the States are not willing to unblock the appointment of the judges, we should stand ready to look for alternative solutions and stand firm on these issues. I’m quite sure that we’ll also find a united Parliament to do so. International trade is much too important to be managed by the law of the jungle, instigated by large trading partners taking advantage of smaller ones.

In line with President Trump's \"America first\" policy, the UNITED States has been blocking the appointment of members of the WTO dispute settlement body for some time.

That is why we must also continue to stand up for the value of trading with each other in a rules-based way. Now it is more important than ever that europe does not respond with the same coin, but stands for its principles.

It has helped to strengthen the rules-based international legal order with, by the way, the United States as one of its major beneficiaries. Today, this legal order is under threat.

For that reason I call on the Commission to intensify its engagement in order to unblock the appointments procedure as a matter of priority, like we should do in this House.
