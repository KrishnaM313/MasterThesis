Mr President, Madam President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes history moves with discretion and steps and takes leave quickly. This is the case when it comes to the action of a Commission, which has only a five-year mandate to make a permanent change. But in such a short period of time, you can't change things for good. The current Commission, like its predecessors, is an episode, a brief moment in the long history of the European Union. The time for the final review of the Commission that I chair has not yet come, so I will not give you a review today of what we have been able to do over the past four years. On the contrary, I am telling you that work continues for the coming months, to make the European Union imperfect, a more perfect European Union every day. There are still things to do, and that is what I would like to talk to you about this morning. No complacency, no bulging torso, modesty and hard work, this is the attitude that the Commission will make its own, this is our agenda for the coming months. Sometimes history, history in the true sense of the word, invites itself into the life of nations without notice, and is slow to leave it. This was the case at the time of the Great War, which in 1914 took the continent by surprise, so was sunny, calm, peaceful, optimistic the year 1913. In 1913, Europeans expected to live in peace for a long time, yet a fratricidal war swept across Europe the following year. I am referring to this period, not that I believe that we are on the threshold of another catastrophe in Europe. The European Union is a guarantor of peace. Let us be happy to live on a continent of peace, a continent that knows peace thanks to the European Union. (Applause) So let us respect the European Union better, let us not sully its image, defend our way of being and our way of life, say yes to patriotism which is not directed against others, say no to the overrated nationalism that rejects and hates others, that destroys, that seeks culprits instead of looking for solutions that allow us to live better together. (Applause) The founding pact of the European Union, 'never again war', remains a burning demand, a burning obligation of vigilance that is required in and around us. Ladies and gentlemen, what is the state of the European Union today, in 2018? Ten years after Lehman Brothers, Europe has largely turned the page on the economic and financial crisis, which came to us from elsewhere and which hit us in a very often brutal way. The European Union has experienced uninterrupted growth over the past 21 quarters. Employment is picking up steam, with nearly 12 million jobs created since 2014. Twelve million jobs is more than the population of Belgium. Never before have so many people - 239 million men and women - been to work in Europe. Youth unemployment stands at 14.8%: this figure remains too high but is at its lowest level since 2000. Investment is back in Europe, thanks in part to our European Fund for Strategic Investments, which some, increasingly rare, continue to call the Juncker Plan, a plan that has generated 335 billion euros in public and private investment, and we are on our way to 400 billion. And then there's Greece. After years, it must be said, painful, after unprecedented serious social problems, Greece has managed to carry out its programme and get back on its feet. I welcome, once again, the Herculean efforts of the Greek people, efforts which other Europeans continue to underestimate. (Applause) I have always defended - and you know - Greece, its dignity, its role in Europe, and in particular its continued existence in the euro area. I'm still proud of it. Europe has also reaffirmed its status as a trading power. Our global trading power is nothing more than proof of the need to share our sovereignty. The European Union now has trade agreements with 70 countries. Together, we account for 40% of global GDP. These agreements, I am talking about trade agreements, very often, and often wrongly, disputed, help us to export high European standards of food safety, workers' rights, environmental issues and consumer rights to other parts of the world. When, last July, during a long and dangerous period of international tension, I visited Beijing, Tokyo and Washington the same week, I was able to speak, as President of the Commission, on behalf of the largest single market in the world, on behalf of a Union that accounts for one-fifth of economy, on behalf of a Union ready to defend its values and defend its interests. I represented Europe as an open continent, but not as a continent offered. With the European unity that I have been able to set out in principle and in detail, I have been able to make the voice of the European Union heard in order to achieve concrete results for our citizens and for our businesses. United, we Europeans have, as a Union, become an unavoidable force. In Washington, I spoke on behalf of Europe. Some describe the agreement, the arrangement I was able to get after my negotiations with President Trump, as a surprise. However, there was no surprise because every time Europe speaks with one voice, there is no surprise. If she wants and if she speaks with one voice, she can impose herself on others. Europe, where necessary, must act as one man. We proved this when we have consistently defended the Paris climate agreement, because we Europeans want to leave a cleaner planet for the next generations. I share our Energy Commissioner's analysis of the 2030 CO2 reduction targets. They are scientifically accurate and politically necessary. This summer's droughts were a stark reminder, not just to farmers, of the importance of our efforts to ensure the safeguarding and future of future generations. (Applause) Of course, we may not want to see the climate challenge and look elsewhere. We, the Commission, and you, Parliament, must look to the future. Ladies and gentlemen, the world, which keeps turning, has become more volatile than ever. The external challenges facing our continent are multiplying day by day. We cannot, therefore, relax, even for a second, our efforts to build a more united and stronger Europe. Europe can export its stability, as we have done with the successive enlargements of our Union. Enlargements which, for me, are and remain successes, because we have managed to reconcile European geography and history. But more work needs to be done. (Applause) We must irrevocably define our attitude towards the countries of the Western Balkans with regard to their accession. Otherwise, others will shape our immediate neighbourhood. (Applause) Let's look around. What is happening, at this time, in Syria, in Idlib, must be a cause of deep and immediate concern for all of us. We cannot remain silent in the face of the impending humanitarian disaster which, in fact, is an announced disaster. The Syrian conflict illustrates how the international order, which Europeans have benefited from since the Second World War, is increasingly being called into question. For the rest, in today's world, Europe can no longer be assured that the commitments that were made yesterday will still be kept tomorrow. Yesterday's alliances may no longer be the alliances of tomorrow. I said, today's world needs a strong and united Europe, a Europe that works for peace, trade agreements and stable monetary relations, even if others elsewhere are too inclined to choose trade wars or even money. In fact, I do not like this unilateralism disrespectful of the expectations and hopes of others. I will always remain a convinced multilateralist. (Applause) If Europe were to become more aware of its political power, the economic and sometimes military power of its nations, we could abandon the exclusive role of global payer, something that we want to stay in any case. We need to become more of a global player. Yes, we are global payers, but we have to be global players, too. That is why, despite strong resistance at the time, I relaunched the European Defence Union in 2014. That is why, in the coming months, the Commission will continue to work to ensure that the European Defence Fund and structured permanent defence cooperation become fully operational. (Applause) This is an important point for me in this place: we will not militarise the European Union. What we want is to become more responsible and independent, because only a strong and united Europe can protect our citizens from internal and external threats, from terrorism to climate change. Only a strong and united Europe can preserve jobs in an open and interconnected world. Only a strong and united Europe can master the challenges of global digitisation. We Europeans, because we are the largest single market in the world, can establish standards for big data for artificial intelligence, for automation, while defending our values, the rights and individuality of our citizens. We can do that if we are united. A strong and united Europe allows its Member States to win the stars. It is thanks to our Galileo programme that Europe remains in the race for space. No Member State, none, could have put into orbit 26 satellites that already benefit 400 million users worldwide. No Member State would have succeeded alone. Galileo, yes, is a success. A european success first, if not exclusively. Without Europe, no Galileo. Let's be proud of it. (Applause) Mr President, geopolitics tells us that the time for European sovereignty has finally come. It is time for Europe to take its destiny into its own hands. The time for Europe to develop what I have called its Weltpolitikf-higkeit. This ability to play our part in gaining influence in the course of world affairs. Europe must become more of a sovereign player in international relations. European sovereignty comes from the national sovereignty of our Member States. It does not replace what is unique to nations. Sharing our sovereignty where it is necessary makes each of our states and nations stronger. This conviction that we are greater is the essence of what it means to be part of the European Union. European sovereignty will never be directed against others. Europe must remain a continent of openness and tolerance, and it will remain so. Europe will never be a fortress turning its back on the world, especially the world that is suffering. Europe will never be an island, Europe must and will remain multilateral because the planet belongs to all and not just a few. (Applause) This is also the focus of the elections to the European Parliament, which will take place in May 2019. We will use the 250 days between us and the European elections to prove to our citizens that when we act together, the European Union can achieve results and that it respects the commitments we made at the beginning of this mandate. Between now and the European elections, we must demonstrate that Europe can overcome the differences between North and South, East and West. The European Union, Europe, is too small to divide one day in two, the next day in four. We must demonstrate that together, East, West, South and North, we can sow the seeds of a more sovereign Europe. Herr President, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren! Wenn wir im Mai 2019 zur Wahl schreiten, wird es die Bàrger Europas nicht interessieren, was die Kommission vorgeschlagen hat. Aber es wird sie in hohem Mae interessieren, dass die Internetgiganten dort Steuern zahlen, wo sie ihre Gewinne erwirtschaften.  (Beifall) Die Wàhler wollen - viele von Ihnen auch, nicht alle, wie ich wei, dass der diesbez-gliche Vorschlag der Kommission rasch zum Gesetz wird. Die, die das wollen, haben absolut recht. (Beifall) Wenn die Europeer 2019 wàhlen, wird sie weniger der gute Wille der Kommission begeistern, gegen Einwegplastik vorzugehen, um unsere Meere zu schotzen. Wenn wir die Europeer von uns selbst und von der Richtigkeit unseres Tuns erzeugen wollen, dann brauchen wir ein europeisches Gesetz, das das Plastikverbot zementiert. (Beifall) Wir alle erklàren, meistens in Sonntagsreden, dass wir in groen Fragen ehrgeiziger und in kleinen Fragen bescheidener sein sollten. Doch die Europeer werden im Mai 2019 nicht applaudieren, wenn wir weiterhin zweimal im Jahr aufgrund europeischer Regulierungen die Zeit umstellen messen. Die Zeitumstellung abgeschafft! (Beifall) Die Mitgliedstaaten - dies ist ein Gebot der Subsidiaritet - sollten selbst entscheiden, ob ihre Bàrger in der Sommer- oder in der Winterzeit leben sollen. Ich erwarte, dass Parlament und Rat dies ebenso sehen und dafar sorgen werden, dass regionale, binnenmarktkonforme Lsungen gefunden werden. Die Zeit drungt!  'berhaupt rufe ich uns alle dazu auf, in den kommenden Monaten eng zusammenzuarbeiten, damit wir das, was wir 2014 versprochen hatten, rechtzeitig vor der Europawahl einl-sen kunnen. Als wir angetreten sind, haben wir alle gemeinsam versprochen, einen innovativen digitalen Binnenmarkt, eine vertiefte Wirtschafts- und Wàhrungsunion, eine Bankenunion, eine Kapitalmarktunion, einen fairen Binnenmarkt, eine Energieunion mit einer zukunftsorientieren Klimapolitik, eine umfassende Migrations Und wir haben uns - jedenfalls die meisten von uns - vorgenommen, die soziale Dimension Europas nicht weiter stiefm-tterlich zu behandeln, sondern in Richtung Zukunft aufzustellen. Die Kommission hat alle Vorschlàge und Initiativen, die wir 2014 angek-ndigt haben, auf den Tisch gelegt. Die Hulfte davon wurde schon von Rat und Parlament verabschiedet. Zwanzig Prozent sind auf einem guten Weg, und drei-ig Prozent stecken in teilweise schwierigen Beratungen.  Meine Damen und Herren, ich akzeptiere nicht, dass die Kommission fer alle Versumnisse, die es selbstverst-ndlich gab, allein haftbar gemacht wird. Unsere Vorschlege sind bekannt, vor allem in Sachen Flichtlinge und Migration. Sie sollten angenommen und umgesetzt werden. Ich werde auch in Zukunft nicht zulassen, aber ich wei, es wird so kommen, dass die Kommission zum alleinigen Sàndenbock gemacht wird. Sündenböcke sitzen in allen Institutionen, die wenigsten davon in der Kommission und im Parlament. (Beifall) Fuhrung auf breitester Front bleibt angesagt. Dies trifft auch in puncto Vollendung unserer Sicherheitsunion zu. Die Europeer erwarten zu Recht, dass die European Union sie besch-tzt und schotzt. Deshalb schl-gt die Kommission heute neue Regeln vor, um terroristische Propaganda binnen einer Stunde aus dem Internet zu entfernen. Eine Stunde ist nemlich das entscheidende Zeitfenster, wàhrend dessen 'ffnung greter Schaden entstehen kann.  Zudem schlagen wir vor, die Aufgaben der neu geschaffenen Europ-ischen Staatsanwaltschaft auf die Bek-mpfung terroristischer Taten auszuweiten.  Wir messen Terroristen unionsweit und grenz-berschreitend verfolgen kunnen. Terroristen kennen keine Grenzen. Wir sollten uns nicht durch Nichtzusammenarbeit zu ihren Komplizen machen. Aus diesem Grund schlagen wir heute auch neue Maenahmen vor, um effektiv und grenz-berschreitend gegen Geldw-sche vorgehen zu kunnen. Genauso entschlossen messen wir vorgehen, um freie und make Wahlen in Europa sicherzustellen. Deshalb schl-gt die Kommission neue Regeln vor, um unsere demokratischen Prozesse gegen Manipulation durch Drittstaaten und auch - ja, das gibt es - gegen massiv geb-ndelte Privatinteressen abzusichern. (Beifall) Fuhrung und Kompromisswillen sind naturlich ganz besonders in Migrationsfragen dringend geboten. Wir haben yesterday mehr Fortschritte gemacht, als oft behauptet wird. Funf von sieben Kommissionsvorschlungen zur Neugestaltung unseres gemeinsamen europeischen Asylsystems wurden angenommen. Unsere Anstrengungen haben Erfolg gezeigt. Es gibt 97% weniger Flàchtlinge im 'stlichen Mittelmeerraum und um 80% weniger Flàchtlinge entlang der zentralen Mittelmeerroute. EU-Einsetze trugen seit 2015 zur Rettung von mehr als 690,000 Menschen auf hoher See bei. Allerdings haben die Mitgliedstaaten noch nicht das richtige Verh-ltnis zwischen Verantwortung eines jeden Landes fàr sein eigenes Hoheitsgebiet und der netigen Solidaritet untereinander gefunden. Diese Solidaritet messen die Mitgliedstaaten aber an den Tag legen, wenn sie den Schengen-Raum ohne Binnengrenzen erhalten wollen. (Beifall) Ich bin und bleibe gegen Binnengrenzen. Sie messen sleeps, wo es sie inzwischen wieder gibt, abgeschafft werden. Blieben sie erhalten, wre dies ein nicht akzeptabler R-ckschritt europeischen Seins und Werdens. (Beifall) Die Kommission und mehrere Ratspresidentschaften haben zahlreiche Vorschlàge zur Migration vorgelegt. Ich fordere die 'sterreichische Ratspresidentschaft auf - und sie wird es auch tun ', jetzt entscheidende Schritte einzuleiten, um zukunftsf-hige Lsungen fer eine ausgewogene Migrationsreform zu erarbeiten. Wir konnen nicht bei der Ankunft jedes neuen Schiffes weiter 'ber Ad-hoc-L'sungen fer die Menschen an Bord streiten. (Beifall) Ad-hoc-Lungen reichen nicht aus. Wir brauchen vielmehr mehr Gegenwarts- und Zukunftssolidaritit. Solidarity muss von Dauer sein, und sie muss auch organisiert werden. Wir brauchen auch mehr Solidaritet, weil wir mehr Effizienz brauchen. Dies trifft auch zu, wenn es darum geht, einen verst-rkten europeischen Katastrophenschutz in die Wege zu leiten. Wenn es in einem Land brennt, dann brennt es 'berall in Europa. Zu den eindrucksvollen Bildern des Sommers geh-ren nicht nur die Brende, sondern auch der Applaus, den vom Feuer bedrohte Schweden den solidarisch helfenden polnischen Feuerwehrleuten gespendet haben. Europe at its best! (Beifall) Zur-ck zur Migration. Wir legen heute einen Vorschlag zur St-rkung of the European Grenz- und Kostenschutzes vor. Au-engrenzen messen effizienter gesch-tzt werden. Deshalb schlagen wir vor, die Zahl europeischer Grenzschutzbeamter, die aus dem europeischen Haushalt finanziert werden, bis zum Jahr 2020 auf 10,000 Grenzsch-tzer zu erh-hen. Wir legen zudem einen Vorschlag zum Ausbau der Asylagentur der European Union vor. Mitgliedstaaten brauchen st-rkere europeische Unterst-tzung bei der Bearbeitung von Asylantr-gen - eine Bearbeitung, die im Einklang mit der Genfer Konvention zu stehen hat. Und wir legen einen Vorschlag vor, um die R-c-ckf-hrung irregul-r eingereister Migranten zu beschleunigen. Ich wiederhole hier im Parlament meinen Wunsch, der einer Aufforderung gleichkommt, legale Einwanderungswege in die European Union zu 'ffnen. (Beifall) Wir Brauchen qualifierzierte Migranten. Auch hierzu liegen die Kommissionsvorschlàge seit Langem auf dem Tisch - bitte umsetzen!  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk to you about the future, and therefore about our cousin continent of Africa. By 2050, Africa will have 2.5 billion people. One in four people will be African. We must invest more in our relations with this great and noble continent and its individual nations. And we must stop looking at this African-European relationship from the perspective of a development aid provider alone. Such an approach would be insufficient and, in fact, humiliating for Africa. (Applause) Africa does not need charity. It needs a balanced partnership, a real partnership. And we Europeans need this partnership, as well. In preparing this speech, I spoke with my African friends, including President Kagame, President of the African Union. We agreed that in the future, our respective commitments must be reciprocal. We want to build a new partnership with Africa. (Applause) The Commission is today proposing a new alliance between Africa and Europe, an alliance for investment and sustainable jobs. This alliance, as we envision it, would create up to 10 million jobs in Africa over the next five years. We want to create a framework to attract more private investment to Africa. In fact, we are not starting from scratch: our external investment fund, launched here two years ago, will mobilise more than 44 billion euros of investment in the public and private sectors in Africa. The planned projects and the projects undertaken will mobilize 24 billion euros. We will focus our investments in areas where investments make a real difference. By 2020, the European Union will have supported 35,000 African students and researchers through our re-muscled Erasmus programme. By 2027, this figure is expected to increase to 105,000. Trade between Europe and Africa is not unimportant. 36% of Africa's trade is already with the European Union. But trade between us is not enough. I am convinced that we should move the many trade agreements between African countries and the European Union towards a continent-to-continent free trade agreement, an economic partnership between equal partners. Another issue where I see a strong need for the Union for leadership is Brexit. I will not enter into the details of the negotiations, which are being masterfully handled by my friend Michel Barnier. He works on the basis of a unanimous position confirmed time and again by the 27 Member States. However, allow me to recall three principles which should guide our work on Brexit in the months to come. First of all, we respect, of course, the British decision to leave our Union, yes, but we regret it deeply that you are. But we also ask the British Government to understand that someone who leaves the Union cannot be in the same privileged position as a Member State. If you leave the Union, you are of course no longer part of our single market, and certainly not only in parts of it. (Applause) Secondly, the Commission, this Parliament and all other Member States will always show loyalty and solidarity with Ireland when it comes to the Irish border. This is why we want to find a creative solution that prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland.  (Applause) And we will defend all the elements of the Good Friday Agreement. It is Brexit that is making the border more visible in Northern Ireland. It is not the European Union. Thirdly, after 29 March 2019, the United Kingdom will never be an ordinary third country for us. The United Kingdom will always be a very close neighbour and partner, in political, economic and security terms.  In the past months, when we needed unity in the Union, Britain was at our side, driven by the same values and principles as all other Europeans. This is why I welcome Prime Minister May's proposal to develop an ambitious new partnership for the future, after Brexit. We agree with the statement made at Chequers that the starting point for such a partnership should be a free trade area between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  On the basis of these principles, the Commission's negotiators, mainly my good friend Michel Barnier, stand ready to work day and night to reach a deal. We owe it to our citizens and our businesses to ensure the United Kingdom's withdrawal is orderly and that there is stability afterwards. It will not be the Commission that will stand in the way of this. Ladies and gentlemen, between now and the European elections and the summit on 9 May of the year Romania, much work remains to be done. In Sibiu, we will have to convince our fellow citizens that, on the essentials, we share the same conception of the purpose of our Union. People do not like uncertainty or diffuse purposes. They like clear indications. They hate the near-to-the-near and half-measures. So let us not offer half measures to European citizens. All this is the European agenda on the road to Sibiu. Between now and Sibiu, we must ratify the partnership agreement between the European Union and Japan, for economic but also geopolitical reasons. Between now and the Sibiu summit, we have a duty to negotiate an agreement in principle on the European Union budget after 2020. If we want to give young Europeans the chance to make the most of the opportunities offered by the Erasmus programme, which deserves more funding, we will have to decide on this envelope, this envelope as well as other envelopes. If we want to give more opportunities to our researchers, to our start-ups to avoid a lack of resources leading to a drastic reduction in the number of research positions, we will have to make a decision on the budget before the European elections. If we want, without militarising ourselves, to increase defence spending by 20, we must decide before the European elections. If we want to spend 23% more investment on Africa, we will have to decide quickly. I am always told - heads of state, ministers, European and national parliamentarians - that we cannot decide before the elections. As if the elections were a crisis of democracy. No! It is normal in a democracy to have elections, and it is normal, urgent, to decide before the elections to show the way to those who are supposed to elect us. (Applause) By next year, we will also have to further develop the international role of the euro. After only 20 years of existence, and despite the declining voices that have accompanied us on this journey, the euro already has a rich track record behind it. The euro has become the world's second largest currency after the dollar. Sixty countries link their own currency to the euro in one way or another. But we must do more to enable our single currency to play its full role on the international stage.  Recent events have highlighted the need to deepen our economic and monetary union and to build deep, liquid capital markets. Many of the Commission's proposals in this area are just waiting to be adopted. We must and we can go further. It is aberrant that Europe pays 80% of its energy import bill, which amounts to 300 billion euros per year, in U.S. dollars, while only 2% of our energy imports come from the United States. It is absurd, ridiculous, that European airlines buy European planes in dollars and not in euros. We have to change all that. (Applause) That is why the Commission will present initiatives before the end of the year to strengthen the international role of the euro. The euro must become the active instrument of the new European sovereignty. And for that, the first thing to do is to put our house in order, strengthening and deepening the economic and monetary union, as we have begun to do. Without a thorough economic and monetary union, we will lack credible arguments to strengthen the international role of the euro. We must complete the economic and monetary union so that Europe and the euro can become stronger. And still on the way to Sibiu (Hermannstadt), I would like us to make tangible progress in strengthening our foreign policy. We need to strengthen our ability to speak with one voice on foreign policy. It is not normal for Europe to silence itself when, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, we cannot speak out to condemn human rights violations in China because a Member State has opposed it. I am quoting this example, but I could cite others. (Applause) That is why, today, the Commission is once again proposing to you to vote by qualified majority in specific areas of our external relations. I repeat the message. (Applause) I repeat the message I explained, detailed, last year. We will make proposals so that we can proceed, in certain areas, not in all areas, on qualified majority foreign policy. The Treaty, as it is, allows the European Council to take a decision in this direction. I believe that the time has come to bring to life the bridge clause of the Lisbon Treaty, which paves the way for qualified majority decision-making, which is the 'forgotten beauty' of the Treaty. (Applause) I think, moreover, since we are there, that for certain matters of taxation, we should also be able to decide by qualified majority. (Applause) A word, Mr President, to say that I am becoming more and more concerned about the way we discuss our disagreements. Controversial exchanges between governments, sometimes between institutions, are increasing. But it is not polemical and often hurtful comments that allow the European construction to move forward. What worries me is not just an unfortunate tone when the political forces are talking to each other. This is also true of the way some people deal, because they want to put an end to all debate, the media and journalists. Europe must remain a place where freedom of the press is not called into question. Too many journalists are intimidated, attacked and murdered. (Applause) There is no democracy without a free press. (Applause) Thank you for applauding, so that I can drink. (Laughter) In general, ladies and gentlemen, we must rediscover the virtues of compromise. Seeking compromise is not a weakness, does not imply the sacrifice of our convictions and does not prevent the free debate that respects the point of view of each other. The Commission opposes all violations of the rule of law. We remain concerned about the evolution of debates in some of our Member States. Section 7 must apply where the rule of law is in danger. (Applause) In this regard, First Vice-President Timmermans is doing a remarkable, but very often, too often, solitary job in defending the rule of law. It has my strong personal support and that of the whole Commission. (Applause) And then there is one point on which we must not and cannot deviate: the judgments of the European Court of Justice must be respected and executed. (Applause) The European Union is a community of law. Respect for the rule of law and respect for court decisions are not an option, but an obligation. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and for many of you, dear friends, by introducing, not my last speech, but my last speech on the State of the European Union, I have told you about the history, the small story, which covers the mandate of this Commission and the great history, which is that of Europe. We are all responsible for Europe as it is, and we will all be responsible, both of us, for the Europe that will be. History is thus made: Parliaments and Commissions pass, Europe remains. In order for the European Union to become what it must be, we must have several elements in mind. I would like Europe to leave the stands of the world stage. Europe must not be a spectator, a commentator of international events. She must be a constructive actor, a shaper, an architect of the world of tomorrow. There is a strong demand from Europe around the world. To meet this pressing demand, Europe will have to speak with one voice on the international stage. In the concert of nations, the voice of Europe must be intelligible, understandable, distinguishable in order to be listened to and heard. Federica Mogherini has advanced the diplomatic coherence of the European Union in a way that has never been done before. But let us never fall back on the inconsistency of competing and parallel national diplomacy. European diplomacy must be one, and our multilateral solidarity must be complete. (Applause) I would like us to make greater efforts to bring eastern and western Europe closer together; let us put an end to this sad spectacle of the intra-European division. Our continent and those who ended the Cold War deserve better. I would like the European Union to take more care of its social dimension. Those who ignore the justified expectations of workers and small businesses pose a great risk to the cohesion of our societies. Let us turn the intentions of the Gothenburg Summit into a rule of law. (Applause) I would like next year's elections to be a great moment for European democracy. I hope that the experience of the Spitzenkandidaten (head of the list) - this small step forward in European democracy - will be renewed. For me, this experience will be all the more credible the day when we have real lists Transnational. I think it will have to be done in 2024. (Applause) Above all, I would like us to say no to unhealthy nationalism, and say yes to enlightened patriotism. Let us keep in mind that the patriotism of the 21st century is two-dimensional, one national, the other European, the two not excluded. I like, said the French philosopher Blaise Pascal, the things that go together. To stand on both legs, nations and the European Union must walk together. Whoever loves Europe must love the nations that make it up. He who loves his homeland must love and love Europe. Patriotism is a virtue, narrow-minded nationalism is a damning lie and a pernicious poison. (Applause) In a nutshell, let's stay true to who we are. Let us plant today the trees in the shade from which our great-grandchildren, wherever they come from, from the north, south, west or east, can grow and breathe in peace. A few years ago, I told you here that Europe was the big deal of my life. Yes, I love Europe and I will continue to do so. Thank you for listening. (The Assembly, standing, applauds the speaker)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Thank you, Mr President, dear Jean-Claude, in your speech you have given a lot of ideas, you have tried to give a perspective. The following debate will serve to strengthen certain positions. I believe that Parliament will be able, at the end of this parliamentary term, to make its contribution to speeding up the adoption of rules that are still under discussion. Parliament, as you said, cannot and does not want to be a scapegoat, the scapegoats may be from other quarters. Parliament wants to be at the heart of democracy more and more, which is why I would ask you to start thinking, for example, about the need to give Parliament the power of legislative initiative. We are the only Parliament in the world that has no power of legislative initiative.  (Applause) You rightly pointed out – it was met with applause – your reference to the need for majority voting. When we talk about immigration, the Commission's and Parliament's proposal on the Dublin reform can be approved by a majority, but there is always resistance on the part of the Council. If that reform had been approved, there would not have been the Diciotti case in Italy. So you can and should, in my opinion, accelerate. Parliament, having applauded by an overwhelming majority the proposal to proceed by majority vote, means that it supports this action. All the proposals on immigration and Africa are also of great interest and go in the direction called for by Parliament. We have asked for a fund for Africa. Europe has woken up very late on the immigration issue. If you had heard the cry from some countries and from some Members a few years earlier, perhaps we would not be at this point. Of course, Africa needs investment, important investments. I agree that it is not necessary – and Parliament has always said this in a very clear way – to only give gifts. We need a policy of growth, sharing and economic diplomacy. But we need to take a quick decision and Parliament will not fail to make its contribution. As on Brexit, Mr President, Parliament wants to be a leading player. The final vote will be that of Parliament and our representatives are first and foremost working, as they have written in our resolutions, to protect the rights of three and a half million European citizens living in the United Kingdom. We should also do more on work and on economic and monetary union, because unemployment, especially youth unemployment, must be the main social issue that we must tackle. Therefore, Mr President, the European Parliament has been working hard over the last few months trying to give concrete answers to the citizens. My aim as President is to ensure that this institution is ever closer to our European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Europe is much more robust than it was four years ago. You overcame tough times. I think everybody can underline this, but without you, Jean—Claude, without your leadership, it would have been impossible to manage the last few years. With your cool head, your determination and your sincere heart for Europe, you defended the unity of this continent. I want to thank you for this and I also want to thank you for the details of your love affair, which you shared with us in your final remarks. Thank you, Jean-Claude Juncker. (Applause)  But there is still a lot to do and that is the main message of today’s State of the Union speech. We are still in a working session. We have to deliver and, from today’s announcements from Jean-Claude Juncker and the Commission, we can sum up that all the proposals that the Commission promised at the beginning of their mandate are now on Parliament’s and the Commission’s table. I would also add that these were not only the Commission’s proposals in the beginning, but were the promises of the PPE candidate, Jean—Claude Juncker, in his election campaign, to give a clear link between what you promised in the campaign last year and what you delivered under your leadership in the Commission. Also, on the implementing front, we have to be aware that we delivered a lot: you already mentioned some of the figures which are on the table on the economy, a stable growth rate, all the eurozone countries below 3%, we have created millions of new jobs – our companies did so, Mario Draghi has now given a clear signal that he will stop the low interest rate policy by the end of this year. So, having this in mind, it is a big success story. We have Brexit. I can remember, Jean—Claude, when we in your office after we got the messages from London about the outcome of the referendum and we were disappointed. We were looking for answers and we were a little scared about whether others could or would follow. Today, Europe is united and ready for a deal, but London cannot give us a clear answer, so the EU is united and London is in trouble. Finally, on migration, we reduced the numbers of arrivals, especially through the Mediterranean route, by more than 80% by 2015. When you sum up all these things, some would probably say that listing success stories is a boring exercise and probably journalists are not very interested. I would say that this is not the case, but I would say that it is a precondition for the most important thing a politician can have, and that is trust from the people. We did it together: all the political families worked on this. I want to pick up only one aspect because there is still a discussion going on about how we rescued the euro and yes, my party, the PPE party, is proud of what we did. It is about the policy of Enda Kenny, of Passos Coelho, of Mariano Rajoy, of Samaras, and of Anastasiades in Cyprus. They took the necessary steps and we rescued Europe and the euro with the policy that we invented and we established. (Applause) We created growth and a good future perspective for the people and I do not remember – let me say this in party political terms –Hollande, Renzi, Dijsselbloem or even Moscovici presenting any kind of alternative proposal about how we should answer the challenge which was on the table. Even Mr Bullmann, in the German Government, with your contribution and your party, I didn’t see any alternative proposal presenting other strategies to overcome the crisis. Stable budgets and an ambitious reform programme are necessary for a good economic future. That is what the PPE believes in.  (Applause) But now let’s look to the future. A people’s Europe is, first of all, a Europe of security. That’s why we welcome the proposal to provide 10 000 Frontex officers to really contribute to a strong border control. Security also still means the fight against organised crime and criminals. Their data exchange is key for Europe and I also want to underline that the Schengen area brings more and not less security. That’s why we ask the Council to take further steps to include Bulgaria and Croatia inside the Schengen area. They have waited for such a long time. It’s now time to act. I ask the Romanian Government to stop the risks regarding the fight against corruption in Romania because they are harming the decision—making process towards Bulgaria and Croatia in the same way. All three countries must have the right to join the Schengen area immediately. I want to underline this again. A second point for a people’s Europe is a Europe of democracy. That’s why I thank you for the initiatives to make our European elections safe. Neither Russia, nor China, nor any external power will decide. No trolls, fake news or Cambridge Analytica will decide. The people will decide. Europeans will decide the future of this continent. A third point: a people’s Europe is a Europe of fairness. I wonder what a truck driver is thinking when he listens to the radio and they talk about self-driving trucks. I think he is asking himself, ‘what will happen to me?’ In such a world – we are facing a revolution in the labour market – we have to create a new fair deal for Europe. That means – and I think in this House we all share these general ideas – fair taxation, contributions by the digital business sector to the future of this fair approach, and a new social model. Today’s Europe cannot be united – and cannot be called united – as living conditions in the European Union are still not equal. That’s why I think we have to do more on common living conditions and living standards in the European Union.  Finally, a people’s Europe is a Europe which is strong at global level. You showed in the Oval Office that we are strong – economically, a giant – and we also have to become a giant politically. That’s why a change from the unanimous vote mechanism to the majority vote system is fully supported by the EPP. Let’s stand up, let’s make this century a European one again. The crisis times are over. Now it’s time for a more united Europe, for a more democratic Europe and for a more ambitious Europe.

Chapeau, Mr Juncker! You are not the porte-parole of the national capitals, and you are a credit to the decency of this political role in Europe. By fulfilling it as you do you make a huge difference vis-à-vis the predecessor from your own political family, and I appreciate that. But that is not the issue at stake today. The issue is not whether you are a dedicated European or whether the College of Commissioners consists of dedicated Europeans. We are convinced of that, otherwise we would not have voted for you. The question at stake is whether our institution and our policies are yet up to the task on which we have to deliver nowadays. Yes, we are in an era of huge crisis. Mr Weber, I do not think we have yet overcome the crisis: think of migration, which you mentioned; think of climate change; think of the deepening divides between north and south and between east and west. No. We are in a transformational period and, as Pope Francis said at the beginning of your term of office, ‘This is not an era of change, this is a change of era.’ The real question, which we discuss in our political Group, is ‘Why can’t we be more radical?’ Why can’t we go for a clearer policy change to live up to the change of era. You mentioned migration, Mr Juncker, and we wholeheartedly support what you were saying. Given that, as Manfred Weber reminded us, you were the PPE candidate for your post at the last election, why is it that, when you talk about migration you have the applause only of the left side of this House, while the rest are silent? I wonder why that is. I cannot understand it, because migration is what he says is the task of today. Yes, we have to open legal ways for migration. What we witnessed again in the summer in the Mediterranean is a scandal. It is disgusting to see people drowning – although the official mission of the European Union no longer includes safe harbours because of the right-wing Italian Government. And this is the mission of the Commission President who was the PPE candidate last time for that office. I urge the Council to take note of that when preparing for the summit on 19 September: to discuss his proposals and to take urgent action. This is what we expect from the Council.  (Applause) We will be able to act in a broader picture only if we reach out to the societies of the east. Yes, they need a new compact. They have an interest beyond Bratislava, Mr Juncker. They have a clear interest in safe energy. They have an interest in cohesion, long-lasting cohesion, and in the re—industrialisation of their countries – and they deserve that. The workers in the eastern countries deserve a decent future, and we need to establish a new compact. I am deeply convinced that it will then be easier to resolve the migration question too. Let us talk about the south. It is not bearable that 40—50% of the young people in the south are without any prospects. We need a new master plan for the south. And why not? This could be done by the Commission in the remaining months of its term of office. Why not propose a new master plan, building on the investment plan of Jean—Claude Juncker, extending that to the south and restoring hope and a vision of the future to the southern countries? Why not make them again the marketplaces of new ideas, the bridge builders to the cultures in our neighbourhood? That would be a very important task, and we would encourage the Commission to undertake it. But it is not only the societies in the east and the south that are falling apart. Look at the north. Look at Brexit. Of course, we fully back the position of the Commission and we stand united on that. But look at Brexit, look at the Swedish elections, and you see that ordinary working-class people, who have invested their hope in Europe, would like to see us delivering, at the top of our agenda, one specific proposal. Why does the Commission not come forward with the proposal that each and every child in the European Union have a child guarantee: that each child deserves free healthcare, deserves proper education, deserves decent housing? That could be a proposal in the forthcoming months to unite the European Union around a new future for the next generation. And that is what we propose. You are right, Mr Juncker, that we need to defend our institution. We need to fight against enemies who would like to undermine our democracy – Cambridge Analytica, for example, and all the enemies from the outside, as well as enemies from inside. And yes, we need to strengthen the Community method in the last months of your term of office.

I expect there will be more of a ‘summing-up speech’ and I was just wondering what the proportion will be between pluses and minuses. On the plus side, I would put the Juncker plan which you mentioned en passant, which I think has been a success, but there is also a minus sign and the first thing that comes to mind is immigration and the demographic crisis. Of course you did not cause it directly: it was Chancellor Merkel who opened the European borders, but you could have prevented her or at least tried to prevent her. I don’t know with what effect, but at least you could have. We can subscribe to the idea of strengthening European borders, but I think it is a somewhat belated proposal. We could have talked about it some time ago. Instead, we spent a couple of years imposing a solution that was absurd from the very beginning: mandatory relocation. A lot of energy was spent on it, a lot of bad blood was shed, and the typical share of bullying and invectives were thrown around, but the real question that you should ask yourself and we should ask ourselves is: ‘is the European Union in a better shape now than it was when you took office?’ And I think the answer is clear: no. With all due respect, President Juncker, and all the successes that you had, no. There has never been a time in the history of European integration where Europe was more disunited than it is now. You talked about unity; no, unity is no longer there. It doesn’t mean World War I or World War II. Until recently, integration was a one-way street; now it’s a two-way street. The number of people who are deeply dissatisfied with the European project is increasing. That’s why our colleagues– my colleagues, too – are somewhat nervous about the elections – because they do not know what will happen. They are afraid of a possible political earthquake and you cannot say that the European Commission has no share in it and no responsibility – there is at least political responsibility. I mean, come on, there is some relation between cause and effect. It’s not the fact that there are so many people who have been antagonised, made angry, irritated, marginalised, bullied and rejected. The number is so high that you cannot neglect it and you cannot decline any responsibility for that. ‘You’ not as a person, but ‘you’ as a chief of the important European institution. We have to roll back this process somehow. When you mentioned that you wanted to have qualified majority votes in more areas of policy, public life in Europe, you are in for more trouble because that will petrify this system, in which some actors are equal and some are more equal than others and in which the decision-making process is extremely obscure. Nobody knows who makes the decisions, and the division between north and south, east and west are still there. If you want to have more trouble, go along this path. This will be an extremely interesting situation after the election. To what extent will you be responsive to the signals? You are charming man, President Juncker, and I love listening to you, but when you were talking today, I thought, ‘my God, we are living in two different worlds’. I wonder which one is the true one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I first want to react to Mr Legutko. What he is saying is terrifying. He is saying here that we were never so disunited as today. Has he forgotten what Europe was between the two world wars? Has he forgotten what Europe was in the Cold War? Has he never heard about the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain? (Applause) Europe is united now. Mr Legutko is not offering another vision. He says he is in another world from Mr Juncker: very well, for me that’s no problem. But please, Mr Legutko, don’t say things that are completely crazy in a continent that has seen 20 million dead and victims because of nationalism and populism like that which you defend today. That is the point. (Applause) I have to tell you, Mr Juncker, I did not want to start on this note but I find it so terrifying that somebody should give us lessons here about unity in Europe and then try, with his Government, to go against the rule of law and against a number of other things – against European values. Sorry, I wanted to start with the State of the Union of Jean-Claude Juncker, and especially a part that none of the speakers so far has mentioned, namely the part about Africa. I think you are right, Jean-Claude, you have made a clear proposal: they don’t need charity. What they need is a true partnership, between Africa and the EU. And I think it is possible to create what I would call the biggest economic and trade area in the world, because if Europe does that with Africa, it will become – it is already – the biggest trade area. It will also, in my opinion, be a true alternative for Africa, for African citizens, to the takeover by the Chinese, which is happening every day, every week, in every investment today in Africa. I think that Parliament must support you in pursuing this goal. My question is a little different to the questions from other political group leaders. It is this: last year you gave us your legacy, and you repeated that this year, and so the question is whether we can translate that legacy into reality in the coming years? It is an existential year of elections with a number of threats, let’s be honest, with the rise of nationalism and populism everywhere in Europe. We have a number of authoritarian leaders. (Interjection from the floor: ‘Hurray’) Yes, thank you for supporting me! We have leaders like Mr Kaczyński and like Mr Orbán, who is, in fact, hijacking our European parties. I think they’re doing a little of what Trump is doing in the US Republican Party. (Heckling) Let’s be honest, your voice is only an affirmation of this. The inconvenient truth is that the alt-right in Europe is trying to undermine this European Union and is actually trying to take over European politics from within: to do the opposite of the agenda that Jean-Claude Juncker presented to us today. It is for that reason – and I think all of us, certainly including Manfred Weber, are aware of this – that in the vote we are going to have in a few moments it is so important that all pro-Europeans are united against this alt-right authoritarian tendency apparent in a number of our countries. Leading the European Union is not only a matter of mathematical strength: it’s also a question of moral authority. And it is moral authority which is at stake at the moment in the European Union.  In the same spirit, Mr Juncker, I want to ask the Commission about a specific issue: something that you mentioned very briefly, but which I want to go into in more detail. I want to ask the Commission to introduce in the coming months a package of specific proposals and measures to protect our elections against the foreign meddling that we have already seen in other continents and in other places in Europe. These would include, for example, measures identifying foreign agents who are active on European social media platforms, as well as the extremist politicians with whom they are colluding. In the USA, as you all know, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been appointed to investigate Russian interference in elections, and they have already issued dozens of indictments. I think we need to catch up as quickly as possible by establishing our own special prosecutor to investigate and to stop all disinformation in Europe too – and certainly before it is too late in the light of the European elections to be held next year. My special request to you, Mr Juncker, is to ask if the Commission could take an initiative on this and bring it to the table of the Council and the table of the European Parliament.  Finally, my last point: I want to support you in one thing. The most important point you made was about the end of unanimity and the use of what is called, using a French term, the passerelle clause. That was your most important proposal, and my proposal, Jean-Claude, is that you be ambitious. Include all fields, all possible articles of the Treaty, in your proposal on the passerelle clause, because I am pretty sure that, at the other side of the table, in the Council there will be a number of them who will not be in agreement with you. It is obvious that the best thing to do in politics is to ask for the maximum possible. Start with 100%. Say ‘I want the end of unanimity inside the European Union’ because that is the main problem at the moment in deciding on a number of things: for example, as you mentioned Mr Juncker, the migration package. With the Council not capable of deciding, even when it is with a qualified majority, my proposal is to be ambitious: include the whole package, all fields of foreign policy and, as far as I am concerned, all fields of taxation too. Include everything in it and we will see what the end game will be if we support you. You said – and this will be my conclusion – that this would be the ‘last-chance Commission’. Do you remember that, four years ago? And I have been asking myself what can come after the ‘last-chance Commission’ in the coming years. I think that what will come is something different. The Commission that we need in the future, colleagues, will be more than that: it will be a type of new, renewed European government. And it will have one task, which is to realise further the legacy of Jean-Claude Juncker, as well as the other visions that have been set out in recent months, for example by the French President in his Sorbonne speech. That will be the task of this new Commission. And that – furthering your legacy – is also the task that we, as our political group and movement, will offer to the electorate as a real European alternative to the nationalists and the populists inside and outside this House.

We have a lot of challenges. We have problems – to say the least – in our transatlantic partnership, we have China rising up – there are so many challenges out there. But I would argue that more threatening than anything that the world can throw at us are actually the enemies from the inside, and that they are the obvious ones: the nationalists that bring hatred, division; the racists that spread fear and hate. But there are also some less obvious: the decision-makers who actually don’t take decisions and want to keep the status quo, who just want to keep their own privileges and who are just closing their eyes at what is at stake. And then there are powers in governments – of which, unfortunately, we have more and more – who use the European Union as a scapegoat for all their own failures and that are cutting away democracy and civil liberties bit by bit and piece by piece. But a Europe united, a Europe that knows what it stands for, can face all external problems and can be a front-runner and a shining example in the world. We can be strong if we don’t make ourselves weak. And Europe has promised its citizens to bring peace, prosperity and democracy, and those promises are still very relevant – but we need to renew them and we need to bring them to fulfilment. On peace, we have major achievements to show, but we cannot rest on laurels and Norwegian medals: there are new global challenges ahead that threaten our future and our security, and the biggest one of them is climate change. We have seen this summer that climate change is happening: it’s happening now and it’s happening everywhere, from disastrous harvests to forest fires. There is no way anyone could possibly deny that. And the good news about climate change is that we know what to do; and the bad news about climate change is that we don’t do it. But with Trump leading the US into space rather than forwards, we cannot wait as Europeans for someone else to protect our planet. No, we have to do it ourselves, and there is no time to lose. And there the Commission has been way too timid in the past five years, I have to say. It is now that we need a very quick change to renewables and phasing-out of the climate-killer: coal. And if climate protection truly is a priority, then it should also be a priority in the multiannual budget. It should also be a priority in the agricultural reform. Agriculture is both a victim as well as a culprit in climate change, but farmers can also be part of the solution. And here is where the Commission should have been more ambitious with the agricultural reform. The European Union has also always promised prosperity, but we are far away from the triple-A rating that we should have, I agree, on social policies. And the austerity imposed on Member States in the past without regard to consequences and also without regard to whether this would actually help anything: that has seriously undermined the European promise of increasing living standards. But increasing the quality of life is not just some minor thing that you can forget about. It’s an essence of policy-making, and we need to renew this promise and build a social Europe, and one not just of nice declarations like we’ve seen from Gothenburg. We need not just nice intentions – that’s all very nice, but we need a social Europe with real facts and real figures. We need common minimum social standards in Europe. All citizens must get full access to social protection, to housing and to medical care. A framework directive on adequate minimum income schemes can create such a safety net as well, and here it would be very interesting to see a proposal by the Commission, so that we can ensure that safety net for everyone and not just for a lucky few. And Europe has promised democracy, rule of law and civil liberties to all its citizens, and that was a very strong call for all the countries that wanted to join, for all the people living under dictatorships who were being deprived of freedoms – like the country where I myself was born. Our continent has a long and bloody history of oppressions, of tanks rolling against protesters, of people suffering in prison camps, and it’s only thanks to those courageous people who were marching for freedom, who were marching for democracy and who did not give up, that today in the European Union we have that democracy, we have those civil liberties and we have freedom. But those very big successes are under threat. We need to fight for them again every single day, because inside Europe today, judges are being dismissed, corruption is being legalised, newspapers are closed, universities harassed and civil society treated as criminals. And this is not a detail; this is a threat to all of us. And again, today as well, courageous people are standing up, marching for human rights – their own rights and the rights of their neighbours – and they are marching for freedom, be it in Sicily or Romania, be it in Chiemnitz or be it in Pirin. And they defend democracy, they defend humanity and they defend Europe, and we see as well that, if we stand up together, then we really have power and we are really strong together. And I think more now than ever, it is now the task and responsibility of all of us to take a stance and to take up all of our responsibilities. We have responsibilities: you, as President of the Commission, we all, as Members of the European Parliament – and all Europeans from north to south, from east to west. Because if Europe loses on democracy, then it will lose itself. And this is about more than one country or another country: this is about the achievements on this continent that so many people have even died for. This is about our true self, the true self of Europe, and it is time to take a stance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Gabriele Zimmer", "mepid": "28248", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr Juncker, today, in a very intensive speech, you have expressed your political positions, with which you have taken over as President of the Commission and have led to this up to this point. I would like to pay tribute to you for that. I believe that this makes it easier for us to talk about what needs to be different from the point of view of the various political groups in the European Union.  I would like to start with the evaluation as the first thing I want to do. Are we really at the stage where we can say that we have weathered the crises, we have come to the point where we can look forward to all the dangers, to all the challenges, to be prepared, to ensure that people have a corresponding sense of social security, of solidarity, of a community here in the European Union? And here I say to you clearly: no!  Yesterday, when the Greek Prime Minister was here, a sentence from him was very revealing when he said, 'We are out of the memorandum', and then added – and he said this several times: 'We survived'. If, however, the phrase 'we have survived' is the conclusion of a policy which has been largely supported by the institutions and also by the Commission, of a way of crisis management which has ultimately been carried out on the backs of the poorest of the poor and ultimately led to it, that inequalities have been deepened, and that we do not have the certainty that we can look to the future, but that we all feel that with the coming election we really have something ahead of us, where we have to say today that we have to avert it, because we want a Europe of solidarity, of community, of peace, then there are a whole series of starting points where we have to look at today's policy and say. : That's not how it will work.  We have to say that, even ten years after the start of the financial crisis, the level of prosperity from the pre-crisis periods has not yet been restored in many countries. And where growth is back, it doesn't matter to many people. The rights of women workers have been severely reduced in many Member States. We must send a signal that we are strengthening these rights and also the protection of women workers and, above all, those who are not in a working process at all, that we are bringing them back, that we accept them, that this is part of it for us, to the European Union, and that we do not want the promised Triple-A for Social Triple-A to ultimately become a triple-A for a future military strength of the European Union.  That cannot be the case that we are taking the money from the EU budget for the fund that you mentioned earlier. And I say to you: the title you needed to show strength, to show common ground, to demonstrate strength to the outside world and, ultimately, to protect the citizens, reminds me too much of the slogan of the Austrian Presidency, of which I do not believe at all, of this slogan, because it says ' Europe that protects'. And you make this very clear: this is not about social union, it is not about that at all. There is virtually no specific objective in the terms of reference for this Presidency. It is a question of protecting the external borders, of repelling the refugees, and of continuing this process, these humanitarian disasters that we experienced in the summer, in practice.  I am very grateful to you for saying where the stumbling block is and who is blocking here. And I believe that we as a Parliament should make it very clear that we finally need Dublin, that we will not accept it, that the Council is constantly blocking us here and that it simply thinks that it can do what it wants and simply remains silent in inaction.  And what we expect from the Commission is my urgent request: say it out loud. It does not help the people and many consciously looking actors, including those who are looking at development, activists in Europe at all, if they do not know where the causes lie and who they have to turn to, with whom they can fight together, if it is not clear who is responsible for what, what responsibility the individual institutions bear.  We must make that clear. Otherwise, we will hardly win over voters who are prepared to overcome this lethargy – namely, to fight for Europe. We have to compete together. That must become our mission. And here we differ – and I say this quite clearly – also massively as leftists from all right-wing attempts, destroy Europe.

A European Union of peace, of prosperity, of contentedness and, as you said, you’re trying to make it a little more perfect every day. Well, it’s a very good advertising slogan, but I tell you what surprised me.  Since your last State of the Union speech there’s been a seismic political event in Europe, perhaps one even on a par with Brexit. Italy, a founding member of the Union, the third-biggest economy in the euro area, now has a coalition government between the 5—Stars and the Lega that is polling over 60% of the vote and is posing a direct challenge, both in terms of the management of the euro area and indeed, how the migration crisis is handled. You made no acknowledgment of that at all. No acknowledgment of the populist revolt that is sweeping through virtually every single Member State. Instead you’re to carry on regardless.  And I noted your continued use of the phrase ‘sovereign Europe’. What you’re talking about is a deeper centralisation of power: a centralisation of power in terms of Europe’s foreign policy; a centralisation of power, as you first laid out last year, in terms of building a European army; more power at the centre for taxation. All of this, of course, meaning less to be done at the nation-state level. And now another 10 000 European border guards paving the way for a federal border police in Europe. Well, I’ll tell you something – if you’ve got problems with the Italians now, you ain’t seen nothing yet when you put that proposal to them.  But it’s all about centralisation – power, power, power. But here’s the funny thing – you appealed to our sense of European patriotism. So why is it that patriotism at the nation-state level is considered to be insular, bad, nasty, xenophobic, probably racist into the bargain? And yet, patriotism at a European level is a good and a virtuous thing. I’m afraid this idea of European patriotism, this idea of putting that flag above their own nation-state flag is for the birds. People do not have a profound sense of European identity. They have a sense of national identity and in a way that is the great dividing line between your vision of Europe and that increasingly that is being said by the electors. We wish to live in nation states. Now on Brexit, Mr Juncker. On the Irish border already there are huge differences between the north and the south. Differences of politics, of tax, of currency and of law and we manage. And if we can get to a free trade deal, well, of course, there’ll be no difficulties whatsoever. I thought you had some very positive things to say. You said our vote to leave was a vote to leave the single market and its associated parts. I agree with you. Quite why Ms May at Chequers wants to opt back into much of it, I don’t know.  But you said twice that we need to come to a free trade deal. It’s what European exporters want, and it is, absolutely, and it’s what we want. Surely now the time is right. The ground is prepared for a Canada—plus—style trade deal between you and between us. We leave political union but we carry on doing business on a tariff—free basis. We want it. Increasingly, I think that you want it. Let’s get Brexit sorted and, Mr Verhofstadt, you’ll be happy, you’ll see the back of us.

Mr President, Mr Juncker, four years after the installation of your Commission, and only a few months before the European elections, the time is obviously on the balance sheet, and it is clear that your Commission is finally a summary of all the excesses of the European Union and of all that people cannot bear today. The action of your Commission is opaque, undemocratic and punitive. Opaque, when you decide, it is the prince's decision to appoint Mr Selmayr as Secretary General of the Commission. His majesty Jean-Claude Juncker is breaking all the rules in force. Undemocratic, when your Commissioner Mr Oettinger declares, in a statement of incredible arrogance, I quote, 'that the financial markets will teach Italians to vote well'. And also undemocratic when, as recently as now, you say that the European Union's budget will be locked down until 2027, without waiting for the citizens of our peoples to vote in the elections in May 2019. Punitive also, with regard to Poland or Hungary, and we had a fine example of a Stalinist trial, just yesterday, simply because these countries have the courage to define what our values of civilization are and because they refuse the mandatory quotas of migrants that you wanted to impose on them. Punitive also against the British, to whom you want to charge the price of freedom, by refusing any trade agreement while countries that are not in the European Union, such as Norway or Iceland, are granted access to the single market. As you multiply free trade treaties with the whole world, would you deny that to the British? And then, of course, the action of your Commission has been marked by the acceleration of the abolition of all economic protections. You are knowingly organising unfair competition, within the European Union with seconded work, outside the European Union with free trade treaties whose consequences are seriously anti-ecological and which harm our industries and our agriculture. This is true of CETA (AECG, Global Economic and Commercial Agreement), it is true of future treaties with the countries of Mercosur or Oceania. And as recently as this summer, you went to Tokyo, without the advice of the European Parliament or the national parliaments, to sign a pre-free trade agreement with Japan. Finally, of course, your Commission has been characterised by a crazy migration policy, and Mr Legutko pointed out earlier - with great moderation - which has not stopped him from suffering the wrath of Mr Verhofstadt, who spends his time criticising and attacking populists or extremists, but who is in this Chamber with great steadfastness. , the face of hatred, of aggression, of the rejection of any idea that would be different from his own, and he has demonstrated it just now. Mr Avramopoulos, your Commissioner, had talked about immigration, in setting the framework for your Commission, the reception of migrants, I quote, is an economic and social imperative for our ageing continent and you yourself said earlier that you wanted to increase legal immigration routes even further.

But I have run out of a clear rate here to build a competitive market, without blockades, to remove protectionism, which is based not only on populism, but much broader, on support for small and medium-sized enterprises – that would be a very pragmatic approach.  Unlike Mr Farage, who spoke here three minutes ago, I am in favour of Europe being more responsible for defence policy than before. I look at this process very positively. Europe should share responsibility for this area with the United States. But practical solidarity is needed, it is necessary to be accompanied by the feeling that Europeans, that the European Union will defend the security of Eastern Europe as much as southern Europe, and that it will not tolerate initiatives contrary to European security and European solidarity, such as Nord Stream 2.

I would like to point out here that the Commission has exactly proposed, in the context of the so-called 'Gothenburg' process, such an action. This is Chapter 3, point number 11. I would also like to remind Mrs Keller that I pleaded, today as yesterday, that the Gothenburg Declaration should not remain a poem, but that we should turn intentions into deeds, including legislative acts. I would like to say to my friend Verhofstadt, to whom we should address with a minimum of politeness, that the Commission has today adopted a text on the protection of European voters, European candidates and political parties in the forthcoming European elections. So it's all on track. I will tell Mr. Farage that you have to listen before you speak. I have not put on the same level national patriotism and European patriotism.

I won’t be able to go into all the detailed elements of President Juncker’s speech but his considerations deserve careful examination. Obviously, he touched upon issues that are at the centre of our attention. But let me turn to something else at the outset. I would like to stress that I fully second what President Juncker stated at the beginning of his speech. Our union is a union of peace. It is a union of prosperity and we should show respect towards this union, deal with it carefully and protect our common values. Now let me turn to some of the issues touched upon, for instance, the idea of further strengthening Frontex. It is an important element of a functioning EU policy on migration. It was already discussed at the European Council in June and it will be a main topic for the discussions at the informal Heads of State or Government summit in Salzburg. Yes, the strengthening of Frontex is, in our view, a precondition to establishing a resilient and well—grounded European asylum system. We hope as far as possible to find common ground and to bring things forward.  The European Council in June also reconfirmed the need to bring our cooperation with Africa to a new level. A visible expression of this aim will be a high-level forum, which we are currently planning to hold in Vienna at the beginning of December. As far as the proposal on summertime is concerned, we are planning to put that on the Council’s agenda very soon. Given the specific political context, before the end of the current parliamentary term, there is indeed a need to concentrate on the delivery of pending proposals and on the effective implementation of legislation. Be assured that the Austrian Presidency’s energy and determination is fully focused on this. In recent months, there have been developments which may on the surface seem contradictory. There is much talk about Euroscepticism and concerns in this respect ahead of next year’s European Parliament elections. Yet, at the same time, we have seen positive signs on renewed trust and higher levels of support for the Union. For our part, as the Presidency, we are confident that there is enough unity and determination in Europe to tackle these challenges ahead and to transfer them into opportunities. Our motto is ‘a Europe that protects’ and this is what we are trying to contribute. I think this motto could also apply to a series of elements of President Juncker’s speech today. Europe has emerged stronger in many ways from the crisis we have faced in recent years, but now we need to act swiftly and determinedly on the economy, migration, security and digital Europe, especially cybercrime. The increasing number of cyberattacks and the crucial questions on cybersecurity must be discussed diligently. We will strive to use the effects of digitalisation at its best on the one hand but, on the other hand, we have to deal carefully with the possible negative effects. The goal must be a secure, stable single digital market and the highest trust from the consumers of this service in Europe. Addressing you in this Chamber in July, Chancellor Kurz presented to you the priorities of our Presidency, namely, security and the fight against illegal migration, securing prosperity and competitiveness through digitalisation and stability in the European neighbourhood. I will not go through these principles and priorities again. They focus on achieving tangible results through demonstrating to European citizens the EU’s indispensable added value for its citizens and Member States. This is particularly important in this period as we near the end of the parliamentary term. As President Juncker mentioned, we have a lot of work to do in the coming months with regard to legislation, but there are also the informal meetings of the Heads of State or Government in Salzburg next week and the European Council meetings in October and December in which crucial decisions will have to be made. Beyond our Presidency are the European elections and the informal meeting in Sibiu in May 2019, when the implementation of the leaders’ agenda will be reviewed and a strategic agenda for the period 2019—2024 will be prepared. Finally, speaking of delivering on priority policies, I would also note that today’s debate on the State of the Union is a key moment in a new annual cycle of programming. The General Affairs Council, at its meeting on 18 September, will have an exchange of views on the basis of the Commission’s letter of intent, which was issued only yesterday. We also look forward to continuing the fruitful dialogue among the three institutions on priorities, particularly on the implementation of the joint declaration on the EU’s legislative priorities for 2018 and 2019. Results can be delivered in a focused and targeted way through our joint programming. Let me reaffirm the Council’s commitment to this process and assure you that the Presidency will continue to be a determined partner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Daniel Caspary (PPE).", "mepid": "28219", "text": "   Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. President Juncker has put it aptly: the European Union is now in a much, much better position politically, economically and socially than many people perceive it to be. But still, many people see great challenges, many people have concerns or are dissatisfied. My impression is that often these concerns and dissatisfaction come from the fact that people have an expectation of the European Union that we cannot fulfil, that we have expectations, where the Member States do not give us the tools to meet these expectations, and the European institutions do not have the necessary competence. When President Juncker suggests that we eliminate the issue of tax breaks, tax breaks for companies such as Apple or Amazon, which are granted on the backs of craftsmen and small and medium-sized enterprises, if we want to shape a stronger common foreign policy, or if we want to tackle the issue of migration and the protection of external borders better together at European level, then we have the very situation where the Member States have not given us the competence to do so far in many of these things and that we are not regulating things here.

It is indeed true that the time for European sovereignty has come, and it has come at the forefront of the response to climate change, the digital revolution, trade, the need to manage migration in another way.  But why doesn't this agenda go ahead? This agenda does not advance because we have forces from the past arguing that it is better to protect citizens only behind national borders. This is a complete illusion because it is not possible today to be able to protect citizens on the basis of national policies, solutions are needed at European level. But the real reason why this agenda is not moving forward is that we have conservative status quo forces that resist that these European-scale solutions are truly implemented. For these forces of the status quo, migration has only an organised European border, but progressive forces have to overcome this blockade because it is not enough. We need a real partnership with Africa, we need to have a European asylum system and we need to live up to it when we receive refugees here and we have to give them protection. The forces of the status quo think it is positive that we have had a pick-up in employment in Europe and investment, but progressive forces want more because we need much more investment to drive the energy transition and drive the digital revolution in the right direction. Here we have a huge blockade which has to do with the reform of the euro zone. Mr Weber is pleased with where we are, but it is not possible because this euro area continues to produce divergences until it has a working budgetary capacity. And then the conservative forces think it's enough to have jobs. That's not good enough. The quality of jobs must have a real social pillar that guarantees a contract of employment and social protection for all citizens of Europe, in any region in which they are located.

Firstly, he considers the financial crisis to be over. That is a fatal mistake, Mr Juncker. Nothing has been solved, everything is just covered. The pot continues to simmer, and the day will come when the lid will lift and all the omissions and misjudgments will fly around our ears. Secondly, peace, which is so important to us, is no longer threatened from the outside as it was in the 20th century, but from within, above all through a completely misguided migration policy, which the Commission and this House are working with. Thirdly, his policy of ever closer union is no longer going on. Today, it is more a question of who will leave next, rather than who will join the Union next.

The Commission has put forward a proposal that increases divergence, a bad proposal for the cohesion countries. How is estonia to fall by 24% and Finland to rise by 5%?  How is it explainable that Croatia will fall by 6 % and Italy to increase by 6%? The argument that some states have grown is a false argument. So they grow up, promote good policies, promote prosperity and are punished by European funds, even though they are far below, but far below rising states. This is not equity, this is not a path for the next seven years, this is not a discourse for the future and therefore we need to review the MFF deeply and I am also concerned because the Portuguese Government is conformist - as was seen here with Maria João Rodrigues - which criticises the jobs created because they are low, is what happens in Portugal , there is jobs created, but low, that is the socialist policy and that is the policy that we want to condemn.  And, by the way, one last question about the Solidarity Fund that was applied to Portugal for the fires. It must be said that the Portuguese has used more than half of the Fund for bureaucratic structures and not to re-place the situation on the ground.

Too often, when we are wrapped in our bubble of commentators’ blogs, news cycles and work programmes, we forget that it is the people, the taxpayers and the voters, that we serve and not the other way round. But we hear many in this Chamber tell voters that their concerns are unfounded, or that the way they have chosen to vote is nationalistic or populist. But by attempting to shut out parties that do not share their vision and do not believe in the project, they also shut up many voters and push them further away.  I know that Mr Juncker has worked very hard to regain the confidence of voters. But many people in many EU Member States feel that the EU has lost its way, that it has failed to deliver on issues such as jobs. It has failed to deliver on their concerns over migration; it has failed to deliver on them feeling safer in their home countries, and on the things that they care about. So when politicians here talk about winning back their confidence, it rings hollow to those that are still willing to listen, as they feel that they have heard it all before.  I remember only too well in 2014 as President Juncker addressed this Chamber full of freshly elected MEPs, he declared it to be a moment to be a new start for Europe and said that we should play as a team with common policies. Yet voters have seen attempts to push divisive migration policies that sadly, rather than helping people, have reduced sympathy in some quarters for refugees and those fleeing war and persecution, rather than going around the table and asking each country what they can do, rather than telling them what to do.  He spoke of greater transparency but the public read in the papers of the appointment of a Commission Secretary—General that was clouded in secrecy. He said that Europe cannot spend money that it does not have but they see a multiannual budget demanding more money at a time when one of the largest net contributors is leaving. He talked about considering giving the euro area its own budget capacity and powers but, as the people of Germany will tell you, there is no such thing as European money.  My Group agreed with Mr Juncker when he said: ‘we don’t need a European solution to everything’ and this is still the case. So European Conservatives and Reformists ask that this Commission President and future Commission Presidents listen to the people who have lost confidence in the EU.  I know at times that our Group can be the greatest critics, but real friends tell each other the hard truths and we work together where we agree. So the ECR calls on the Commission to start delivering the kind of European Union that people want and deserve. Not an EU which increasingly replaces national governments, not a European Union that is dismantled and destroyed, but a reformed European Union that Mr Juncker promised to deliver here in this Chamber five years ago. With vital elections next year, this is the eleventh hour for the EU.

However, the question of whether and how this promise can be implemented in such a short time is unanswered, because the previous mandate of the Agency has not yet been fully implemented and this proposal would require serious investment and support from EU Member States.

If we were to draw the line under Juncker's mandate, we can see two things clearly. He found the European Union reeling from the economic, financial and social crisis. He can say that after his mandate, the EU has been fully economically recovered. For more than 20 quarters, europe's economy has been growing, 12.5 million jobs have been created since 2012, youth unemployment is at a record low.

Specifically, change the process of comitology, which lacks democratic legitimacy. But we would probably expect too much from a president whose office is linked to the controversial professional growth of his right hand.

If there were attempts in that direction, they were insufficient to correct the weaknesses of the Union. On big things like addressing the migration crisis, social cohesion, economic and social imbalances, the Union was not decisive in the last 5 years.

The cultural absorption level has already been exceeded in all the Member States that had unchecked mass migration during recent decades.

It said \"workers tend to be too dependent on state pensions.\" Two years earlier, the same company recommended that the European Union set up a cross-border pension fund on its territory.  June 2016: the date on which Commissioner Dombrowskis announced the Commission's proposal to set up a European personal pension plan. We understand the complaints of three months ago of the high promiscuity among senior officials of the European Commission, including Dombrowski, with the multinational. Even before any decision on this proposal already BlackRock tracks the path in European pension funds managing a pilot project created by Commissioner Coins and delivered to the American multinational. If masks have ever had them, they have fallen, leaving the interests to which the European Commission serves to the public. But this is not a debate on BlackRock, nor about commissioners, it is a debate on the future of pensions and the political choices that the European Union seeks to impose to the detriment of peoples and workers.  The completion of a new pan-European pension product responds to an old demand by large investment funds to appropriate workers' contributions to public social security, integrating the World Bank's model of promoting growth called the \"second pillar\". This is a despicable assault proposed by the European Union on workers' pensions for appropriation of their income, aimed at the liquidation of public and universal social security with the support of the right and social democracy.  It is not surprising that the Commission's proposal is that, through country-specific recommendations in the context of the European Semester, they insist on theorising the unsustainability of public pension systems and the inevitable replacement of redistributive themes by capitalisation systems. The implementation of such recommendations of the European Union, together with the right-wing and austerity policies followed in recent decades by those who have governed countries such as Portugal, have led to an accelerated process of weakening public social security, with obvious and harmful consequences: the attack on the right to social protection, the introduction of measures that erode the financing base of the systems , harming especially the older people, unemployed workers and beneficiaries of non-contributory social benefits. A reality aggravated by low-wage policies and high job insecurity, destruction of national productive capacity, increased unemployment, inevitable reductions in contributions made and consequent increase in poverty and social exclusion. In addition, the retirement age has been increased on a proposal from the European Commission. They instigate the generational confrontation with a single goal: to privatise pension systems and usurp workers' incomes, serving them with a hand to vultures of pension funds, making a shallow plank of the brutal social consequences of the bankruptcy of these funds. The needs of workers and peoples opposed to the interests of large economic and financial groups require a clear response: the defence of public, universal and solidarity social security as an irreplaceable instrument for promoting social justice in the distribution of income, which must be consolidated by strengthening public systems with contributory funding based on principles of solidarity between generations and a redistributive logic , a path incompatible with your integration project that cannot be disconnected from the fight against unemployment and precariousness, the creation of jobs with rights and the effective appreciation of wages, the fight against contributory evasion and the rejection of the misuse of revenuestemming the income of the contributory regime for purposes unrelated to its purposes.  Public and universal social security must serve the interests, well-being and happiness of workers and peoples.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. A stable, trustworthy guarantee of old age is a central task in a social society. That is why we also welcome the debate – knowing full well that pension insurance law is primarily national law and that our powers are limited.  We recognise that in many Member States the demographic structure is difficult. We are pleased that the life expectancy of our European citizens continues to increase. From generation to generation, life expectancy increases by three years on average in Europe: that is, my year will be on average six years older than the grandpa has become, and my son will be three years older than my year on average with his vintage. That is why we must be concerned about the age structure, which means that there are fewer and fewer employees in a pensioner.  The task remains, first and foremost, a task for the Member States. With our proposal, we in the European Commission want to make a supplementary voluntary offer, not a substitute. We believe that the state pension and the statutory pension must remain the main pillar of pension provision in the future. And we believe that private security by the citizen and economically reputable offers can also play a useful complementary role. Supplementary pension schemes and the added value that should also be organised at European level are the background to the Commission's proposal, which my colleague Mr Dombrovskis has drawn up in the lead.  Please take it away from him: we do not want the American industrial companies that have just been mentioned to benefit from it. We want there to be a second pillar in which Europe can add value and which fully meets our legal requirements of insurance law and the market economy.  We want to make an offer that the Member States and the citizens can accept, but do not have to accept. If a Member State wants to continue to place pension provision fully on the state statutory pillar, it is its own decision, its right, its responsibility. However, if the second pillar is to be added in addition, our proposal, if you follow it, is an offer – no more and no less.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 178, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Karoline Edtstadler", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I am sorry for the delay: there was a slight delay in signing legal acts together with President Tajani. Let me turn to our topic. Sustainability of the pension system is crucial and has to be seen in the overall context of sustainable public finances. We need a modern and efficient social safety net that targets public resources to where they are needed most, catering in particular for vulnerable groups in society. But beyond the sustainability, we should also not forget about adequacy. Sustaining adequate pensions in ageing societies is key to the economic coordination efforts and ensuring inclusive growth in the EU, as pensions are both the main source of income for older Europeans and an important component of public expenditure. An increased awareness about old-age poverty led to a 1.9 million decrease in the number of old people at risk of poverty or social exclusion since 2008 in the EU, despite growing life expectancy. Despite these improvements, there is no room for complacency, as was rightly highlighted by the 2018 Pension Adequacy Report endorsed by the Council in June this year. The European Pillar of Social Rights, Principle 15, highlights precisely this issue. It affirms the right of workers and the self-employed in retirement to a pension which commensurate with their contributions and ensuring an adequate income. Furthermore, it highlights that women and men shall have equal opportunities to acquire pension rights. To this end, Member States are working hard to ensure that the gender income and pay gap is closing. It is well known that the gender pay gap is amplified in old age. More than 20% of old women aged 65 and over are at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU. The Council has not lost sight of this issue. Most recently in March, Ministers have debated the implications of the gender pay gap on our societies and discussed ways forward on how to tackle it. The Adequacy Report’s key messages focus in this regard on the following: reducing the inequality requires equal opportunity policies targeted at women and men of working age, inter alia through promoting the work-life balance and equal distributions of caring responsibilities and addressing labour market participation and career opportunities, work intensity and career breaks. Last but not least, this debate closely ties in with discussions on the future of work. An increasing number of people do not work in regular full-time employment any more. We must make sure that our social security systems, including pensions, are not the last ones to adapt to this reality. This would have grave consequences on our societies in a few decades from now. The proposed recommendations on access to social protection for workers and the self-employed is currently being discussed. The intention is to take steps to extend pension coverage to more people in non-standard or self-employment, and adapting accrual conditions to diverse work patterns. This can help more people build up adequate pension rights. In conclusion, ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances is particularly important, given the ageing population and the debt levels in the EU. It is also of utmost importance that we do not leave our fellow citizens who have contributed to the betterment of our societies, who were instrumental in the growth of our economies, and who have shaped the Europe that we live in today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 179, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Heinz K.

Today's debate on the future of pensions concerns all European citizens. However, this issue lies in national competence, and that is a good thing. I share this position in the division of competences. The future of pensions, as it is designed, should be based on three pillars. The first pillar of statutory pensions should continue to be a priority, as in Austria, the stable pension scheme is largely provided by statutory pensions. Reforms are, of course, imperative here. Intergenerational justice means that demographic development must not be carried out on the backs of young people. And if we already spend an average of 20 years in retirement today, then it is clear that we have to work longer. The second pillar – we have mostly regulated it through company pensions – must become as attractive as possible. We need to strengthen them in order to maintain living standards in old age. And the third pillar, private pension provision, will soon be able to get something particularly attractive for young people with the PEPP proposed by the Commission, the Pan-European pension product, which, for the first time in this form, also offers a capital guarantee in the standard version of pension savings, which, irrespective of the development of the capital markets, will include a guarantee for the payment of the amounts paid in.

Yes, we know that our pension systems are confronted with difficult challenges because of ageing and because the poverty we still have among pensioners is not being reduced. Something needs to be addressed because we cannot have poverty involved in the pension system. This is even more acute if we have in mind the future of younger generations because, for the sake of fairness, we need to make sure that young generations have the same chances to count on an adequate pension when they need it. How could we address this? First of all, let me make the point that the best way to have a sustainable pension system is to have a very high employment rate and good quality jobs. Then, let me also underline, in the middle of the discussion about the outcomes of migration, that migration, if it is properly managed, can make a positive contribution to the sustainability of the pension system. Last but not least, we need to consider new ways to finance the system, notably by corporate taxation and by the so-called digital tax, because a new source of tax is there.  Let me make the point that the European social model involves a pension system based basically in a public pillar and the pensions system should be available for everyone.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Many young people in my country do not believe that they will receive an adequate pension later on. Many people in Germany are – not unjustifiably – very concerned about old-age poverty.  The German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) has just published that more than sixty percent of Germans have to adjust to the fact that they will be missing around seven hundred euros a month in order to maintain their standard of living in old age. Private pension provision is therefore recommended, as is the one in this House, which is not without a certain irony, because private pension provision is being severely damaged by the policies of the European Central Bank. Persistently low interest rates devalue savings assets and deprive people of the opportunity to provide appropriately privately for their pension.  In addition, in my country, the parties have been competing for the highest pensions for years. As a result, around 100 billion from the federal budget are already being paid into pensions. Of course, many other areas such as education, infrastructure, defence, family support and much more suffer from this. Nevertheless, every second pension in Germany is less than 800 euros. The ratio of contributors and contributors is getting worse and worse and will not improve in the future.  Already today, social transfers to immigrants per capita in Germany are higher than those to domestic welfare recipients. Unfortunately, Germany is increasing the number of low-skilled or unqualified immigrants further, thereby depriving it of financial leeway. Citizens whose life insurance policies, as well as their savings, are devalued, are increasingly relying on state pensions, even low pensions or social assistance, at least in Germany.  In the euro area, we need the policy of banks and insurers to be unbundled, not an increase in interdependence and dependence.

Ms Trebesius is not sticking around to explain that to me, because I actually think that we rely a great deal on immigration for our economy and for the future of our health-care and pension systems. Never mind. I’m not really sure why we’re having this debate today on ‘fighting privatisation and strengthening public universal social security systems’. I mean it sounds as if a fierce attack were being mounted on our pension systems by private actors. I have not noticed that. I may not have read the newspapers properly but, as far as I can see, in those cases where there is an attack on pension systems, it’s twofold. One type of attack is by trade unions and left-wing parties who are refusing reform of the public systems, at the expense of the younger generation. They’re protecting the rights of the elderly. The average age of the board members of pension funds is, I believe, 56! I think there should be more 18-year-olds on the boards, deciding about their own future. Okay. The second type of attack is actually by governments because the attack that I’ve seen in certain countries, mainly in central and eastern Europe, has involved the government nationalising pension funds. This is basically doing what is being advocating here. They nationalised the pension funds in what I would call highway robbery, because people’s savings then went into the public coffers and were used for other purposes. In my dictionary that’s theft. In the Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP) report – because of course that’s at the root of all this – we explicitly emphasised the need for strong first and second pillars. Nobody has denied the need for a strong public system, but there is also a third pillar – and I’m coming to a conclusion, Madam President! There is a third pillar which may allow people to achieve a proper pension in countries where the state systems do not supply that. That is what we want to achieve.

There always used to be a trade—off between working in the public and the private sector. The private sector was the wealth creator. There was high risk, but it also provided high rewards. Life in the public sector was low risk, by which I mean job security, but also provided rewards that were far lower than those expected in the private sector. It is, after all, the private sector that generates the taxes, the price we pay for a civilised society, and high-grade public services run by first-class public sector workers who knew that, barring economic catastrophe, they had a job for life. Now we have a complete reversal of the situation. Public sector pensions are protected, incredibly generous and yet horrifyingly unfunded. The money has got to come from somewhere, and no government has been honest enough to say where or even speculate if these promises will be met. Private sector pensions in Britain were the gold standard. That was until Gordon Brown raided them in the early Blair years and abolished the tax relief that pension funds earned on dividends from stock market investment. That was the end of final salary and many successful private pensions in Britain. Those now relying on the state pension can look on and see one of the worst in the developed world and one that they will have to work longer to see.

Therefore, no system is satisfactory: neither public funding, always closely linked to unemployment or work, depending on the time, many of which have been mismanaged, often bordering on scandals, when one looks at the general level of pensions in Europe; nor the private system, since the 2008 crisis showed the seriousness of the dysfunctions of predatory pension funds. So the new world that is opening up, with digitization, robotics and also economic migration flows, requires us to be very attentive and above all very rigorous. Unfortunately, the complementary European system proposed to us by the Commission will not be able to benefit the most vulnerable, who would need it most. It may even become monopolistic. So yes, of course, to several pillars of retirement - the public, the private sector and personalized savings - but always under the strict control and guarantee of the states, because it is not possible to make our pensioners the poor of today and tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 188, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Κωνσταντίνος Παπαδάκης (NI).", "mepid": "125093", "text": "   Madam President, the SYRIZA-ANEL government maintains in Greece the anti-labour legislation on new pension cuts from the beginning of 2019 and is making good on workers with the haggling it makes with the troika, when it has agreed to cuts in pension expenditure of up to 7.8 billion over the next three years.

Take the Netherlands: about 90% coverage in terms of private pensions and in my own country, Ireland, for the private sector, the figure is about 40%, and massive varieties.  The only way we are going to get to a better place is with solid policies. The truth of the matter is that for the public sector, as regards their pensions, the best way to protect pillar one pensions into the future is for governments to run surpluses to put money aside so that their pensioners into the future have guarantees with regard to the basic old age pension for people as they get older. We need the private sector as part of this debate. I heard some ideological views from the left that we don’t, but we do. We have a totally underdeveloped personal pension area when it comes to private pensions in Europe. The market is currently worth about EUR 700 billion. That could double in the next 10 years if we get it right, and that’s about ensuring some certainty for savers, proper tax treatment when it comes to encouraging people to put money aside and also auto-enrolment, as they have in the Netherlands and other places, which encourages people to put money aside from a very early age. We should encourage people to save, and that is a personal responsibility, but it also makes sure that the mix of public policy is right.

We know how the imbalance between men and women argues against women, argues against those who benefit from atypical employment schemes, against those who are not today salaried.

That is also why we have argued that the costs and charges on these basic schemes should not exceed 1% of the accumulated annual capital, which we have obtained, with the rapporteur's agreement, and I thank her for that. It is also for this reason that we have refused to allow the use of this product to be a means of developing a kind of tax dumping that would have allowed some to use this product as a financial investment tool and then to benefit from a tax regime of their free choice in the countries most favourable to capital accumulators.

Speaking in this debate, I would like to remind you that social security systems modelled on the Bismarck system created in the second half of the 19th century in Germany are the basis of modern welfare states. However, due to the increasing average life expectancy of insured persons and demographic problems in many countries, these systems increasingly require support from the budgets of individual Member States. However, the steady increase in wages in the economy and, consequently, the increase in the payment of insurance premiums, as well as the increase in the number of employees employed under the employment contract from which contributions are paid, mean that budget subsidies to the pension system do not have to increase at all. A good example in this case is my country, Poland, where such subsidies have not been increasing for two years.  However, the most important element of future pension systems is the demographic policy supporting fertility, as in the long term this is a key factor that will ensure the efficiency of pension systems in individual Member States. Three years ago, Poland also decided to support family policy by implementing the Family 500+ programme, for which it allocates around 1.5% of its GDP per year, which I would like to stress very strongly.

The differences in pension provisions between Member States in the EU are life-size. It is impossible and undesirable to turn it into a kind of European unity sausage. Pension system deserve customization. And that customization can be delivered especially at national level.  However, that does not mean that we do not have a common challenge. Ageing, for example, is taking place in all European countries. At the turn of the century we counted about four workers per pensioner. In a few decades we have fallen back to two workers who will have to pay the costs for one pensioner. So we are facing a huge challenge when it comes to the affordability of the first pillar in particular. That challenge is there in all countries. We must therefore ensure from the EU that our regulations do not make it more difficult for those countries that already have successful second-pillar pensions, but that we encourage other countries to set up such systems as well.  When we voted on IBPV legislation here, we commissioned the Commission to set up a high-level working group to examine how to boost occupational pension provision. I would very much appreciate it if Commissioner Oettinger could give a little update on this.  At the same time, I find it regrettable – like others – that the left is actually trying to create a kind of false contradiction between the first pillar and the other pillars with this debate.

The first pillar of the pension must first be strong, i.e. with a replacement rate that does not plunge pensioners into poverty.

It needs to be modernized, of course, but not only in relation to the ageing of the population, but also in relation to new forms of contracts. Today, we see employment reforms, at zero contribution rates, which are only gifts to businesses, but which are deadly for the pension system. And so to say that pensions are not within European competence is wrong because the European Semester system today requires countries to make savings in their social security. And social security is the pension system. Today, social security is approached, not on the basis of the well-being of individuals, but on the savings that we will be able to make. It is a short-term management of social security. So transferring the collective solidarity solution of pay-as-you-go pensions to an individual system of capitalisation is not the solution. PEPP (a pan-European individual retirement savings product) may be a financial savings product, which we probably need to improve.

It is astonishing that we are only now addressing the crisis in state pension systems, where this crisis has actually been looming for decades. I am here at the ripe age of 56, and I was a member of the baby boomers in Germany. We know that in Germany and in many other European countries, the birth rate has been steadily declining since the 1960s. And while we still had a birth surplus in the 1960s and the population grew, it has been shrinking for decades. This shrinking population is causing the levy system to go into deep crisis. Because, of course, the rate of return of the levy procedure depends crucially on the size of the population growth rate. We have been in a situation for a long time now where the rate of population growth is negative. In other words, it is not possible to build up a sustainable guarantee of pension provision solely on the basis of the levy procedure.  The alternative is, of course, a capitalisation procedure, and this capitalisation procedure is now being maddened by colleagues on the left and those on the far right. They say this is a vicious form of privatization. No, that's not it! This is simply another offer to citizens to better secure themselves at a time when the levy system has reached the limits of its capacity. It must be seen that it is not only demographic developments that jeopardise the pay-as-you-go procedure. We must not only see that the increase in life expectancy continues to strain the pay-as-you-go system, at least if we do not also increase the retirement age at the same time. Another problem is that the pay-as-you-go procedure, in its foundation as an element of the intergenerational contract, was actually an insurance against unwanted childlessness. And today the problem is that there is far more than the problem of unwanted childlessness. There is the big problem of wanting childlessness – people who simply don't want to raise children or want to be humble with a child. These people have great earning potential. They pay into the pay-as-you-go system and draw the corresponding income from the pensions of the pay-as-you-go system. But they do not fulfil the second part – or, if you like, the first part – of the intergenerational contract, that they also give birth to and raise children themselves, and then pay those children into the pension insurance system later. Because of these difficulties in the pay-as-you-go procedure, we need to supplement the pay-as-you-go procedure, and this can be a capitalisation procedure. It is now completely wrong for colleagues on the left and colleagues on the far right to see it as a vicious privatisation. Because, of course, it is the case that private companies can offer this. But it is just as well possible for the state to offer a capitalisation procedure. There is really no objection to the fact that the State also saves an asset fund and that, for example, non-insurance benefits, which are currently subject to the pay-as-you-go procedure, are fed from such an asset fund or from the income of the asset fund. Many states already have what is called a sovereign wealth fund, but few actually use it to address the pressing problem of retirement provision. We could do that. We could use this asset fund to invest in much-needed tasks, for example in the area of infrastructure investment. We could encourage business investment with high rates of return and use the returns to better hedge old age. These are all possibilities which the levy procedure does not have at its disposal. And if there is such a state-driven capitalization procedure, then the state also has an interest in high interest rates. The problem that has been raised is that we now have a low interest rate phase and that the capitalisation procedure is no longer worthwhile and that the Riester pension has halved in present value, for example, would be solved if the state finally ensured that we were earning decent interest on our savings.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 200, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "António Marinho e Pinto (ALDE).", "mepid": "124742", "text": "   – Madam President, a privileged instrument for realising the ethical-political imperative of solidarity is the existence of a pension system that guarantees conditions of dignity in old age.

They paid with their taxes and contributions to schools where we study for free as children, adolescents and young people, as well as the health services we all benefit from.

I don't think I'm the first to stress this this afternoon: will there still be a pension for us, for my generation? Ageing is a fact. Figures show that the population will continue to increase. But the active population will continue to decline at the same time. That's less of a working way to support more people. This means increasing costs for public pensions, which will become increasingly difficult to finance. As former President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, said: 'With an evolution from four to two active people for one pensioner within fifty years, it is no longer a question of left or right, but purely arithmetic.'  I believe that the real solution to control pension costs is contained in three things: Firstly, we need to get public budgets in the euro area in order, so that there is room to absorb the growth in pension costs.  Secondly, the degree of activity must be increased. The more people are in work, the more contributions there are to pensions.  Thirdly, re-measures are needed to reform the pension system itself and to keep people in work longer.  Finally, part of the solution is also for people to invest more in a supplementary pension themselves. We have known for longer than today that public money will not be available in the long term. Incentives must therefore be put in place to make both the second and third pillars accessible to all.  All too often it is the bottom of society that does not set aside money for later. The fact that the parties that are supposedly standing up for these people are on the brakes for ideological reasons is wrong, even unjust. The private market can indeed offer solutions. But then we must all dare to sit at the table and create a framework for this. For example, after retirement, people have the security of a guaranteed supplementary income, on top of the pension, for the rest of their life.

For three reasons: First, the return on money is currently low. Interest rates are lower than ever. This means that money will not work for us and there is still talk in this Parliament of a pan-European pension product. Again, people will have to save, while the money does not yield much. Interest rates are low. The return is low. What we do need is for people to stay fit, enjoy going to work and being able to handle that work, even at a later stage of their career. But for that we have to invest and not save. The second reason is that money is looking for financial returns, when it should be about social returns. Not only profit but also people and planet. That's exactly what sustainable finance is about, which is a broader look so that pension funds and insurers don't just put money into fossil energy companies, companies that violate human rights, or companies that evade taxes. There is also a social return. Thirdly, return cannot be without risk. It is therefore a matter of achieving a fair distribution of those risks.

I suggested yesterday to Mr Tsipras that he should keep the 24 billion euros left over from the third loan package and recapitalise the insurance funds with 12 billion euros. To ensure the sustainability of the insurance system! There is no need to cut pensions! This was imposed by the IMF. The evidence shows that there should be no reduction in pensions both because of the procedures but also because of the very social sensitivity that needs to be done. So there is a solution: recapitalisation of the insurance system! We recommended it.

We believe that occupational pensions along different cultures in the Member States is also a second sensible, albeit narrower pillar. And we believe that even grown private pension schemes, often motivated by tax incentives, have a complementary – not replaceable – meaning as a third pillar.  However, the market for private pension products in Europe is not sufficiently exhausted. And only in a few Member States does private pension provision have a significant importance, with up to fifteen per cent of total pension provision. And here we want to make an offer – not a duty.

Who and how the rules of the game are set in the global economy will have an essential impact on the future of pensions. Privatization is not the answer to the sustainability of the pension system. Private pension funds are risky financial products that are based on speculation. A robust, well-organized and run public social security system is much safer and more economically efficient.

Previous EU debates on pensions (Green Paper, White Paper on Pensions) have shown that, due to historical circumstances, established institutional systems, other characteristics (different levels of earnings, traditions, financial infrastructure) systems are quite different, and that their changes can only be made slowly, under the right conditions, in close interaction with various factors. It is not possible to develop optimal solutions for pension systems that are equally useful for all countries. There's no decorated model that can be copied. This was also convinced by the EP debates on pensions in the wake of the White Paper. At the same time, a number of questions relating to the future of pensions, such as demographic trends and ageing challenges, put on the agenda questions for which jointly formulated answers and methods can be useful.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner and ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. It is a great honour and pleasure for me to present the Council's position on the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2019 here today, as an MEP, but above all in the even greater interest of the citizens who are here today and can also watch live.  I am pleased that, during the Austrian Presidency too, it has been possible to draw up a balanced commission proposal and to be able to adopt it unanimously with all the Member States. We have drawn up a proposal which provides for a total budget approach to the commitments of EUR 164 billion for 2019. And this proposal has succeeded in achieving an increase of 2.09% compared to 2018.  I am pleased that Parliament's report, which was adopted by a large majority in this House on 5 July, also confirmed that we have been able to achieve a great deal of agreement on the priorities we are setting for the European Union for 2019 and beyond. And so, in the Council's proposal – together with this Report by Parliament – we see a good basis for being able to discuss and adopt these common priorities in a common budget in 2019. The clear priorities we see together relate to the issue of youth in Europe, our common future, which is also manifested in the strengthening and promotion of young people at European level, growth and employment – also as a basis for social peace in Europe – and the issue of security and migration.  We all know that, at the same time, we are facing major challenges, especially in 2019. We do not yet know what the negotiations on the UK's exit will be. We are currently having major discussions with America in connection with trade relations, which are also under discussion at global level. We also see from this summer that in many regions of Europe natural disasters, exemplified by a major drought, are likely to put an additional strain on us in the future in budgetary reasons. The migration crisis has taken on a level that has improved significantly compared to recent years. Nevertheless, just referring to Today's speech by President Jean-Claude Juncker, it is important to point out that we need to act here, particularly with regard to migration, which is on the move on the continent of Africa and where we are called upon to take measures to improve this situation.  For all of us, and you in particular, 2019 is also an election year for the European Parliament. This makes it all the more important to demonstrate here and to show that we are able to work together – the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Council – to lay a common basis on what we are responsible for in terms of expenditure towards taxpayers at European level.  Allow me to mention a few important basic data on the Council's position: the starting point of the Commission's proposal has laid a basis for an increase of around three% compared to 2018. I make no secret of the fact that this was a very difficult starting point for the discussion in the Council's discussions with all the Member States, because in most Member States the budget estimates are well below this increase approach, and I dare say that it is my own responsibility: we have planned an increase of less than one% for Austria's budget for 2018 and 2019. Therefore, our position and our proposal, with sensible, balanced planning, but with an increase of more than two% as I announced at the start, is the common one. can also cover important projects well. The Council's proposed position for the 2019 budget, unlike the Commission's proposal, is a difference of around EUR 1.5 billion. This is significantly lower than the difference in the previous year's proposal. It is important that we all recognise that it will be necessary to use this approach to increase, in particular, to continue high-performing programmes and to support priorities in the right form, as outlined in the introduction. In order to put the priorities into practice with measures, I would like to give some examples to which we have paid particular attention: we have earmarked an increase of ten percent for the Erasmus programme in this proposal, an increase of six percent for the agenda of the Horizon 2020 research agenda, and an increase of six per cent for the Erasmus programme. the expansion of our infrastructure network in this area in Europe, an increase of 25 percent and, in parallel, an increase of 30 percent for the transport networks, an increase of 55 percent in the area of migration capital, of which an additional 10 percent for foreign policy, with a conscious focus on our priority issue of the Western Balkans and in the approximation in the sense of the common partnership for the future an increase of plus 40 percent.  We were particularly critical of the Commission's proposal, in that we provided for a significant reduction of EUR 66 million in our proposal in terms of administrative expenditure. We see here the need to seek a ceiling of two per cent in order to ensure that, above all, the efficiency and effectiveness of administration in all the institutions, bodies and agencies of the European Union are seen as a clear objective and a clear signal for this issue of optimisation and efficiency.  In addition, we have added three statements to this proposal and to this Council position: firstly, it is the well-known and familiar approach of the declaration on sufficient resources for payments in the field of agriculture and cohesion.  In addition, we have added two new declarations, which refer to an audit of administrative expenditure, which, as mentioned above, constitutes a particular and important point in the proposal. We want to analyse the high stock of so-called earmarked revenue in this area. And in this statement, we ask Commissioner Oettinger, also with regard to our negotiations, to give a more detailed analysis in the presentation.  In the third declaration, we would like to draw attention to an agreement dating back to 2017, which is to keep and make the agreed increases by 2020 budget neutral and to the fact that this has not yet been achieved in this form, which is why an additional spectrum is needed in the context of the 2019 budget and budget.  Allow me, Madam President, honourable Members and Commissioners and guests, to conclude by saying that, starting with this debate in the coming weeks and months, I believe that we have the opportunity to underline the common ground – a great opportunity, which is that we have the opportunity for all sides – both Parliament, the Commission, but above all from our side – with our proposal. to jointly negotiate and adopt a sensible, sustainable and also correct budget for 2019. And I can promise you and promise that, as the Austrian Presidency, we will make every effort within the Council to conduct these joint negotiations constructively and do everything possible in this area to achieve a good result.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 237, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Löger, rapporteur Viotti and Mr Rübig, Mr Arthuis, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and gentlemen for the work he has done on this report. We – both the Council and Parliament and the Commission – have shared common objectives with the budget: on the one hand, growth and employment, strengthening European competitiveness and, secondly, security and the abandonment of migration policy. In the area of migration and security, we are grateful that the Council proposal does not provide for any reductions in the Commission's approach to the AMIF asylum, migration and integration fund, as well as to Frontex or EASO and Europol, that is to say, central agencies. In other programmes, such as COSME or Erasmus+, the Council's approaches and proposals are also encouraging and forward-looking for us. We are counting on us to meet the time frame in the coming weeks. It is the last budget proposal to be debated and decided by this Parliament, the second last one drawn up by the Commission, and it is the first to see the british friends leave for more than nine months. We are grateful that, in the negotiations, the UK has so far continued its willingness to exercise all the rights and obligations of the budgetary framework by the end of 2020, thus remaining a stable partner in 2019. In other words, a normal budget. We want to talk to Parliament and the Council about the approaches, and I admit that what the Council is proposing is not really cuts, but corrections from an increased commission proposal. We are concerned about a few programmes as far as the Council's approach is concerned. I believe that the European Union should not save on research. We have, incidentally, supported by the European Council, for years and days, a 3% target in relation to our European gross national product, but we are only 2%. Austria is one of the few Member States that has reached 3 or even more than 3%. This makes it all the more important that we do everything we can to strengthen horizons and thus allow existing programmes and joint ventures to continue, and also to launch new ones – artificial intelligence and more. We are concerned about the Council's approach to the issue of the Connecting Europe Facility. I mention two outstanding projects: the Brenner Base Tunnel between Austria and Italy and Rail Baltica – a project between Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. For both, we should avoid delays in tendering and awarding, and thus implementation. This has to do with the actual appropriations. The same applies to Copernicus, where we can only provide emergency services, border surveillance services and other important services if the Commission's proposal is complied with. We are therefore aware that there will be differences between Parliament and the Council on the issue of financing the Turkey-EU agreement in the second tranche. We should be prepared to compromise on the issue of a billion or two billion or a division between Europe's budget and the Member States' injections of between one and two billion. We, as the Commission, will take a critical look at administrative expenditure. This is not just about the Commission, it is about all the institutions. We have frozen the appropriations for expenditure in kind. In terms of human resources expenditure, we are guided by what should be the corresponding percentage adjustment in 2019 as a formula from many Member States and their salary growth in the public sector. And since we do not have a pension fund, but of course there has been a significant increase in the Number of Member States over the last decade, we now also have an extraordinary development in pension expenditure, which is reflected accordingly in heading 5. We are happy to go into this in detail in the negotiations. I am grateful for the objective admission. We look forward to Parliament's position, which will come in a few weeks' time. We will present you with an amendment in October, and I am grateful to you for your personal contribution, for taking the lead in the negotiations in the Council. This is a clear sign.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a busy day here in Parliament today. This morning the votes on Hungary, the vote to activate sanctions finally against Hungary, and not against the Hungarian people, but for their freedom, for freedom of the press, for just justice. Then the copyright vote, and I personally came out quite disappointed today. I do not think this will be the way to protect small publishers, to protect authors and so on, but perhaps we will have a different, less free Internet. And then now we get to the heart of the budget debate. I would like to thank the Minister for being here with us and for making an immediate commitment to accompany us and to discuss this budget with us together, but I would like to say a few very clear words to him. This debate, these two months that separate us from the final for the adoption of the budget, will be a derby. And it will be a derby exactly between those who think they want to give Europe a perspective and a future for Europe and those who only want to control the public accounts. It will be a derby between those who think they can give prosperity and priorities to our businesses, our universities, our municipalities, our citizens and those who will only have a look at the vegetable garden of the next elections in May 2019. And again between those who want to give real solutions to the issue of migration and those who want to howl at the bad Europe that is not able to provide solutions. Minister, I think – and I say this, if You will allow me, with a joke – that at this stage we are looking at the next budget with different lenses, with deforming lenses. You look at the next budget with the lens of the 2018 budget, and then you talk about the increases that have taken place, the increases that you have put in your reading, and I look at your reading of the 2019 budget instead with the lens of the European Commission's proposal, which is a proposal that is based on the accounts that come in and on the reality that the European Commission sees before it. So you want some data? The figures are that compared with the European Commission's budget proposal there are cuts of 794 million on research and development on line 1, there are three million cuts in youth unemployment, there are 340 million cuts in agriculture in your budget proposal. These are the deforming lenses, and we want to work on that. And then there is the great question of Africa and the countries from which migration originates. We want to deal with this in a very serious way. My government says, says its government, all the governments of Europe say that they must be helped at home, an expression that I do not like at all. If, however, this is the objective, but if we really want, I say, to eradicate and eradicate the real reasons for migration – poverty, security, instability of governments, wars, etc. – we need to invest. Instead, in your draft budget there is a cut of EUR 306 million on the fourth line of the European budget, that is, humanitarian aid, cooperation and peace instruments. I want to increase these figures. I want to increase these figures, because I think that migration and the security of migration are done by investing in these countries. Finally, I would like to say a few words, Minister, Commission. I would like to thank you once again and I think that the path and the dialogue will be constructive. But one thing must be explained well to the citizens: that what this House is asking for, what Parliament is asking for is not the moon. I come to the end, Madam President. This money, you have to tell the citizens, this money is there. This money is available and can be invested, just want it. I believe that we can make a journey together, the Council and Parliament, to find a solution to the issues that are there. With regard to the subject of Turkey, touched on by the Commissioner, I would simply like to say that there is only one possibility of compromise, to respect the pacts that have been reached in the past, and we will certainly find a solution, a solution that will satisfy our citizens and, above all, give a perspective.

Madam President, Federal Minister Löger, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work he has done on this report. Budget is always a negotiating issue. It is important to focus on setting common goals and preparing a budget that invests in Europe, where growth and jobs are generated. That is why it is important that we see that a great deal of performance is being done not only in the Commission budget, but also in the other institutions – we have nine other institutions, in addition to the Commission, which make up approximately EUR 4 billion. When I look at how different the rates of increase are here, I see that data protection – and we have just adopted the General Data Protection Regulation – is at the top, with a plus of 16%. That is why I also support the Council's cuts of around EUR 100 000. That is not very much, but it is a symbol of the fact that very large increases are also subject to a reduction. One of my concerns is the financing of the European Court of Justice. We have talked about Brexit, and on Brexit it is clear that disputes arising from Article 50 must be dealt with quickly and efficiently by the Court of Justice. That is why the 16 posts here are a prerequisite for whether the Withdrawal Treaty or hard Brexit can also be resolved by the court and not by other institutions. This year, we have finally made the 5% reduction in staff, and Parliament has also cut its posts by 5%. This is, of course, already noticeable in the House. But the difference between the European budget and the national one is also very large: the European level ultimately has less than 1% of GDP available, the nation states 30 to 50%.

Thus ends a ritual exercise of plank. What I see is that, year after year, the overall cut is growing: 1.2 billion in 2018, 1.55 billion in 2019. By amplifying - we have heard your message, Minister - the margins available, the Council gives the impression that it is seeking to protect itself, showing a kind of timidity, turning the European Union budget into a budgetary back-up wheel, as it does for the financing of the reception of Syrian refugees in Turkey. The phase of bureaucratic arbitrariness must give way to that of political vision and engagement. On the eve of the European elections, we must send a clear and voluntary message to European citizens. Let us respond to their impatience by confirming a Europe that speaks to them, a Europe that prepares for their future, a Europe that protects them. To agree to increase the margins for unforeseen events would be to forego action and show our inability to decide. This last budget of the legislature must carry an understandable message, a promising message. Preparing for the future means making research a priority and empowering our researchers and laboratories. For example, in an area as crucial as digital, can we resign ourselves to the need for global giants to be American or Chinese and not European? Preparing for the future also means investing in education and vocational training, and offering young people the opportunity to meet European diversity through Erasmus scholarships. I have heard your comment, Minister, there is progress. But you should know that despite this progress, Erasmus is causing frustration, as almost one in two eligible applications is rejected each year. Protecting Europeans means taking stock of migration challenges and having greater resources to control our external borders and implement a new partnership with African countries, whose population will double by 2050, as President Juncker reminded this morning in this Chamber, is to establish constructive relations with the countries of the neighbourhood, the Balkans and the Middle East. Protecting Europeans means giving substance to structured cooperation in defence and security, in the fight against globalised terrorism. In two weeks, informed by our rapporteur-general Daniele Viotti and Paul Rubig, the Committee on Budgets will vote on its own version of the 2019 budget. Then comes the time for the plenary, here in Strasbourg, at the end of October, and we will start conciliation. In advance, I thank the Austrian Presidency, Mr Minister, for your presence and your commitment, which I have no doubt. I thank you and Commissioner Oettinger, who had to leave us, for your understanding and for the help you will give us. In conclusion, I would like to express my strong hope that the 2019 budget will not simply be an extension of previous budgets that mark a new plank in commitment appropriations and in payment appropriations. The time has come to identify the common European goods, that is, the prerogatives of sovereignty that States can no longer exercise on their own because of the challenges that globalisation poses to them, whether it is climate, defence, migration, space, terrorism, digital and artificial intelligence. May we convince our Heads of State and Government that the appropriations, which have become ineffective when they are committed at the national level, must now be transferred to the European Union budget in order to be spent more usefully. This would be demonstrated as to what European added value can be. In other words, the European Union budget would increase without increasing public spending in Europe. Europe is in crisis, Europe is in danger. We were elected to restore it and restore confidence to all Europeans.

The contributions have shown that we will have a constructive and critical discussion in the coming weeks. However, I am also happy to take up the image of the general rapporteur, Mr Viotti, who, as an Austrian in particular, has called on me, as an Austrian, to enter a derby, where I confess that Austria is unlikely to make it in football at the moment. But – and I am happy to accept the picture: my image and my hope is that, as it has been mentioned, we will be able to form a joint team in the coming weeks, a joint team from Parliament, the Commission and also from the Council's point of view, in order to prepare ourselves for the points that we have already defined and found together in terms of content. , to provide the right measures and to put the right budget funds behind them for 2019. Our adversaries are not here, our adversaries are on a global scale – others who are trying to weaken Europe, others who are trying to undermine and undermine this European future. Therefore, in all the necessary discussions that we are going to have, I should like to remember that, in the end, we must form a team together to deliver for Europe, for the citizens, what we need, namely as victors at global level, as a united Europe, to look to the future as a united Europe. I would like to make a few points. We have deliberately defined this proposal in a balanced form, and I make no secret of the fact that we, too, are certainly more dynamic here or there in the Council proposal, in a medium- and long-term perspective. But it is a responsibility that we have in common to be able to afford the programmes and the measures that we are taking. We must also live up to the responsibility of the taxpayers in Europe, and we in the Council take them very seriously, namely to ensure that we achieve this budget and budget in 2019 on the basis of reasonable resources. Finally, once again, I would like to make an appeal: we have the opportunity to discuss things together, and I am prepared to go into tough discussions and accept the conflicts. However, it is important that we finally recognise, including in the proposal that Parliament will prepare and adopt in the coming weeks on the basis of this discussion: we will go through the objective together. I am building on the constructive basis that has emerged in today's discussion and the common objectives that we will be able to demonstrate in time as a clear symbol for the citizens of Europe that we – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – are capable of achieving common objectives with the 2019 budget. We owe that to the Europeans.

An aspect defining the entire seven-year EU financial framework is to avoid a payment crisis at the end of previous programmes, when there are not enough resources left in the budget by the end of the cycle.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her It can be said that since 2011 we have been creating something like a road traffic code for the digital society. The General Data Protection Regulation and Directive are the basis for the most comprehensive and modern data protection legislation in the world in order to effectively protect citizens' fundamental rights, their right to informational self-determination. And as is the case with road traffic, it must be clear who has priority, where one-way streets are, at what speed you can set off. And, of course, the rules must apply everywhere. Otherwise it will not be possible. Traffic has no limits. The aim of this regulation is now to implement the data protection package, if you like, in the European institutions and for the European Data Protection Supervisor. I can say with a clear conscience that we have really ensured that what applies to every EU citizen on data protection must, of course, also apply to the EU institutions – such as the Council, the European Parliament, the Commission – and not everyone can cook their own soup and that it simply should not be so easy to ask future assistants here in the European Parliament. How many cigarettes they smoke, whether they've been to the psychiatrist, what illnesses their parents had, and so on and so forth. But the European Public Prosecutor should also be subject to the same rules, Eurojust and, of course, Europol. I would remind you that the Europol regulation is the only one, the only law in which biometric data is still not counted as particularly sensitive data. And to Europol, I would also like to say quite conciliatoryly: no, Parliament never intended to undermine Europol's work – on the contrary, to create transparency, including in terms of data protection. I think we will be able to do that by 2022. However, the regulation also regulates stronger competences – and this was very important to us – for the European Data Protection Supervisor and data protection officer in general. And here we really agreed: more competences must be found here and, above all, resources must be significantly increased. We also wanted a strong data protection committee. In this context, the regulation also introduces a new model of coordinated supervision for database and information systems. Up to now, for centralised systems containing data from the Member States, there has been a separate supervisory body consisting of EDPS, national authorities, each with its own procedures, its own chairmanship, its own Tralala, I say now. We have actually put an end to this in order to have a single mechanism of control. And that's good. We are also pleased to have contributed a little to transparency and freedom of information. This is the system for access to EU documents. There, we have achieved an important clarification that citizens who want to receive certain information from the EU cannot simply be fed cheaply. And with that, we have implemented a bit of the court rulings in the Bavarian Lager and Dennekamp cases in this law. However, as is always the case in life, there is also a downside, and that is internal rules that we all cannot particularly suffer. However, these are half-sensible precisely where specific rules are needed to carry out tasks – OLAF, for example – or because the GDPR has given up room for manoeuvre and homework in some places for the Member States, as well as for the balance of freedom of expression and data protection, without, however, – and this was important to us – undermining, undermining, the existing law. That is why safety nets and the control of the EDPS were also necessary. Let me conclude by saying a personal word: thank you to the shadow rapporteurs, who were really my absolute support. We are a small group, and we really have to work on this. And also thank you to the staff. Otherwise we would not have been able to act in this way. We would also like to thank the Commission, which not only put a good draft on the table, but was helpful as a mediator, the Legal Service, the LIBE Secretariat. These are all professional props. I got to know that. Thank you very much! And I say to the Council: it still has a lot to do, namely ePrivacy. We are through, we are done with our homework and now we expect them to be done by the Council.

The final text provides the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies with a strong and coherent data protection framework aligned with the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as, where relevant, the Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive. It will ensure that everyone is protected when EU institutions and agencies process their personal data, whether it is staff of the EU institutions, visitors to our buildings or recipients of EU funding. Let me briefly go through the main elements of the regulation. The final text introduces novel concepts in line with the General Data Protection Regulation such as data protection by design and by default, the need to notify a personal data breach to the European Data Protection Supervisor and to the data subject – the people affected by the breach – and the need for a data protection impact assessment prior to processing when this might result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of people. The agreement modernises data subject rights, in particular by introducing the right to data portability, an explicit reference to the right to be forgotten, and the need to provide the data subject with more information. Article 25, providing for the possibility to use internal rules to restrict data subject rights, strikes the right balance. While respecting the requirements of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it meets the operational needs of Union institutions and bodies. The legal text meets the quality of law requirement as formulated by both the Luxembourg and Strasbourg courts. The new rules will abolish unnecessary bureaucratic requirements such as, for instance, prior checks. Supervision has also been reinforced, in line with the General Data Protection Regulation. The European Data Protection Supervisor will now have the possibility to impose a pecuniary fine on a Union institution, body, office or agency, which is an unprecedented power in EU law. Finally, a word on the issue of scope, which has been the subject of many discussions. The Commission welcomes the balanced result, which has been reached after intense negotiations. The Commission has always called for a coherent data protection regime for all institutions, bodies, offices and agencies to avoid unnecessary fragmentation. At the same time, the specific nature of the work of law enforcement agencies needs to be recognised, and interoperability between these EU agencies and Member State authorities needs to be ensured. The inclusion of Eurojust under the scope of this regulation and the review clause for the Europol and European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) regulations are important achievements in this regard. The Commission, however, regrets the complete exclusion of missions referred to in Articles 42/1, 43 and 44 of the Treaty under the Common Security and Defence Policy from the scope of the regulation, as this creates a gap which will need to be filled with additional legislative instruments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 247, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Birgit Sippel", "mepid": "96932", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, the new EU Directive on Data Protection in the area of Police and Judicial Cooperation is sometimes called the little sister of the General Data Protection Regulation. The rules for data protection in the EU institutions are probably not more than a distant cousin in the public eye. However, this does not do the regulation justice. The EU institutions have to make sure that our own data protection rules live up to the high standards that we expect companies and public authorities all over Europe and beyond to comply with. This is precisely what this regulation seeks to do. We as the S&amp;D Group would very much have preferred to have one set of data protection rules for everybody, including the EU institutions. However, the Commission chose a different approach. The data protection rules for EU institutions that we will be voting on tomorrow is, therefore, the third step in our endeavour to secure EU citizens’ fundamental right to data protection. Despite the challenge of having different texts, overall, I think we managed to achieve pretty good results. The new rules are aligned with high data protection regulation standards and, for example, like in GDPR, this regulation guarantees certain rights to citizens, such as the right to know what kind of personal data an EU institution holds about you, as well as the right to ask for the correction or even deletion of those data.  As the S&amp;D Group, we believe that this regulation, coupled with GDPR and the Police Directive, represents an ambitious step towards securing the fundamental rights of persons. In this context, we agree that an independent supervisory body should be set up to ensure the protection of fundamental right to data protection in the EU institutions too. I find it regrettable, however, that EU agencies are not fully covered by this new regulation. Europol, after long debates, continues to have its own set of rules. However, it is our understanding in the S&amp;D Group that the future Europol reform will rectify this problem, thus helping to create legal certainty and uniform rules, including for the processing of operational data.  Together with and on behalf of our shadow, Miriam Dalli, we would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Cornelia Ernst. Together, we managed to agree a piece of ambitious and progressive legislation. Through tomorrow’s vote, this House will show what Parliament and the Council together can achieve in the area of fundamental rights protection in all sectors. In particular, I am happy to see that e-privacy rules are incorporated in this regulation. However, there is a missing piece: the e-privacy regulation for outside the EU institutions. E—privacy seeks to protect the confidentiality of communication as a whole. It was proposed by the Commission in January 2017 and Parliament adopted its position in October. But ever since then, the file has been stuck in the Council. Member States are unwilling to make a bold step towards protecting fundamental rights online, despite the fact that the current e—privacy rules do not even cover main players such as Facebook or WhatsApp, and this has to change. Member States have to move and the Austrian Presidency has to be more ambitious than just aiming for a progress report in December.  To sum up, with the regulation for data protection in EU institutions, we are taking another important step towards ensuring fundamental rights in the digital era, and this House stands ready – and the S&amp;D Group stands ready – to add the missing piece to this protective framework. We want to start negotiations on the e-privacy regulation with the Council now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 248, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Ruža Tomašić", "mepid": "119431", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Club. – Dear Chairman, the General Data Protection Regulation, although it imposed new obligations and restrictions on businesses, has given individuals important guarantees against lawlessness that unfortunately has been known to reign in this area.

It was really a pleasure to work with you and I think the results speak for themselves. Regulation 45/2001 is part of the historic reform of the European Data Protection landscape, which aims to remove legal fragmentation by harmonising common rules in principles between the EU agencies that carry out law enforcement tasks. From the start, the objective of the European Parliament was to end the so-called stand-alone regimes such as Eurojust, Europol and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The final interinstitutional agreement was in the end a victory for the European Parliament, because for the first time we have ensured that the stand-alone regimes cannot deviate from the principles of this regulation. The harmonised rules in the regulation will, furthermore, prevent data protection loopholes in the cooperation between the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Finally, I call on the Commission to evaluate in the future whether to extend the scope of the regulation and to include all EU law enforcement agencies in order to increase the legal consistency of data transfers between EU bodies and agencies, increase mutual trust and data exchange between data agencies, as well as legal certainty for data subjects.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 250, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Romeo Franz", "mepid": "193273", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which The same rules that apply to companies and public authorities in the Member States should also apply to the EU institutions.

Madam President, this proposal for a regulation is of great interest. It transposes to the institutions of the European Union the application of the famous RGPD, the general regulation on the protection of personal data. However, this transposition is a good thing because the EU institutions must lead by example and agree to apply these rules of privacy to individuals on their own. For this is the purpose of this text: it is a question of forcing the Eu institutions to respect the essential protection of the personal data of individuals, just like the Member States.

In this sense, the new rules on the protection of personal data and their processing by the institutions and bodies of the European Union are moving in the right direction.

That is why this legislation needs to be explained consistently. Although the EU institutions in the field of personal data protection are among the very consistent ones, this legislation also needs to be worked on fairly consistently and needs to be explained, so I am glad that the EU is also adopting this legislation at the highest level. Of course, there must be exceptions for some agencies, such as Europol, Eurojust or EUIPO, which, by their very nature, have to perform slightly different tasks and have a different way of handling personal data.

Mr President, a few days ago, a major clean-up of the ocean began in the United States. The images went around the world. The Ocean Cleanup wants to use plastic catchers to help clean up the plastic soup in the Pacific Ocean. I hope that the boyhood dream of the young Dutchman Boyan Slat will be a success. Cleaning up the rubbish of the past is noble, but of course we must first of all ensure that we prevent plastic waste from ending up in the sea. So we need to be more sensible with plastic. That is the focus of our debate here today.  Plastic is an important and valuable material, which is still hard to imagine from our society and economy. The problem is the way we produce and use plastic today. It's untenable. Plastic is developed to last forever, but all too often we only use it once. Sometimes it disappears into the environment after just a few seconds or minutes in the garbage bag, or worse. We are very careless with the material: we produce almost 26 million tonnes of plastic waste every year in the European Union, but only 30% of it collects for recycling.  All this has disastrous consequences for the environment, the climate and the economy. Our ecosystems suffer from pollution. Not least our seas and oceans, which turn into a plastic soup. We are missing opportunities for less CO2 emissions. We are literally draining the euros out of our economy. 95 percent of the value of the material is lost. Moreover, the recent Chinese ban on the import of plastic waste from the European Union is putting our noses in the face. For years, we have conveniently outsourced our plastic waste problem in Europe. We must therefore use the Chinese ban as an opportunity to invest in recycling capacity in the European Union and change our policy.  The momentum there, not only at the political level, is also growing among many citizens to take action. It is about turning this public concern into public responsibility, into joint responsibility. So my report is not a plea against plastic, but it is a plea for a circular economy in which we deal with plastic in a sustainable and responsible way, so that we can stop the harmful consequences and maintain the value in the chain.  To succeed, we need to use the strategy as leverage for circular production and consumption models. We have to deliver customization, as there are no passe-partout solutions. And we need to work together across the entire value chain.  Better and more plastic recycling is the beginning. A few months ago, we adopted new ambitious waste legislation here. A complete and rapid implementation of this is essential. But more is needed: for example, all plastic packaging must be cost-efficiently recyclable or reusable by 2030 at the latest. Through the packaging directive we want to work on a truly circular product design.  Companies can make a difference by linking their brand name and marketing to circular production and consumption models. The creation of a genuine internal market for recycled plastic is also fundamental. Today, the proportion of recycled plastic is estimated to be only 6%. To increase this, we need to strengthen confidence in the market through quality standards and verification. Minimum requirements for recycled content, a lower VAT rate and a circular purchasing policy can also further encourage the use of recycled plastic.  More and better recycling is necessary, but not enough in itself to become a real circular economy. I'm going to keep stressing that. Preventing plastic waste remains crucial. This can be done, among other things, through smart measures on disposable plastic. On this point, the Commission has now come up with a legislative proposal, and we in the Committee on the Environment are working on this together with mr Frédérique Ries and others. My report also calls for a well-thought-out use of bio-plastic. Based on clear standards and criteria, biodegradable plastic can play a supporting role, but it is not a beatifying solution for marine litter. Bio-based plastic can help reduce our dependence on third countries by partially differentiating the raw materials. But research and development are of great importance here to give innovation every opportunity. For oxo-plastic and microplastics in cosmetics, among others, we ask for a ban until 2020. Finally, we call for further research and innovation efforts, including in the next multi-annual financial framework. The EU must also join the global ly and, of course, set a good example in its own institutions. I would like to thank the fellow shadow rapporteurs for the very constructive cooperation.

I would like to inform you of the position in the motion for a resolution by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the implementation of the Circular Economy Package on options for regulating the interface between chemicals product and waste legislation. The aim of this initiative is to minimise the presence of substances of concern in recycled products and to strengthen the market for secondary raw materials. These are raw materials that are extracted from discarded material through recycling. On 16 January this year, the Commission adopted new measures to implement the Circular Economy Action Plan. The Commission communication analysed the four main problems identified at the interface between chemicals product and waste legislation and analysed the extent to which they hinder the development of a circular economy. The four problems mentioned, which I will address later, are, firstly, insufficient information on substances of concern in products and waste, the presence of substances of concern in recycled materials, uncertainties as to the criteria to be met, according to which materials are not considered waste, and fourthly, difficulties in applying the European Union's methods for classifying waste and impacting the recyclability of materials. It is important, in the interests of the circular economy, to fill this gap and to counteract this problem. A number of oral questions have therefore been put to the European Parliament and a motion for a resolution have been drawn up from the European Parliament. In general, the motion for a resolution refers to the following content: the Committee on the Environment welcomes the Communication from the European Commission and the accompanying Staff Working Document. However, rapid action is expected to be taken to address this interface problem. The primary objective of the European Commission should be to prevent hazardous chemicals from entering the material cycle and to achieve full coherence between the implementing rules in waste and chemicals legislation. For a true circular economy, the products must be developed in such a way that they last long, that they can be repaired and reused. And, of course, the products must also be developed with minimal use of substances of concern. The implementation of chemicals product and waste legislation can be a challenge especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Particular attention should be paid to small and medium-sized enterprises. More details on the four issues raised, which have been analysed by the Commission, are, firstly, that substances of concern are those of concern and that substances of concern are those identified as substances of concern under REACH and substances that have been banned under the Stockholm Convention. All substances of concern should be tracked as soon as possible and information on these substances, including their composition and concentration, should be fully accessible to all stakeholders in the supply chain, to recycling companies and to the public. The second defined problem is the handling of the presence of substances of concern in recycled materials. This is primarily about the possibility of recycling materials containing substances of concern. This should only be considered if there are no materials without substances of concern that can be used as substitutes. More than 80% of the environmental impact of a product is to be determined during the design phase. The Ecodesign Directive and other product-specific legislation should be used to lay down requirements for the replacement of substances of concern. It is important to ensure a level playing field between eu-made and imported articles. Products manufactured in the EU must not be penalised by imported products. The third problem defined is the uncertainty about criteria according to which materials are not considered waste. Clear rules are needed to determine the conditions under which something is no longer covered by the waste legislation, and robust criteria for the end of waste status are also needed. These clear EU rules must be designed in such a way that they can also be implemented by small and medium-sized enterprises. On the part of the House, the European Commission and the Member States are invited to consider the criteria for the end of the waste status. The fourth problem defined is the difficulties in applying the European Union's methods for the classification of waste and the consequences of the recyclability of materials. Here, the House believes that the European Commission should revise the European waste list without delay. In conclusion, I would like to say that there is great tension in the committee with the answers from the Commission and the Council to the oral questions, so that they can then enter into a political debate conducted from the centre together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 267, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Karoline Edtstadler", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, the Council welcomed the package of communications presented by the Commission in January 2018 and actions undertaken to deliver on the 2015 Action Plan on the Circular Economy. This is reflected in a set of Council conclusions adopted by the Environment Council on 25 June 2018. The Council calls for a high-level political commitment to be maintained for an ambitious implementation of the whole Circular Economy Action Plan. In this context, its conclusions emphasise that the transition to a truly circular economy involves closing the loop of product life circles and turning them into real value chains through greater recycling. Furthermore, reuse is closely interconnected with creating non-toxic material cycles where substances of concerning products and waste are soundly managed and reduced to a minimum.  This is also underlined in the resolution by the European Parliament on this topic. A more consistent approach between chemical and waste rules is therefore required. It is necessary to establish clearly, together with all stakeholders, what is a substance of concern and how to deal with the presence of such substances in recycled materials. Information to the consumers and all actors in the value chain on the possible presence of substances of concern in materials is of greatest importance.  In this respect, the Council welcomes, as you do in your draft resolution, the recently agreed provisions of the revised Waste Framework Directive that complement existing REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) obligations for suppliers to inform their customers when articles contain substances of very high concern. A relevant tracking system throughout the supply chain should also encompass all products imported into the Union that may contain substances of concern. Secondary raw materials need, in principle, to meet the same criteria as primary raw materials. However, the detoxification of waste containing legacy substances might, in certain cases, require a differentiated approach that also adequately controls the risks for human health and the environment.  In this respect, the Council encourages the Commission’s action to develop a methodology addressing the management of waste containing substances of concern. The Council encourages Member States to make use of all possibilities under the Ecodesign Directive or other product-specific legislation to promote the circularity of products and to support voluntary methods and approaches regarding the substitution of materials containing substances of concern as early as the design phase. The Council underlines that it is important for end-of-waste criteria to be implemented effectively and favours the establishment of guidelines that allow a clear distinction between waste and product status to avoid the need for operators to comply with two sets of rules. Efforts to harmonise these criteria should focus firstly on the most important waste streams.  Finally, the Council calls urgently on the Commission in particular for concrete actions to be taken to remove technical, financial and market barriers preventing recycling and the uptake of secondary raw materials. Effective measures are needed to avoid, remove, or reduce the presence of substances of concern as much and as soon as possible to ensure non-toxic material cycles.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 268, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I really want to thank the Parliament and especially the rapporteur, honourable Member Mark Demesmaeker, and all shadows for a very positive approach towards the plastics strategy. The strategy is fully in line with the thinking and approach we first put forward in the circular economic action plan. It addresses the whole value chain and creates synergies between economic and environmental goals. As you rightly recall in your report, the strategy aims at fostering a new plastics economy where reuse and recycling activities are truly integrated in the production chains, delivering great added value and prosperity in Europe, for example by improving the dialogue and cooperation across the value chain, addressing all its key players from plastics producers to end-users and recyclers. To this end, the wider plastics industry is currently working on voluntary commitments, and a pledging campaign is ongoing to support objectives of this strategy by increasing the uptake of recycled contents in new products. The goal is very simple: to ensure that by 2030 all plastic packaging is reusable or recyclable; that more than half of EU plastics waste is recycled – today it’s only 30%; and that demand for recycled plastics in Europe grows at least four-fold. Today, only 6% of the plastics used in products put on the EU market comes from recycling. To support innovation in this field and guide future funding decisions, the Commission will develop a strategic research innovation agenda for plastics. In the meantime, and by 2020, Horizon 2020 will have invested more than EUR 350 million in plastics innovation. Also, financial incentives are an important way to steer the policies towards a more sustainable future. As you highlighted in your report, in the proposal for the next long-term budget, the Commission foresees a Member State contribution based on the amount of non-recycled plastics packaging waste. Such a contribution putting for the very first time at the EU level the price of the negative externality of not recycling will help implement the Waste Package and the Plastics Strategy. The Plastics Strategy will also help deliver the EU’s energy union vision for low-carbon energy-efficient economy. In terms of CO2 savings, recycling only half of all plastic waste generated in the EU each year would be equivalent to taking off the roads more than 13 million cars. The strategy also announced a new legislative initiative to reduce litter from single-use plastics items and fishing gear. This initiative is already being negotiated by the European Parliament and the Council, as you know. Besides, the Plastics Strategy also features action to reduce pollution from microplastics, the legislative proposal on port reception facilities to tackle sea-based marine litter and the preparation of new labelling rules to ensure that consumers get clear information about biodegradable and compostable plastics. Action is ongoing on all these fronts. Regarding the second question – the oral question submitted by the Parliament in relation to the interface between chemical products and waste legislation – we very much appreciate the Parliament’s interest in this area. In 2015, the Commission made a commitment to assess the issues. This is exactly what we have done in the Communication which we published in January. We identified four main issues and we set out a list of planned actions. These actions will be delivered or well under way by the end of the mandate of the current Commission in 2019. What has been done so far? We published guidelines to promote a more coherent approach to waste classification. We launched a study to develop a specific decision-making methodology to support the decision on the recyclability of waste containing substances of concern. We are also preparing to launch two further studies. Firstly, the visibility study on the use of the information system to enable information on the presence of substances of concern in materials to be available to recyclers. Secondly, the study of Member States’ practices as regards implementation and verification of end-of-waste provisions. The Interface Communication is currently being considered by stakeholders, and an open consultation is running until the end of October. At the end of this process, the Commission will consider the most effective and inclusive way forward for addressing the identified challenges. However, while this is all ongoing work which is on track, I am happy to point out that there have already been some spin-off developments. We found that addressing chemicals of concern in food packaging is not sufficient, because there is a risk of incidental contamination with substances that were not originally present in plastic materials but may originate from use or mis-use of plastics. This situation could prevent effective recycling of food packaging, which is a significant market. Therefore, in the framework of the Regulation on Food Contact Materials, the Commission is currently working on the applications related to around 100 recycling processes to de-contaminate recycled PET to make that material suitable for food packaging. On batteries, we are going to monitor the coherence of different legislative instruments to ensure a smooth functioning of the internal market for batteries, waste batteries and materials coming from recycled batteries. Also, following the recent adoption of the amendments to the Waste Framework Directive, the Commission and the European Chemicals Agency are looking into establishing a database for the future collection of information on substances of very high concern in articles. Such a database would also help to promote non-toxic material recycling and improve the risk management of chemicals during repair and other forms of refuse- and waste-recovering process. With this summary, I trust that you will agree with me that a significant amount of work is already under way to address the interface between chemical products and waste legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 269, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "John Flack", "mepid": "188623", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. – Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague Mark Demesmaeker, and all MEPs involved in this excellent report, and I would like to thank the PECH Committee for the opportunity to work on our contribution to the strategy covering marine plastic litter.

This is a step forward, but we must do more, and now that we are working on the legislative proposal from the Commission, I hope all this good work is taken into account. We think about plastic bottles, bags and straws floating around, but I also want to remind colleagues of the damage done by ghost gear: abandoned fishing nets trapping, strangling and drowning untold numbers of marine mammals and birds, as I highlighted by distributing Netty the dolphin to many, many Members here, and I hope he might have reached the Commission as well.

It was a very fruitful collaboration.  Commissioner, you have taken a broad bow, and as someone who has been in this House for quite a long time, I would then propose the alternative: let us then show how much the Member States have implemented. I am not taking my country out of it. The whole series of the Presidency of the Council would be full, because an unimaginable number of things in Europe have not been implemented in the field of waste. And that is actually regrettable.  Mr Demesmaeker pointed out the figures: 140 million tonnes of plastic waste are floating in the oceans – the equivalent of half of Europe. I've been told that you can see the plastic paints - I think only five pieces in this world - from space. So there is reason enough to do something about it. And I believe that we must also be aware that seventy per cent of this waste is also in the depths of the waters and that it is not easy to get out of it.  We drink it, we taste it, and we inhale plastic. And that is an important reason, because we find it in honey, in meat, in all sorts of circumstances. That is one of the reasons why we need to get to the bottom of it. The consequences are that one day we will also notice this in terms of health. And I'm really not an anxious man, but I don't want to hide the fact that plastic is a great success for society, because we have it for the freshness of food etc., etc., blood bags are made with it – so all things that are important. And, Commissioner, you have rightly said this, and Mr Demesmaeker has also said that we must deal with it better, we must allow a process of awareness to be carried out in our minds and we really think about what we are doing with it.  We have increased our plastic quantities twentyfold since 1960. All of this is reason enough to actually increase the thirty per cent that we are recycling so far.

Mr President! The transition to a sustainable and circular economy is necessary. For the sake of the environment, to reduce the pressure on our planet's resources, and then for the sake of our health. That is why it is very good that we are now taking a major step, not least in the area of plastics. The plastics strategy put forward is ambitious in terms of reuse and recycling. However, this level of ambition for plastics must apply throughout the way we produce. In our circular economy, it must be possible for all our products to be upgradeable, they must be durable, they must be repairable, they must be recyclable and recyclable. We need to do this in all other areas, not just in the area of plastics. However, in order to ensure that this happens in a circular economy, it is also very important that we ensure that no hazardous chemicals enter our material cycle. That is the aim, as the Commission has said, that is what everyone in this House wants. But we are not on target yet! Until we are on target, it is very important that we make a huge effort. We need to step up efforts to substitution substances of very high concern, not least endocrine disruptors. We must provide a very comprehensive product information, not least on substances of concern, so that recycling and recycling take this into account. Moreover, we must also step up efforts to classify, register and trace and dispose of the waste that has dangerous substances in it. Because we must not compromise the safety of consumers on the way to a circular society. There is a long way to go before we are in the finish line before we have a well-functioning circular economy, and products already in the design phase take these things into account. In order to achieve this objective, it requires a great deal of effort from everyone: the Commission, the Member States, our agencies, our companies, etc., all of us must join!

I think that it is a very opportune moment to be debating this today, at a time when citizens not only in my own constituency, but across Europe and indeed the world are more conscious of the impact which plastic use is having on our environment. There is a clear momentum in tackling these issues, and now is the time to act.  There is no denying that plastic is an essential material for our society and economy. However, we need to transform the way in which plastic and plastic products are managed. Currently less than 30% of all plastic waste is recycled. Indeed, plastic waste accounts for over 80% of marine litter, something which Mr Flack has referred to.  This has a devastating environmental impact, with up to 500 000 tonnes of plastic entering our seas and oceans each year. But I have to ask the question, and we should all be asking the question: somebody has to put that plastic there for others to take out, so there must be a serious educational problem somewhere along the line, since we are not getting the message across. The Commission may want to consider further action in pursuit of a circular plastic economy by introducing the recommended new provisions reducing hazardous substances in plastics. In that way we can increase plastic recycling without increasing the risk of emitting hazardous substances into the environment.  This is one cause of the problem. Everyone tells you that they support this, and they all express fine words, but, unfortunately, we all know that it is extremely expensive. We must be aware that China has closed its doors to Europe’s plastic, including other countries in the Far East. We have got to find other ways of dealing with the problem. It is our problem and we must deal with it.

The concern about the plastic challenge is shared by the entire European Parliament, the whole world. The Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency recently investigated products from low-cost online stores outside the EU. Almost all toys, jewellery and electrical appliances were in some way unfit. The toys contained life-threatening parts, electrical appliances caused electric shocks, jewellery did not contain promised precious metals and cosmetics did not contain lists of ingredients. Product design and consumption habits play a significant role in addressing the plastic challenge. There is a lot of low-quality and non-recythric plastic on the market, which therefore has no value whatsoever. In our waterways, in lakes, rivers and in the sea, plastic causes a great deal of damage, damage whose harmful effects on the ecosystem we do not even know. Mr President, I have said on various occasions that plastic is a good material: it is sustainable, safe, cheap and versatile at best. Our problems stem from the fact that the material cycle is not working. We need to think about the circulation of plastic as a whole from start to finish. According to the waste hierarchy, the priority must be to reduce the amount of waste, then reuse and recycling. Mr President, we need an open-minded attitude. Plastics can be replaced with a variety of products made from renewable materials. For example, there are already plastic-free coffee cups on the market.

The mainstream of information talks a lot about it, the public now know that there is a very serious problem that we are trying to address, and that is important because we have so much pressure on the institutions and on those who have to make decisions. From this point of view, there is a fundamental concern for the environment and for the oceans, which are full of this plastic, but let us also remember that 31 % of plastic still goes to landfill and as much as 39 % goes to incinerators, and therefore there are also direct and indirect consequences for our health. We welcome, of course, the intervention of the European Commission, with the plastics strategy and also with the first two pieces of legislation that we are currently evaluating, because it is important, precisely, to intervene in a strong and legislative way.  We intervened on the file – even though it was already a good file in itself, given the fine work that has been done by the rapporteur – with points that we consider fundamental. First of all, the concept of prevention: first we must prevent and then solve the problem upstream, and then we must act on the one on which we cannot intervene upstream. We have called for a ban on oxo-degradable plastics and microplastics that are voluntarily included in cosmetics, we have focused on toxic materials that must be eliminated from the production circuit, and we have called for the internationalization of costs, that is, the manufacturer must take care of what happens to his products when they are placed on the market and then become precisely a waste that ends up in the seas.

I am referring to the clampdown on the use of microplastics and disposable materials, and in particular to the objective that every plastic material produced should be recyclable by 2030. I come from a land, the South of Italy, which has all too often been transformed into the landfill site of industrial waste in the productive north of Italy and Europe. I also trained politically in the environmental struggles against landfill and incinerators. For many years now, the committees have been proposing a 'zero waste' model and a truly circular economy. In order to achieve this, the production of goods must be completely reoriented and the economy as a whole radically transformed, and the habits and behaviour of Europeans and Europeans must be followed. This is a goal that can only be achieved through a major initiative managed and financed by the public sector.

And let's remember that some types of this plastic, unfortunately, have a particular aspect: it takes over 400 years to dissolve on land. Therefore, if anyone asks what this European Union is for, we can say today that there is finally a positive response, because we believe that the balance sheet of this report is positive. In the meantime, because it achieves the goal of reducing plastic waste through prevention, and secondly because packaging is also a good result, which by 2030 will have to be reusable and recyclable plastic. More could certainly have been done to increase the share of plastic recycling, which is still too low in the European Union, but we have still managed to ban the landfill of plastics by 2030, and that is a very good thing for us.  We also called for a ban on the incineration of plastic in cement plants and incinerators, because they generate emissions that are harmful to the environment and toxic to human health, but unfortunately our amendments on this point were not adopted. However, together with the other political forces, we have succeeded in banning the use of oxo-degradable plastic and also in banning the addition of microplastics in cosmetics, personal hygiene products, detergents and household cleaning products by 2020. Finally, let us remember that citizens must always be informed and made aware. The real revolution is made by them when they go shopping in supermarkets, which unfortunately are still full of plastic containers that in turn are packed in other plastic containers.

Mr President, with ten tonnes of plastic produced per second in the world and more than nine billion tonnes accumulated since 1950, plastic has become the archetype of 21st century waste. Production has never stopped growing, so much so that plastic is overflowing from our garbage cans and is found everywhere: in our oceans, in our soils, in organisms and even on our plates. Today, everyone is aware of this: we are dealing with an unprecedented environmental and health crisis, where the problems have been hidden under the carpet. For example, only 9% of the plastics produced around the world have been recycled and we are still unable to properly collect all the waste for storage and reprocessing. Also, this new European strategy is welcome. Except that it leads to a false good solution, that of creating a new market to reuse used plastic. In fact, it will promote the production of a new generation of plastic that is more easily recyclable and reusable by companies. Now, we all see that after the nightmarish dream of globalization and exponential growth, the world is gradually regaining consciousness of its limitations, and perhaps even of its mistakes. Excessive plastic production is a mistake and if we do not separate ourselves from plastics wherever possible, we must agree on a drastic reduction in production. I make it clear that this report misses this vital objective. It will even promote a revival of this industry thanks to the misleading concept of the circular economy. Let's face it: recycling plastic is a problem, not least because it is not free of toxic chemicals and because of the cost of recycling. That is why I have tabled two amendments, which support a more coherent vision, with the aim of reducing plastic pollution. The aim is to encourage and tax-favour substitutes for plastics, such as wood, glass and cardboard. Finally, let us pay attention to recycling in third countries that do not meet our standards.

That is why the European plastic strategy is essential. China's decision to ban imports of European plastic waste offers us an opportunity to create the conditions for a genuine domestic market for recycled materials. But the problem is recycling.  Barriers to better recycling are essentially technical and economic. I am thinking in particular of the cost gap between virgin plastics and recycled plastics.  It is important to support not only local authorities, but also businesses, to make the necessary investments, no doubt through concrete legislation. I have retained the desire to introduce a price on non-recyclable. I think that is particularly important.

It is well known that all plastics create fragments as they degrade but we know that fragments of ordinary plastic could accumulate for decades, and perhaps for as long as 100 years as micro-plastics, before they become biodegradable. New plastic goods therefore urgently need to be modified at manufacture so that if they do get into the open environment they will become biodegradable much more quickly than ordinary plastic. This modified type of plastic is known as oxo-degradable or oxo-biodegradable, and the technology is available here and now from an entrepreneurial firm in my own constituency in the UK. I was therefore astonished to see that Article 42 of the report calls for a ban on this technology without a vote, and I am angered that foreign MEPs should seek to extinguish British innovation. The Commission has at least gone through the motions of asking for a scientific study on this but, with the greatest respect to the rapporteur, Mr Demesmaeker, neither he nor his colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are polymer scientists. They are therefore in no position to come to a conclusion in advance of a scientific report and they have not, in fact, included a single line of evidence in their report to justify such an important decision which they are asking Parliament to make. I will be voting against this report because only the British Government should have the power to prevent British innovation. If the report succeeds tomorrow it will confirm that the EU favours ideology over science yet again, and that factual evidence is a mere irrelevance. At the very least, voting on this topic should be delayed until a scientific report is to hand. In my own speciality, of UK agriculture, hundreds of hectares of land are covered in plastic as a frost protection. It can be heavily contaminated with soil when it is removed a few months later, making disposal a major problem.

He started it and understood what policymakers actually haven't understood for years. We have to act. It is now time to prevent the plastic soup from increasing and gaining the upper hand. The soup has to be cleaned up slowly by projects like Ocean Cleanup or the fishermen in the North Sea, when they are fishing. We must also help them. Unfortunately, there are also quite a few disposable forks and the like that would be degradable under the influence of oxygen, but therefore do not prove biodegradable in the aquatic environment. We're being fooled. This is shabby plastic! We must therefore move towards fully reusable plastics and an internal market for secondary raw materials. Producers need to start designing reusable products. The production of plastic waste is unacceptable because microplastics pollute our environment and our seas.  These reusable plastics do require a clear policy framework. Substances of concern should not be allowed into the circular raw materials when reused, as others have said.

One and the other should, in its application, be guided by principles and concerns of social justice and not by the principle of the sacrosanct market that those who pay can pollute.

However, let me just add a different point of view. We have just adopted and brought into force the legislation on the circular economy, all the directives that we have thoroughly negotiated. I think that we need to have a look not just at the strategy but also at the plastics proposal. How does it fit with the system? Take, for example, the collection target for beverage bottles: I have no problem with being ambitious but does it fit entirely? I mean, are we not in fact diluting the targets we have? Eventually, is there something that we need to do to prevent discrimination between products, or an additional requirements for extending producers’ liability? Again, this is an important issue, but what about consumers? In terms of the whole chain, we can’t put the burden on producers for the misbehaviour of consumers. So a number of issues need to be looked into, including awareness, and I’m sure that if we manage to fit this piece properly into the system that we have established then we can deliver results.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 302, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Bronis Ropė (Verts/ALE).", "mepid": "125214", "text": "   – Mr President, mr President, I would like to – (DE) Mr President, I am pleased that the European institutions have begun to work purposefully on the issue of plastic pollution.

In welcoming this initiative, I would nevertheless like to draw attention to a few moments. First of all, we need to talk about a clean circular economy. Although recycled, toxic plastics that circulate continuously will pose no less risk to the environment and human health.

The worrying information emerged that only 30% of plastic is still recycled, around 30% go to landfills and around 30% go to landfill. The main objective now is to make a complete effort to prevent the generation of plastic waste. It has a big impact on both the economy and the environment.  We already have a lot going on. The new Waste Directive obliges Member States to organise recycling and sorting of plastic. It's an important step. Similarly, the Commission has proposed that, in future, plastic should be fully recyclable and that certain single-use plastics should also be abandoned. One proposal included in the Commission's multiannual financial framework is the introduction of a certain type of plastic tax, which would further push member states into recycling plastics. We still have a lot of work to do. One of the most important things for the consumer is that we need clearer labelling of which plastics can be recycled and how they should be sorted. On the other hand, industry also needs uniform standards on how recycled plastics can be used. There is still a lot of work to be done in both of these. As well as the need to invest enough in research and product development in the sector, so that we can also find sustainable bio-based replacements for plastics that are environmentally friendly. This is the kind of work that is going on across Europe and it is important that we direct research resources towards this. Of course, this is also a big international issue. Plastic is coming into Europe from all over the world in the same way that plastic is exported from Europe to the rest of the world.

The proposal on single-use plastics, to which Mr Juncker was referring, still lacks ambition for my liking.

A little nod, perhaps also, to the Austrian Presidency here: the European Parliament will certainly be ready to conclude this dossier under your presidency. We can do even more: first, ensure the innovation needed for a post-2020 circular economy policy; second, to develop a dynamic innovation and research sector to design alternatives to plastics; third, act to speed up what I call the 'Plexit', the exit of plastic.

In January this year, the Commission published a communication addressing options for addressing issues just on the border of legislation on these chemicals. The communication aims to promote a broad debate within the Union and to find a way to address the main problems identified.  We deal with four critical issues. Insufficient information on substances of concern present in products and waste. Secondly, the presence of substances of concern in recycled materials. Thirdly, uncertainty as to how safe it is to dispose of these materials and whether they can cease to be waste. Fourthly, difficulties in applying the methodology. The conclusions of the Commission communication are therefore the four problems mentioned. We should address these problems so that we do not have obstacles in the circular economy. The ambition must be to achieve full regulatory compliance.  I therefore have the following two questions to the Council. How does the Council approach these issues and the possible measures proposed by the Commission to address the four most important problems?

The aim is not to dump the waste of ships in the sea, but to hand it over to ports.

Parliament's objective is to support the Commission towards a new sustainable plastics economy, combining economic development with the protection of the environment and human health. Today, there are still too many plastic products on the market that cannot be recycled or reused and that, at best, can only be disposed of in incinerators or landfills, while at worst they are dispersed in both the marine and terrestrial environment, with serious damage both to biodiversity standards and to economic activities such as fishing or tourism.

Through the report that we will be voting on tomorrow, Parliament is calling for a concrete commitment to a change of pace for the Commission and all the stakeholders involved, and defines a series of concrete measures to ensure that plastic is designed, produced and consumed and that its end-of-life is managed according to the principles of the circular economy. The other point on which our position is very clear is that of the need for immediate and urgent action to combat the other major problem: marine pollution from plastic.

The second mega-trend is based on artificial intelligence, and these two are the ones which will reshape our societies and economy in the coming years. That is why I’m so glad that, as today’s debate here in the European Parliament has shown, this is one of the issues – the circular economy and the plastic strategy as part of it – which unite us. I don’t remember any other policy areas in this House in which the debate would have been so consensual. We share the same concerns and the same challenges, and we are trying, more or less, to find a solution from the same part of the world. So I really want to thank the House for its contribution to the circular economy. Actually, I would like to congratulate the European Parliament, and I hope that you congratulate the Commission and the Council also, on the fact that during this election period we have created a new policy which is called ‘circular economy’ in Europe. That is the reason why Europe is leading circular economy development in the world. The US is far behind us. China is the second best.  Talking about China, I participated in a high-level economic dialogue last June in Beijing, an EU-China dialogue, and right after that we had the EU-China summit in Beijing at which we discussed deepening our cooperation, especially on circular economy. We actually signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with our Chinese counterpart on enhanced cooperation between the EU and China on circular economy. Plastics is one part of that. I was discussing with my counterpart the possibility that we might manage to create a joint or common quality standard for plastic packages in China and Europe. If we did that, it would create an enormous market for the recycling of plastic waste. So there are lots of opportunities. Today we are losing 95% of the value of plastic packages, and it simply doesn’t make any sense. Plastic waste has a value and today we are losing most of this value, simply because we have not developed good policies to recycle plastic. Only 6% of the plastic in our market is recycled plastic. So this means that there are huge opportunities, but we just need better policies which encourage raising the quality of plastics – and there, for instance, the quality standard for plastic packages is of the utmost importance. My final word is on the plastic levy, which is part of our Multiannual Financial Framework proposal. I do hope that we get it through. If it is not possible to get it through, I really hope that Member States could look at it as a national solution. Taxation or levies can create healthy incentives to the economy.

We are all of the same opinion: there is the absolute need to reduce the plastic in our lives to a minimum level and to better use this in general useful material. It was also mentioned that much can be done at a regional level, for example with awareness-raising campaigns. Well, yes, it seems so easy at first sight to reduce the plastic in your life, but if you have ever tried to buy fruit, vegetables or meat and milk products in a supermarket without buying loads of plastic, you would have found out that it is much harder to do this and to manage this than you at first think. Let me assure you that the Austrian Presidency attaches great importance to the circular economy and Treaty-related files such as the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. But we still have to do more, and I agree with many Members who mentioned that. Thus, the Council looks forward to the results of the Commission’s public consultations addressing the interface between chemical product and waste legislation, which is still ongoing until 29 October.

A stable internal market for secondary raw materials is indispensable for safeguarding the transition to a circular economy, therefore the obstacles this market confronts with have to be fully addressed, while laying the ground for a level playing field. Indeed, the EU Plastic Strategy constitutes a necessary step forward in the EU’s transition towards a circular economy and as well as a crucial tool towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goal to prevent and reduce marine litter.

Given the fact that the basic materials of different plastic products are different hydrocarbons, it is by no means easy, especially as regards packaging materials in retail trade, to ensure classification according to the chemical composition, which is an important prerequisite for recycling. Logically, the first priority is therefore to prevent the generation of plastic waste, the second priority is reuse and the third is recycling. To do this, of course, it is necessary to use the appropriate technology for collection and sorting. Today, only 30% of plastic waste is collected for recycling in the EU. 31% of plastics are landfilled and 39% are incinerated. As regulations to prevent plastic landfilling will apply across the EU by 2030, there is a need to increase the possibilities for re-use of packaging and recyclability. The Commission is invited to introduce a ban on microplastics in a number of products by 2020, while setting out requirements to reduce their release from a variety of materials.

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch weighs more than 43,000 cars and covers an area five times that of Poland. Garbage negatively affects marine flora and fauna, penetrating our digestive system, causing various ailments.  We need to start with educational activities and make citizens aware that by increasing the number of plastics we use every day, we are harming ourselves and the environment.

Plastic waste has devastating environmental impacts on marine ecosystems, for example, and not all its health effects on humans are even known yet. The amount of waste generated must be reduced. Recycling and collection must also be promoted, as currently only 30% of plastic waste in the EU is collected for recycling. The market for recycled plastics should also be encouraged, as currently recycled material accounts for only around 6% of new plastic products, according to Commission figures.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of this House, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. First of all, I would like to stress that I am pleased that we have had the opportunity today to discuss the report on the European action plan to combat antimicrobial resistance, or AMR, here within the framework of the concept of 'health'. Because it is nothing less than one of the greatest threats we are currently facing.  In his State of the Union address this morning, President Juncker pointed out that only a strong and united Europe can protect its citizens against threats from inside and outside – from terrorism to climate change, as he said. I would like to add and emphasise that this common Europe, this joint effort, is also needed to protect people from growing health threats – from AMR, for example.  I would also like to say briefly here that I regret that President Juncker, in his speech today, did not address the issue of health, which is so important for the people, but also for the business location. In contrast to his 2017 speech, where he was pleased to point out the importance of a high vaccination rate and the need for all people in the EU to have access to vaccination. Vaccinations – also an important issue in connection with AMR.  Why is this fight against AMR, antimicrobial resistance so important? Because almost 500 people in the European Union die every week from infections caused by multi-resistant germs, largely ignored by media coverage, but also largely unnoticed by the general public perception. That is as many as there are deaths from road accidents in the European Union every year. And there will be many more if we do not engage, consistently and seriously tackle it.  We are threatened with a return to a pre-antibiotic, prepenicillin era, where a urinary tract infection could be a death sentence, where surgeries, transplants, chemotherapy could pose a much higher risk to patients than they are today. Lack of knowledge about the mode of action of antibiotics, improper use, abuse, overuse – both in human medicine and in animal husbandry – lack of hygiene measures, improper disposal – they are among the main causes of AMR.  The European Parliament has dealt with this issue on several occasions in the past, and many steps have already been initiated. I hope that Commissioner Andriukaitis will use his speaking time here to go into it in detail. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to him for his commitment and commitment. However, I would also like to thank those responsible in the European agencies working in this area for their good and fruitful cooperation.  The aim of this report is to support and, above all, to promote the work of the Commission and the Member States. We have drawn up a number of general proposals here, but in particular a large number of concrete suggestions and demands. In order to prevent, in addition to all the human suffering caused by disease and premature death in 2050, the economic damage caused by antibiotic-resistant infections will reach the financial impact of the 2008 economic crisis. Promote awareness-raising, health literacy, better education and training for all health professionals, and the development and use of rapid diagnostic tests, new and alternative medicines and treatments, the importance of prevention and immunisation, new business models to stimulate industry, universal access and the availability of antibiotics should only be a few of the areas of action that we have addressed in our report. Detect.  At this point, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all those who have worked so constructively and intensively here – the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and The European Union, but also the colleagues in the committees that have been consulted. The numerous amendments and amendments have helped us to put to the vote tomorrow a report that is not only in line with the concept of 'health', but also with the concept of 'a strong voice', because both the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and The Environment adopted the report unanimously.  I look forward to today's exchange with them and Hope that the report will also receive strong support in the vote tomorrow, so that, in addition to President Juncker's statement, we can also take part in the threat to health.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Kadenbach, for her personal commitment and determination in leading this work, as well as the committees that have been involved in the preparation. We often take antimicrobials for granted, relying on them and believing that they will always be there to protect us. If you will allow me a personal note from my professional past as a medical doctor and a cardiac surgeon, I would like to stress how painful sepsis and death can be in situations where antibiotics can no longer help. I am also particularly struck by the very high speed with which resistance to bacteria has recently progressed, since the first therapeutic use of antibiotics less than a century ago in 1941. Excessive and inappropriate use of antimicrobials in humans, animals and plants and poor infection-control practices have led to growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This resistance has progressively transformed into a serious threat to public health worldwide. Honourable Members, let me remind you, as Ms Kadenbach also did, that 25 000 people die annually in the EU alone as a result of infections caused by resistant bacteria. Some estimate that if current infection and resistance trends continue, there could be 10 million deaths per year worldwide by 2050. In simple terms, there is a risk of reverting to a world where some common infections are no longer treatable. The European Union was quick to recognise the importance of tackling antimicrobial resistance, as the 2001 ‘Community strategy against antimicrobial resistance’ shows. This policy was reinforced with the 2011 Commission action plan, and last year a new and comprehensive EU action plan on antimicrobial resistance was adopted, pursuing the ‘One Health’ approach recognising that human health, animal health and the environment are interconnected. You will remember that I came to present that plan to the various relevant committees of the House. This milestone clearly underlined the Commission’s commitment to step up our actions to tackle the huge challenge of antimicrobial resistance. The new action plan contains concrete measures with EU added value. It supports the EU and its Member States in delivering innovative, effective and sustainable responses to antimicrobial resistance. It also reinforces the research agenda and enables the EU to promote global action and play a leading role in the fight against AMR. A first progress report was published in April of this year and it will be updated regularly Let me mention a few examples. First, the Commission published EU guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials in human health in July 2017. Second, a joint action project on antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections started in September 2017. This brings Member States and other stakeholders together to support the development and implementation of effective health policies against antimicrobial resistance and to reduce healthcare-associated infections. A second Joint Interagency Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance Analysis (JIACRA) Report was published in July 2017 by the European Medicine Agency, the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and we can now see the common efforts of the three agencies. Each provides evidence-based data on the correlation between antimicrobial consumption and resistance in humans and food-producing animals, and this will enable Member States to tailor their antimicrobial resistance policies better to the local context. Next, the Commission is providing training sessions for veterinary and public health staff from national authorities involved in AMR control, under the so-called Better Training for Safer Food programme, and is carrying out joint Commission-European Centre for Disease Control visits to Member States on request in the context of the implementation of national ‘One Health’ action plans against AMR. Meetings of the One Health Network government experts from human health, animal health and the environmental sector, as well as EU scientific agencies, are organised regularly and I am very glad that your report will be presented at the network meeting next month. Lastly, as to global activities, we can assure you that we will pursue our efforts in various forums, notably the G7 and G20, and in collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the World Health Organisation, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the OECD. Antimicrobial resistance is indeed a global threat which requires global action. That means too that we have a collective responsibility to ensure that EU Member States deliver on the commitment they made when they endorsed the 2015 global action plan on AMR. Furthermore, the negotiations on the new EU regulation on veterinary medicine and on medicated feed are now successfully concluded and I am glad that the House will vote on the outcome of these trilogue negotiations no later than next month. This is a major milestone in the fight against AMR. Indeed, the draft regulation includes a ban on the preventive use of antibiotics in groups of animals, as well as the possibility of reserving certain antimicrobials for humans only. In addition, the 2006 ban on antibiotics as feed additives is now broadened to cover the use of all antimicrobial veterinary products as growth promoters in animals. This will be an important further step in the responsible and prudent use of antibiotics in the EU. Madam President, honourable Members, the report we are debating today is of great importance. It contains many valuable suggestions on ways to go further in our common fight against AMR and I will carefully analyse all the proposals you have made. Antimicrobial resistance will only get worse in the future if we do not continue to act together: not only the Commission but also the European Parliament, the Member States and, of course, all the stakeholders involved in the use of antimicrobials must reinforce our efforts. We need to do so to avoid a return to the pre-antibiotic era, with simple wounds and infections causing significant harm and even death, and routine medical procedures being very risky. That would be a really bad scenario. I look forward to the adoption of this report and I thank the House for its continued commitment.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Kadenbach for her report and her hard work. I appreciate that in her report she also took into account ITRE's advice on antimicrobial resistance. As rapporteur of ITRE, I have tried to find sustainable solutions. For me, these sustainable solutions lie in the following elements.  It is of immense importance that research and innovation are sustained. The search for new antibiotics is crucial, but epidemiology and immunology also offer opportunities. This search will mainly be undertaken by the pharmaceutical companies and research institutes. That is why there can be not only one economic model, but that there must be different motives for developing new antibiotics. Here we speak in the report of the pull and push incentives.  In addition, it is also important that the patient receives a quick and correct diagnosis. Is he infected with a bacterium or a virus and what bacterium is it? The technology of this new rapid diagnosis should be available and accessible in all Member States. Antimicrobial resistance is not only a European problem, but a global problem.

There has been only one new antibiotic discovery in the past 30 years, and in February of last year, as has already been said, the WHO reported that within a generation, unless there are new antibiotics, deaths from drug resistance infection could reach 10 million a year. The agricultural community has a big role to play in curbing the overuse of antibiotics, and there are already some important legislative initiatives coming down the track with regard to the advertisement, sale and prescription and use of antibiotics on farms. This evening, though, I want to repeat one of the calls that the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee has made in this report, which is that the Commission must ban all food imports from third countries where antibiotics may still be used as growth promoters. Worldwide, 80% of the total consumption of medically imported antibiotics is in the animal sector for growth promotion in healthy animals. The link between antibiotic consumption by animals and resistance in humans cannot be denied, and if we are going to be realistic about combating this global issue, then this should be one of the first places to start.

So many sick, lifelong disabled, deaths caused by these germs. We urgently need new antibiotics. But they are not available, and the development is expensive and takes a long time – up to twenty years, if it succeeds at all. We urgently need alternatives to the antibiotic. But these alternatives do not exist, at least not yet. We must promote development. That is why we need to be much more accountable with what we have. Half of the antibiotics are used improperly by the patient, but are also misprescribed by the medical staff. People know too little about it. The majority think antibiotics simply help against everything, against colds, colds, viruses. But that is just wrong, and we need to re-anchor this in our society, so that people know this so that they understand why these resistances are spreading and that everyone can be affected – this does not always affect others – so that everyone can and must make their contribution to slowing down or even stopping this development. , if that is still possible. Old medicines, for example, do not belong in the toilet.

But at one point we need to improve tomorrow: I would ask you to join me in deleting recital 63, which requires food labelling in relation to the use of antibiotics in farm animals.

It is clear that human and animal health are – today it is known – closely interlinked. Wide-ranging action programmes should be adopted that raise awareness among European societies of the use and handling of antibiotics not only for the treatment of humans, but also for animals. Member States must act in close cooperation in this regard, using, of course, the substantive, expert actions of the European Commission and the Member States.  Prevention and good health-promoting behaviour should not only be limited to restrictive sales of antibiotics (for example, without a prescription or online), but must also be closely linked to a social information campaign. The widening of sensitivity and the broad information campaign should apply not only to antibiotics. We must not forget vaccines.

Mr President, Commissioner, the use of antibiotics is still rising spectacularly. The OECD has shown that in just 30 years, the use of antibiotics in the world has increased by a staggering 67%. In human health, antibiotics are still prescribed far too easily. As many as 50% of the prescribed antibiotics have no effect. Furthermore, in some parts of the world, large quantities of antibiotics are still dumped in the environment through wastewater when manufacturing medicines. Outside the EU, antibiotics are still used in livestock farming as a growth promoter to produce cheap meat. This is frightening and it has to be different when you consider that this is causing rapid decline in the action of the antibiotic and that we are no longer able to treat simple and common diseases and infections. In addition, there has been no research on antibiotics since 1987 and no new classes of antibiotics have been developed. Action is needed and countries cannot do this alone, the European Union cannot do this alone, it must be tackled globally. I am very much in favour of a Paris agreement on antibiotic resistance. We have to crack down on abuse. We need to do much more research into alternatives such as vaccination and develop new antibiotics, and we need to focus much more on preventing diseases in humans and animals than we are curing. And that is possible, evidenced by several Member States in the European Union, where human health care is effectively used.

I would have liked the President of the Commission to be the subject today, because in fact AMR is a time bomb and it is getting worse and worse. That is why I am annoyed that we are not taking a more vigorous approach to the issue, because it is also a reason for AMR that we are using too much antibiotics abusively and unnecessarily in many areas. This starts in human medicine, that antibiotics are still prescribed against colds. This is completely unnecessary. But there is too much use of antibiotics also in the field of animal husbandry. Prophylactic, metaphylactic antibiotics are used because too many animals are kept in too narrow stables and because animal husbandry is not properly designed. We cannot afford that. The cheap meat will be very expensive for us at some point if we carry on like this. In fact, we must also point out that more antibiotics are used in animal fattening than in the human sector. That cannot remain the case. We must also ensure that reserve antibiotics are no longer used in the animal sector. And we must prevent, in the case of antibiotic resistance, there being, so to speak, the transmission of animals to humans. I believe that we agree that we need more training, we need more research, especially in the direction of alternatives. The use of antibiotics must be the last resort, not the first means we use.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Commissioner Andriukaitis, you know, I come from Germany, and that is why I would like to start by mentioning a worrying figure from my country of origin on this subject. In 2017, six times more antibiotics were used in agricultural livestock farming than in human medicine. Thousands of people are already being killed each year in Germany by antibiotic resistance. Public health is ignored by the German Government when it comes to farmers' profits. But let us talk about Europe. Multi-resistant germs infect millions of patients in European hospitals every year and are estimated to be responsible for 90,000 preventable deaths. When a person loses his life in the EU due to antibiotic resistance, our misguided agricultural policy, in particular, bears a great deal of complicity. For too long we have turned a blind eye to the problem and allowed mass animal husbandry to become the money machine of the pharmaceutical industry. We must now put a stop to unscrupulous fattening plants, which even use prophylactic antibiotics, and to the pharmaceutical industry. I hope that you, Commissioner Andriukaitis, will now do nails with your heads and do not act in the same way as in my own-initiative report on rabbit farming. We are still in the clinch. And by the way, you know for yourself how many antibiotics are being used in this sector.

Since then, unfortunately, antimicrobial resistance in the world has increased and in some countries, in some Member States, it has even reached and exceeded 25 %. Now the rapporteur, with the intention of limiting them, has rightly included all the possible causes in the text, but I would not like this to divert attention from the cause which, on a global scale, is by far the cause of the increase in antibiotic resistance, namely the use of antibiotics in animal farms. That is why I fully agree with what Mr Eck has just said.  We have spent these years fighting to improve veterinary legislation, because we know that the use of antibiotics for livestock is considerably greater than the use made of antibiotics for humans, and that the majority of feed intended for farm animals contains antibiotics. There are intensive farms with hygienic conditions and respect for animals that are really in a shameful state, with animals living their entire lives on each other in very tight cages, in the midst of their own excrement and often in the midst of mice. And these are precisely animals that are intended for human consumption, that can live in these very high-density lagers only because they are filled with antibiotics, which then have an effect on the resistance that develops in humans. Therefore, from our point of view, the main road is to ensure that the livestock and aquaculture sectors prevent diseases through good hygiene and good farming practices, rather than using antibiotics as prophylaxis. In short, today we are not saying anything new, but we say it with the knowledge that times are pressing and that we must speed up the search for new, but above all pragmatic, solutions. That is why we must ensure: one, the strict application of the rules and controls on veterinary medicinal products; two, the use of antibiotics in intensive farming as prophylaxis must be banned; and three, encourage organic and extensive farming patterns.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 344, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Joëlle Mélin", "mepid": "124765", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group.

It addresses both human and animal antibiotic resistance. It discusses ways of making better use of antibiotics in human pathology and in livestock farms. We should add phytosanitary plants, which are often potentisers of antibiotics. However, it does not point the finger at all at the persistent excesses of the free movement of humans, especially during irregular immigration, without health checks or respect for hygiene rules. This, of course, concerns particularly multidrug-resistant forms of tuberculosis. Nor does it point the finger at the free movement of goods in the trade of meat-food products from countries that do not comply with European standards, and this in the context, however, of official treaties with Europe. Because livestock antibiotics are used to prevent epidemics in herds, but above all to accelerate the growth of animals. This ultimately leads to contamination of the entire food chain.

The so-called methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococus aureus are known, which when you simply go to be treated, operate on a normal abdominal hernia to the hospital, and otherwise you are quite a healthy person, you may get such a resistant strain in the hospital and you may lose your life in this way.

Therefore, as the rapporteur on this legislation, I needed to understand where the challenges lie in order to address the issues in the interests of our citizens. The paradox we discovered during our work was that the problem was not always a lack of legislation, information or existing procedures. On the contrary, in many cases it was the existence of legislation which complicated matters. It was therefore important to address issues such as lengthy or unclear administrative procedures, complex and confusing information – which is all over the place – and difficulties in getting access to various public services. To make matters worse, when information is available only in a single language, it is not necessarily understood by the majority of the users. So voting in favour of the new rules tomorrow will help Parliament to reach an important milestone in significantly improving the lives of citizens and businesses, and will showcase the tangible benefits that the European Union can bring to its citizens. The new rules will establish a user-friendly, interactive European Single Digital Gateway which, based on people’s needs, will guide them to the most appropriate services and will provide access to all the necessary information and administrative procedures needed to move freely in the European Union. In simple words, we will create a European search engine which will connect all public services in Member States and will assist with information and procedures that currently are often scattered, incomplete and certainly not transparent. The gateway will provide information on matters such as travelling, working and retiring, residing and having access to education and healthcare, family residence, and citizens and consumer rights in the EU. Furthermore, it is not only information that is important, but also the quality of information, and that is why we are introducing quality standards in Member States to ensure high-quality, accurate and up-to-date information, which will also be accessible to end-users with disabilities. The gateway will also provide full, online, fair, non-discriminatory access to a list of 21 key administrative procedures such as requesting birth certificates, applying for study grants, requesting social security benefits, enrolling at universities, requesting diplomas, declaring income tax, and so on and so forth.  Another important milestone achieved with this legislation is the ‘once only’ principle, which for the first time ever will be introduced at European level. This means that citizens will no longer have to submit the same documents over and over again, but instead will submit them only once, and they can then be reused, while fully respecting the protection of personal data. And what is very important is that, whatever information people need, they will be able to obtain it in more than a single language. This effectively means no more wasting precious time and money; no more red tape and complex procedures; no more papers and hours of waiting in long queues in public places. Therefore, I urge all of you to support this regulation – a new important step towards providing a responsive, inclusive, borderless, user-friendly, digital public service to citizens and businesses at national and European level. Last, but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to the shadow rapporteurs, to the Commission and to the Bulgarian Presidency for their open and collaborative work on this report. We worked under extreme pressure and to a strict timetable but, when there is a will, a way will always be found to improve lives and to deliver tangible benefits to our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 366, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, Honourable Members, thank you very much for this discussion on a single digital gateway. First, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs  Mizzi, the shadow rapporteurs and the Chair of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee for the really excellent cooperation, which enabled us to improve our initial proposals and reach a quick agreement on this file last May. Let me begin by saying why this proposal on the single digital gateway is so important. As we all know, the single market is a cornerstone of the European Union, but we observe that when crossing borders, many European citizens and companies still experience a jungle of confusing rules, complex procedures and endless paperwork. A survey has shown that more than 80% of businesses see administrative complexity as the number one problem for them in the single market, and this is exactly the problem we want to address with this regulation establishing a single digital gateway.  Let me go through the three points that I think are the most important. First, we want to inform people better – because most people and businesses are really keen to respect the law, but imagine yourself settling in another country, even for a very short time, and think about how difficult it is to find out which rules you have to comply with, let alone in another language. Two in every three small enterprises say that finding out about applicable rules is a huge challenge for them for exporting. As for bigger businesses – this is also very interesting data – bigger businesses dedicate up to 20% of human resources to keeping track of rules applicable to them. Even those twelve million people in Europe who reside in another Member State – if they even find information, they are not certain that they can really rely on it. The regulation will make sure that citizens and small businesses can easily find all the information they need on single market rules and it will be done at both EU and national level via the Your Europe web portal. They will be guided directly to official national websites that provide the precise clarification that they need. The information must be easy to find, easy to understand, up to date and translated into English. Thanks to the gateway quality label, they will know that they can trust this information. But speaking about quality, let me mention one very important thing that you have drawn attention to: the specific needs of persons with disabilities. In this context, I really welcome the introduction of requirements similar to those we have at national level for the Commission websites which will be part of the gateway. Second, the regulation will ensure that in five years, the most important procedures can be handled entirely online in all EU Member States. You are very ambitious on this because this will apply not just to the 13 procedures that we initially proposed but to the more than 20 that were proposed by you. The regulation will also ban any discrimination against cross-border citizens or companies who want to make use of national procedures that are already online. They will no longer be blocked because their phone numbers, postcodes or eID are rejected.  The regulation also makes a start with the implementation of the so-called ‘once only’ principle for cross-border data exchange. You rightly insisted that the regulation should ensure full data protection for the European citizens and, again, I want to reassure you that all the necessary data protection safeguards are in place in this regulation. The third point: the Commission and the national authorities have already set up numerous assistance services that citizens and companies can contact when facing problems, but still more than 9 out of 10 consumers and businesses – a huge majority – are unaware of their existence. Thanks to this regulation, anyone looking for assistance will be guided towards the service that is most suited to help.  Let me conclude by saying that users are at the centre of our interest. Users should not be asked to adapt to public authorities, but the other way round. This is what this regulation will ensure. With this regulation, the EU will deliver on some of the commitments from our Digital Single Market communication and from the Tallinn declaration. It will be a big step towards making the single market work better. Thank you very much for your valuable help and I am looking forward to this discussion.

Whether I am looking for information on the possibility of working in an EU country, whether I am going to recognise my professional qualifications from another Member State, seeking information on setting up a business or hiring employees, all EU countries are now making this information available to all EU citizens with the central digital gateway.

In this context, one of the main challenges is to make the benefits of new technologies directly perceptible to citizens by simplifying their daily lives. The digital one-stop shop is a first concrete example. It is, in fact, a significant step towards the digitisation of public administrations and towards the simplification of procedures for citizens and businesses. The fundamental change introduced in the new regulation concerns the obligation for European public administrations to digitise a number of administrative procedures so that they can be completed online. Requesting a birth certificate or recognition of a diploma obtained abroad, or communicating the possession of a vehicle, notifying the opening or closing of a business or the activity they carry out in another country will be easier for citizens and businesses. In addition to promoting the digitisation of many services, this regulation establishes the one-time principle of 'once only' in the Union. The European authorities will thus be able to exchange data and documents already provided by the user, so as to minimise the administrative burden. The S&amp;D Group has fought to ensure that the application of this principle complies fully with the General Data Protection Regulation, with full respect for privacy.

It is worth stressing that an important part of this report is that the new EU regulation does not change the substance of national rules. Our political group, as conservatives, welcomes the recognition of the principle of subsidiarity and the fact that a common way of sharing information is important and that different national approaches continue to coexist. And that is probably the essence of the European Union, in a nut nut, on this issue.  I regret that it was impossible to include even more support for businesses in order to be able to work digitally with national actors, but I hope that future changes can further reduce the bureaucracy that is harming business. I am pleased that we can act across political divides on this issue – this is important. In today's society, where internet access is becoming more common and digital applications and tools enable more and more online tasks to be carried out, it is actually important that our countries go with the times. I am pleased that my government is doing this. The idea is that people waste less time in office and can work more and make more money.

In fact, it is aimed at the proportion of EU nationals wishing to exploit the sacrosanct principle of freedom of movement. The studies are formal and the figures are unfortunately cruel: it appears that the proportion of nationals affected by the application of this regulation does not even exceed 5% of the total population of the European Union. Efforts are honourable to make life easier for these poor people, but it would still be more urgent to take care of the remaining 95%, who are waiting and demanding something else from their politicians. The challenges we face are immense, the stakes are serious and our action does not live up to the expectations of our fellow citizens, who are subjected to these fanciful regulations, more than they benefit from them.

So, thank you very much, Marlene Mizzi and Othmar Karas, and congratulations for achieving compromise with the Council on this difficult file. It is a very concrete step forward and a very necessary one, because, according to different studies, we already have forty different EU information and problem—solving services, but 91.6% of EU citizens and businesses are unaware of any European—level online services. You say, Madam Commissioner, that 80% of businesses see administrative complexity as the number one problem in the single market, and that their costs go up to EUR 55 billion per year. But even worse than those billions is the frustration and anger when a tourist, an artist – and we love them, we proved this today – a company proprietor or a worker, a student, a patient or a doctor cannot find that necessary information, such as a form to fill out when he or she encounters problems when delivering documents online. This portal will help to solve those problems. I find it especially important today, when some politicians call Europe an imaginary community, the imaginowana wspólnota, which serves only those bureaucrats. You know what I am talking about. Instead, Member States must play an active part, not only in harmonising laws in the European Union, but also in informing citizens and sharing information, for example by building together this digital gateway so that all citizens of Europe can profit fully from the possibilities that our Europe gives them and that the single market offers.

It was a highly anticipated thing - highly anticipated by citizens, highly expected by businesses, especially small ones. We often discuss in the intergroup for SMEs what problems small firms have, what problems they have in cross-border work. This portal is aimed at improving the functioning of the single market, and this is an objective of the Commission. Digitalisation is another objective of the Commission. The portal solves this problem and we must say that we have long wanted that one-time principle to exist. It would make a lot of savings to the citizen, and to businesses, but of course these savings eventually go to the budgets of the states, they go to the budget of the European Union. We must also say that this administrative work is facilitated through the portal because, as was said in the report and as the rapporteur presented here, there will be an English translation. Of course, the states have a lot and a lot of responsibility, and the Commission also checks, updates the information, is accurate information so as not to confuse, so as not to confuse, because the aim is not that. The goal is to help. There is another problem, and I am glad, Commissioner, that you mentioned it - it must be non-discriminatory, it must also address people with disabilities and it must be non-discriminatory for other citizens as well. There are a lot of petitions and I think each of us is getting these petitions about the fact that a citizen can't handle it when they go to another state.

This is unacceptable, these have been lost profits for years. Ninety-two per cent of consumers and businesses do not know the online services provided at European level and do not know who to turn to in the event of a problem. Europe wins when it delivers concrete results and solutions for its citizens, and that is why it is important that we adopt this regulation.  With the opening of the portal, Europe will save nearly one million hours from the time of its citizens – a time when they can realize their ideas, start a business and make it a reality or share their time with loved ones.  If access to high-quality and easily accessible information is made available online, European businesses could save between €11 billion and €55 billion a year. A single digital portal is not just a database or guide. This is a place that will change the face of our internal market – overcome barriers, give equal access to students, entrepreneurs, workers to the information they need when travelling, when they are studying or traineeship abroad, when they retire, move, register a car in another country.

Dear colleagues, I am very proud to have been and can be rapporteur for this report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and that I can now account for the work that we have done in plenary and before tomorrow's vote.  \"Europe on the move, the future of EU mobility\", is the title of the report. Have you ever thought about what European transport will look like in 10 years' time? At a time when children who go to school with their parents today will be 20 or 22 years old and travelling independently? How are they going to move from one village to another, from the village to the city, out of a city, home, from one big city to another, or between Budapest and Strasbourg?  A lot will change around us, but if we are not prepared for this, we in the European Union institutions will surely not be able to keep up with technology, the revolution that is taking place before our eyes in everyday life. That is why it is crucial that we talk more and more about this issue. The mobility sector and transport play a key role in the EU economy, not only for our society but also for the economy, which accounts for around 4% of EU GDP and more than 5% of EU employment. With the development of automated vehicles, digitalisation and the need to create cleaner transport, the sector is undergoing profound changes that will have an impact on our society in all respects. It is estimated that passenger transport will increase by around 42% between 2010 and 2050 and a 60% increase in freight transport over the same period.  In the report, I sought to answer the question of what changes the transport sector is undergoing, how our relationship to mobility is changing and what mobility means in the 21st century. Parallel processes are taking place. Sustainability, environmental protection, the creation of safe transport, the transformation of the energy sector and continuous infrastructure development have been brought to the fore.  The labour market is also changing and changing structurally and other competences will be needed. And this process will take place in 5-10 years. Our primary task is to formulate a comprehensive mobility strategy that includes the effects of digitalisation, environmental issues and, of course, to respond to the needs of the population. Mobility becomes a complex service, digital interconnection with each other creates new collaborations and forms of business. Think of sharing-based models.  Approximately EUR 740 billion is needed to build the entire trans-European transport network by 2030. In addition to EU funds, we need market participants and, of course, the Member States. Digitalisation is one of the most important factors, affecting all areas of the transport sector, will have an impact on users of mobility services, on service providers, and will also have an impact on European industry and workers.  It is our legislative responsibility to ensure that profound changes do not create tension in society and that the Competitiveness of the European Union is maintained. The transformation will be rapid and significant. We must also focus on research and development, and it is essential that the European Union maintains its technological leadership in an otherwise highly competitive world market.  The community and sharing economy is transforming the transport industry worldwide. As the value of transactions in the collaborative economy within the European transport industry was estimated at EUR 5.1 billion in 2015, an increase of 77% on the previous year, economic results based on non-cash sharing far outweilar this scenario. This also highlights the importance of the report.

If we act now, we can seize the opportunity of this change and make European mobility sustainable, safe, smart and more accessible; European industry more competitive; and European jobs more secure. If we act now, we can lead in setting new global standards. These concepts are well reflected in the draft resolution prepared by Mr Ujhelyi, which supports more action – including at EU level – in this field. Allow me to specifically address three important topics raised in the report.   First, sustainability, transport is a major contributor to EU greenhouse gas emissions, as well as air pollution. We are committed to reducing and ultimately eliminating the negative externalities of our mobility. We can achieve this goal through stricter emissions standards, better consumer information, multimodality, smarter road charging, urban mobility planning, research and innovation, and by smarter use of public procurement to accelerate the transition towards zero— and low-emission vehicles. I would like to thank you for your support for this objective. We have several pending legislative proposals aimed at contributing to achieving exactly this. I therefore count on your active support to examine them as much as possible before the end of your mandate.  That brings me to the second point: Vision Zero. Until recently, Vision Zero – no road fatalities on European roads by 2050 – might have been perceived by some as an ambitious but distant vision. Today we can be much more confident. The fresh approach we are taking in road safety, with the so—called Safe System approach, and our move towards a connected and autonomous mobility are making Vision Zero a reality. With the third Mobility Package, we are proposing a strategy to make the EU an engaging global leader in autonomous mobility systems. We propose a clear, forward—looking and ambitious European agenda that provides a common vision, identifies clear supporting actions for developing and deploying key technology services and infrastructure, and that provides a clear action plan. Our strategy is based on three pillars. First, a legal framework that creates a single market for autonomous mobility, covering road safety, cybersecurity, access to data and data protection. Second, financial support to establish a new partnership with a consolidated sector—wide approach towards research and deployment throughout the EU, including for the coordination of pilot projects. Third, an in-depth assessment of the socioeconomic and ethical aspects of autonomous mobility, making deployment suitable to absorption capacity as well as the maturity of autonomous relations. We also propose to make a number of new vehicle safety technologies mandatory as part of the revision of the general safety regulation, for example, intelligence speed assistance, autonomous emergency braking and detection of pedestrians and cyclists. This will make sure that all road users will be able to benefit from the latest developments in technologies.  That brings me to the third topic: one platform for connected and autonomous mobility. Citizens’ mobility demands are growing, and their attitude to mobility is indeed changing. They want to shift seamlessly between different transport modes and enjoy easy access to travel information. Meanwhile, vehicles are becoming increasingly clean, connected and automated, and ultimately driverless and zero—emissions. This opens the possibility for vehicles to become an integral part of multimodal mobility, providing first and last—mile service and inclusive solutions for the elderly, disabled, and young people. Before we get there, we are engaging with stakeholders to address some very important enabling topics such as security, data protection, fair and equal access to data, liability and ethical implications, integration of automated vehicles into existing traffic, public acceptance, global standard settings, and many more.  This is why we proposed to bundle all efforts and create a single platform, the Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM), where all stakeholders come together to push our ambitious agenda further. Under the next MFF, this platform should evolve towards a fully—fledged partnership for connected and autonomous mobility, combining public and private efforts to escalate the development and deployment of innovative mobility solutions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is a movement, Europe is moving towards a new model of development: a low-carbon economy. There's a long way to go. The transport sector is currently 94 % dependent on oil and is responsible for more than 25 % of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, passenger and freight activities in Europe will increase by 60 % and 40 % respectively in 2050. The central point of the communication, which I agree with, is compliance with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. But how can these ambitious objectives be achieved? This is the answer: by promoting low- or zero-emission mobility, intermodality, shared mobility, the development of automated vehicles through interconnections of transport infrastructure networks, digital energy networks, digital technologies that will make it possible to implement the fundamental principle of 'polluter pays', for example with a electronic clearing system based on the environmental performance of vehicles.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 385, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Luis de Grandes Pascual", "mepid": "28393", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner Bulc, Mr rapporteur, thank you for your open attitude to dialogue. This has made it possible for us to recognize ourselves with our suggestions and concerns in this report. Thus, a balanced and reasonable text has been possible in our view. I think the treaty is very interesting and affects us all, but it is almost futureology. But it is not wrong to make forecasts of what is to come, apart from the concretions of the mobility package, which was an obligation we had in this own-initiative report. The digital mobility revolution and new smart technologies are a phenomenon, which is to produce an unstoppable and irreversible situation; affect the modernity, forms and modes of transport of the future, in which, according to the modern thesis of comodality, they have to act in symbiosis, so we will have to be very attentive to them.  Our main concerns are the safety, legality of these modes of transport, legal responsibility and training of workers in the sector, among other points. It is important to create bridges so that the coexistence between the old and the new modes of transport develops easily and in a progressive way in order to anticipate the advances to which the sector will be subjected. The sharing economy, ladies and gentlemen, which is a great label where so many things fit, that it has come to stay, cannot, in my opinion, be a jungle. It cannot be left to come from what happens, but it is necessary to rule it, it is necessary that the system has rules of the game in which innovation is not prevented, but that the acquired rights are respected.  These are the two keys on which we must base the future of European mobility, because it seems to me that it is the field of equity, of justice in the specific case.  We must try to make the sharing economy not one more label, Commissioner. Political decisions are not being taken, regulations are not prior, start-ups are subject to successive judgments in the various Member States incoherently. This is not the way, it seems to me that it is not the area on which it is up to us to work as politicians, but it is an inexcusable obligation to tackle them.

I believe that absurd tragedies such as the collapse of the Morandi motorway bridge in my region, Liguria, really oblige us to think seriously. It is necessary to ensure that adequate resources, both European and national, are put in place for cutting-edge projects, that they are a key part of a strategy on mobility in step with technological development and the challenges of globalisation and climate change. It is also necessary that the impact of the transition in transport is really accompanied by an investment in the skills of workers in the sector.

These are obvious issues.  However, we have doubts as to whether some of the proposed solutions will not adversely affect the position of consumers and the operating conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises. Nor can we make investment in modern modes of transport dependent solely on climate objectives. We also disagree with the use of the extremely controversial concept of 'social dumping'.

And one of those challenges is road safety. How are we going to make Europe's roads safer for all road users? Every year, 25 000 people die on European roads as a way of passing through road accidents. I repeat: twenty-five thousand! Road safety in Europe must and must be improved! The mobility of people and goods continues to increase, which is good for our economy and the prosperity of Europeans, but that also leads to fuller roads and traffic congestion. Personally, I am even more concerned that all this is at the expense of the environment and the climate. Our mobility can only be future-proof if it is also sustainable. The challenge we face cannot be solved by individual Member States on their own. We need a common European approach, one that focuses on innovation with smart forms of mobility. The development of self-driving vehicles, for example. And this can contribute to fewer traffic accidents, better traffic flow and low CO2 emissions. But intelligent transport systems also help us move more sustainably, safely and efficiently.  I therefore very much welcome European initiatives, including the European ITS Congress.

For example, we need to introduce electronic tolls based on the climate impact of vehicles. We also welcome the development of new innovations for smart mobility, but more needs to be done, and that is why we call on the Commission and the Member States to promote more ambitious plans to make smart mobility sustainable, both in our cities and in rural areas. At the same time, Europe must become safer. We will protect the most vulnerable in traffic and ensure that we have better connectivity between vehicles, infrastructure and the network itself to ensure an unhindered and safe flow of traffic.  Finally, I would like to underline the role of innovation in a clean and sustainable future.

So talking about an agenda for the future of mobility in Europe is, or should be, without a doubt, talking about sustainable and intelligent mobility, less polluting, safer, more accessible and also more affordable. Boosting sustainable mobility is spent on road transport to reduce CO2 emissions, a clear commitment to electric vehicles, clean batteries and the use of renewable energy, where efforts are beginning to be made. And yet, let us not deceive ourselves, it clearly goes through a commitment to public transport, to reduce the use of individual road transport, where demand continues to increase. Making a real effort to boost public transport — unfortunately, we have seen how the fourth rail package, which is liberalisation and somehow an attack on the train, which is the most sustainable and safest means of transport we have , has been approved in this parliamentary term , because I think it should be something that we must review and which should be a priority. To talk about sustainable mobility is also to take into account the social impact of transport at different territorial levels, the need to vertebrate rural territory, to engineer new forms of collective transport. And we are not talking about the false sharing economy, we are talking about forms of public transport, so that transport serves to nurture the territorial area and not to depopulate it. And, of course, urban areas are the places where CO2 emissions are most concentrated and it is necessary and urgent to bet on greener, more sustainable, more humane mobility, boosting the bicycle, driving the pedestrian in the center of cities and projecting cities in a way that encourages the use of public transport to connect with other territories.

More and more European citizens are living in urban areas, which are increasingly congested and which have often been designed at distant times, without, of course, taking into account modern mobility needs. These needs have changed profoundly today and will change still further. We must, however, be courageous and allow the citizens of Europe to take back their cities, to make them more livable, more fluid and more easily accessible. This means making important choices in favour of public transport, its implementation, but also choices to improve the quality of air that is breathed in urban areas, through the facilitation of sustainable mobility, zero polluting emissions, and implementing the use of the collective means to the detriment of the private one. Only in this way will we be able to put in place initiatives worthy of redesigning a liveable future for European citizens.  With regard to the mobility of goods, we in the Committee on Transport have drawn up a text for which I was rapporteur, and which I hope will soon be negotiated with the Council, for example to relaunch combined freight transport, that is to say to transfer as many goods as possible from road to iron. But the future of mobility also means greater security in infrastructure, with a sharp increase in economic resources to monitor the state of European networks, especially in structurally sensitive points such as viaducts, tunnels and sections particularly at risk. We need to have more financial resources, perhaps having to be accompanied by budgetary constraints, especially for states such as Italy, for example, with geographical characteristics that require bold infrastructures such as bridges and tunnels, to carry out frequent maintenance on existing infrastructures, to implement, for example, their resilience to seismic events, or in any case to prolong the life of operation and ensure that citizens can take advantage of them in complete safety. The future of mobility in Europe, ladies and gentlemen, also passes through Genoa, from a city affected by a disaster that has become a symbol to which we must all look in order to understand how important it is to have safe and quality infrastructures, with priority thinking of existing ones, before we even sing large works that mobilise millions of euros.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 392, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Dieter-Lebrecht Koch (PPE).", "mepid": "1852", "text": "   Mr President, Mrs Bulc, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Bulc, for the work she has all been very much on her part. Do you want future mobility to be safe, sustainable and just? Then we must also make them innovative, digital and competitive. How can we achieve this: through smart drivers, vehicles and infrastructure?  One step towards increasing road safety is the mandatory installation of safety-relevant driver assistance systems. They can compensate for human misconduct, which is responsible for about 92 percent of accidents. A further step is the creation of an infrastructure that includes charging stations for sustainable fuels throughout the country. In addition, this infrastructure must enable communication with the vehicles, especially in a transition phase on the way to the next stage of automation.  In all regulations, we should adopt a technology-neutral approach that covers the entire footprint of the vehicles. Every mode of transport must work on its efficiency, because there is no technology that can solve all the problems. And future mobility must allow smooth door-to-door transport, even across borders. To this end, EU citizens should be able to book travel by train, bus and plane on multimodal platforms and, at best, travel with a single ticket.  Neither the cleanest and low-emission vehicles nor diesel driving bans can solve the main problem in cities – congestion.

That is where we are facing really big challenges, because we know that emissions in transport have only increased. The forecast is that transport will increase considerably, so we now need really significant major cuts in transport emissions. In this context, we have legislation on this very reading, which also seeks to steer car manufacturers in the direction of producing lower-emission cars. Here it is important to take into account a wide range of technologies. The fastest way, as we know, is to add renewable fuel to car tanks, because the car fleet is regenerating extremely slowly. At the same time, however, it is clear that the electrification of transport and other alternative fuels must also be promoted. Another big trend is digitalisation and its promotion. On the other hand, digitalisation will also help us to reduce emissions by being able to design the entire transport system more efficiently. Thirdly, I would like to highlight the European Union's investment in both innovation and infrastructure.

However, I believe that the transitional period will not be easy, since it will involve not only the integration of automated transport into the current context, including the creation of connectivity and the necessary infrastructure, but also the achievement of safe coexistence with traditional means of transport.

First, on the impact on jobs: in order to support workers in the transport industry in adjusting to digitalisation and the transition to low-emission mobility, the Commission, in partnership with Member States and stakeholders such as employers, workers’ representatives and education and training providers, is addressing skill gaps and mismatches. Key initiatives include the EU Skills Agenda and the ‘Blueprint for sectorial cooperation on skills’ and we are really looking forward to the results of these measures.

New mobility solutions should be among the main beneficiaries of the Horizon Europe programme, with almost EUR 15 billion for mobility and energy activities. This will allow us to accelerate technological innovation. Of course, our Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) will also continue to support the deployment of new, modern infrastructure equipped with intelligent transport systems, and for the use of alternative sources of energy. We have proposed a budget of EUR 30.6 billion for CEF between 2021 and 2027, which, for the first time, will also include investment in road safety. I hope that, as we have proposed, this will be among the main criteria for project prioritisation. Technology is evolving faster and faster, and promises to find solutions. I do not doubt that there is always a technical solution to a problem, but I would like to stress one more time that technology is the means and not the final objective. I believe we should always put the users first – right next to the collective social benefits. Connected and autonomous mobility will flourish only if it is socially acceptable. Let’s not forget that our societies can only absorb a certain amount of new things. This is why it is so important that our strategy on connected and autonomous mobility covers not only technological and legal but also social and ethical questions. When we implement the necessary flanking measures to prepare for changes in jobs requirements and skills, and when we give meaningful answers to difficult ethical questions, then we can fully reap the benefits of the mobility of the future. Triple ‘Vision Zero’, no road fatalities, no pollution and no congestion: this is the commitment that can be achieved with such a holistic approach. But until then, we have a lot of work ahead and I am sure we will have many more discussions on this topic. I hope they will be as invigorating as today’s debate, and I count on your continued support. Together I am sure we can make a real and urgently needed difference.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 405, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "István Ujhelyi", "mepid": "124705", "text": "  Artist. \"Mr. President, I would like to thank you for your support Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to I thank you for the debate and let me take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner and the colleagues who wrote the original communication in the Commission, the original proposal, and those who also thanked them for the work. They did a good job not only until everything was ready for the Commission's communication, but also afterwards, because my colleagues were in very active contact, and I think there was exemplary cooperation between the Commission and Parliament's staff. And let me also thank the reporting colleagues, they have helped me a lot from the various factions. I will highlight three things now, at the end of the debate. One, perhaps most importantly, could affect any of us: there are 25 000 or more fatalities on Europe's transport roads every year. Our fundamental task and goal is to minimise this. It's part of our job together.  Secondly, the fact that we have entered the digital age, the world of digital development, also follows that we must ensure that every Single European citizen has the same transport access and the same transport option, born in the eastern, western, northern or southern parts of Europe, and in a big city or a small settlement. That's very important, too.  Thirdly, that workers in the transport sector, including those in our transport industry, i.e. our factories, must also receive very serious attention from us at European and nation-state level, as we are seeing very rapid technical progress in China and everywhere else. I'm pretty sure we're going to have to compete with them.  Let me say this last sentence: as a Hungarian, I considered this proposal particularly important, since this industry accounts for nearly 170 000 people in Hungary and 10% of GDP, a quarter of its exports. There's still work to be done. Thank you very much for the opportunity and thank you for working together!", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 406, "date": "2018-09-12.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "124891", "text": "  I close the debate.

The Europe on the Move initiative enables European industries to become world leaders in innovation, digitisation and decarbonisation. We hope that this initiative will help the strategy to renew industrial policy in the European Union. Clean mobility is essential for our future, but it is also important to come to the aid of the companies that provide this mobility. I believe that the transition to fundamental modernisation of mobility in the European Union will have several challenges, but it must be socially correct, transport companies must not be burdened by administrative obligations and peripheral States should not be punished on the grounds of cross-border operations. I support the idea of drawing a clear direction, which supports investment in transport, but which also takes into account the possibilities of each Member State, and I hope that, in the future, we can also focus on issues such as shell companies exploiting both legislative loopholes and their own employees.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
