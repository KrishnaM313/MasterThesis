Civil society organisations and independent human rights bodies play an essential role in promoting, safeguarding and raising awareness of EU common values. They are also key players when it comes to ensuring the effective enjoyment by everyone of rights under EU law and under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. The importance of preserving and protecting the civil society space is particularly clear in times when fundamental rights and values are under pressure. We are aware and concerned about alarming reports and studies, including from the EU Fundamental Rights Agency and the Council of Europe, which point to a pattern of pressures civil society is facing in many parts of the European Union. Policymakers in every democracy should engage in a regular and transparent dialogue with civil society and independent human rights actors, both as allies and as critical minds, and support the development of a sustainable environment for these actors to strengthen their role and perform their functions independently and effectively. As reflected in the draft resolution you are going to vote on today, this also entails a positive obligation at all levels to provide these actors with adequate financial support. The EU budget can provide value added in upholding common European values such as democracy, freedom, the rule of law, fundamental rights, cultural diversity, equality, solidarity, sustainability and peace. Working together with national budgets and complementing other efforts at European and national level, the Union has been providing concrete support to civil society and independent human rights actors in many key areas. With a view to the post-2020 EU budget, we are exploring ways to create a values framework in the EU budget with broader funding programmes in a scope aimed at promoting and protecting EU values. We want to further enhance synergies between the current different funding programmes to give EU value an ever more prominent and visible place in our funding priorities. We want to reach a critical mass of funding to have an impact on citizens’ daily lives. In this context, we are determined to make the best of this opportunity to strengthen the added value that the EU finances can provide to support, empower and build the capacity of civil society and other independent actors whose activities promote, safeguard and raise awareness of common values at national and local level and help the strategic enforcement of rights under EU law and the Charter. Maintaining our civil society strong, independent and pluralistic requires our joint efforts, and we welcome the continued engagement of the European Parliament on this matter.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Michał Boni", "mepid": "124896", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, democracy, the rule of law and European fundamental values cannot be taken for granted. They need active cultivation. A vibrant civil society is best suited to strengthening these values and preventing democracy from eroding. However, the performance of these tasks needs access to funding. This is why it is vital that we invest our resources in a strong civil society for the sake of our fundamental values and the future of the European project. This is what the proposed European values instrument is all about. Its focus is on grassroots civil society actors who operate at local and national level, where European values are confronted with significant challenges across Europe. So far, the EU has not developed adequate instruments to this end. We know what the European crucial values are and have discussed them many times. What is also key is to open the space for dialogue between various pluralistic organisations with their views on the civic future of Europe. It is the best background to practise democracy, to give citizens a real opportunity to participate in democracy. This is the only way to keep and develop democracy in Europe, especially in the era of post-truth politics. This instrument should be user-friendly, transparent, accountable, responsive to urgent needs and easily accessible to local civic actors. Only in this way will it bring added value. I strongly hope that the Commission will approve the idea and that adequate resources will be allocated to the European values instrument in the next budget.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Josef Weidenholzer", "mepid": "111014", "text": " Mr President, on behalf of the S&D Group. We should always bear this in mind: good coexistence and long-term stability can only be guaranteed if the state, the economy and society are in a balanced relationship. In the times of communism, we were able to see what it means when the social element is missing. The state, dominated by the party, stifled the commitment of free people. Not least the rise of civil society eventually led to a peaceful revolution. Tadeusz Mazowiecki once put it this way: “Everything depends on the power of society, on its spiritual values, on its wisdom in asserting human rights and the rights of the nation.” But what was undisputed for a quarter of a century and became a cornerstone of the new European self-image, which seems to be forgotten today. From a European perspective in particular, it is necessary to look at this connection. We cannot accept that the civil society sector is again under threat. It should certainly not be an excuse that this seems to be a global trend. Many developments are also worrying in Europe. Administrative measures and policy campaigns are narrowing the area of civil society, as our Fundamental Rights Agency recently stated in a worrying report. If we do not take these well-founded concerns seriously, we will be jeopardising the European project in the long term. We should firmly oppose these trends. Civil society is not opposed to politics, as is often feared and claimed. We need civil society as a critical and sometimes unpleasant partner. This is the only way to ensure that we as politicians do not stand out. It is therefore necessary to promote civil society at European level. And, love Ladies and gentlemen, what is possible for political parties must also apply in this context and, above all, to those organisations that are committed to the values of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Marek Jurek", "mepid": "124892", "text": " on behalf of the ECR Group. — Madam President! The idea that the authorities of some state, but also the authorities of the European Union, would mean an open commitment to the deformation of public opinion, so would be a denial of the freedom on which public opinion and democracy should be based. Unfortunately, such concerns may be justified since European Union authorities have so often expressed concern or criticism over the election results in Austria, Italy, Hungary. It is therefore not excluded that those who lead the union of our states are afraid of the outcome of the next democratic general election, so it is time to remind you again: the European Union is the union of our states, not your ideology. Of course, if this mechanism arises, we will judge it by fruit, we will verify whether it truly serves everyone, but the intentions with which it is created are serious, legitimate concerns.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Sophia in 't Veld", "mepid": "28266", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, I would like to pick up where Mr Jurek left off. First of all, a little correction: it is not a union of Member States, it is a union of citizens and citizens may actually have very different views. What will happen when this instrument is adopted, is that we are actually going to strengthen democracy. Why? Because one of the tasks of civil society is to actually challenge people who are in power. It is to challenge governments. It is called checks and balances, it is the very core of democracy and, yes, that means that civil society could, for example, challenge your government or the Hungarian Government. I think that would be extremely healthy for democracy in those countries and other countries. It is very funny that the European Union has instruments to support NGOs and civil society outside the European Union but not inside.  Therefore, I very much welcome the initiative by Michał Boni. It is also in line with the position adopted by the European Parliament in October 2016 in the report on the DRF Pact so I very much welcome this. I think the report by the Fundamental Rights Agency about the state of civil society also highlights the urgent need for such an instrument. In this context, I would also like to strongly condemn the recent targeting of NGOs and people working for NGOs in Hungary. I think that is a very dangerous development and it should be condemned by this House. Finally, Madam Commissioner, I have just one question because I think the Commission should also seriously implement other instruments aiming for accountability, like the preparatory action on the litigation fund and we have just met with your people this week. But I am also a little bit worried to hear that the Commission explicitly excludes the instrument of litigation or litigation costs as eligible activities, like under the recent call for proposals for the EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation. Litigation is a very important instrument, allowing citizens and NGOs to create this sphere of fundamental rights and the rule of law so please give your support to litigation as well.

We'd like to say that we promote democracy, rule of law, human rights on the international stage. I chair one of Parliament's delegations and I know that the support that we give for human rights organisations in countries where those rights are under attack and where defending them can lead to torture, imprisonment, impunity for those who attack such defenders and repressive laws designed to stop such bodies being effective, is crucial and really important to keeping democracy alive at the grassroots.  Worryingly, I think we're seeing an increasing number of these signs in a number of our Member States. Legislation designed to stop the effective working of organisations defending human rights, rule of law and democracy. Media attacks on the concept of defending human rights. The Fundamental Rights Agency, talks about the stigmatization of human rights defenders. Politicians who want to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights and we see journalists who put their lives on the line by investigating corruption. So the European Values Instrument I think is an important proposal, designed to support organisations who uphold and promote the values on which the EU claims it is founded and these are universal values. This is not a selective choice. This was the choice made by those who have joined the European Union and I think that that direct support is crucial and will only strengthen the way in which the European Union can say that it is acting without double standards but applies the same standards internally as we do externally.

First of all, I would like to remind you that the European project was born in the post-war period not to create a vast market but to protect citizens from the diseases of democracy and the poverty that had devastated it. It was born from the will of countries that came out of fascism, Nazism and, away, welcomed countries that came out of dictatorships: Greece, Portugal, Spain, Eastern countries. It's time to return to the roots of that project: according to the mechanisms protecting the rule of law in member states, they are often perceived as top-down devices, falling from above instead of starting from bass, bottom-up. This is why it is important to support NGOs dealing with rule of law monitoring, advocacy and litigation. Secondly, the crisis of parties and the poverty that returns give NGOs a new centrality: it is they, often, who mediate between power and society. Their strength and independence is as valuable as that of judiciary and media. Thirdly, the Union devotes funds, and rightly, to defend democracy in third countries, including candidates but does not spend anything on the Union's national and local NGOs: a disparity that must be overcome. Fourthly, the support of NGOs in the Member States is virtually guaranteed today only by the EA Norway fund and philanthropic associations: it is often perceived as support that comes from outside and created misunderstandings. In order to overcome such misunderstandings, it is also better to have, in parallel, an instrument which is responsible for the European institutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Jörg Meuthen", "mepid": "190518", "text": " on behalf of the EFD Group. — (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. We are talking today about the fact that a committee decided in an urgary procedure that the European Union should subsidise so-called civil society organisations directly from their caskets. I already have a big problem with the procedure. How can it be that an own-initiative report on such an important issue is not adopted duly adopted in committee on which there are amendments and, above all: public discussions? You have opted for a backroom procedure. The committee authorities have sat down to decide in a small circle something that would throw the previous support system over the heap. In your resolution, you call for the introduction of a special instrument to promote European values, firstly financially and directly. Money for these organisations is therefore bypending the government and parliament of the Member State. Of course, you are thinking of Hungary and Poland in this new instrument. This House and the Commission complain that Poland and Hungary did not adhere to the much-invoked European values. I see this the other way around: Hungary and Poland are defending European diversity. They are fighting to preserve the nation states. They are fighting to ensure that things are not ruled from the distant Brussels ivory tower, but they are fighting for subsidiarity. They are the real defenders of Europe. It's perfectly clear to me that doesn't fit your plan. They want a centralistically governed unitary Europe. And you are ready to pull all the tabs for this. You know that you never have a majority in the electorate for this. But you can't choose another people. That's why you're trying to fabricate a consensus. They want to influence public opinion. I don't need to tell you that this is undemocratic. It is also non-liberal and violates the spirit of separation of powers. Don't you notice how ridiculous you are when you accuse Orbán and the Poles of violating the liberal-democratic “comment” while trampling on Western democracy? I'm afraid not. Because you won't listen to me. I can only give you one last question on your wrong path: Don't you want to finally learn lessons from Brexit?

The example par excellence is, of course, the Hungarian situation where, for example, the Helsinki Committee openly says, 'When we criticize the government's position on migration, then we want to hold the government accountable to the Geneva Convention'. Pure political interference from an organisation funded 80% by Mr Soros and which you are now going to supplement with European subsidies. It's just an example.

He talked about European values. It is not that European values are exclusive to the European Union; it is that the European Union is not just an economic entity, a single market, it is that values go along with that and they are not exclusive because we also observe universal human rights. That is the point. The point is that, with that, a strong independent civil society is essential. The Fundamental Rights Agency recently said that NGOs within the European Union are facing overall budget cuts and economic crisis. NGOs are diminishing, so this work by Mr Boni, supported by all the major political groups, is essential to ensure that that important part of democracy is supported, and supported independently. This flexible instrument is important, and supported, because it provides that distance between the NGOs and the European Union, but allows them to be active and vibrant. These are the core values that are shared by all EU Member States, but we have a duty to support grassroots organisations that are defending human rights independently. Without active and critical civil society we would not be a Union based on democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights. I, myself, was a Chair and a director of an NGO. I know about flexible funding, which is often difficult with regard to bureaucratic EU funding.

But you’re right to say that it will be a challenge, because independence with EU funding is not an easy equation, but it’s critical.

I want to say that by supporting civil society we are not promoting any specific ideology. We are upholding the values enshrined in the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I speak about universal values and one speaker spoke about Japan and South Korea. I am negotiating with Japan, South Korea and the United States the issues of protection of privacy and I can tell you we are speaking here about individual freedoms, we speak about universal values. This must be emphasised. Many times I have received advice from many politicians saying that ‘if the people want to have a say, if they want to be heard, let them join political parties’ or ‘let them come once in four times to elections’, and – the advice continues – ‘be silent in the meantime’. That’s not my way of thinking because I think that the purpose of such advice is that a silent crowd is so easy to handle, and the EU doesn’t want to handle a silent crowd, we want active people. We do not fear active people in the EU. What we want to achieve with this special financial support is not the support of NGOs. We want to support civil society organisations working in specific fields of policy which cover discrimination, the rights of children, the fight against sexual violence and many other things which we frequently discuss here in this House. We share the view that we need the cooperation of civil society. This House is are right: the NGOs must remain independent. That’s why it is so important that the EU will not be and cannot be the only source of financial support. There must be a financial framework with multiple channels, and I am sure this will remain the case in the EU. So again my declaration today is that we are supporting it.

According to the new instrument, from Brussels, they will tell from outside which NGOs are useful to the EU, from outside, which organisations are needed by voters at national or local level.

To enable these organisations to continue to exist, the European Parliament proposes a new financial instrument enabling the European Commission to grant grants to organisations active in the defence of fundamental rights in Europe.

I am very happy and honoured to respond to your invitation on this day, Mr President, so that, as you have recalled at the moment, can freely discuss the situation in our Europe in a particular context. To discuss freely because the proposals and the speeches, I made them several months ago, especially at the Sorbonne, and it is this time of exchange that seems to me today indispensable in this place where you make our Europe live every day in its diverse sensitivities, its divergences and its convergences, by building the essential compromises that advance it. We will exchange our views in a particular context which, I believe deeply, makes our responsibility even greater. A context which is first and foremost one of divisions and, sometimes, doubts within Europe, a context where Brexit continues to be discussed and worked — I want here to welcome the work carried out for several months by Michel Barnier — but also that of a doubt that arises in many of our European countries and which, month after month, has been able to emerge sensitivities that call into question what sometimes seemed to be fundamental. A context in which a form of European civil war reappears, where our differences, sometimes our national selfishness, seem more important than what unites us in the face of the rest of the world. A context where the fascination — and I will return to it — illiberal grows every day. A context where geopolitical threats — and we will certainly return to it in the discussion — give Europe a greater responsibility every day. A context of major international conflicts, such as Levant or the Sahel, but also of the emergence of great authoritarian powers and a clearly elaborated strategy aimed at challenging the framework of multilateralism in which Europe had taken its full place, and which was also the framework of its influence, in which we had collectively built peace. Today we are debating at a time that is also the major transformations linked to digital technology, global warming and its consequences, which deeply question the foundations of the industrial society that founded our great compromises, give rise to fears, lead us to revisit some great balances and impose on us to rethink the action grammar that is collectively ours. Therefore, this moment gives us a special responsibility. We cannot act as if, in a way, our discussions were ordinary. This is the moment that separates us from the forthcoming European elections, where we will have to live our struggles for the ideals that have made us. To begin our discussion, I just want to share with you two strong convictions. The first is that if we decide to abandon our commitment to democracy and all that it carries in Europe, we will go wrong. The second is that, in this context, we can and must build a new European sovereignty through which we will provide a clear and firm answer to our fellow citizens that we can protect them and respond to these world disorders. (Applause) Indeed, in this world and at this difficult time, European democracy — I believe it very deeply — is our best chance. The worst mistake would be to abandon our model, I dare say, our identity. Here, in Strasbourg as in Brussels, you bring to life every day this democracy in Europe that Tocqueville spoke of. Our identity is first of all democracy that respects the individual, minorities, fundamental rights, what was called the name I still claim, liberal democracy. I do not want to let settle down this mortiferous illusion which, let us never forget it, here less than elsewhere, has pushed our continent into a chasm, this illusion of strong power, of nationalism and of the abandonment of freedoms. I reject this idea, which even reaches Europe, that democracy would be doomed to powerlessness. In the face of authoritarianism that surrounds us everywhere, the answer is not authoritarian democracy but the authority of democracy. (Applause) Because this freedom emancipates and protects the individual. A Parliament like yours, ours, is a European miracle. Peaceful gathering of the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe to deliberate together in their differences, strong and heavy in their history and in what has sometimes divided them, is a unique model in the world. This treasure, we have been making it live for seventy years. Let's not get used to it. We took every risk and went through the worst to get there. And if we want to be even more concrete, let's look around us, compare and sometimes look at those powers that can fascinate some with an alleged effectiveness. In which other place in the world do we have this same requirement, obviously in terms of economic, geopolitical, diplomatic and military matters, but also respect for minorities, freedom of conscience, equality between men and women, respect for privacy? Where else, at this point, with the same vitality and strength? So there are divisions between countries, within this Chamber itself, but beyond these divisions, this democratic model that brings us together is unique in the world. Europe's identity is more than a liberty-conscious democracy, it is a culture unique in the world that combines this passion for freedom, a taste for equality, attachment to the diversity of ideas, languages and landscapes. This European model is neither abstract nor dated. Today, it is embodied in our common commitment to the protection of the environment, climate and health. It is now developing in our approach to the digital revolution where only Europeans are so committed to freedom of innovation as well as to fair regulation and the protection of their privacy. This identity clearly distinguishes us from the authoritarian powers above all, but today, we must see it well, from some of the closest allies. Our American partner, with whom we share so much, today faces the temptation of disengagement and rejection of multilateralism, climate issues or trade issues. This model, I am convinced, is powerful as no other and fragile just as fragile because its strength at every moment depends on our commitment and our demand. Every day we have to defend him together. So, in order to live up to this commitment, the first condition is truth and responsibility. Some, blaming all our ills to an honest Europe, fleeing their own responsibilities, tell us with aplumb that the people no longer want Europe. They offer golden lanes. Sometimes we believe them. They then evade their responsibilities when they should lead their people to the end of this adventure. Others wisely argue that we should not hasten the steps so as not to abrupt the peoples, that it would be the game of the populists. They would like to get used to music that we know well, that sometimes paralysis, not becoming aware of the time that is ours. I believe that nothing is more wrong to say that it would be convenient, indeed, to dissolve the people or excite their passions in order to avoid proposing a path, to criticize without proposing, of destroying without rebuilding. It's not the people who abandoned the European idea, it is the betrayal of clerics that threatens it. We must hear the anger of the peoples of Europe today. It is not pedagogy that they need, but a new project, a requirement for daily efficiency, and those who trade in the anger they stirred, propose for the only future the endless path of returning to yesterday's nationalist tearing. We have experienced all the ways and consequences. In order to revive the people's Europe, we must therefore agree to act differently, drawing from the source of democracy. Let's look at things in the face: how can we be satisfied with European elections in which less than one citizen in two moves to vote? So, in the coming year, let us build the reality of a structured debate on convictions and proposals. Today we cannot do the same as yesterday, that is to say, refuse to talk about Europe, distribute places, blame Brussels or Strasbourg of all the evils. Continuing to do this is deciding to have a game of dupes that may be more comfortable for each of us, but that will not solve any problem. Like you, I believe in the nobility and complexity of democratic choice. As representatives of the peoples of Europe, you embody it. You make choices every day, you define compromises, you forge solutions, because you have received the mandate of the peoples, and our common duty is to bring this European democracy to life, which is so young. That is why, ahead of the elections and the time constrained for election campaigns, we must bring the debate to life, create this European public space which we have often left in the wasteland. It is in this spirit of experience and innovation that I proposed citizen consultations this year. I will launch this one in France this afternoon. A frank, open, rough and difficult debate, but indispensable to find out what brings together and separates, to get out of the simplistic alternative of yes or no to a question which is generally not considered presuppositions or implicit texts, and to have democratically a critical debate on our Europe. I am pleased that all Member States have agreed to share this approach. I know the commitment of President Juncker and the European Commission in this action and I want to thank him for that, and I also appreciate your essential role, Mr Tajani, in this exercise. I want to thank you too. I invite everyone in your countries and throughout Europe to animate and participate in these essential debates, because they are a condition for this democratic vitality. The second conviction that I want to quickly share with you is that of the necessary European sovereignty. To defend the European idea is not to defend an abstract idea, the dilution of our own sovereignties. No, it is to take note of the fact that, in the face of these great upheavals of the world, these great transformations, at this moment we are experiencing, we need sovereignty stronger than ours, complementary and no substitute which alone will allow, in the face of great migration, global insecurity and economic, social transformations and environmental issues, to provide the right answers. That is this European sovereignty in which I believe. (Applause) On this subject, you have done a lot and I want to congratulate you on it, but by the end of the legislature, in spring 2019, we need to achieve tangible results on several fronts: immigration, by unblocking the poisoned debate on the Dublin Regulation and relocations, but also by overcoming this debate, building the external and internal solidarity that our Europe needs. I propose to create a European programme which directly supports financially local authorities hosting and integrating refugees. (Applause) The second subject will be the taxation of digital technology following the Commission's proposal, by creating a short-term tax that puts an end to the most shocking excesses. I support this proposal. It is essential, and it will allow, I hope, to find ways of own resources for the upcoming budget. The reform of economic and monetary union is a third essential front before the end of this legislature by defining a roadmap for step-by-step progress on banking union and the establishment of fiscal capacity to promote stability and convergence in the euro area. Finally, what holds us together is not just a currency or a treaty, it is a sense of belonging, in other words a culture. And I could mention, because it is essential, the establishment of European universities that is actually progressing or the deployment of Erasmus, but here I want to stress one of your ongoing work, which I think is essential, that of copyright, the protection of creators and artistic creation. This abundance that infuses our societies is the broth of culture without which Europe would no longer be a continent of vital diversity and creative genius. (Applause) On these four fronts, this legislature has a special responsibility and you have understood what France's position will be. But beyond that, we must build this full European sovereignty to protect our fellow citizens. In the area of internal security, external security and defence, we have made a great deal of progress in recent months, and I welcome the work being done by this House on the European Defence Fund. Faced with all the tensions of the moment with some neighbours such as Russia, Europe has shown a face of unity and of sovereignty. We need to continue this work. Sovereignty is also economic and commercial. Here, too, we have shown this united face, and I welcome the progress made in recent months, at the initiative of the Commission, on economic and commercial sovereignty in defending our strategic investment sectors. These were essential advances in pursuing, in the commercial field — and we will certainly return to that in the debate — a united, voluntary position in terms of developing our economic opportunities but protecting our legitimate interests, both of our workers and our consumers. I believe in this economic sovereignty, which we must pursue through the competitiveness that each State builds through its reforms, by the indispensable solidarity that we must develop further within Economic and Monetary Union and by a more realistic trade policy. Sovereignty is also climate and energy sovereignty. It is indispensable. We will have to open the debate quickly to increase the European contribution under the Paris Agreement. We are in the process of completing discussions on the energy and climate package, but it is clear that we will have to open a new stage. Several of you have already committed themselves to this, and I hope that in the coming months we can reopen the debate on a carbon floor price. France will push the idea of a minimum price and France will support the idea of a border tax on CO2. It is neither a technical lubie nor a technical instrument, it is the condition for a credible energy transition. The fourth sovereignty that we must carry further is that of health and food. In our daily policies, in our budget choices of today and tomorrow, we must support food sovereignty of quality. That is what our fellow citizens expect from us, that is what we owe them. It is good for our economies and territory, it is good for our fellow citizens and it is a choice consistent with our long-term commitments. The fifth sovereignty we must defend is, of course, digital sovereignty. Here I would like to commend your work that has led to the elaboration of what appears today in all international debates as the reference legislation, the one that protects the personal data of our fellow citizens. Where others considered us to be those who, in a way, offered illegitimate protections, we are becoming the unique geographical space in the world where we promote innovation and breakthrough innovation — I will defend these choices in future debates — and at the same time we are building ourselves in the capacity to protect individual freedoms. Finally, this Europe of freedom and equality is based on a foundation of social values that we proclaimed together in Gothenburg. This social Europe is also the one of sovereignty, of this foundation in which we believe. There are differences, but we must not feed differences. The very meaning of the European adventure is that of increased convergence. That is why we have fought with many to regulate the seconded work in recent months. The European Parliament has made it possible to further improve the compromise reached in the Council and I am delighted that this reform will soon be successful, and I would like to welcome the work that has been carried out. This is precisely the image of a protective and effective Europe. We must continue to build these European sovereignties. They must be at the heart of a coherent project and must nurture the philosophy of the forthcoming multiannual financial framework, and I want to conclude my remarks on this point. This budget, which we are going to discuss, must to express a political project of coherence, efficiency and convergence. France is ready to increase its contribution, but to that end, it is a refoundation of the budget itself that must be envisaged by creating new own resources, I am in favour of it, on the digital and on certain energy resources, by removing the rebates that cannot survive Brexit, by dignified financing European action by defence and migration, modernizing current policies and defining conditionalities, I would say rather, criteria for fiscal and social convergence. We must not deny any ambition of existing policies, but we must add the new ambitions we carry. It is in this sense, in any case, that France will work in the coming months. (Applause) As you will have understood, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is, in my view, the seat of European legitimacy, its responsibility and thus its vitality. It is here that part of the future of Europe is played, Europe as a gathering of our sovereignties, by and with an even greater sovereignty, the one that unites us, this Union in the service of peace and solidarity offering the world a unique space of stability and security. It is here that we must anchor the rebirth of a Europe driven by the very minds of its peoples. I hope that, in the coming months, we will succeed in overcoming the divides between North and South, East and West, small or large, and the decline in national selfishness. I belong to a generation that has not experienced war. I belong to a generation that is offering themselves the luxury of forgetting what our predecessors have experienced. There are many who today believe that we can continue to prefer the usual confrontations, the certainties of yesterday because we have become accustomed to them, the divisions well known and well concerted. But I also come from a land and a family that have experienced all the bloodings of our past history. So the choices are simple. I don't want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers. I do not want to belong to a generation that has forgotten their own past or who will refuse to see the torments of their own present. Everyone, in times that open, will take responsibility, but I want to belong to a generation that has decided firmly to defend its democracy because it is not a word that no longer dirty or to which we have become accustomed to or to which we have been alanguished, it is a word that makes sense because it is the fruit of past battles. I want to belong to a generation that will defend this European sovereignty because we fought to have it, because it makes sense and because it is the condition that will allow future generations to choose their own future at that time. I will not give in to any fascination with authoritarian sovereignties, I will not give in to any ease of the present times, but I think that together, our responsibility in the coming months is to organise the real European debate, to have the real European deadlines which alone will allow our peoples to choose those who want a Europe that no longer proposes, those who want a Europe of withdrawal, those who want a Europe of habit or those who are ready to carry a Europe of ambition, of reinvented sovereignty, of a living democracy, the one in which we believe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 44, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Le Président. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": " Thank you very much, Mr President.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 45, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " President of the Commission. — (FR) Mr President of Parliament, Mr President of the Republic, I strongly agree with what the President has just said. The President of the Republic and you, Mr President of Parliament, have hoped for a male and manly dialogue between the President of the Republic and the European Parliament. I therefore take the floor without abusing it. First of all, I wanted to say, as a Luxembourger who I am and European that I want to be, all my emotion and friendship to see the President of the Republic express himself in the way he expressed himself. Real France is back! (Strong applause) We, Luxembourgish, with the immodesty that characterizes us, we usually say that Luxembourg is the small France of abroad. I therefore welcome France's return to us and I would like to tell you that your election, Mr President, and your election campaign have given Europe new hopes. I hope that your ambition during the election campaign and in the aftermath of the presidential events will be crowned with success. You can count on the Commission to support you in your approach and I hope that, as is already the case today, a genuine complicity in ambitions between the President of the French Republic and the Commission will be established. As you have shown this on many occasions, you were among those who supported all the Commission's efforts to make social Europe, not a poem, not a dream, but a reality of today and tomorrow. Let others follow you in this ambition, which is also ours! You were alongside the Commission when it came to reviving investment Europe, the Juncker Plan — as it was called at the time — today's EFSI, led to the mobilization of €273 billion in the field of investment. of investments, 41 of which are in France. This joint joint approach, which was ours, is therefore producing results. I would like you to continue to co-lead the European struggle for commercial sovereignty. With regard to international trade policy, I do not want to see this sad spectacle of a Europe offered. I would like Europe to remain open but not a Europe offered. We have common interests to defend, particularly in the steel industry, among others. I would like to see together to ensure that this gap, which often divides Europe between East and West, is bridged by a renewed common ambition. I believe that the fate of Europe is not written by dividing and rising against each other. Europe is a whole. (Applause) I know the importance you attach to Franco-German friendship, and I am geographically and historically very much in favour of many rapprochements between these two countries and these two nations. However, let us not forget that Europe is not only Franco-German. We are 28, tomorrow 27: it is also necessary, for the engine to operate, the contribution of others. We are 27 and not only French or German. (Applause) I would like our radar of the future to continue to signal the plight of the peoples of the Balkans. I would like to recall the European perspective that we proposed to the countries of the Western Balkans in 2003 in Greece, in Thessaloniki, a city that I like, since I had the honour of being a Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Thessaloniki. So I am deeply attached to this city, for reasons not only historical, but also personal. In 2003, we decided to give a credible European perspective to the countries of the Western Balkans. I am aware of all the difficulties on this subject which the Commission is going to discuss today, with Federica Mogherini and others. I am not naive, I am aware of the difficulties, the efforts that the countries of the Western Balkans must make, of the need to improve the performance of certain countries in the Western Balkans in some respects, but if we take away from these countries, in this extremely complicated region — I should say tragic — the European perspective, let us relive what we experienced in the 1990s. I don't want a return from the war in the Western Balkans! We will have to focus on this ambition. (Applause) Finally, I support the initiative of the President of the Republic to launch this citizens' dialogue. This is in fact an extension of a Commission initiative, which we call the Citizens' Dialogues. I have taken part in many of these dialogues, and we have conducted more than 500 of them in all the Member States of the European Union. I encourage the President of the Republic, the French Government and the Minister for European Affairs to make this a major event, not only in France but throughout Europe. Europe deserves a thorough democratic debate. Actually, tomorrow's story is written today. I wish we could write it together.

President Macron, my Group is glad to have you here. France is a proud country, but you know France can only be strong if Europe is strong. You spoke today about the values of Europe, about our common union of values. And you are right, secondly, to convince Europeans it is important that Europe must deliver – protect our borders, stabilise our euro, fight against terrorism, common defence, fair taxation – the list is long and you can rely on the PPE as a strong partner in this agenda. Concrete projects and values: this has always been the approach for convincing people about Europe over the last decades. So why, today, is Europe under so much pressure and even in crisis? My answer is: people do not feel involved. The reality is that they still see Europe as an external power and not as their own project. The key question for the future of Europe is: who has the power? The people in Europe, or some elite groups? To answer this question we do not have to invent anything new. We simply have to practise what is the essence of Europe, what has been fought for over generations with blood, sweat and tears; we must dare to practise parliamentary democracy in the future. You spoke about democracy. I want to be a little bit more precise. What makes parliamentary democracy such a strong force? It gives people a say and brings them together. When my voice matters, I care, I engage, I belong, and I am willing to work for a greater common good. And what if my voice does not count? Then it starts to feel like this is not my Europe. This is visible everywhere today: in newspaper headlines, in Facebook comments and in voting turnout.  When you lose people, you lose Europe. It is good to knock on the doors of Europeans and ask for their opinion on Europe, and many Members of this European Parliament are doing this on a daily basis; to speak, to convince, to discuss with Europeans. But it makes, in the end, a big difference, and you know this: to simply stand in front of people and ask them their opinion (afterwards you can care or not), or whether you stand in front of people and ask for their vote, because then the people have the power. That is why we need parliamentary democracy. And now to be more precise. True democracy does not work just during the meetings of the Heads of State or Government. Too often, they postpone their decisions, too often, they only look at who is the loser, who is the winner, and tomorrow’s headlines at home. True democracy does not mean decisions are taken behind closed doors. True democracy means more than just a meeting – and Jean-Claude Juncker has already said this – between Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron: the Franco—German axis is important but it is not Europe. Europe is much, much, much, much more. (Applause) True democracy does not mean denying responsibility. Leaders and national ministers cannot keep blaming and shaming Brussels for their own decisions, and true democracy does not mean dividing us into good and bad Europeans. I respect the will of the voters in every Member State, whether it pleases me or not.  So what is true democracy? President Macron, just take a look around here. The Chamber of the European Parliament is the right place to discuss this. Every citizen is given a voice here. You can find Communists, you can find Conservatives, Christian Democrats, Liberals, Greens, Social Democrats and even right-wing extremists. Some people call this old Europe: I call this democratic Europe, where people recognise themselves, with their concerns and needs, with their different views and with their representatives. The European Parliament is the political landscape of our continent and they can be proud of this.  There is no vote on a President of Europe, there is no European-wide referendum. There is simply only one event where all Europeans together are asked for their opinion on Europe. Political issues in Europe must be in the hands of the voters during the European elections, just as national interest issues are in the hands of voters during national elections. And for the same reason, the European Parliament is the only place to elect and to control the European executive bodies – the Commission, or, as I call it, the government of Europe.  This is why the people must be given the right to decide who will become the next President of the European Commission. Candidates must stand for election, must defend their programme, explain to people what they stand for and, finally, they have to look for the support of a majority of this Chamber of freely-elected Members of the European Parliament.  (Applause) This is how the German Bundestag works. This is how the Spanish Cortes works, this is how the Polish Sejm works. It is simply parliamentary democracy in practice, which gives the power to the people.  And let’s call a spade a spade. Not a college, but a government; not a Commissioner, but a Minister; not a regulation, but a law; it would make things understandable for people if we were to do so. And those who want to become a Commissioner next year should probably run in the European elections. Let the people decide who the government should send to the Commission next year.  Other elements are equally important. A true democracy can only survive if it has common basic convictions. There is no French, German or Croatian way of life, there is only a European way of life, and we can be proud of this fundament. It is unique in the world.  A true democracy in Europe also means believing in a vision. Politicians like Kohl, Delors and Mitterrand have made the impossible possible because they followed their European dream. But again, the key question for true democracy is: when this Parliament decides to freeze the negotiation process with Turkey, then the process has to be really frozen. When this Parliament is deciding about strengthening the external border, then Frontex officers have to be sent to the external border, and when this Parliament decides to introduce free interrail passes, then the project has to see the light of day. So the people of Europe must decide – and we are representatives of the people of Europe – about the future of the European project. If we ignore the European people, the people will ignore us, and that is what we are facing sometimes today.  So let us rebuild Europe as the most successful form of government ever invented by man: a parliamentary democracy. And I know this idea is not welcomed by everybody, but we have to overcome our trauma. Since 2005 we have been discussing more about red lines and not enough about ambitions. The French say no more Treaty change, the Germans say no more money, the Central Europeans say no more Brussels. I tell you, my main fear is not another Brexit; my main fear is a frightened Europe, and we will not be able to cope with the next crisis if we go on with this, so let’s start now.  Today we have the President of France with us. With his forward-looking approach for Europe we can achieve a lot. The PPE is ready to work for a democratic Europe with ambitious projects, but in the end the people are the owners of the European dream and the European future.  As a young student, I was very much marked by the history of the ‘Weisse Rose’. Young people, students in Munich – the youngest was Sophie Scholl, 22-years-old – were arrested by the Gestapo in February 1943. They had used flyers to call for resistance against the Nazis. I quote from one of their flyers: ‘The imperialist idea of power must be disarmed whatever side it comes from, for all time. [...] Only with generous cooperation between the peoples of Europe will it be possible to create the ground on which a new construction is possible. [...] Freedom of speech, freedom of confession, protection of individual citizens from the arbitrariness of violent criminal states, these are the foundations of a new Europe.’ In Munich 1943, four young people were executed for these ideas. This has always motivated me to carry on their dream, dear friends. (Applause) And I am sure they would be proud of what has been achieved during the last decades, a Europe of peace and freedom. And the task of my generation now is to build up a real democratic Europe, but the future is in the hands of the people of this continent, a true parliamentary democracy for Europe. Let us begin.

In these days where the enemies of Europe, those who would like to fight the European project, shout out their hate, and in these days where fake news is going whole countries, we need to certify and to reconfirm that we need this united Europe and we need a strong Europe. Somebody like you, President Macron, having dedicated his own faith to his commitment on Europe, is very warmly welcomed in this House. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your pro-European stance. We need that and we would like to see more leaders doing the same. Just look at the slaughtering in Syria and what happened over the weekend. but, please, this is a real case for a unified Europe. This is a real case for strengthening the European institutions. This is a real case for strengthening Federica Mogherini, the High Representative, the United Nations and António Guterres. So please work in that direction. More is Needed Than the Action of Member States. Look at the Facebook scandal. Look at the situation in Europe and world-wide. Data protection is at the top of the agenda today. but, just as we need European institutions to strengthen our foreign policy, we need European legislation. Facebook needs European legislation. Facebook urgently needs the community method and our group, the Socialists and Democrats, proudly lead on e—privacy and on general data protection. Please support us in the Council. And now, forgive me, when I start to talk about the relationship between Paris and Berlin, I feel tempted to switch to my native tongue. Mr. President, who do you want to work with? Who is your partner? It is true that we sing the Beethoven anthem — the European anthem. But it's not enough to step off red carpets and sing the anthem. We have to make our dream come true, and incidentally, when we talk about history in Germany talk: Friedrich Schiller, who wrote the text on this magnificent European anthem, did it against German small-state affairs, against the Napoleonic Wars and at a time when the liberals were just about to discover that their idea of human freedom is only in a society of the same, only in a society of the same brotherhood and sisterity can become a reality. If we ask ourselves today, “Where is the situation in Europe? “, let's go back to the roots. If this European idea of universal freedom saddles people because it does not create a world of brotherhood and sisterity, then the axe is placed on the European project, and that is why we have difficulties today, and we must remember this in order to overcome it. So again the question: who do you want to work with? You have difficult days ahead of you. “Madame No” in Berlin has already shown how difficult it will be to reform the Economic and Monetary Union, and the many small mini-Schäubles that are already positioning themselves in the German Bundestag on the occasion of the debates today in the German Bundestag will not make business easier for you. (Interjections and applause.) What story do we learn? It's not internationality. No, you need a strong European Commission. You need a strong European Commission, supported by a strong European Parliament. This is the only way will economic and monetary union progress, and that is what the European Socialists and Democrats stand for. If you are looking for an intergovernmental project with Berlin, I have a suggestion: go to Angela Merkel and tell her: “Look, Angela, you are drastically reducing the use of coal and I drastically reduce the use of nuclear power.” sustainable development could serve the European Union. (Applause) You have chosen the right slogan: Europe is about protecting our people. Europe must protect its people. But why, then, do you block the work-life balance package in the Council? We fought for this package, and we want the mother to be able to come back after the baby break and decide for herself when she is in the family and when she is in the workplace. This is an important thing that we can move forward together. Why are we blocking the financial transaction tax when it comes to justice? (Applause) Why can we no longer make up for a European corporation tax if we want to tax large corporations? And last but not least: Europe's dignity decides when dealing with refugees. Are you sure that what is being done in France at the moment is in line with the size of the nation and the European dignity? I have question marks. Social Democrats have been fighting for more than 150 years — for more than 150 years! — for a united Europe and for a Europe of solidarity. This is not always the Europe of red carpets, but this is certainly the Europe of schools and universities, workshops and marketplaces. I believe, Mr President, that you have to decide: if you want to be with the people, you will find friends in my group. But that must then become a reality in our common concrete policy. We wish you luck, but we also wish you to make the right choice!

The European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) Group welcomes a leader with a bold vision and a desire to shake things up, for too many national politicians praise the idea of ever-closer union when in Brussels or in Strasbourg, but when they return home their support for the European project of further political integration becomes a barely audible whisper.  Monsieur le Président, what you say in Paris is what you have said here in Strasbourg, and that is to be respected, but when it comes to your desire to reform the European Union, the ECR Group agrees with the objective but I am afraid the devil is in the detail.  Whilst we share your commitment to strong transatlantic relations, cutting red tape to help businesses create jobs, and the need for closer security cooperation, your vision of a European Union with a bigger budget, harmonised corporate taxes, unified social policy, a common asylum system and a European Minister for Finance may be the right vision for France, but the ECR Group feels it is not the right vision for all Member States.  While there will be many in this Chamber who see you as a saviour of the European project of political integration, many outside this Chamber do not want to see an EU dominated by just one or two large Member States. They want national leaders to find common solutions which are agreeable to all Member States, but what you propose, Monsieur le Président, is revolutionary. But rather than sleepwalking – to use your phrase – towards your goal, it should be presented to voters across the EU, with an honest disclaimer, in large letters, bold and underlined, that Member States will become less and less sovereign as the EU becomes more and more sovereign, as you wish to see.  All politicians need to be careful. You talk about temporary taxes but I am reminded of Ronald Reagan’s line that there is nothing more permanent than a temporary government programme. The growing dissatisfaction amongst voters has not been because the EU has too little power, but because it has too much. Despite this power, it has failed to secure the greater stability and prosperity that was promised. Countries signed up for cooperation in key areas of mutual interest with their EU neighbours, not to see more and more decisions made in one city on the other side of the continent.  Mr Macron, we understand why you are seeking to regain the initiative. My Group agrees that the European Union has drifted for far too long, but by returning to the 1950s agenda of political integration you may be in danger of ignoring those who want the EU to face the challenges of the 2050s, not the 1950s. That is why the ECR Group believes that the EU should facilitate nations to cooperate where necessary, but return powers to Member States and local communities in areas such as immigration and social policy. But when countries do agree that an EU solution is the best solution, all countries should stick to the rules and not pick and choose, as we saw with the Stability and Growth Pact or with the Dublin Regulation on asylum.  The ECR Group believes that common sense and proportionate regulation, rather than more political integration, will allow businesses, farmers, fishermen and entrepreneurs to compete in global markets, but we also ask for more honesty. We ask that richer eurozone governments be honest with their voters that their taxes will be transferred to the budgets of poorer eurozone countries, possibly forever, for that is the way that currency and sustainable currency unions work. Like your movement, Mr Macron, the ECR was established to offer an alternative to the longstanding and stale political establishment in the EU. We have appreciated your honesty about your ambitions here today. While I may be one of a number of MEPs who will not return to this Chamber after the 2019 elections, the ECR Group will continue to fight for a vision of a reformed European Union. We will continue to oppose calls for ever more political integration, but where there is common ground the ECR Group hopes to work with you to shape a reformed European Union which respects all Member States and their citizens. Let me just end on a more personal note. As our two nations, the UK and France, work together with the US in Syria, supported by our European and international partners, can I thank you for your cooperation and hope that our countries will continue to act as partners where it is in our interests to face global challenges together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 50, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": " on behalf of the ALDE Group. — (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Republic, ladies and gentlemen, I want to start where Mr Kamall has finished his speech and I would like to repeat in your presence what I said yesterday in this very Chamber of the European Parliament, namely that we fully support the military action that has been carried out in Syria by France and other allies. It must be said, ladies and gentlemen, because a regime that uses chemical weapons against its own population is a genocidal and illegitimate regime. That is the reality that must be acknowledged. (Applause) But it must also be said, Mr President, that this intervention demonstrates our weakness because it is France that intervenes, it is the United Kingdom that comes in and launches missiles, it is not the European Union. Sixty-five years after the National Assembly torpedoed the European Defence Community — we tend to forget — the European army still does not exist. It must also be said, ladies and gentlemen, that our foreign policy is also occasionally an illusion because of our lack of unity, because of this unanimity rule that still exists to date for the Union's foreign policy, which is an aberration and which must be put to an end. This weakness, let us admit, is not only about our external action. You used the word “paralysis” in your intervention. A paralysis is declared at the internal level, let's say it. When a country like the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, it is difficult to say: “Ah, what a success!”. Moreover, there are, of course, authoritarian drifts in Poland and, above all, in Hungary. Ladies and gentlemen, in a recent report on the Hungarian elections, the OSCE speaks of “intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric”, “media bias” and “opaque electoral financing”. These are almost the same terms, word for word, that in the comments made by the OSCE during the election of Putin. It must be clear: in my opinion, there is no place and there will never be room for illiberal states in our Union. Freedom of expression, the rule of law, legality before the law are not only liberal principles derived from the Enlightenment, but also and above all European values. Something needs to be done in this regard. At the moment, we do nothing strictly. I was touched, Manfred Weber, by the words you used, by this pamphlet written by these young people in 1943, murdered by the Gestapo. You have gone to the heart of the existence of the European Union and it is, in any case, better than sending telegrams of congratulations to Mr Orbán. That is the reality. (Applause) I think, Mr President, that it is this refusal to tackle aberrations in Hungary, this inability to act in the major conflicts in our neighbourhood, this inability to respond to migratory flows — let us say it, because that is the reality of today! — which also affects our economy. The Americans, during the 2008 financial crisis, responded in nine months with a plan to clean up the banks, with investments of $2,500 billion — in nine months and with two different administrations, one Democrat and the other, Republican! What about us after nine years? After nine years, we have not yet cleaned all our banks, we do not yet have our banking union, we have not yet created the new governance of the euro area. I am therefore strongly afraid — I will say this very openly here — that Europe is not ready for the moment if tomorrow — hopefully this will not happen, of course — a new financial crisis is triggered. We must ask ourselves in this debate, Mr President, why? What is not working in the Union? Why, in the European Union, is it always too late, too soft, too weak? It must be said and acknowledged: it is the intergovernmental system with, at its core, this foundation of unanimity that is doomed to failure and inertia in this world which is constantly moving faster and faster. It must be added — we have already talked about this during the debate — the binary political system that governs the Union and which, from the beginning, is gone. It is not only about the two major traditional parties in this chamber — I will not say any harm to them, they are our colleagues — but also, we have already talked about it, about the Franco-German axis. It must still be said: he is not in good shape at the moment. Make no mistake: I am in favour of having a very good relationship with Mrs Merkel, but of course, the future and the next Europe cannot depend solely on the 'random agreement' between two Heads of State. We need a lot more! Let us face it, the Eurosceptics — there are a number of them here and you will hear them after our speeches, because at the moment you listen to the good part of the speeches — are not always wrong, naturally, let us admit it. It must be recognised that a large majority of our fellow citizens — as you said — are exasperated by the inertia of the Union at the moment. As you said, the problem of citizens is not the European Union, but the way we manage the European Union. You saw right in your speech at the Sorbonne. The solution to break this inertia is not to break Europe, but it is to reinvent it, to redesign it, I would say. You said — and you have said here today — that true sovereignty is European. I must say that it is very courageous of you in a country that has always thought “long live Europe, as long as it is French!” — which was still a bit of the feeling in France. What is important in this debate, Mr. President, is that you have broken up with what i call a platitude, you did something incredible: you convinced the french during the election that a nation is not sovereign when it withdraws on itself, but when society and its citizens regain power over their own lives, over their own destiny. You convinced the French — and certainly this chamber — that for this we need a new European project, a transnational project with a pan-European impetus. I encourage you to persevere because the conservative forces in Europe are still powerful. Too many say “Let's stay on the status quo, nothing should be done! Keeping power is actually more important than exercising it!” Between us, I sometimes feel that compared to conservatives in Europe, even SNCF is a stronghold of reformers. Do not hesitate, do not abdicate: after 2019, you will find another European Parliament, with many more people who will support you, a “Europe” generation that demands boldness! When I talk about boldness, I always end, Mr President, with Danton, who said: 'Boldness, boldness, still bolding'... and Europe will be saved!

Its European headquarters had been physically occupied but politically empty for too long. Certainly, Europe cannot be neither French nor German, but it cannot build anything in the long term unless it can count on the resolute commitment of Germany and France. A France that could, if it really wanted, embody within its borders the European motto of unity in diversity. Mr President, your ambition for Europe overlaps in many respects with the long-standing struggles that we regionalists and ecologists have been leading. We are convinced, like you, that Europeans must act together if they are to meet the challenges of this century. This is where the key to our true sovereignty lies. We share your willingness to build a political union that gives back the voice to the citizens, who must be at the heart of the European project, not on the margins. Like you, we want to give a future to our common currency, which requires, in fact, a robust investment budget, a common guarantee of bank deposits, but also an end to tax competition and social dumping. Finally, we are with you to say: “Make our planet great again”. As we know, and you know, Europe must be at the forefront of the ecological transition, starting with its budget, which must be the instrument of it. Ecology is the key to our prosperity. Mr President, what you want for Europe, you say that France must start doing so itself today. Yet, your action in France tells a whole different story, a story that underlines your country's motto: freedom, equality, brotherhood. Where is freedom when your citizens can be under arrest, house arrest and searches on mere police suspicions? Where is freedom, when armed police arrive in the early morning to arrest a group of young people whose only harm would be to have peacefully occupied a construction site? My daughter was part of that group. She was taken in front of her two-year-old son, far from home, to undergo an interrogation for a whole day. In your France, the rule of law, guarantor of our freedoms, is moving away day after day. Freedom, equality. Where is equality when you impose more precariousness on workers while at the same time, you make tax gifts to the richest, the ones you like to call the first of rope? Your faith in them is unshakable. But, you see, what defines the rope, Mr. Macron, is the rope. It is it that allows to adapt the speed of the first rope to the needs of the group. It is also the one that prevents the last rope from falling into the ravine. But in our societies, Mr President, this rope no longer exists: the rich are getting rich, the middle classes stagnate and become precarious, and the most fragile ones are abandoned to their fate. Freedom, equality, fraternity. Is it in the name of brotherhood that you sell weapons to regimes that return them against their own population or against their neighbours? Where is this fraternity, when your police lacks tents and sleeping bags of migrants? Expeditious procedures, non-suspensive remedies, administrative detentions are the ingredients of your Asylum and Immigration Bill. Contain and repress rather than welcoming human beings in forced exodus. Freedom, equality, fraternity. In the country of the climate agreement, I will add a fourth term, namely “sustainability”. You say you want the carbon tax, the end of glyphosate, the end of diesel cars, bravo! But at the same time, you remain an ardent promoter of the current free trade treaties and, worse, nuclear power. You have allowed, unlike your predecessor, the adoption by the European Union of a completely lax definition of endocrine disruptors. Certainly, you had the courage to put an end to this senseless airport project in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, but it is to crush in violence the projects of those who have invented for years a different way of life. Mr President, a book tells you a philosopher. He says that none of your words is the result of chance. A few months ago, you talked about “successful people” and “people who are nothing.” You did not say “people who do nothing” or “people who have nothing,” you talked about “people who are nothing”. You see, for us, the European project is precisely to ensure that never again, in any part of this continent, no woman or man can be considered “nothing” or think of themselves as “nothing”, because to consider human beings as “nothing” means allowing them to suffer anything, and that we will never accept it. (Applause) Mr President, you have become a habit of giving a gift to your distinguished guests. Allow me to do the same. I offer you this climbing rope, symbol of the rope you seem to hold on. I tell you this: whenever you advance the cause of freedom, equality and fraternity in Europe, whenever you act for a more just, more sustainable and democratic Europe, we will be at your side. Otherwise, you will find us on your way.

It is difficult to understand your concept of sovereign Europe at the very moment when you made the decision to bomb sites in Syria, outside the framework of European discussions, without a UN mandate and with Mr Trump and Mrs. May as the sole alliance. No matter how unbearable, condemnable and abject the use of chemical weapons by the dictatorial regime in Damascus may be, you cannot be free from the framework of international law. Even the September 2013 resolution against Syria obliges it under Chapter VII of its Charter, which expressly mentions that the decision falls within the purview of the Security Council. What is serious and worrying here is twofold. If our country produces acts that in fact violate international law, then we are paving the way for the law of the world jungle. On the other hand, why double standards? On the one hand, the readiness to bomb in Syria without waiting for the conclusions of the expert mission when Israel, with impunity, kills in Gaza, when Turkey grabbed Afrin and when Yemen is shelled in total silence. We would grow to work on a project for a peace and co-development conference between Europe and the Near and Middle East, including recognition of the State of Palestine. If your citizens' consultation project was intended only to oppose those who would be for a European integration and those who would be against them, I believe we would be in a mortiferous trap. There is another far more productive path, that of a progressive, social, democratic and ecological transformation of the European project, that is, the modern and new way of a union of nations and associated peoples, free and sovereign. The word “refounding” should not hide the forward, ultraliberal, austeritary and ademocratic flight, the very one that causes in all Europe a huge anger, which you talked about. In France, the bustling of employees, pensioners, job deprived of employment, those whose lives are precarious or even crushed comes from more than a decade of austerity, while large companies generate profits and tax evasion is breaking records. For Europe to protect them, we must end this old dogma of competition, which allows social and fiscal dumping, promotes relocations, lowers levels of remuneration for work and destroys public services. It is solidarity Europe that we should invent. Let us carry out an innovative act for all European citizens, that of social security at work combined with the necessary training to ensure a higher harmonization of wages and the right to housing for all. Europe does not protect when it goes ahead of these free trade treaties that destroy our social, health and environmental standards. Let us invent equal exchange and cooperation instead of this economic war, a new agricultural and food policy that secures our peasants and food quality, a mercy fight against tax evasion and tax havens, and the taxation of financial transactions. A Europe that protects would be one that would no longer let refugees sink into the sea and stumble on walls but would reach out for asylum, as proposed by a report by this Parliament which could also be used by your Minister of the Interior. To protect workers and peoples, for sovereignty, it is necessary to have the courage to emancipate oneselF from the dominance of financial markets and to invent new mechanisms to cancel illegitimate debts, renegotiate others and to give ourselves the means to effectively mobilize the enormous sums of money created by the Central Bank for the economy of the future: public services, environmental and digital transition through the creation of a fund for human, social and environmental development. Such a fund would also be a very good tool to undo our SNCF debt, to carry out a common project for freight in Europe at the service of the climate, it could also be a tremendous lever for launching a large European digital company to emerge from North American domination.

You have come to please: to please the powerful, as you always knew how to do; please the richest, who can now, in your own words, fend themselves on their own, exonerating themselves from their duty of solidarity with the nation; to please the givers of professional lessons, to those who have long confiscated power and have turned the back to the peoples. Your jury is here, in the ranks of the European Commission, and it is he who assesses you every day and it is he who, today, will put you a note. Rest assured, your rating will be excellent because your speech has unsurprisingly resumed all the canons of European catechism. Your jury gives you a good point when you talk about European sovereignty, a way of undermining national sovereignty, the only one that is worth democracy. Your jury gives you its encouragement when you endorse its agenda: liberalization, destruction of public services, total opening of borders in defiance of senseless migratory risks and terrorist risk, ideological condemnation of any form of commercial protection. Today, it is true, you have little missed the congratulations of the jury, because you have spoken for once in French, while, more and more often, in your public expression, you are abandoning the language of Molière and the Francophonie to the benefit of Anglo-American. But, rest assured, you stay darling of the Commission. You are so good pupil, so well applied to the policy of the Commission and the lobbies that you have already joined Tony Blair and Matteo Renzi as the Brussels whooping cough. And, like them, you are doomed to promise to reform the European Union, but you are already disappointing because it is irreformable by construction. Mr President of the Republic, you have already failed on the seconded work and on glyphosate. That's why I'm sad. Leading an old nation like France is too noble a function for it to spoil in this Star Academy of fading stars of the European flag where everyone scrolls like a vulgar pupil. Mr President of the Republic, do not wade in the croupy waters of technocrats and lobbies. The world here is already the old world. The world of tomorrow is the world of people who raise their heads. Be connected to this dynamic of history. Under the leadership of Nigel Farage, followed by so many others, the British people have already broken their chains. Yes, the British people, whether you like it or not, voted sovereignly for their freedom and independence. Freedom is the future, the European Union is already the past. Mr President of the Republic, therefore, talk about France and, therefore, talk to the world, as France knows how to do when it is free and as President Chirac knew how to do in 2003, when he knew how to refuse American wars. You said that yourself in a recent interview with the BBC channel, if a referendum on Frexit were held in France, Frexit would prevail. So be a Democrat, so make this referendum in France, offer young people pride, the elders dignity and all freedom. France is much better than a long exhausting head-to-head with Brussels and Berlin. France is a country on all continents and oceans. Our nations are good civilizations brighter than any European treaties will ever be. Let's get out of the European Union and go back to the world. And if, by adventure, Mr President of the Republic, this prospect did not seduce you, then you could reconvert to the European Commission or directly get recruited from Goldman Sachs.

Have you, therefore, taken nothing from Iraq or Libya from these interventions that their authors justified at the time by moral considerations, but which led to war, create chaos and allow jihadists to prosper? Are you not aware that in France and Syria it was also the worst of Islamists who applauded your strikes? In international matters as in many others, you are finally far away from the new world you claim to embody. You coalize around you, in a reflex of a besieged citadel, all the beneficiaries of this old world, of a breathtaking model, all those who have an interest in what it perpetuates, all those who still dream of the global village. Your plan to escape forward appears above all as the pale synthesis of Jacques Delors and Édith Cresson, that of an ever more bureaucratic and less democratic construction, that of an amnesian Europe, without borders and without identity. Under the looks of a certain modernity and not without some communication skills that you must recognize, you are finally against the current world. For human and cultural reasons, for economic and ecological imperatives, this century will be the one of the return of the very notion of boundary, that is to say, of border, does not deprive the zealots of the unimpeded free movement of goods and people, which has become free movement and weapons and terrorists. Sunday night you have said that France should be “a more flexible and mobile country”. Mobility and flexibility are words, slogans, advertising, com, so far away from real politics and its demands. What we need to guarantee is a sustainable France and sustainable nations in Europe. People have started to speak, Mr President. Listen to what the United Kingdom, Austria, Italy, Poland and Hungary have said, in turn, but also many Frenchmen. These peoples want their economies, businesses and jobs to be protected from unfair competition. They do not want posted workers or free trade treaties, which a small minority benefit to the detriment of the real economy and the people who suffer from it. They want to put an end to unstoppable and endless immigration. They want to regain their sovereignty, that is, simply, their freedom. Yes, people want to be able to decide for themselves. In the past it was called democracy. People express their rejection of this European Union, which intends to decide on everything but is unable to meet the challenges where it is really expected. A paradoxical mixture of deregulation and overregulation, absent and powerless in technological innovation, food safety, artificial intelligence or personal data protection, the European Union is pervasive when it comes to undermining the freedom of nations. You want to accelerate by leaving aside those nations that would not share your choices and who, according to your expression, would not want to “move forward”. But what, Mr President? Moving forward towards more European integration, less economic regulation, more immigration and communitarianism? With you — and you will probably have Mr Verhofstadt's support — it would therefore be Europe without Hungary but with the Turkey. “It seems impossible to imagine a renaissance for Europe that does not take into account the demands of rooting,” said Albert Camus, speaking of the work of Simone Weil, the philosopher. The rebirth of Europe, its refounding, must be rooted in our nations, in our common civilization. This is the challenge of identity that we must meet together. The identity of nations is not a weight, on the contrary, it is a weapon and a shield in globalization, it can be a formidable factor for success and outreach.

You want, like me, to give a future to France and Europe, which is going through a deep crisis of legitimacy and disasusing peoples. But Europe, this civilization of freedom, will be nothing tomorrow if it is erased by demographic realities. On Sunday night, you quoted essayist Stephen Smith about Africa. I will therefore repeat his figures: today there are 510 million Europeans in the Union and 1.3 billion Africans in the neighbouring continent. In 30 years, the proportion will be 450 million Europeans for 2.5 billion Africans, or five times more. And by 2100, three out of four people who will come into the world will be born south of the Sahara. Your Minister of the Interior, Mr Collomb, himself spoke of “migratory submersion”. Immigration is not the cure for Europe's ageing. Immigration brings more dependents than assets. It destabilizes our societies and helps to tear apart our national units, fragile legacies of centuries of struggle. What we need is to make living gains made productive, to encourage labour mobility within the Union, to revive our European birth, to digitize our economies by focusing on robotics and artificial intelligence. Mr President of the Republic, our freedoms are primarily the product of our civilization. It is this evidence reminded us of Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and Vienna.

I was a former minister and I particularly liked this exercise. I will not necessarily repeat in chronological order but try to answer the main points that have been raised. Firstly, however, when we talk about sovereignty and national or European peoples, I would like to make two or three clarifications to Florian Philippot. I am surprised that you can say what you said about this assembly, in which you are. You were elected there by the French people. You have a strange respect for the French people to treat the function they have entrusted to you like that. (Applause) If you didn't like this assembly, you shouldn't come to it, that's all! (Applause) You had to go to other elections, you had to submit to them. As for the project that would be the real French project, but finally, the French chose it last May. Both of you were defending a project that lost. And he lost because the French people decided so. (Applause) Nevertheless, you are expressing anger. I have already said this on several occasions: we must hear it, and I hear it. As I have always said, I have always had respectful debates, including in the campaign with Mrs Le Pen, and that is why I will not find myself in the ease of the comments that have been judging from here what should be done in a country by telling about all the nonsense to which I answered at length last Sunday. It is precisely because I am here with the legitimacy of the French people, but with all the demands of the French people, that I cannot accept what you have said about what is happening in my country. First I want to tell you that it there is a Constitution in my country, which has not waited to incorporate fundamental freedoms, a declaration of human rights, a preamble of 1946 and all these values, and that there is a Constitutional Council to judge and determine whether laws respect freedom, equality and fraternity. The laws you referred to, the Constitutional Council has judged them, either by referral to parliamentarians or by question for a preliminary ruling on the law on internal security and the fight against terrorism. So you can make remarks of platform that can fit you, sir, because you have the comfort of this living room, but I don't have the comfort of this place and I have the cohesion. I had the courtesy to listen to you, I ask you the same courtesy. I have had this courtesy which is democratic; you are a representative, I am another representative. The Internal Security and Combating Terrorism Act makes it possible to fight Islamist terrorists in our country. It is in this capacity that it allows home visits, it is in fact that it allows the protection of public spaces. I fully assume that because I am today the president of a country that has been repeatedly attacked by terrorists. Therefore, I cannot explain to my people that we are disarming in the face of this risk because people like you allow themselves to utter untruths in the name of the principles that are rooted in our Republic, defended by the Constitutional Council and which a whole parliament carries. In the name of the respect I have for the majority in Parliament, as for the Council, I cannot let you say the nonsense, forgive me the term, which you have said so. In the same way, you mentioned Notre-Dame-des-Landes's project and, given the time allotted to me, I will not expand further. We have made courageous decisions that have never been made since 20 years to stop a project that was not in line with our objectives. But, the people who were demonstrating against this project, is it legitimate to let them protest and attack the law enforcement forces when there is no more origin to their demonstrations? Agricultural projects, including the most innovative ones, are still on site, carried by people who comply with the rules, but freedom, equality and fraternity also require respect for the republican order, and no project can be built if we do not respect the rules of the Republic. (Applause) (We hear Mr. Coburn shouting “Long live free France”) Long live France and long live Europe. I don't know what you're putting behind free France. If you put the same thing as I do, we have all our place in this inquiry. Many of you have talked about migratory issues. This subject, and you are right to recall Mr Smith's figures, is a much deeper root topic and which we will not settle through any policy today's national policy. That is why I believe that tackling the cause is to help stabilize Africa in terms of security and the fight against terrorism, what we are doing at the United Nations and in the framework of the French intervention Barkhane alongside the Sahel States; it is to have an ambitious development policy that alone will enable development and the emancipation of everyone in his country, and that is what Europe has repeatedly supported through the idea of this Marshall Plan; that is what we support and what we do through the alliance for the Sahel and our policy; and this is the decision I have assumed to increase our official development assistance to achieve a new 0.55% of gross national income by 2020; it is then a policy of external and internal solidarity in Europe and it is the key to having an integrated response to migratory risk. You have heard me speak earlier on these issues that will occupy the Council and Parliament in the coming months, but I believe very deeply that we need European solidarity at our borders to protect ourselves, as well as solidarity within our borders. As such, I made a proposal, but there are many others to be able to share the burden. France must now welcome cooperation with several Member States in this area. I am thinking in particular of Germany and Italy, whom I wish to welcome, and I believe in particular that, together with Italy, we have shown, during the last year, our ability to work together precisely. Just like the one I mentioned earlier, that of cohesion, I am assuming reforms underway which aim, on the one hand, to give an effectiveness to the right of asylum which I have always defended and which I defend vigorously, but which consist in stopping a system where it takes 14 months before obtaining asylum, which is the case in France, when it is six months in Germany, for example. So the whole meaning of the reform which is thus carried by France is to bring our system together with another system, especially that of the Germans or our neighbours, in terms of deadlines and organisation. The French system, today, is not up to the migration challenge that is ours. It is extremely long, it does not distinguish, strictly speaking, asylum seekers from other migrants, and it does not allow us to receive a reception that is equal to what we owe to women and men who arrive either on visas or to apply for asylum and be protected. I fully assume that and, you know, when I speak of the sovereignty of an effective Europe, it is because I refuse the unacceptable plan of nationalist narrowing, because from where I am, I have beaten it, and I also refuse a form of of guilty irenism that would be draped behind principles, forgetting that we must always maintain the cohesion of our peoples at the same time and that there is a reality to embrace. Chesterton had a nice formula, he said, “True idealists are pragmatics.” Look at Robinson Crusoe, he did not leave with great travel ideas but with hams and cheeses and an organization to be able to hold. I invite you to take inspiration from Robinson Crusoe. Secondly, many of you talked about issues that are essential for the functioning of our Europe. I will try to get back in time. On the subject, first, dear President, of the Balkans. I would like to see two lines that seem to me to be a matter of our interests and pragmatism. As for the first, I agree with your desire to tie the Balkans to Europe. Our geopolitical risk is to see the Western Balkans drifting to Turkey or Russia — that is a risk — or collapse into their own divisions. Therefore, giving them a perspective and linking them to a project and this European ambition is essential, but, for my part, I would only defend enlargement when there is first a deepening and reform of our Europe, and I would like us to be able to keep that ambition in these two lines. So I do not want Balkans who would turn to Turkey or Russia, but I do not want a Europe which, working hard at 28 and tomorrow at 27, would decide that we can continue to run and be tomorrow 30 or 32 with the same rules, that is not true. In speaking of these rules, I am convinced that we must have more pragmatic rules. First, if we want to move forward, let's accept it. Many of you have talked about the Franco-German couple, but you never heard me in my speech about the Franco-German couple. I have so was grasped by your reaction that is inspired or educated by history. I am committed to the relationship with Germany, but I never considered it to exhaust the European subject. I simply know, educated in history, that if there are not a minimum of agreements between France and Germany, we are wasting a lot of time moving forward and pretending to make Europe and pursue. But I always wanted, sometimes breaking the front lines that had settled, consider that one could move forward with a form of hard core that we would have predefined. In recent months, I have seen several European leaders with real ambition, who were from countries that some say small or east, or this or that. There are only Member States of the European Union and that is a project logic. But let's try to move forward with a rule that the one who does not want to move forward cannot block others. I also hope that we can make the reforms ahead and move forward with this rule that has been proposed by others in the past, and that we have this degree of ambition. I am therefore in favour of more qualified majority so as not to systematically move towards a logic of blocking, I think this is fundamental. Then you talked about more institutional issues of Parliament, President, and parliamentary democracy. I am deeply attached to it and that is why I wanted these participation exercises too. I am also committed to the separation of powers which goes hand in hand with a Constitution. Constitutions and Treaties are therefore responsible for Parliament and others with the Commission or the Council. If we want to change it, we must ask the peoples to do so, and I am therefore not in favour of deciding to arbitrate this or that competence and, at once, pass it on one side or the other. Besides, I believe so much in democracy parliamentary and the vitality of the expression of peoples that I proposed these transnational lists, because, if we believe in the vitality of peoples and democracy, we must not believe them simply when we organize with parties in elections that remain national projections and with the turnout that is ours today . Let's go to the end of logic! We believe in parliamentary democracy, we want it to be a great parliament, there must be the maximum participation in the elections, so the debates must be truly European and we must therefore dare to go towards a part of transnational lists, the leaders of which could legitimately be the famous Spitzenkandidaten. However, I find it odd, as such, to stop somehow in the middle of the ford and to believe in parliamentary democracy if it remains a democracy of existing, structured parties whose logic is still mainly national, it must be said. I see the time running and I know the rules that the President told me. Nevertheless, I would have liked to come back to several other topics. Let me just finish this with two points: one is Syria, the other is the European budget and the ambitions that we must carry. I do not believe that a higher budget is a problem for our fellow citizens if we know how to organise ourselves, and I do not believe that this European ambition — to clarify this point that many of you have raised — namely a stronger European budget to bring our new ambitions, to bring the ambition of our historic policies , this European sovereignty of which I am talking about, competes with national budgets or national sovereignty. I do not believe so because when I look at the big challenges, that is, energy transition, digital technology, trade, major migration, we need a European response. And we see it on all these issues, the national response is being debated, but it is insufficient, and as such, you have given a great example: the general data protection regulation. It made no sense to do so at the national level, none. We would not have protected anything, there would have been bypass policies, the operators would have gone to Belgium, the Netherlands or Germany if I had done so. You have done this only at the level where it was relevant to do so and at a level where we can stand up to major economic players but where you can create an organisation, and I therefore assume the fact of carrying these two sovereignties because they are complementary. Finally, with regard to Syria, I would like to say first that this intervention by France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America has nothing to do with Iraq or Libya, for a very simple reason: we have not declared war on anyone and we did not intervene in declaring war on anyone. But it's a little always the same principle, basically, what I'm telling you. If we believe in multilateralism, in the strength of law, we must be able, at some point, to decide not to give in to the cynicism of those who want to “powerless” multilateralism, that is what it is about. So, very precisely because this subject, like others, does not suffer approximation: we are engaged in many in an international diplomatic and military coalition that fights against whom? This is the only war that is being waged in Syria, against ISIS, against the Islamist terrorist groups that have attacked us and killed hundreds of people in our countries. This war is legitimate, it has a framework and we are fully involved. This is the only war we are waging today in Syria. But there is a parallel war, the one that Bashar Al-Assad has waged against the Syrian people and their opponents for seven years now. We did not declare the war in Bashar al-Assad, I have said repeatedly, and the interventions of a few days ago did not change anything in that regard. However, we have done constant diplomatic and humanitarian work to do our duty and defend our values, and I fully assume that. United Nations resolutions, in particular resolution 2118 of September 2013, provided for the use of coercion that President Putin used when he visited Paris a little less than a year ago, when I had already presented this red line of chemical weapons use. Indeed, there are international texts condemning the use of chemical weapons, including resolution 2118, with a commitment by all the permanent members of the Security Council and a commitment, at that time, by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. This commitment has been repeatedly violated. On several occasions, several members of the international community have organized themselves to “blame” the United Nations and the International Organization for Combating Chemical Weapons since November 2017, by de-structuring the OPCW attribution mechanism and then opposing all resolutions that allowed further progress. So, I ask you, to the same people who, every time, are indignant at the images we have seen, of children and women who died of chlorine attacks, let us sit down, defend rights by saying that rights are for us, the principles are for us, but that reality is for others. No! (Applause) So, in a context that is very specific, and I would like to recall, where we are fighting on terrorists, where Bashar al-Assad waged war on his people, three countries have intervened, and I say this with great frankness, for the honor of the international community, for, precisely, in a legitimate multilateral framework and in a manner that is so targeted, without any human victims, destroying three chemical weapons production and processing sites. So let's face our principles, indeed, look at international law in front and ask where we want to go. These strikes do not solve anything, but they simply end a system that we had become accustomed to, which is that somehow the law camp would have become the camp of the weak, and I do not solve it. Then we will continue the essential diplomatic work in the Security Council to build the framework for the fight and prohibition of chemical weapons. It started again with always the same Russian vetos. At the United Nations, we will continue to fight for humanitarian access and evacuation in Ghouta, as unfortunately tomorrow in Idlib. We will continue humanitarian work on the ground, and I announced yesterday with France, which will invest €50 million for projects carried by non-governmental organizations on the ground, and I invite all countries to join in this humanitarian effort. Finally, we will continue to work towards an inclusive political solution by speaking to all parties, Russia, Turkey, Iran and the regime and, above all, all opposition forces, to build tomorrow's Syria and repair this country, because that is the main thing. But we will not build tomorrow's Syria if we look away and leave it to Bashar al-Assad's regime and its allies, once they finish the dirty work they are doing.

There have been a series of questions about migration policy. First, I would like to say that everything that happens between France and Italy is not at the initiative of one or the other, but in perfect coordination. I said so by stressing the perfect understanding that we have between our two countries to manage migration flows and situations — you are right to recall — which are always extremely difficult and worrying human situations and which call first of all the greatest humanity but also for coordination. I therefore welcome the exemplary relationship between France and Italy, which will continue. France adopted a reform earlier this year, on the initiative of parliamentarians, to allow the application of the Dublin Regulation, which is currently unsatisfactory — and I agree with you on this point — but no longer applying it at all was unsustainable for a country like France, which today counts thousands of people whose situation is still unsatisfactory. allows them to be in refugee camps, even though they have been refused, for example, in Germany. 50 to 60% of the people who are refugees in France, especially in the Paris region, are called — I do not like this formula, but it is often taken up — “dublined” from neighbouring countries. So if we do not make the current system work, with all its imperfections, it is unsustainable, especially for a country like France. Therefore, on this point, I assume the realism we have shown, which has allowed us to resume what has been done for several years and which will be pursued. Now the question is how to reform this system, because I do not satisfy it and I consider that it does not allow to respond today to the migration challenge as we know it. First, moving towards harmonization of rules. That is what we want to do, especially with Germany and Italy. Harmonising our rules means that we can manage in a much more coordinated way the reception — we should draw heavily on our German neighbours — the deadlines and rules on asylum and the treatment of irregular situations — in this regard, I invite you to look at the rules in force in Germany which are even more drastic than those proposed today by France — but with, behind, an investment in integrating populations and those who obtain titles, which is also our wish. It is to this co-ordination that we will go in the short term through the law. Finally, more broadly, there is the European stage which, as I said earlier, is the most effective stage. On this point, I want here, in response to several of you, to defend, on the one hand, greater solidarity outside the borders. Indeed, we need to assume a European investment to protect European borders and not leave the burden on the countries of entry. This is an indispensable reform without which we cannot support today the migration we have to face and which will continue. On the other hand, we must move towards a common asylum system. I am in favour of it; that is the best answer. Today we are trying to coordinate things. I am in favour of a common asylum system where all Member States would adopt the same rules. Finally, we need to build the rules of internal solidarity and, on this point, several reflections are under way. We have seen all the difficulties of a relocation policy — which was urgently needed. If we want to build the regulations and the laws that will allow us to deal with this challenge tomorrow, i am in favour of assuming solidarity policy funding. That is why, together with others, I am pushing the idea of having an agency that can fund the communities that will be candidates to welcome and integrate refugees. We see all the difficulty of some national debates, we also see cities that are ready to go in this direction. Simply, European solidarity is essential to finance reception and integration policy. On this point, as you have understood, I am in favour of much more convergence, internal and external solidarity, and the same common rules. In the French debate, we often misestimate the fact that the problem we have been having for decades in France is that we do not welcome everyone, that we keep everyone waiting, that we have some of the highest deadlines in Europe for granting asylum and that, at the same time, we do not know how to accompany those who have been able to accompany them. those who are not eligible for asylum and who have no title. Therefore, we are in a situation where everyone is badly welcomed, we do not integrate almost anyone and we do not bring home any of the people who do not have the right to receive a residence permit. So I want to defend such a system, but I can tell you one thing: it is neither fair nor effective. Therefore, I assume this passage which is unsatisfactory for everyone. Some say it is unfair, because indeed we are harder with those who remain in an irregular situation. We are harder to be able to better accommodate those who will be in a regular situation, those who are entitled to asylum. Then you asked me about Brexit. I have a very direct answer on France's position vis-à-vis the United Kingdom and the post-Brexit situation. I am in support of the most integrated relationship possible, the closest one, and there is a solution: we know it well, it is the EU Membership. It is the one that allows good access to the single market, which allows access to freedoms and very good integration. I know we can't promise something to your people and then want to give them the opposite. So there will be negotiations. They are led by Michel Barnier within the framework of a mandate given by the Council. I am very interested in friendship with Britain and we have bilateral relations with regard to the defence and management of common borders, but there is no cherry-picking in the single market. It is a simple principle. I believe in Europe and, therefore, believe in what we have done. Consequently, freedoms in Europe are united and full access requires recognition of all these freedoms, European jurisdiction and contribution to the budget. Afterwards, we know the formulas, but we have to be consistent in the choices we make. This is also democracy, it is explaining the What if scenario to the end. There are many people who propose — to make a nod to your country — what if scenarios, but they don't explain it the next day: the day after is necessarily the moment when you have to embrace the principle of reality. As far as the regions in Europe are concerned, I believe in one thing. I am sensitive to all cultural expressions. They have their place and Europe has always recognised them, but I also believe in the constitutional framework in which they speak. You are MEPs elected in different countries: France, Spain or others, where sovereignty is expressed at the level of a state. So it is within this framework that my answer can be made. I am in favour of accompanying cultural specificities, the richness of our diversity, but to do so in a a framework that is a democratic framework. And this democratic framework requires respect for the constitutions that our peoples have chosen. It may or may not please, but these constitutions do not cut apart and sovereignty does not fall apart unless the people decide to do so. Then, on the link with the European elections, I received all the political formations in France before making this choice. First, had the regional constituencies reconciled France with Europe and allowed much greater participation? No. All political parties believed that they had a national constituency — all but yours, I recognize your consistency in defending it here, but honesty simply requires me to remind you that you were the only ones. All the others were for a national constituency, in view of the fact that the constituencies previously selected by France did not correspond to any political, administrative or even local identity reality. As you know very well, they were relatively artificial splitting of regions whose only coherence was the telephone directory of some thirty years ago. I believe that this does not correspond, from a political point of view, to the reality of France, neither yesterday, nor of today or of tomorrow. I think that this reform, which was wanted by almost all French political groups, was therefore the right one, and I believe in the Spitzenkandidat system. I think he's very good. So, on this point, rest assured. I do not belong to any political family that is represented among you today. This is my freedom, it is quite consistent with the spirit of the French Constitution and this freedom gives me the right not to, in any way, enter into the deliberations that are yours and which will be those of Parliament and the political families whom I eminently respect but which I respect, are neither those of the European Council nor those of the President of the French Republic. Therefore, I consider that it is indeed a step forward that the existing political families propose a Spitzenkandidat. I consider that it was even more democratic to go to the end of this logic and that there is a form of European emanation and a start of European demos that can be made. If we had been coherent to the end, this president, this Spitzenkandidat would have been the top of the list of European parties. I am not opposed to it at all; I am simply not a member of a political family of your Parliament. Therefore, it seems to me that it is extremely coherent. I would just like to say to the Hon. Member that almost all the states you have cited are federal states, so their lists are federal lists. You are right to say which are not transnational, but because they are already federal. If we want to have a start of federal reflection, we have to go towards lists which are transnational, which are at the bottom of truly European lists and which are no longer national lists reflecting European beliefs. I just wanted to make this distinction that seems to me to show reality, because you could have led to other interpretations. Secondly, several of you told me precisely about the Europe that protects. I want to tell you that, in assuming my responsibilities, that is the principle I wanted to bring to the European Commission. Some of them followed me in this formula. I believe in a Europe that protects. This is the basis of sovereignty. Sovereignty is both protection and the ability to carry one's voice in the concert of nations and internationally. It is the very pact that makes our citizens trust us. So yes, I believe in a Europe that protects in all forms. I defended this formula in all my speeches and in my action. It is also under this Europe that protects that I wanted — I did so in my speech and welcomed your commitment on this point — to bring about a more ambitious and faster reform of seconded work because I think it is very concrete. It speaks to our fellow citizens, and you know, it speaks much more to them than all the stories of voter lists or size. What speaks to our fellow citizens are not our political subjects but the topics we debate and the answers we bring to their daily lives. For our fellow citizens, it is not the setting or setting of our action that prevails, it is the bottom. Therefore, the Europe that protects is how to deal with the issue of social dumping in our Europe. I am going to be very direct with you: when we defend a reform of the seconded labour directive, for a Europe that protects, we are precisely in line with the European interest and we do not go into any kind of drift or betrayal of European history, dear Member, which now consists of advancing Europe through tax dumping and social. I believe that, if we believe in the European project, we must take note of the fact that we have ambitious agricultural or cohesion policies — and I defend them. Look at the philosophical and political fundamentals that led us to decide on these policies. It was to make all countries converge towards a kind of European standard. For years, we had accepted that these policies would be used to finance alternative models in some cases and, therefore, tax and social dumping. Therefore, cohesion funds are used to lower your tax or create tax niches to attract companies against other European states. Or, to maintain social models that are unsustainable, we pay less well for the workers and sometimes decide to pay them even less well for attracting companies within Europe. I fully believe in the need to move towards a stronger European competitiveness and I am pursuing these reform policies in my country. But I think it is impossible to pursue such policies if, at the same time, we do not have a genuine desire for cohesion at European level and, therefore, convergence and if we do not use both our directives, our law and the money we invest in our budget to allow these convergences. Therefore, I believe in a Europe that protects, I believe in a Europe from convergence, particularly in fiscal and social terms, and therefore in strengthening the fight against optimization, fiscal and social policies and non-cooperative policies between our countries. You then asked me about trade policies. On this point, you have stressed all the tensions that exist, and I find myself perfectly in what the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said earlier. I believe in the trade policy we have built multilaterally. It has set rules for itself, it is the WTO that defends them. I am not in order to retreat nationally, because this trade policy creates rules of the game and these are opportunities for growth. Now I'm not in support of a naive trade policy. That is why I have defended the strategic sectors that are precisely to be defended, and I think we cannot buy everything or invest in all sectors innocently in our countries. In fact, I invite you to look at how other countries organize themselves, including when they join the WTO. They have always defended their own strategic interests, and we have sometimes suffered too much naivety on this point. Finally, I am in favour of ensuring that our trade policy is fully consistent with our other objectives. Free Trade Treaty with Canada had been negotiated — moreover, if the jurisdiction as it is normally defined is followed to the end, it is a Community jurisdiction, which could therefore have been exercised to the end. It was decided to refer the file back to national parliaments. A great deal of work has been done at the level of the French Parliament to follow this text, improve it and ensure that before it is ratified and throughout its implementation, it will comply with our requirements, especially in terms of climate. The Canadian Prime Minister will address the French Parliament this afternoon, where he will have the opportunity to recall his commitment to these principles. But, for my part, I hope that with regard to the upcoming trade policy that is ours, we will have a minimum of coherence, that is, that our environmental, social and health commitments will always be reflected in our trade negotiations. We cannot negotiate new treaties where one agrees to open trade lines with geographical areas or countries which, in a claimed way, either do not want the Paris Agreement or decide that their social model is based on claimed dumping or on a particular optimization mechanism, because at that time it is explained that we will trade, but at the expense of those who have rules in our space. Our trade policy must therefore be consistent with our environmental, social and health commitments. You have repeatedly come back to the issue of Syria. Let me begin by telling you that today, no European taxpayer finances the targeted interventions made by France, it is the French taxpayer. So, on this subject, let there be no misunderstanding between us. Secondly, I want to say again, because democracy has rules, that it can not only be rules that we Arrange. The President of the French Republic is the head of the armies, it is the French Constitution, voted by the French people, that decided so and which makes the President of the Republic responsible and can take certain decisions. The Constitution provides that the president is then obliged to inform the national representation, which has been done, and we have even decided that there should be a debate. Each country, by its Constitution, has its rules, but you cannot give me lessons in democracy by explaining that you do not like French rules. They were decided by the sovereign French people and voted by them when they had to decide on their Constitution. This is so and will continue to be so with regard to the competence of the French President. If it is a European intervention, a European policy, it is European rules that prevail, but loving democracy and sovereignty, that does not mean wanting to mix all the rules or anything that binds us. Finally, I would like to recall — and I will not be longer on Syria, since I have already detailed our position at length earlier — the heart of France's action, for months now, it has been diplomatic and humanitarian action and the preparation of the follow-up, which has enabled us, on several occasions, in the Security Council to take a resolution for the ceasefire and humanitarian access that was not respected, but Russia had agreed to sign, because we had activated ourselves. It was resolution 2901 a few weeks ago. We resumed this diplomatic initiative the next day, and we are on the ground on the humanitarian front with our NGOs and the support announced yesterday. On the other hand, we have consistently promoted a policy of preparation for the next — as I said in the UN General Assembly — and we have taken the initiative of what has been called the small group, together with several countries in the region, also to prepare for tomorrow's Syria, with the participation, in particular, of countries where millions of Syrian refugees today live. I am thinking of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. So that is what I think is the essence of what is happening today in Syria and which I wanted to recall. Secondly, I would like to say two words about energy policy. First, I fully understand your concerns about Nord Stream 2, and I must tell you that Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed them herself a few days ago, recognizing that this was an extremely delicate matter because it involves our collective sovereignty, our energy sovereignty over the Russia. In my view, the energy policy we must have fits in these lines and that will allow me to respond to your Franco-German energy proposal. We must have an energy policy that is consistent with our commitments to reduce CO2 emissions and ensures Europe's energy sovereignty, because if we give it anything, it will not be possible. The French strategy was to keep these two lines. Some people don't like nuclear power, I can hear it. Nuclear, however, does not emit CO2 and it emits much less than coal. However, it is not good to rely too much on nuclear power and, in this regard, my predecessor had committed France to a transition strategy that is quite desirable and which has been strengthened. But France will have a very clear line on this point. Our desire is to develop much more and continue to do so, renewable energies to improve the mix, to do so in conjunction with all the European countries to improve the interconnections that make it possible to use these energies better. But our wish is not to yield anything to our energy sovereignty, nor to the sovereignty of the countries around it. You can shake all fears. What I am simply saying is that we have the Safety Authority, which is the most demanding and, look at what has happened, I have not seen in recent years, even during the incidents that may have occurred far from home, victims to deplore as for other energies. So I simply note that there is a security requirement and we have, and that there is also a requirement to reduce the dependency on energy production that must continue. The share of nuclear power must be reduced, but it must be done at a rate that will allow for the maintenance of that sovereignty. If the shutdown of plants leads to the reopening of coal-fired power plants, which has been the case in Germany unfortunately, you are degrading your CO2 balance, which is exactly contrary to the Paris Agreements, and if the acceleration of this pace, without preserving your energy sovereignty, leads to increasing your dependence on a particular Non-European sovereign power, especially Russia, to import energy, this is not a good decision. I therefore fully assume that we have an energy strategy that has a top priority: reducing emissions. That is why I decided to shut down all coal-fired and thermal power plants in this five-year period. The law has been passed, it is not a petition in principle, they will all be closed, so there will be no more. In terms of mobility, there is a need to move much further, with rising fuel prices and diesel-petrol convergence, which is also essential, and with a renewable energy investment policy which is absolutely essential to go much further and which will reduce the cost of fuel costs. over time, at the pace that has been recalled by the Minister of State, Nicolas Hulot, a few months ago, the share of nuclear power. It is this strategy that we have decided to retain because it allows us to keep these two lines: lower emissions and energy sovereignty. I therefore hope that together with Germany we would keep these two lines, and I will not give in to policies that would lead us to increase, even in the short term, CO2 emissions, or to those that would collectively lead us to dependence on other powers so that we can now operate our economies. Secondly, in terms of union and economic and monetary integration, I must tell you, there is already a multi-speed Europe. We must not be mistaken: there is Europe of the euro, there is the Europe of Schengen, so there are already several speeds in our Europe. For me, our moral duty is not to declare these clubs as closed and not to declare that we decide ab initio with whom we are going to work or not, but to take note that in order to move forward in Europe, it is necessary that the most ambitious and voluntary be able to move forward, and that is how Europe has Always advanced. If Europe had always waited for the entire club, but — sorry to tell you — you wouldn't be there. Europe was born from the ambition of some who have sometimes taken crazy risks and pursued these crazy dreams, which must therefore be pursued. In this context, I hope that we will have more ambition for Economic and Monetary Union. First, in the short term — I will be very clear — we must complete the commitments made on banking union and go to the end of what was decided several years ago in this legislature. Clearly, at country level, we must carry out reforms that bring us in line with, in particular, the European Semester and our commitments, because that is the responsibility of States. This is what I decided for France and presented to the French people during my election. We must also move towards greater solidarity within this Union because today, what is dysfunctional, in particular, in the euro area is that we have put ourselves with instruments of responsibility, but we have not taken decisions on solidarity and there is no monetary space in the world that works with the the constraints of a common currency, with reforms that are totally legitimate at the domestic level and without fiscal capacity that allows investment, convergence and stabilization in the event of a crisis. (Applause) So it is this project that I am defending, the one I want to work on with Chancellor Angela Merkel and with all the partners in the euro area as well as outside, because it is a discussion with the ultimate objective that all countries that wish to be able to join it. It is therefore essential that there be regular discussions not only within the euro area but also in a broader manner. I therefore agree with you on this point: we must move towards a political form that cannot be merely intergovernmental. So there is a part of intergovernmental, there are intergovernmental instruments that exist and this will involve the decision of States and governments, but there must also be community-type structures that can be established at this level. That is why I welcomed the proposals. I think we must try to go further than what the President of the Commission did, because there was this reflection that there would be a Eurozone line. I think we simply need to have, here too, a democratic principle and democratic governance at the euro area level. We undoubtedly needs to have, at the euro area level, a representation of the parliamentarians gathered here, on certain subjects, at least a more consolidated circle because there will be extremely important questions which will involve democratic control before a Parliament which will have to know about them, because it will require a form of executive which will be competent and who will have a mandate. Since this cannot simply remain at the intergovernmental level, we must find a path to move, in any case, towards a much more integrated institutional and democratic form at the level of the euro area or of all those in the euro area who want to integrate such a project. I believe that if we do not, in the coming years, and if we do not decide in the coming months this organisational and institutional breakthrough, which allows for greater stability and greater capacity to invest, we will not be able to move forward in Europe. You asked me about a lot of other subjects, but I think I have far exceeded the time. I still wanted to seize the opportunity you gave me to talk about gender equality. It is a subject that I have constantly defended, which we defended during the campaign and for which I made the great cause of the quinquennium. We are defending this right now by a law which is being examined in France. So, on this subject, rest assured, my commitment is full. With regard to the proposals that are being made and the draft directive, I fully agree with the principle, but paid parental leave at the level of the daily sickness benefit is a nice idea which can be very expensive and end up being unsustainable. In France, we are going to reform leave, especially parental leave, for the spouse who today cannot benefit or benefits much less from it. I think we have to have an egalitarian ambition and go much further, but we do not can't make it pay through systems, sometimes unbalanced. We have to work on the proposal, I agree with the principles, but the modalities described in this way, as analyzed on the French system, have a potentially explosive cost. France will itself make a proposal in this direction; in any case, I believe in this equality, and the reform of parental leave that we will carry will go in this direction. Finally, with regard to the strategic defence of our Europe and defence policy, I said: France believes in this defence policy. President Verhofstadt just now paid tribute to the French National Assembly, which a few decades ago put a stop to well-known projects. I think we can be grateful, collectively, for having made a great deal of progress in recent months because a compromise has been reached, because the Commission has pushed out an ambitious project and because you yourself are pursuing this by working on the European Defence Fund. I hope that we will achieve this ambition as much as possible. But it is also about our sovereignty and, in the meantime, I want to make it very clear that France will stand at every moment alongside any Member State when its sovereignty is attacked. That is the position we took firmly from day one alongside Britain when the Skripal affair broke out. It is also the position that we are constantly standing alongside Greece when it is threatened in the Eastern Mediterranean. A few days ago, I discussed this with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. We will constantly have this position from where we are because the heart of our common sovereignty is to have this solidarity between us. So, ladies and gentlemen, I have probably not answered all the questions, but I tried to be as exhaustive as possible, and I was very happy to do it here in Strasbourg. In Strasbourg, a European university will also be opened, Mr Hon. Member, as in many other places because it is a nice idea. I believe that this Europe of Strasbourg, we are proud of it. In any case, for my part, I am proud of this and thank you for honouring this beautiful European city with your presence.

Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to join you today to discuss again the UN global compacts. In our globalised world, human mobility can only be addressed effectively by the international community as a whole. It is – and we all recognise it – a global phenomenon that requires global solutions. No country can manage this alone, but together we can set up a humane, dignified and secure mechanism for governing human mobility. Over the past years, the European Union has built a comprehensive approach to addressing migration and forced displacement. In the face of the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, we are the world’s first responder, granting asylum to persons in need of protection and offering safe and legal pathways through resettlement. In the year 2016, Member States granted asylum to over 720 000 persons, and in the year 2017, 382 000. In the context of our partnership with Africa and with the help of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), we are funding five transit countries where migrants receive assistance, medical care and psychological support. In Libya, over 33 000 people have benefited from our support in detention centres at disembarkation points or in their host communities. Through the new Joint Task Force that the European Union has set up with the African Union and the United Nations, an additional 15 000 migrants stranded in Libya have been assisted in the voluntary returning to their homes, where they receive re-integration support. 1300 persons in need of international protection have been evacuated from Libya in view of future resettlement. The Commission has also launched a new resettlement scheme with at least 50 000 additional places for refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Turkey by the end of 2019, and set aside 500 million to support Member States’ resettlement efforts. All this was possible thanks to our common work inside the European Union, and to strong cooperation with our partners in our region and worldwide. Our approach is based on solidarity, shared responsibility, multilateralism and engagement, and we would like these four principles to be reflected in the global compacts on refugees and migrants. The crucial point for the global compact on migrants is to strike a balance in addressing regular and irregular migration. A person should never risk their life when seeking a better future abroad. Dangerous and irregular travellers must be differentiated, whilst also opening regular channels for human mobility. As you are aware, we are working very closely with our Member States to develop targeted pilot projects on legal migration with certain third countries, the priority currently being African countries. At the same time, the global compact should promote effective return policies. In this respect, we have managed to engage with a few countries of origin in Asia and Africa. As for the compact on refugees, it is an opportunity to modernise refugee responses by going beyond traditional humanitarian intervention and focusing on development. This is in line with the European Union’s approach to forced displacement, and it also meets the expectations of host countries and eases the pressure on them. I believe that the global compacts present a unique opportunity to share the lessons we have learned and the partnerships we have built, as well as to listen to the needs and priorities of others. Comme l’a rappelé le Président de la République française, Emmanuel Macron, ce matin, nous avons besoin de plus de solidarité interne et externe pour affronter les défis migratoires. Le pacte mondial pour des migrations sûres, ordonnées et régulières doit permettre de renforcer la solidarité entre l’Union européenne et les pays tiers pour une gestion responsable des flux migratoires. Ce pacte permettra de parvenir à une compréhension commune des défis migratoires auxquels est confronté chaque pays dans le monde et fournira une boîte à outils commune pour y répondre. The two global compacts together present international cooperation frameworks that will guide our work over the next decades. They will serve as a toolbox to address the various situations which may arise in the future. They will serve as a platform to build new partnerships and to forge new alliances. So it is clearly in the European interest to negotiate two strong and ambitious compacts, and to do it together as a Union. The future compacts are first and foremost about people, and they must be shaped not only by our interests but by our values. They must be shaped by a vision grounded on human rights, responsibility and mutual solidarity. A vision where the most vulnerable ones, are protected. A vision in which there is no place for traffickers, smugglers and criminal organisations. A vision where irregular migration is reduced, and instead we have the courage to invest in more regular and safe channels for migrants. We have now reached a defining moment in the process. We are half-way through the negotiations and formal consultations on both compacts. Thanks to the European Union’s leadership and strong engagement, the current revised drafts of both compacts largely reflect EU legislation and policies. We see a good chance to develop a common understanding on how to humanely and efficiently manage human mobility. The next months are crunch time to find the middle ground between the diverging views, different national migration realities and priorities. We will continue our engagement toward reaching an agreement on the Global Compact on Migration, to be politically endorsed at the intergovernmental conference in Morocco in December as well as on the Global Compact on Refugees to be adopted under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly later this year. With the withdrawal of the United States from the Global Compact on Migration back in December 2017, the compacts need more than ever a strong and united Europe that speaks with one voice during these negotiations. In that light, I regret that one of our Member States has taken the position on the Global Compact on Migration that is not in line with the position of the 27 other Member States. Here, our common work and your contribution as the European Parliament will be essential. This is a test of humanity. But let me add that we should also be very pragmatic in how we approach this discussion. Two good global compacts will help us manage human mobility in a much more orderly and effective way. Let’s not turn this into an ideological debate. Let us shape these two compacts together as a Union and for all Europeans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Anna Maria Corazza Bildt", "mepid": "96674", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I welcome the UN Global Compact on migration and refugees. Global challenges need global solutions and the EU as a global actor must do more to address the root causes of migration, from conflict to poverty and climate change. It is time to have a global governance of flows, sharing responsibility for orderly and safe migration. The EU must take the lead to move from illegal to legal migration, combat smuggling of migrants, implementing resettlement and voluntary returns, and supporting countries of origin. It is also time to put humanity back at the centre of our debates on migration and change the narrative. For many people, migration means slavery. I am just back from Niger and Agadez, the trafficking hub to Europe via the Mediterranean. We met women, children and young men coming back from Libya. Their stories are heart—breaking. Trafficking in human beings goes hand-in-hand with trafficking of drugs and weapons. People die in the desert in their thousands of hunger and heat, abandoned by traffickers. Libya is hell on earth. Migrants suffer ransom, forced labour, sexual abuse, torture. We have a responsibility to help people trapped in detention camps get out of there back via Niger. The EU operation in Niger is effective, but more resources are urgently needed for resettlement with UNHCR and repatriation of returnees from Libya by OIM to home countries in Africa, and for reintegration projects in their local communities. Key are the projects for reconversion of traffickers into legal work, like handwork and building work. It is happening. Let’s do more: fewer traffickers in Agadez, Niger, means fewer irregular migrants to Europe, but also fewer deaths in the Mediterranean, in the desert and less labouring in Libya and I finish by saying that the Global Compact should also focus on children and promote gender equality in the world, with zero tolerance for violence against women and children.

Let's be honest. Paper here is very patient again. The Pact recognises that migration is a phenomenon of all times and states that every effort must be made to enable legal migration. But there is still no idea of a proposal from the European Commission for a law to give migrants in Europe access, including lower paid and lower skilled jobs. We have to wait well after the European elections for such a proposal. While we know that in southern Europe the harvest is being taken off by immigrants with no papers and exploitation is the order of the day, the global pact and also our parliamentary resolution rejects the imprisonment of children. That makes sense, because children are not supposed to be in prison, but - even here in this Parliament we are afraid to say it out loud - European countries are locking children away. Refugee children who are waiting for asylum or are evicted are systematically imprisoned. Or helping migrants, giving someone something to eat, offering someone a ride, saving someone from the sea, they're all normal, human, humane actions. You can't make that punishable, that's what our resolution says. But there are European Member States that have sued and prosecuted their own citizens who gave refugees a lift. There's a Spanish rescue ship in Italy in chains because it saved people from the sea from drowning.

It is certainly an international policy issue and it is time for Europeans and our governments to have a less historically centered and ethnocentric view of these issues. It is a fact that international migration is increasing and, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations says so well, the majority of them are regular. But the West is no longer the center of it. Migration has become globalized, regionalized. South-South migration now exceeds South-South migration. Of the 258 million international migrants, 60 million come from Europe, which is, proportionally to its population, the continent whose inhabitants migrate the most and most mobile. This is normal because Europeans are very largely those who enjoy a real right to mobility, unlike the rest of the planet. And only half of their migration is intra-European. Therefore, who better than Europeans can show that migration is an opportunity and a wealth? We are the first to benefit from the right to migrate. Let us therefore realize that those who are in an irregular situation on our continent, those who risk their lives in the Mediterranean Sea, are first of all those who are deprived of this right to mobility, do not have a regular migration route and flee inhumane situations whose causes are difficult to unravel.

If we have learned anything over this time, it is that human mobility cannot be stopped or forcefully prevented, but it has to be managed globally. Therefore, the UN global compact is crucial. No country can face these phenomena alone. The EU has to speak with one voice and has to take a leading role, especially after the US has decided to leave the negotiations. Managing migration requires major investment in comprehensive global development policy, especially in human rights, social inclusion, education, justice, health and employment, with a special focus on vulnerable groups and children.

The dangerous spread of misinformation and fake news poses a threat to our policies and provides fertile ground for xenophobia and racism.

Indeed, these are the countries that are most affected. We also need to lift the greater perspective. That means migration cannot be seen as a problem, let alone discussed in terms of security threats or other completely irresponsible that we often hear here. Migration has always existed. It's something fundamentally positive and it's something we should cherish. We also need to make sure to create policies that preserve and reinforce people's right to mobility globally. What is a problem is the exploitation of migrants. In the job market, sexually and in other ways. Furthermore, I must also say something about the economic and foreign policy of the European Union, as well as the trade of arms from certain Member States, which are actually responsible for creating many of the situations we see and driving people fleeing and migrating. It is naive and perhaps also irresponsible — or, perhaps some would say, hypocritical — to think that you should continue with that policy while saying want to reduce migration. No, we need debt cancellation, we need development, we need economic partnerships that are equal and we need to stop the militarization of Africa and the Middle East in particular.

Dialogue between recipient, origin and transit countries is essential. Europeans must play a leading role in the United Nations in drafting the global pacts as we enter the so-called intergovernmental phase of negotiation: we can provide our experiences and our vision of this problem. For me, there is a need for an analysis and also a realistic debate on migration, which takes into account its positive potential, but we cannot ignore the security concerns of transit or origin States, nor the limits of their capacity for economic and social integration. Europeans have known migratory phenomena and their tragic problems in recent years. We have experienced the so-called refugee crisis, which affected the eastern Mediterranean and also the central Mediterranean. Still today, the Mediterranean continues to be the scene of daily news about irregular migration attempts or flows.

We are well aware of our responsibilities in this respect, I would say on two different levels, both of them extremely important. One is the investment in the UN system and in multilateral approaches, as such. We know very well that this is challenged from different sides in the world of today. And we know very well that the world looks at the European Union to create, consolidate and strengthen alliances globally to work in a multilateral manner. This could be true for issues related to different things, from trade to human rights and crisis management, but also on migration and refugees. So we know that the UN system counts on us. We know that the partners around the world count on us to make sure that the multilateral approach and the multilateral method are the ones followed when tackling a global issue. I would never – never – say ‘problem’, because we’re not talking about a problem, if not for those fleeing countries at war or facing forced movements. As for the specifics of our responsibilities, we know that we have a responsibility to uphold a certain approach to the migration issues and also on refugees. On refuges, this is clearly full respect of values and, in particular, full respect of international principles and regulations. And it is also a matter of the basic moral compass that for us as the European Union is a must, and this entails full respect of human rights and the consideration that every single person that is a refugee or migrant is first and foremost a human being and, as such, has individual human rights that are impossible to be considered as subject to discussions or negotiations. We also know that we have a responsibility to build consensus globally on a certain way of managing migration. I say ‘managing migration’. I don’t say ‘stopping a problem’. I say managing migration, which is the partnership approach. The European Union has not always been on this line. The European Union has, in the past, several times either turned its eyes away from this issue, leaving the front-line Member States alone. Or some other times – I still sometimes see this temptation here and there – it has taken the security approach, as if it were a border management issue. Migration movements are massive global phenomena that need to be managed together with partnerships that involve countries of origin, countries of transit, and countries of destination. Some of these countries are at the same time the three and the international agencies of the United Nations system. I will give you an example of how this partnership approach is bringing results, because this is the basis on which we are going to work. And we are already working in the UN system to try to build a global alliance around this model. Take the dramatic situation in the detention camps in Libya. We have discussed this in this chamber several times. And several times I have told you we are working to close these camps. Last December we established a joint task force between the European Union, the African Union, United Nations with UNHCR and the IOM, and we set the target of emptying the detention camps and, as an intermediate target, to save 15 000 of the people that were in the detention camps in Libya in the coming two months. We have managed to save more than 16 000 of them in less than two months and have assisted them in returning voluntarily to their own local communities and supported them with reintegration projects and economic start-up activities. And we are about to completely empty the detention centres in Libya. The news was shocking and striking when we saw the images and the stories from the detention camps. I would also like us to tell the stories of those whom we managed to save as we empty the detention camps. Because this helps us pass on the message inside Europe and outside of Europe, that this is not the policy we’ve chosen purely out of values and good feelings. This is also the policy that is bringing results. It’s cooperation and partnership, and not walls, that is bringing results in migration policies, and we are starting to see good results. We will continue to take this approach, hoping for a united position between the Member States of the European Union But let me tell you we will exercise our responsibilities and duties in the UN context on migration and refugees. We will, I imagine, continue to discuss this issue in this chamber in the coming months as we go towards the summit and then the finalisation of this work towards the end of the year. I count on this Parliament to follow this work very closely on a day-to-day basis to help us to build this way of working, both internally within the European Union and outside it. I will not refer here to the issues related to Dublin or to other decisions related to solidarity internally that still, I believe, should be tackled.

We have said very clearly time and again that, even when the war in Syria disappears from the headlines, we always have to remember that the war in Syria is not over yet and, in particular, that the use of chemical weapons is a pattern which we have seen developing from the regime side over the years. The entire international community, we believe, considers the regime’s use of chemical weapons entirely unacceptable, but for Europeans, it most certainly is. Our response as the European Union was very clear, united, and immediate. The use of chemical weapons is unacceptable to us, and those responsible must be held accountable. Accountability is also a key element when it comes to building a new future for Syria, as I think President Macron very rightly mentioned here this morning in the Chamber. We, as the European Union, have always worked in all the different contexts that we could, and we continue to do so, in order to re-establish an independent mechanism for investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Today we are working to enable the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to investigate and report on the most recent attack.  You have all followed the targeted strikes carried out by France, the United States and the United Kingdom on chemical facilities in Syria with one objective: to prevent the regime from using chemical weapons again. You will also have seen the reactions, including the declaration I issued a few hours later on behalf of the 28 Member States, and the Council conclusions which we adopted yesterday and cover not only the issue of the use of chemical weapons, but also, more generally, our common position on the conflict in Syria.  The main point here is this: now more than ever, it is clear that the only sustainable, the only pragmatic, the only possible solution, to the war in Syria is a political solution. After seven years, there is certainly no doubt: there is no military solution to the war. The only way to end this conflict is through the intra-Syrian talks in Geneva, between the Syrian parties, under the leadership of the United Nations. Now more than ever, it is time to invest all our work, all our convening power, all our political capital, to push the Syrian parties towards the negotiating table and finally start meaningful negotiations; not just talks for the sake of talks, but meaningful negotiations.  This was the message that I delivered just the day before yesterday in Saudi Arabia, where I had the honour to open the Annual Summit of the Arab League and where I also had the opportunity to meet the UN Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, with whom I spoke at length about the current situation and how to relaunch the political process. I also had the chance there to discuss and share with all the leaders of the region not only our analysis, but also the need for a renewed regional effort in order to try to put an end to the war in Syria through a political process.  Next week, exactly one week from now, all the relevant international and regional players will gather for the second Brussels Conference on the future of Syria and the region, which I will have the honour and the responsibility to chair, together with the United Nations. This Brussels Conference was planned long ago. We had a ministerial preparatory meeting as far back as September at the margins of the UN General Assembly. It will be even more relevant today in the current circumstances because it is the first huge international event that gathers different players that are, let’s say, on different sides in this war, and the EU-UN co-chairmanship is obviously an excellent opportunity to try to build a path towards a political solution. We will make full use of the conference to do just that: to shift the focus now to diplomacy and peace-making. With no meaningful UN-led political talks, it is only a matter of time before the next military escalation comes. The risk of splitting the country into zones of influence is increasing by the day. The Geneva talks represent the only path that can lead towards a peaceful, united, independent and truly democratic Syria, in all its diversity. At the Brussels Conference we will have over 80 delegations around the table, as I said, with very different positions among themselves. I see this as an opportunity to collectively and consistently commit to stopping the violence and supporting the Geneva process. We want to bring together – it will not be easy, but nor will it be impossible – those who have leverage not just on the Syrian parties, as we always mention – in part because on the Syrian opposition we have the leverage ourselves and we have been working with them and we continue to work with them day by day –, but mainly those who have leverage on the Syrian regime, which so far has not committed seriously to the political talks in Geneva. It has not entered into the mechanism and the dynamic of negotiation. Those who have leverage will work together towards new and meaningful intra-Syrian talks under the auspices of the UN.  I am also proud of one thing that I believe this Parliament will understand very well. We will host at the conference hundreds of delegates from Syrian civil society groups – Syrians – women and men, most of them coming from inside Syria. I know that some may think that this is a marginal issue, that it is even something nice to say, something naive, that as war is going on it is a sort of distraction, but these are the real people on the ground who are experiencing the suffering of the war. They are also what I would call the everyday Syrian heroes. They are incredibly precious for the country and its future because Syria will not be taken out of the conflict or be reconstructed in the sense of building the country a democratic future if the international community, starting with the European Union, does not invest in those Syrians that want to build a democratic, peaceful and united country. The future of Syria lies – and this is a minor detail that the international community tends to forget –and has to lie only in the hands of the Syrian people and no one else. It is not a chessboard. It is a country with people and citizens, and we want to bring the voices, the faces, the hopes, the dreams, but also the ideas and the aspirations of the Syrian people to the stage. That is democracy. That is the way we intend it.  We believe it will have to be up to them to decide on the new institutions of the country, to make them inclusive, democratic, and, at the end of the day, make sure that every Syrian man, woman and child, beyond ethnicity, faith and political or social background, everyone will have the right to feel protected, safe, welcome, and at home in the Syria of the future.  Many people ask about preconditions – who has to step back or forwards, one step in or out. The real answer, which is borne of pragmatism, from our side, is this: we need a political process that guarantees that every single Syrian inside the country, including those that are currently outside of the country, can feel at home in the Syria of the future. That is it. That is what the political process in Geneva should guarantee. What we can do as Europe, as the international community, is to invest all our resources, to move from a context of never-ending escalation on the ground, which is repeating itself cyclically, to one of true political negotiations. It is not easy, otherwise it would probably have been successful long ago, it is not easy, but we will work on this in Brussels next week, on renewing our humanitarian pledges, which are essential and vital, on the resilience of the Syrian people, and on the only way to make our humanitarian work sustainable, which is to unlock the Geneva talks.

The real debate, apart from the horrible humanitarian crisis, is whether we are dealing with a new episode — as the Secretary-General of the United Nations said — of the Cold War. The withdrawal of the United States, what has happened in the electoral processes in France, Germany, the referendum in the United Kingdom, the support for separatist movements in Spain make it clear that we are facing a new scenario and a new configuration of threats: cyberterrorism, nuclear proliferation, increased race weapons, mass intoxication on social media. Mr President, Syria is the greatest failure of the international community, and that questions ourselves and our role in the world.

I was appalled by the cynical positioning of some, including in this House, on Monday evening who, since the last chemical attacks, were denying the obvious lightening up of the seriousness of the attacks and others before.  Do we really have to choose between fighting terrorism and promoting civilian and human rights? I don’t think so. I will make clear once again that Assad is engaging in what the UN has termed the ‘crime of extermination’. The vast majority of the Syrian victims were killed by the Syrian—Russian—Iranian alliance in deliberate, indiscriminate attacks. They have targeted hospitals and rescue workers, and they are impeding humanitarian aid to those in need. Several chemical attacks have been committed in this country. There is no doubt about that, and there is no doubt that these are unacceptable acts under international law in the Geneva Conventions. The targeted US, French and UK air strikes were a necessary response in order to prevent the future use of chemical weapons. Russia has vetoed 11 times – I repeat, 11 times – the UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, and undermines the ones adopted. I am firmly convinced that the only solution for ending the war in Syria is a negotiated political solution, where Europe should work in coordination with the UN in general and the UN Security Council. What remains to be done today? I will continue our calls for a ceasefire to implement the resolutions on the territory. It is necessary to reinvigorate the UN political process, and formally we have to support the work of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and its findings on Syria.

There are some in this House that question the evidence and many more that doubt their attribution to the brutal Assad regime. There will be no cast-iron guaranteed independent sources, Assad will make sure of that. But the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the UN have each verified the use of chemical weapons banned since 1925. And the British, French, US and other Western governments, NATO and the European Union have all concluded that the Assad regime is culpable. The continued use of chemical weapons is wholly unacceptable, and allowing this to continue with impunity cannot be tolerated. Russia has repeatedly used its veto at the UN Security Council to stop chemical-weapons-related resolutions on six occasions since 2017 alone. Such use of the UNSC veto to protect tyrants and violations of international humanitarian law, or the use of prohibited types of weapons can provide, in my view, under the evolving ‘right to protect’ doctrine, legal justification for the use of military force to deter or prevent further humanitarian crises. Given the potential for unintended consequences and escalation, military intervention is a decision not to be taken lightly. The targeted and very limited air strikes carried out are specifically and solely aimed at impeding President Assad’s regime’s chemical weapon capabilities and must surely be seen for what they are, which is the West’s determination to deter future use of chemical weapons by tyrants everywhere across the globe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 202, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Marietje Schaake", "mepid": "96945", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, thank you. High Commissioner, colleagues, – or High Representative, excuse me – every time we discuss Syria we have to mourn more deaths, more who have forcibly disappeared or been raped or tortured, and recently – despite the alleged destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons, despite international law – hundreds, including children, choked to death because of the use of chemical weapons. Those children cannot possibly be terrorists, as President Assad claims with every citizen that he kills, and this cannot go unanswered. But even now – and we’ve heard it as the EU position over and over again – the mantra is that there is no military solution to the war in Syria.  The question that I want to ask is whether all this is happening because we have no decisive role in creating peace and contributing to peace in Syria. Clearly – and I really hate to say this – military brutality by the cynical coalition of Assad, Putin and Tehran-steered militants is creating facts on the ground, and the facts amount to war crimes. I’m convinced of that. So when we as the EU repeat that there is no military solution, what we must avoid is a situation in which this becomes the carte blanche for the status quo and for facts creeping ever further on the ground. We desperately need an EU strategy to end the war in Syria  if we want to be serious about ending the war. Seven years of bloodshed, several vetoes by our Member States, disruption in Syria and the Middle East – and an impact here in Europe, with people seeking shelter and asylum, which is also – unfortunately – feeding politics of fear seeking to exploit the situation. This impacts us globally and certainly in Europe. So I think that next week’s Syria conference is another opportunity for the EU to develop a strategy and I consider it welcome that accountability and justice are to be the key priority. That is an essential ingredient for peace, and so hopefully the EU as a whole can build on the Dutch, German and Swedish initiative to centralise accountability.

Next week's Brussels donor conference on Syria should focus on the following areas: protection of civilians, humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees, prospects for peaceful Syria. During the military offensive in East Ghouta, which began in February, the Syrian army and its allies committed massive war crimes through heavy bombing of the besieged civilians with thousands of deaths and injuries. Ten days ago, the Syrian Army is said to have used chemical weapons against civilians in the city of Duma. It is important that these allegations are now being investigated by inspectors of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the ground. The use of weapons of mass destruction must remain an absolute taboo. A longer-term presence of international inspectors in Syria is needed to guarantee the complete destruction of the chemical arsenal there. I strongly reject the military strikes by the United States, France and the UK last weekend. Without an international mandate and in combination with President Trump's war rhetoric, this military action posed a significant risk of wildfire. And it is important that the international community is committed to ensuring that all those responsible for war crimes committed in Syria are held accountable. I therefore welcome the fact that the EU Foreign Ministers have once again made very clear this this week. Finally, the Syria Conference must make it clear that only political negotiations can provide a perspective for peaceful Syria. There must be an immediate ceasefire for conflict resolution. For this it will be necessary to bring all parties back to the negotiating table. Coordinated European diplomacy must also contribute to this. The donor conference must guarantee humanitarian aid in the region in the long term.

I believe it was a good decision to focus your speech primarily on what needs to be done and how the EU intends to act in order to ultimately help to end the untenable, inhuman conditions and involvement of global nuclear powers in this conflict and to lead to a stable long-term solution. come. The main problem, however, is that some of the Heads of Government, who are responsible — including within the EU — are now pretending that what happened last weekend is more or less a symbolic act, a kind of sandbox game. But I don't think we're sitting in a sandbox, and everyone — at least that was my impression — was happy at the end of the day that there was no further escalation. How can it be, however, that we are talking, on the one hand, about the fact that we want diplomatic, political solutions to talk about the untenable conditions within the UN Security Council through the veto policy of some states — particularly Russia — and, on the other hand, tremble that Russia will hopefully not take adequate measures to take on what the US, France and the UK reacted? It has been a fatal mistake that Russia broke off the joint UN investigation mechanism last year after it proved that chemical weapons were used by the Assad regime a year ago. And it is all to be done to give us joint mechanisms of investigation again so that it finally comes to the day, and those responsible for this must be punished. That's indisputable here in the house. What is controversial, however, is to what extent one's own launch, without having prior evidence, really serves to open the political and diplomatic doors and bring all those involved to the table. This is just not the case! What happened has been counterproductive, and you have to say that clearly! Our job is to really get everyone involved involved in preventing some wild believers that sandbox games can satisfy their own ego, but ultimately endanger the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. And one thing I have to say about this: if the aim was to destroy production deposits of chemical warfare agents, then this is just as dangerous as, for example, to say: you want to punish the breach of international law by responding to the breach of international law. The destruction of ordnance production facilities ensures the release of warfare agents. This endangers people, which threatens the future and people's lives and health. And I would like to know if there is information on the extent to which warfare agents have lephemerged and to what extent there have been changes there.

I and my party, the UK Independence Party, have no sympathy whatsoever for President Assad: he is a tyrant who is quite capable of killing his own people, I have no doubt. But ISIS is much worse.  There is no proof that Assad’s regime was actually responsible for the chemical attack, and let me quote, if I may, a higher authority on this – the former First Sea Lord, Admiral West: ‘I think we need unequivocal proof that this chemical attack was done by Assad’s forces. [...] as a military man, if I’d been advising Assad, I’d have said ‘you’re about to take over that bit of territory, you’ve clearly got the whole of that area now under your control. Why on earth would you do something that would bring the international forces in?” If I’d been advising the opposition, I’d have said “get a barrel of chlorine gas here, at some stage there will be bombs dropped on you – when that happens blow it up and we can blame them, because what we really want is the allies coming in’.”’ Yesterday, in this Chamber, we had MEPs who would normally condemn President Trump out of hand warmly supporting him because he is dropping bombs on the Assad regime. All they were doing was virtue signalling to the rest of the world that they oppose chemical attacks on civilians. Well, who doesn’t?  But who actually did it? What this Parliament should have been doing yesterday was actually asking questions: ‘What proof is there that Assad did it?’, ‘Who benefits from this attack?’, instead of making statements that they can’t substantiate, and Mr Tajani said that this House was overwhelmingly supportive of the bombings. Well, it wasn’t.

The Foreign Ministers shared a common assessment of the challenges for the European Union’s relations with Russia. We have seen an evolving pattern of challenging Russian behaviour in many different fields. Central to these challenges is, of course, the situation in Ukraine, where Russia’s illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and at the same time the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine continue to this day. Other areas of challenging Russian behaviour obviously include the Russian posture in Syria, which you discussed earlier today, just an hour ago, and also the issue of disinformation and interference, hybrid threats, malicious cyber activities, and military posturing. The space for independent political voices and civil society in Russia is shrinking, and respect for human rights and the rule of law is waning. At the same time, Russia is our neighbour and an international actor that we must deal with and talk to, not least as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.  Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Council reaffirmed that the five guiding principles agreed two years ago continue to be the most balanced, dynamic and effective framework for managing our relations with Russia in the current circumstances.  Firstly, the full implementation of the Minsk agreements remains a key element for any substantial change in EU-Russia relations. We will continue to support the work of the Normandy format. Yesterday the Foreign Affairs Council looked at ways in which the European Union can help more to work for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. This includes action at the political level, as well as concrete humanitarian action on demining and the preparations for reconstruction in Donbass, all within the UN framework when the time comes. Secondly, we will continue to strengthen relations with our eastern partners, especially after the very successful Eastern Partnership Summit that we had in November 2017, and also with our Central Asian partners, in anticipation of our new Central Asia Strategy, which I discussed with you in plenary last month. We will purse a policy of transparency towards Russia on our cooperation with our eastern partners, exploring cooperation in areas of mutual interest. Our Eastern Partnership is not an alliance against anyone; it is not about spheres of influence or confronting partners with binary choices. It is a positive partnership that is delivering on our citizens’ needs and aspirations, both within the European Union and among our eastern partners. Thirdly, the Salisbury attack has made it painfully clear that we need to reinforce our own resilience within the European Union. The EU gave a strong and united response to this attack. In its conclusions on 22 March the European Council condemned the attack in the strongest possible terms and expressed unqualified solidarity with the United Kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to our shared security. Ms Mogherini, the High Representative, recalled the Head of the EU Delegation to Moscow for consultations, following which most Member States took coordinated bilateral measures. A strong signal has been sent. At yesterday’s Foreign Affairs Council we also discussed how the EU and its Member States will take forward the European Council’s decision to strengthen resilience to chemical-, biological-, radiological- and nuclear—related risks, as well as to bolster capabilities to address hybrid threats, including in the areas of cyber-based strategic communication and counter-intelligence. All institutions have a critical role to play in these efforts. Fourthly, as you know, we have a policy of selective engagement with the Russian Federation in areas in which we believe this to be clearly in the European Union’s interest. Yesterday Member States agreed that this is still a very valid principle. We must continue to apply it, primarily in the areas of foreign and security policy: from the nuclear deal with Iran to the Middle East peace process, from Afghanistan to the situation in the Korean Peninsula, or to other global issues such as climate change, the environment, migration, counterterrorism, or cooperation in the Arctic or certain regional issues. All of these are strategically important for Europe and our citizens. Last – but certainly not least – we discussed ways to provide even more effective support for civil society and human rights in Russia, as well as for people-to-people contacts, with a focus on youth, the most important hope for any society. We are looking into a significant increase in EU funding for civil society and human rights in Russia, but will also engage in other ways to send the clear message that the EU is open and supportive to the Russian people. So, once again, the Foreign Affairs Council has confirmed the unity of the European Union in our overall approach towards Russia. It is both a principled and a pragmatic approach that takes into consideration both our interests and our values. As we look ahead, we call upon the European Parliament to continue to support all the strands of EU action towards Russia. Unity among Member States and EU institutions is a very strong signal to Russia. But it is also a strong signal to our citizens that the European Union is there to protect our beliefs and our interests. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to our discussion.

I quote: ‘After the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a cold war on Britain and the British Empire’. History is repeating itself isn’t it? Over these days, and in particular after the Salisbury attack, the term ‘cold war’ is now on our lips and in our minds once again. The cold war was the environment that Putin was raised in. It formed his mindset, it made his KGB career. It was his comfort zone, which he wants to get back into. All his arsenal is set ready – propaganda, spy games, regional and civil conflicts. So we are facing the 21st century cold war, different from the previous one: undeclared, more hybrid and less ideological. Colleagues, to deter Russian aggression, our response must be based on sanctions and unity of our action.

Mr Fleckenstein has unfortunately left now — like the 720 colleagues he has just mentioned here. I do not think we have made any progress with what we have done so far. There are two warehouses in the European Union. Some say: 'All this has been too much and wrong in tone, and we need to be milder again in our dealings with Russia. 'And the others say, 'This is all not consistent enough, and we have to put it on top.' I believe that this can continue for a while and that this very indecisiveness of the European Union is one of our great citizens. problems and rather a guarantee of failure. The European Union has never declared itself an enemy to Russia or the Kremlin. Ever since I noticed the confrontation — quite clearly, at least with the occupation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbass, but also around events such as Syria bombardment, for example Aleppo, or the poison gas attack in Britain — I have seen that it is clear: Russia is sending a signal that it will show the West wants it to be strong and somehow to defend itself against what has developed in the West. How to deal with this, for example, after the reaction of this airstrike to chemical plants in Syria, we now have a new moment to talk about it. I found what President Macron said today in the debate right. I believe that we have to explore again and again all the possibilities of change in the Kremlin. But when it gets as difficult as in Donbass, with a ceasefire in Syria — and recently Russia has done everything it can to make new escalations They supported the Turks in Afrin, they put Iran in position in its new position of power in Syria — if we fail, then the instruments we have given ourselves with sanctions is one that we need to develop.

We were glad to hear that the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea have agreed on a date – 27 April – for the inter-Korean Summit meeting on the southern side of the joint security area, and are actively preparing for it. The planned meeting between US President Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong Un, is another historic opportunity to launch a process which may lead to denuclearisation and lasting peace on the Peninsula. We are looking forward to the outcomes of this summit and we are following the preparations closely. We firmly hope that they will foster trust and become building blocks for a process of negotiations leading to stability and development in both countries. Trust is essential. History has taught us that peace-making can be a long and fragile process. Once trust is broken, it takes a long time and serious efforts to rebuild. Many remain cautious about the prospects for peace on the Peninsula, despite recent encouraging signals. Indeed, North Korea must take concrete action to address international concerns with regard to its nuclear and missile programmes. To begin with, we expect that the DPRK will enter into a negotiation on denuclearisation and refrain from further tests on nuclear weapons or re-launching missiles. A peaceful environment will be crucial to create the necessary conditions towards the negotiated solution. The recent positive developments would have been impossible without the leadership and courage shown by President Moon and his government in reaching out towards the north. The European Union has always supported the leading role of the Republic of Korea in assuring the engagement of the DPRK in a meaningful dialogue, aimed at a complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. The Korean Foreign Minister, Ms Kang, took part in the Foreign Affairs Council on March 19 to discuss the state of play and the way forward. This meeting provided an opportunity to pledge the EU’s continuous support to the work of the Republic of Korea. We reiterated our position in favour of a peaceful resolution on the crisis, and we also confirmed that the strict monitoring of DPRK commitment to de-nuclearisation will be necessary. Our support to furthering the diplomatic process, combined with sustained pressure through sanctions was reaffirmed by the Secretary-General of the European External Action Service at the end of March, on a visit to the Republic of Korea and Japan. Clearly, through our policy of critical engagement, we have been maximising pressure on the DPRK. The EU has transposed all UN Security Council resolutions in a swift and timely manner. Additionally, the European Union has adopted autonomous measures against DPRK. We can safely confirm that the EU sanctions regime vis-à-vis DPRK is currently our most restrictive towards any country. We approached a significant number of countries in Africa, in Asia last autumn, and will do so shortly again to encourage them to fully and strictly implement all UN Security Council resolutions. This time we will also include an offer of concrete support for capacity-building on sanctions enforcements where needed. It is of the utmost importance that the international community remains united and determined in its approach, and calls on the DPRK to completely abandon its nuclear and missile programmes. We would thus maintain the direct and indirect pressure on North Korea until it embarks on a credible path towards complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. Talks for the sake of talks are not an option. This has to be a meaningful process towards peace. At the same time, pressure and sanctions are not an end in themselves. They are always an instrument to encourage a political process. The European Union is strongly convinced that lasting peace and denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula must be achieved through peaceful means. This is why we have welcomed these new high-level initiatives which will give diplomacy a chance. And in parallel to our current strong focus on the critical track, we have always kept communication channels open. We also believe that the multilateral process will be necessary to address the DPRK nuclear issue in its entire complexity and achieve lasting peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. Once agreed, consistent monitoring and verification of the de-nuclearisation by respective international bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency will be needed to ensure that DPRK is be strictly and fully implementing its commitments. The European Union will be ready to support these processes, in close consultations with the key partners. The European Union has a huge expertise on nuclear non-proliferation, particularly thanks to the talks with Iran. We are now willing to support the Korean peace process in any possible way. Once again, we are on the side of non-proliferation and we are on the side of peace.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 314, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (FR) Madam President, we can only welcome positive news from the Korean peninsula with optimism. The two summits, the one between the two Korea and the one between President Trump and the North Korean leader, are steps in the right direction. The summit between the United States and North Korea is highly anticipated and highly commented as it will be unprecedented, but this is not the first attempt to persuade the North Korean regime to abandon its nuclear programme. I think we should focus less on the details of this meeting and focus more on the key points which are: what can we promise the North Korean leader and, above all, what will he ask for in return? Two elements seem meaningful to me. First, North Korea is seeking international recognition of its status as a nuclear power, and we must absolutely avoid granting that recognition. That is why we must categorically deny the lifting, even partial, of sanctions until we have long-term guarantees on the complete, irreversible and verifiable dismantling of nuclear installations. These safeguards are also in line with compliance with the obligations of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Secondly, maintaining pressure on the diet is an absolute necessity. We should not reward Kim Jong-un for his consent to dialogue. The time for confidence will come when there is genuine openness and an improvement in the human rights situation and living conditions of North Koreans who, let us not forget, still suffer greatly from malnutrition, torture and slavery. So let's be optimistic, but let's remain lucid.

Let’s be cautiously optimistic: the Winter Olympics have contributed to the softening of tensions, but there is no doubt that we have to be thankful to the international community for being united in condemning North Korea’s ballistic missiles and nuclear programme and exercising strong pressure, and to President Moon Jae-in of South Korea for showing incredible leadership and commitment to peace.  The EU played an important role here. We imposed sanctions that went even beyond those adopted by the UN Security Council, and High Representative Mogherini used all the diplomatic tools at her disposal to mediate the contacts between the two sides. This is indeed a crucial moment. We have to be optimistic but realistic at the same time. It is an opportunity that should not be missed, but it is not all in our hands and we need to keep our guard up.

President Trump’s decision to accept North Korean leader Kim Jong—un’s invitation to talks without preconditions is an unprecedented act of diplomacy. These talks are a stepping stone to further dialogue and are the beginning of a process, not its end. We are at a point where a 64-year-old armistice will finally be made into a peace treaty. The North Koreans want this and now so do the South Koreans. President Moon must be congratulated by this House. Having returned from Asia, I come to this Chamber with the perception that the North Koreans are at last willing to discuss denuclearisation, starting with a freeze. I also know that nuclear weapons are existential to the North Koreans. They do not consider nuclear weapons simply a deterrent; the weapons also underpin the very identity of the DPRK and reinforce the authority of Kim Jong-un. The fact that they are willing to discuss denuclearisation is a huge advance in the cause of peace, a peace that can disappear like a puff of smoke if we ask for too much too soon.  There is another legitimate view that a step—by—step dismantling of the nuclear programme may simply be a stalling tactic to remove crippling sanctions and that the DPRK regime has no intention of removing the nuclear weapons. The answer to this must surely be open and authenticated verifiability. If the North is truly sincere, it must agree to a verification system that is acceptable to the international community. The EU has a role to play here. Not only will verifiability confirm a freeze, but it will also lead to a step-by-step dismantling of the weapons according to a staged process, whereby North Korea becomes more engaged in global institutions and has access to the family of nations.

It has for decades been very aggressive and threatening towards its neighbours, South Korea and Japan. The size of the North Korean armed forces is ranked fourth in the world, and now the threat of nuclear weapons has been added. North Korean actions have been met with an international response in the form of sanctions, and it is good that China has finally also started to follow the sanctions policy. The meeting planned between the US President, Mr Trump, and the North Korean leader has been met with slight but careful optimism in North Korea’s neighbouring countries. However, it seems unlikely that as a result of just one meeting, both sides will be able to agree on something substantial. It is a fact that North Korea has only caught the attention of President Trump because it now has nuclear capabilities, and it will be very hard for North Korea to give up this privilege so easily. The United States, the European Union and other nations cannot withdraw sanctions before North Korea has significantly changed its behaviour, so we are probably going to continue in this limbo. What that the EU can do is make sure that the sanctions are kept in place and that they are followed by the Member States. We also need to make an effort to ensure China also keeps following the sanctions policy until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons ambitions and stops violating human rights.

Secondly, we recalled that this dialogue should aim at a peaceful resolution and at the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. Thirdly, we emphasised that pressure on North Korea must be maintained until the regime in Pyongyang delivers in a concrete manner. A final remark: regarding the prospects of the ultimate goal of reunification of the two Koreas, the case of my home country, Germany, has taught us that such a process can take a very long time, but it has also shown that all of a sudden things can move very quickly once the process has begun.

At the same time, I think it’s really important that we are not overly naive. It wouldn’t be the first time that countries open up to DPRK following positive signs, but that funding is quickly diverted to further development of nuclear weapons, as has happened to Japan in the past. The difficulty of monitoring underground networks, equally, makes it extremely difficult to ensure compliance with any future deal. So, talks between the US President Trump and King Yong Un scheduled for May need to be underpinned by a coherent strategy rather than motions or machismo. Involvement of regional actors is key.

Moving the shadows of a possible conflict away from this region must remain one of our highest priorities. It is vital that we step up cooperation with South Korea, our strategic partner. We must always keep in mind — and remind our American allies — that any kind of military escalation would have a devastating impact especially on its civilian population and that of our own Japanese allies, another key partner. For this reason, too, we must support and encourage intra-Korean dialogue initiatives, making efforts to ensure that the global and regional powers involved contribute positively to this process. As for North Korea, it is important to reiterate that abstaining from missile provocations and stopping the nuclear programme are essential conditions not only for keeping the dialogue open, but also and above all in order to reopen, if the commitments follow concrete and inoppulsible facts, possible prospects for humanitarian aid.

We should ensure that nuclear weapons are eliminated, for security in the region, but also to give the non-proliferation treaty as a whole more credibility.

I welcome the recent signs of an inner-Korean convergence process, which has been stepping up in recent weeks. It is imperative that this dialogue be maintained with international support. At the same time, however, this is not enough to achieve lasting and stable peace on the Korean Peninsula. That is why China and Russia must continue to use their influence on the leadership in Pyongyang to prevent the regime from further nuclear and missile tests that are contrary to international law. Likewise, US President Donald Trump should focus on diplomacy and prudence at the forthcoming meeting with Kim Jong—UN in May, and use the United Nations and EU-backed sanctions programme to the North Korean leadership as a means of exerting pressure. In the long term, Iran's nuclear agreement will serve as a reference for a possible deal with North Korea. This is one of the reasons why it is important for President Trump to abandon his plan to unilaterally terminate the Iran agreement. The European Union should play its role as mediator and diplomatic strength to advance the inter-Korean talks and international negotiations on North Korea's nuclear disarmament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 327, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Dubravka Šuica (PPE).", "mepid": "119434", "text": "— Dear Chairman, it should first be remembered and once again reiterated that North Korea is one of the most authoritative and brutal regimes that exist in the world.

It's one of the precedents in world politics, but here, we need to see what's meant to talk about. In any case, without denuclearization, without, therefore, disarmament of the peninsula there is no talk of lifting sanctions. Therefore, sanctions should be taken as measures that are not of their own purpose, but at the same time they should be kept until human rights are improved, until the standard of living is improved in North Korea. And that's what the European Union must always keep in mind, too.

The last thing I have to say, and I think it is the most important thing, is that we should all bear in mind that the maximum objective is complete disarmament from nuclear weapons, because I fear that once we discovered the nuclear weapons, they will be used, either by mistake, or deliberately, and the destruction will be before us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 335, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Michaela Šojdrová (PPE).", "mepid": "124710", "text": " — Mr President, the current developments on the Korean Peninsula give us hope for a peaceful solution.

At the most recent European Council in March, our heads of state and government expressed their grave concern over the continued detention of EU citizens in Turkey, including the two Greek soldiers. The Council called for a swift and positive resolution of these issues, in cooperation with Member States, and the European Council is considering these matters. Shortly after, President Juncker and President Tusk discussed this issue directly and at length with Turkish President Erdoğan at the leaders’ meeting in Varna. The detention of the two Greek soldiers is a departure from the custom, usually followed by both sides, of resolving such incidents as swiftly as possible. No charges have been brought against these two soldiers and it remains unclear when the court will examine their cases. The two soldiers have been in pre-trial detention since the beginning of March. We trust that their case will swiftly be brought to trial, in line with international detention standards. Yet the situation creates unbearable uncertainty for the persons involved and for their families. On the political level, it increases strains between Turkey and the European Union. We still have serious concerns about the recent Turkish actions in the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea. The European Council condemned these actions in March, and detentions of EU citizens also create undesirable tensions with Member States. Turkey is a key partner for the European Union, as well as a candidate country. We do have serious disagreements with the Turkish government, particularly when it comes to the negative trend of the human rights situation in the country. Turkey has been moving away from the European Union, in particular in the areas of the rule of law and fundamental rights, and by weakening effective checks and balances in their political system. The Commission has repeatedly called on Turkey to reverse this negative trend as a matter of priority. And this is again our assessment in the country report on Turkey that we just adopted earlier today, after the college at noon. Yet, beyond our disagreements, our dialogue with Turkey is more important than ever. Just think about the situation in Syria. We need to engage with Turkey to address a difficult and tense regional situation, and Turkey needs to engage with us. In this context, good neighbourly relations would be extremely important. It is in our mutual interest to refrain from actions that only make our dialogue more difficult. This is why the European Union has urged Turkey to avoid any source of friction with our Member States, all the more so between two countries that are also neighbours and NATO allies. It is in the interest of all to avoid further irritants and instead strengthen dialogue and cooperation, as well as a peaceful resolution of any dispute that may arise. This is a message we convey to our Turkish interlocutors as part of our continuous dialogue.

So they have protected the EU's external border. Everything, but also everything, indicates that it was an accidental crossing of the border in bad weather. This does not prevent the Turkish side from truly accusing the two soldiers of NATO partner Greece of military espionage and invasion of a restricted military zone — but without a real charge, as would be customary in a constitutional state. That is unacceptable! And it is obvious that Erdoğan wants to use the detained soldiers as a stake to force Greece to extradite suspected Turkish putschists. This approach is also unacceptable. That is why we here in the European Parliament today are calling by a large majority for the rapid end of the legal procedure and for the release of detainees. Unfortunately, this incident also paints a very clear picture of the fundamental situation in Turkey. This picture was reiterated when the Commission report was published today.

I cannot recall having done it once during the term of office because something positive has happened. For the most part, we have talked about human rights abatements and just today about the capture of two Greek soldiers who have accidentally entered Turkish territory. It's not the first time it's happened. In the forested area near Kastanies on the Turkey-Greece border, the border has been crossed accidentally on several occasions before. But the difference this time is that in the past when it was crossed, one resolved the issue directly at the local level. Therefore, it is incomprehensible why Turkey today is holding the two Greek soldiers and why they refuse to send them home, as requested by Greece. What's the difference this time? I assume that it is partly about the long-standing state of emergency that prevails in the country, which put all previous formal and informal rules out of play — and which it is difficult for us outsiders to accept so long after the coup attempt that they are allowed to continue — and that it is the question of a form of show of force in the increasingly tough dialogue between the EU and Turkey and Turkey and Greece. In the case of the two prisoners, there are a number of issues to highlight. It is not just about the risk of degrading treatment, which many Turkish prisoners face in prisons in Turkey. It is also about the rights of prisoners, which under international law must always be respected. It also applies to their right to be notified of the crimes they are accused of. But we must also strive to avoid similar situations in the future. Since both countries are Nato countries, it would not be entirely wrong if NATO's secretary-general was asked to mediate between Greece and Turkey, partly to facilitate the rapid release of the two Greek soldiers, partly to promote the frosty relationship between the two neighbouring countries.

It is completely unacceptable to politicize this unjust detention of the two soldiers for purposes other than what is the case itself, namely a simple trespassing that occurred by mistake. This issue, of course, concerns the two governments directly, but we, as the European Parliament, must make our closeness and uniquely support felt for the government, the Greek people and its soldiers. Turkey must find before it a united and compact Union in defending the rights of the two arrested servicemen, two European citizens who are victims of an artificially fuelled accident, which must be released.

But we should not forget about the future of the EU’s foreign policy spending, with almost EUR 100 million budgeted for external relations already, a lot is at stake, and we must use this upcoming budget as an opportunity to reflect and reform in order to make the EU a stronger global player. It is undeniable that the current foreign policy spending structure needs improvement. Evaluations, independent ones, have found that a strategic and overarching vision is lacking, while management by different services within both the Commission and the European External Action Service are inefficient and incoherent. Information sharing with us here in Parliament has been anything but forthcoming and, similarly, legal barriers have prevented the EU from swiftly responding to new and emerging challenges. We cannot make opaque trust funds the new model for foreign policy spending and certainly not with the main goal of managing migration, and that is exactly what risks happening. The European External Action Service is rumoured to seek the creation of one single instrument for EU External Action with ‘a strong focus on migration’. You heard it right: the goal is to pool all the money together, and as we understand, Commissioner Hahn is trying to ensure the funding intended for candidate Member States and the European neighbourhood remain separate. What’s most concerning to me and many of my colleagues is not that there is an appetite for ambitious reforms – in fact that should be embraced – but that no governance model has been set up for such a single instrument. So how can we in the European Parliament be asked to agree with the new vehicle if we do not know how it is going to be steered? I am afraid that the lack of clarity here uncovers a bigger problem. During a recent Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing and during the many foreign instruments working groups that I have chaired, it has become clear that Members of the European Parliament are not in the mood to give the External Action Service or the Commission carte blanche. They feel sidelined already as strategic dialogues are often neither strategic nor dialogues. Information is shared reluctantly and late. Parliament is keen to ensure it can do its job and steer policies, spending and apply the necessary and required parliamentary scrutiny. MEPs also want to build in more flexibility to ensure adequate responses to new crises, as well as the preservation of European values. We do, as Europe faces unprecedented challenges at the moment: bloodshed continues in Yemen and Syria, and Presidents Erdoğan and el-Sisi have further consolidated their authoritarian grip on power in Turkey and Egypt. At the same time, governments in Russia, China and Iran are at odds with the values and interests we hold dear in Europe. In practice, the values-based goals and objectives of EU foreign policy have too often become subordinate to short-term and national interests such as migration management or countering terrorism. The deal concluded with President Erdoğan to stop Syrian refugees from reaching us in Europe is a case in point. The future of the EU’s foreign policy budget can benefit from reforms, but cannot only be designed to deal with today’s crises. Who knows what could be at the top of the agenda in 2025? And in the absence of an altogether more flexible budget, which is what we should be focusing on with the MFF, we need at least to build in flexibility while we have multiannual spending plans. But certainly the instrumentalising of all foreign policy funds and managing migration as the key goal is not the right direction. So before the European External Action Service and the Commission propose a new architecture, they should think about governance and, where needed, be reminded that we in Parliament play an equal role here. I therefore encourage colleagues in this House to focus on the principles of parliamentary scrutiny, oversight, policy-steered spending, evaluations and accountability.

Let me first share a few reflections on the mid-term review and the instruments covered by the report. I fully concur with the report’s findings that our instruments are generally fit for purpose, but have been stretched to their limits in the past years. In particular, the European Neighbourhood Instrument has been a pivotal tool to force reforms in our neighbourhood. At the same time, as the report notes, the challenges that we have faced in the neighbourhood have shown the need for greater financial resources and more flexibility. The Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance is unique in addressing the objective of preparing candidate countries and potential candidates for EU membership. The next instrument for pre-accession should be clearly positioned in the context of the new Western Balkan strategy. The mid-term review concluded that our Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace was relevant, effective, and efficient and had a unique added value, and we fully agree. The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights promotes some of our core values in a challenging global context. We have witnessed increased pressure on human rights defenders and closing spaces for civil society in many countries. We intend to enhance our support to human rights defenders even more in the coming years and continue our work on EU election observations. Finally, the Partnership Instrument is a young instrument that has helped us invest in the European Union’s soft power, where and when we needed it the most. In the next three years we want to focus it on some priorities, such as economic diplomacy, climate, health, peace and security, and digital issues including cybersecurity. Let me come to the future architecture. I would like to reflect on the lessons from the mid-term review that guide our thinking for the proposal we will soon publish. First, the volume of external action funding needs to match our political ambitions. To deliver on our ambitions we need adequate financial resources. Second, too often we have had to adapt our policies to our instruments. It is time that we adapt our instruments to our political priorities. This is why we have proposed merging our development and foreign policy instruments into one broad instrument covering neighbourhood as well as development and international cooperation. Third, one broad instrument does not mean one single policy. It does not mean less funding for certain regions or themes. There will be clear funding dedicated to each policy area in order to reflect our political priorities. Fourth, we need more flexibility and more responsiveness. Our aim is also to set aside a significant share of unallocated funds. This will allow us to react to changing circumstances without diverting funds from other policies. We want – and we agree with the report on this – to make the EU budget more accountable, more transparent and understandable to the public. That includes, as announced yesterday, bringing the European Development Fund inside the budget, as this would significantly enhance parliamentary scrutiny. Finally, it should be easier to work for the security of our citizens and partners. For this reason, the High Representative has proposed setting up a European peace facility to finance missions and capacity building as an off-budget funding mechanism. Let me conclude by saying that our debates on budgets should finally focus on our citizens’ priorities, instead of focusing simply on instruments. We would like our conversation to be driven by the great issues of our times, from migration to the situation in Syria, from security to Africa’s development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 381, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Antonio López-Istúriz White", "mepid": "28399", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Madam President, as shadow rapporteur for the EPP Group I had the opportunity to coordinate my group's vision in a vital dossier for the European Union's foreign policy.

The effectiveness of the European Union's external financing instruments is essential if we can ensure that the European Union has the necessary tools to implement its overall, neighbourhood and enlargement policy. What we are discussing today is not only the mid-term review of these instruments, but also the recommendation for the new architecture from 2020: what needs to be changed or optimized in those instruments so that they continue to do the important work they do in our foreign policy. In this regard, I would like to highlight three points. The current external relations budget is only 6% of the multiannual financial framework. However, with that amount the European Union has achieved considerable successes in our external relations, from a successful agreement with Turkey to curb migration flows to the Minsk agreements to achieve stability and peace in Ukraine. Secondly, we must point out the importance of having specific instruments for specific aspects of our international agenda. Specific funding for our neighbourhood policy instruments must be ensured.

In the context of the preparation of the Commission’s proposal for the next MFF, the Commission and the European External Action Service are discussing the structure of the external financing instruments to simplify the architecture and enhance flexibility. We must ensure that appropriate safeguards in terms of parliamentary scrutiny are put in place. A simplified architecture of the instruments achieved through their consolidation would have to be accompanied by a new oversight model of governance and parliamentary scrutiny, ensuring full accountability. In addition, a consolidation of instruments would have very political implications, even more so in the context of Brexit and budget pressure.

When we cannot vote in favour of the overall result anyway, it is primarily because we do not believe that we can propose increases for the EU's budgetary areas until we have addressed funding. Since we do not believe that the EU budget as a result of Brexit must necessarily be higher, then we also believe we have a responsibility to address how the funds should be raised before we propose to use them. The other thing that pains us in the ECR Group is that we have repeated the unilateral criticism that has been in relation to the devastation in Gaza and the West Bank of demanding EU funds for buildings back from the Israelis without thinking that the Palestinians have very much added up to them devastation that has occurred, including by deliberately using soft civilian targets as launch ramps and hiding place for terrorist attacks against Israel.

Until today, we have not heard – beyond the rather empty argument of simplification – of any good reason why all these important thematic tools of the Union should disappear and be merged. On the contrary, the recent mid—term review conducted by the Commission has just confirmed that these instruments are fit for purpose and, in the case of the Instrument for Stability and Peace, ‘a key tool for the EU to underpin its diplomacy and tailor—made projects’. This mid—term review also stresses in its conclusions that this capacity ‘must be further strengthened in any future architecture’. We acknowledge that the new structure should be more rational and more flexible.

It would actually be useful to strengthen the ownership of the beneficiaries, having them fully on board from step one. There is also the need to make sure that the EU rules and procedures for funding are fully understood from the beginning. The monitoring and evaluating of the process is a must.

I consider this particularly important for the IPA II Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, especially in the context of today's encouraging Report on Enlargement to the Western Balkans and the recently published European Union Enlargement Strategy, which provides support to candidate countries and potential candidates in implementation of reforms aimed at achieving stability and security in the immediate neighbourhood of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 400, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Cristian-Silviu Buşoi (PPE).", "mepid": "38420", "text": "   – Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Schaake, and the team of shadow rapporteurs on the very good report.

In the light of the wars and conflicts and rising tensions outside EU borders, I stress the importance of further strengthening, post-2020, the architecture of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, which could bring massive EU added value, as it cooperates directly with human rights defenders and local civil society organisations around the world, without the need for the approval of national authorities. The instrument needs clearer and more strategic objectives which are totally independent of other instruments in order to bring more feasible solutions on, critically, human rights violations in countries like Syria and Turkey, which were intensely debated last time in our plenary. Secondly, I would like to welcome the news that the Instrument Contributing to Stability and Peace, in addition to the support for security initiatives and peace-building activities, will now provide funds for training measures and equipment supplies to third countries working towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

Why should we change anything then? Depriving the neighbourhood policy of its own financial instrument will lower the political rank of the Eastern Partnership. We would lose a special approach to the immediate vicinity of the Union. Certain goals and qualities will also vanish, such as differentiation and the principle of more for more, and thus the incentive for structural reform. Neighbourhood policy is focused on political engagement instead of development aid, it is a more comprehensive policy, more ambitious and therefore needs special attention. In addition, there would be a risk of reducing funding for the Eastern Partnership by transferring funds more easily between different priorities and regions.

It is the only current programme that provides independent and impartial funding to civil society and human rights defenders, including protection and support for human rights defenders at risk. It is unique among EU external action instruments. Many organisations and individual human rights defenders will simply not be able to access funds without it. The maintenance of a dedicated, separate instrument would also allow for better parliamentary scrutiny of funding, with greater accountability and transparency.

In replying after the debate, we have one key question left that can be summarised in one word, and that is ‘how’. We hear, on the one hand, that the mid-term review concludes that the instruments are fit—for—purpose. On the other hand, we get a proposal to radically change the instruments. I think the Commission and the External Action Service really urgently need to explain how – and not only to us (we are budget and foreign policy geeks, not a big group of people, although we would have been interested in an actual outline and we have asked for it before), but what about our citizens and what about our partner countries? This cannot wait until the last minute, if you really want this to be a success. I think, generally, the notion of better communication has been raised by MEPs throughout many discussions we have had. So I unfortunately have to conclude that there is still no clarity on governance. It is a broad ask and, frankly, I think it is a missed opportunity that this debate was not used to outline how the reform of the instruments will be governed. On a number of focus areas that you outlined in your introduction, such as public diplomacy, the Western Balkans and a digital values—based approach, I think we generally have common ground, but I am concerned when I hear things like ‘we will work according to what the people want’. Of course, this is a highly political discussion and I suspect it will be for the entire multiannual period that we are talking about, and I urge the External Action Service and the Commission not to lose sight of long-term goals and objectives: even though short-term solutions can be very tempting, they can also be a populist trap. I really think that we, the EU, have a bigger promise than only to look at short-term goals. Certainly when everything gets framed in the context of migration management, I do not think that that is a long-term and a sustainable and values-based solution. I know a lot of colleagues are very unhappy if that is the direction we are going in. To conclude: yes, our money should be focused on policy goals, and should be spent efficiently with the appropriate oversight and parliamentary scrutiny, while respecting our values. We can only really talk about whether we agree with the new architecture if we know how it is going to be governed.

In such a dramatic context, a clear and long-term political vision underlying the Union's foreign policy of the financial instruments of external action is needed.

Serbia is eligible for financial assistance of approximately EUR 1.5 billion over the seven-year period, i.e. EUR 200 million per person per year, which is EUR 28 per inhabitant per year. Although this is a significant amount, it is far behind the resources needed to implement the reforms. For example, the tasks to be carried out in the field of environmental protection are estimated to take EUR 4 billion until accession. I believe that it is essential to take into account the real needs of the candidate countries, in particular the two leading countries, Serbia and Montenegro, when drawing up the next multiannual financial perspective.

In particular, we support the central European countries' demands to leave the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) as separate, according to the principle of “let's not spoil what works well.” We support the simplification and alignment of financial mechanisms for political purposes.

The Recommendation on the Agreement and the accompanying report obtained broad support in the Committee on Foreign Affairs a few weeks ago. I look forward to the support of the plenary tomorrow. But I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the political groups for their cooperation. And I also thank the European External Action Service for its cooperation in preparing the report on this Framework Agreement. Next, I will highlight some aspects of the Agreement and the relations between the European Union and Australia. The relationship is very solid, based on many historical links, values and common principles. There is, yes, a physical, geographical remoteness, but there is a great political and value proximity. Australia is, so to speak, a natural ally of the European Union in that vast Asia-Pacific area, which is very dynamic and increasingly important in today's world. In the White Paper on Foreign Policy 2017, the Australian Government stressed the vital importance of relations with the European Union. These relations have increased in recent years: this is demonstrated by this Framework Agreement, also the leadership forum, or the first contacts already concluded with a view to negotiating a free trade agreement. Furthermore, we agree on many high-level dialogue mechanisms taking place in Asia-Pacific. At the bilateral level, I stress the importance of launching negotiations on a free trade agreement. Australia is a country that believes in free trade in the face of unfortunately booming protectionism. We have a growing trade and economic relationship in which the European Union enjoys a significant surplus. There are many other areas of dialogue and cooperation established by the Agreement, for example: foreign and security policy, human rights, economy and trade, education, culture, research, innovation, energy, transport, justice and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, weapons of mass destruction, global governance or development. Australia is indeed an important regional player and is also a very active member of global agencies in the face of these global challenges. For example, he was recently on the Security Council, now on the UN Human Rights Council, and is also a member of the G20 since its founding and chaired it in 2014. Australia is also present in numerous Asia-Pacific regional and subregional organizations. I would also like to emphasize its alignment with the European Union's positions on sanctions against Russia, North Korea and Syria. I will also mention their participation in anti-Daesh operations and its many peacekeeping missions at the UN. He is also present in the so-called Combined Maritime Forces, in anti-piracy and terrorism operations in the Western Indian Ocean. The Framework Agreement also provides for cooperation on other major global and regional challenges. I refer, for example, to climate change, migration issues and development issues, all of which are addressed in the resolution which we will vote tomorrow. Finally, the positions of the European Union and Australia, at the international level and in the face of the challenges of our time, often coincide. Australia, like the European Union, is also an actor committed to global governance based on international law and multilateralism, which we too want to preserve. It also supported free trade, development aid and the fight against terrorism. The European Union wants to be increasingly present in Asian regional forums; its positions are very similar to those of Australia, and I therefore hope that Australia will cooperate with the Union Europe closely in these forums and to give all the facilities to be fully integrated into all of them, including the so - called East Asia Summit. In this large and complex Asia-Pacific region, Australia is very close to our values and interests; these relations need to be further strengthened and precisely for that the Framework Agreement will be a very useful instrument. I hope that support for the Agreement Recommendation and the accompanying report will remain very large.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 414, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Neven Mimica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, thank you for the opportunity for this debate on the EU—Australia Framework Agreement. The Agreement reflects our wish to give a modern framework to relations with one of the EU’s closest partners in the Asia—Pacific region. It will allow the promotion and expansion of our cooperation with Australia across a broad range of areas of mutual interest.  EU relations with Australia are excellent and I sincerely believe that they will continue to evolve further. We are geographically very far apart but we work together on a daily basis on the global stage. Our cooperation on foreign policy has been constant and intense. Just to name a recent example, Australia has shown great solidarity in condemning the Salisbury attack and took concrete actions in response to it. We take part in the same military missions to preserve peace and security around the world and we particularly appreciate Australia’s participation in our operation off the coast of the Horn of Africa. We also have good development cooperation, especially in the Pacific, focusing on sustainable development, economic growth and gender equality. We are incredibly like—minded and, as a consequence, political dialogue with Australia has been intensifying and an ever—increasing number of political contacts have taken place over the past years. In 2016, we launched the EU—Australia Leadership Forum, a unique platform for European and Australian political business, media and civil society leaders to meet and nurture the relationship with new ideas and proposals. In 2008, the EU and Australia signed a partnership framework, which opened new avenues for cooperation. We also hold a regular security dialogue at senior official level.  The signing of our Framework Agreement last summer by High Representative Mogherini and Foreign Minister Bishop came as a natural evolution of our partnership. Our Framework Agreement makes our relationship fit for the 21st century. The European Union and Australia share the same world view. We support democracy, the rule of law and human rights and we are active players in multilateral organisations such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. We have also shared interests in tackling key global challenges, such as sustainable development, humanitarian aid and the fight against terrorism. We work together against climate change and to better manage migration. We both want international trade to be free and fair at the same time. EU—Australia cooperation in the Pacific is growing. We have many shared interests in sustainable energy, climate change and ocean governance. We are also looking into how to associate like—minded donors, like Australia, in the post—Cotonou process.  To complete the advancing political relationship, we have decided to work towards launching negotiations for a free trade agreement. We have gone through a number of important stages of the preparatory process. The Commission has carried out an impact assessment and held free trade agreement (FTA) co—opening discussions with Australia. The draft directives for negotiating the free trade agreement were published by the Commission in September. The discussions in the Council are ongoing.  The European Parliament has fed into these deliberations with a dedicated report adopted at the end of October. I trust that the Council will adopt the negotiating directives soon, enabling the Commission to launch the free trade agreement negotiations before the summer. The Commission looks forward to continuing cooperation with the Parliament in this matter.

Alongside the FPA, we are also seeing negotiations progressing for an EU-Australia free trade agreement. These efforts also mark a wider engagement by the EU in the Pacific region, and we already see plans moving ahead for FTAs with New Zealand and Japan to complement existing ones with Singapore and South Korea.  Sadly, my country, the UK, has failed totally to appreciate the importance of the 62 FTAs negotiated by the EU, preferring – via Brexit – to go it alone as ‘global Britain’. I continue to regard Brexit as a selfish and destructive act against a peace and prosperity project: the EU. I also have no doubt that the hopes from some Brexiteers to see the Anglosphere and the Commonwealth become a cohesive economic bloc to substitute the EU as our main trading partner are pure fantasy.

Australia and the EU are both committed to advancing the protection and promotion of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. They are closely aligned in foreign policy issues, both being important actors in development cooperation and humanitarian assistance in the Pacific region, and in dialogue with the countries of Southeast Asia. The high level of global mobility requires a multilateral approach based on multinational cooperation and shared responsibility. Furthermore, the partners are dedicated to intensifying dialogue and cooperation on migration and asylum. Moreover, the EU and Australia engage in cooperation on combating terrorism, as well as in the fields of migration and asylum, research and innovation, education, culture and environmental protection.

Strengthening free world trade is a strengthening of our own prosperity, our social policy, as well as a strengthening of the stability of the world, and we must see that, following the withdrawal of Americans from TPP and some of the United States' implied cooperation with China, at the expense of other states in the Pacific region — such as Japan — it is extremely important for the European Commission to enter into this vacuum and make treaties as it did with South Korea — which will soon be concluded — in June with Japan, now Australia, New Zealand, and I believe that we should get stronger in Latin America.

It seems to me that there is a wide convergence of views, a majority, but not unanimous, support for the Framework Agreement with Australia and also for the resolution accompanying Parliament's adoption of the Agreement. I would like to conclude my speech on this matter with three or four considerations. Firstly, EU-Australia relations are very strong at all levels and we must continue to strengthen these relations. The Framework Agreement will contribute to that, and also, as you know, I would like to see that free trade agreement which has not yet begun to be concluded soon. We will thus have two main pillars to sustain the relationship: the political and the economic. And I believe that in the report that we will be adopting this trade issue tomorrow is treated in a balanced manner and that it must be a mutually beneficial relationship, without disregarding the challenge posed by Australia's importance as an agricultural exporter. But let us not forget that the European Union is also a major agri-food exporter. Second consideration: we are natural allies, I usually repeat it. This closeness of principles, values and interests allows us to cooperate closely in addressing global and regional challenges. I am thinking of development aid, the fight against terrorism, and we must also stress again Australia's alignment with European positions on sanctions against Russia or North Korea. Then, if the European Union — the third consideration — wants to be a global player, it must be increasingly present in the Asia-Pacific region, and as a natural ally in those forums we have Australia. The new scenario that opens Brexit has been evoked here. I think this is the time to deepen relationships with Australia. Brexit must be an incentive, a stimulus to strengthen our positions there, and not the opposite. I conclude by reiterating my thanks to everyone for their cooperation, I repeat my hope that tomorrow the Agreement with Australia will be the broadest possible consensus. The convergence of views that I have seen today once again allows me to be optimistic about tomorrow's vote.

Unless it has exclusive competence, the European Union can intervene only if it is able to act more effectively than the Member States at their national or local level. Similarly, the principle of proportionality provides that the means used by the Union to achieve the objectives set out in the Treaties cannot go beyond what is necessary. These principles have been adopted to ensure the effective functioning of the European Union. They are also essential means of ensuring the link between the Union and the citizens. They should therefore not be mistreated for the purpose of blocking or to nourish Euroscepticism, quite the contrary. This report covers the years 2015 and 2016 and identifies the large number of existing tools, some of which were implemented in 2015. There are a range of tools to participate in the stages of the European legislative procedure: impact assessments, public consultations, the REFIT platform, the IPEX platform, the internal Regpex and Connect platforms, dialogues through COSAC and the Committee of the Regions, and the yellow card procedure. Furthermore, since 2014, national parliaments have shown increased interest in European policy through the new instruments put in place, notably REFIT. In 2016, 65 opinions were received from national parliaments, a substantial increase from 2015, which is encouraging. I am therefore not in favour of the creation and development of new instruments without fully exploiting the potential of existing tools. The procedure works when all the protagonists bring interest to him. Therefore, I stress the uselessness of adding instruments and procedures that would increase the bureaucratic burden and further slow down the legislative process. I believe that together, together with the shadow rapporteurs, we have produced a balanced report calling for an effective Union that respects differences and is responsive to the citizens. I would like to thank my colleagues for their collegial and pleasant cooperation. One last word about the Timmermans task-force. As you know, President Juncker has set up a working group to reflect on subsidiarity, to which representatives of national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions and the European Parliament were invited. The European Parliament's refusal to take part does not, in my view, express a lack of interest on the part of our Parliament, but a call for respect for its status as co-legislator. Thus, MEPs keep themselves completely free to express their views on the results of this task force. However, this absence of the European Parliament should in no way affect the relations of the European Parliament with COSAC and the Committee of the Regions. I also hope that our relations with the Committee of the Regions will be strengthened, and I have written a letter in this regard to the President of Parliament. Indeed, the Committee of the Regions is an indispensable institution since it is a valuable cord between the Union and its regions. That is why I emphasised the need for rapprochement between European, national and regional institutions. It is only together, each at its own level, that we must act and engage in policy in the interests of the well-being of our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 429, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Neven Mimica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Delvaux, for her excellent work and for the positive conclusions she has reached. Since taking office, the Juncker Commission has committed itself to give real effect to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. We want to work with national parliaments and EU institutions to ensure that every proposal complies with these principles and we improve our shared understanding of what subsidiarity and proportionality mean. The interinstitutional agreement on better law—making, which the three institutions signed two years ago, puts renewed focus on ensuring that these principles are fully respected when developing the Union’s legislation and assessing its impact. We have shown this joint commitment to bring about the change that citizens wish to see in Europe.  My colleague, First Vice—President Frans Timmermans would have liked to be here this evening, but had to travel to Luxembourg for the General Affairs Council. Under his steer, the College has invested heavily in the better regulation agenda. We have made important steps towards more transparency, more public participation and more evidence—based rule—making. This has truly been a cultural change and it has borne results.  To build on this, as announced by President Juncker in his 2017 State of the Union address, the Commission set up the task force on subsidiarity, proportionality and doing less more efficiently in November 2017. We want to ensure that decisions are balanced and taken at the appropriate level, whether it is European, national, regional or local, and we need to discuss whether there are policy areas where competences could meaningfully be re—delegated to Member States.  The Commission has taken note of the Parliament’s decision not to join the task force. We also continue to stress that the seats earmarked for Parliament remain open, should Parliament reconsider. However, we welcome that the report which we are discussing today confronts the Parliament’s interest in helping improve the application and monitoring of the subsidiarity principle.  Many of your suggestions are very similar to ideas currently being examined by the task force. As regards the subsidiarity control mechanism, we agree that national parliaments should be clear in explaining the reasons for which they consider that a proposal does not respect the subsidiarity principle. Your report also asked the Commission to share its replies to national parliaments’ reasoned opinions with this House. Let me recall that we publish our replies on our website. I note the suggestion for the Commission to reflect on excluding recess periods from the eight—week period, as we have done for the month of August. The eight—week period is laid down in the Treaty, but we are looking at the question in the task force on subsidiarity, proportionality and doing less more efficiently.  The Commission does not have a monopoly on good ideas. We are therefore always ready to discuss constructive suggestions from national parliaments. In 2015, a first green card initiative on food waste was supported by 18 chambers. Many of the suggestions made were then reflected in the Circular Economy package which the Commission adopted in December 2015. I agree with you that such an initiative shows how national parliaments can play a constructive role in the institutional framework. We believe our focus should now be on using the current mechanisms to the full, rather than embarking on a lengthy institutional debate when we know that formal changes could well require treaty changes.

I would also like to thank the Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs for taking into account a number of suggestions from the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which I have drafted. There is a good convergence between our two committees on the fact that the annual reports on subsidiarity and proportionality are very useful tools for us to assess the implementation of these fundamental principles and safeguard the prerogatives that have been recognized in national parliaments. There is also a convergence that the mechanisms ensuring respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality work essentially well. This can be seen clearly in the limited number of “yellow cards” adopted, the statistics on reasoned opinions and the diversity of the national chambers that issue them. There is clearly a strong interest in European affairs in our national parliaments and the European Parliament has become a privileged interlocutor in these exchanges. Finally, I would like to mention that in our opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we stressed the need to introduce a dose of flexibility within the framework of the early warning system, in the interpretation of the eight-week deadline, as detailed in the Rangel report on the implementation of the Treaty provisions concerning the national parliaments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 431, "date": "2018-04-17.json", "name": "Емил Радев", "mepid": "124850", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. — Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank her especially for the good cooperation we had on this report.

I also welcome the European Commission for its initiatives in recent years, which improve the implementation of both principles in the adoption of European legislation. It is today that the European Union is facing an unprecedented crisis in search of its identity, it is particularly important that we create strong European legislation where the European Union can make real progress and add value. Therefore, we must apply the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality correctly. If we do not do this, we will only give arguments in the hands of Eurosceptics. National parliaments, acting as representatives of European citizens at national level, also play their important role in addressing the differences between the European institutions and the public. I therefore believe that we should give them a real opportunity to participate in this process by providing for greater flexibility in calculating the eight-week period within which they can send a reasoned opinion.

I thank my colleague Mady Delvaux for this and the passion she put you into drawing it. The instrument of the annual report on subsidiarity and proportionality is an important instrument: it allows us to give substance to our democratic practice; it serves the Union. The Union needs in some areas to grow and disseminate regulation through more intensive legislation; in some other cases it has to organise legislation that already exists. And we have to give an important, but positive signal, if we can do that, to the people who look at us, to the people of Europe. We must answer the question that comes from below and we must do so taking into account the suggestions and requests from the national parliaments, what are commonly referred to as “the tags” greens”. I would like to give one example in this regard: in 2019 nine parliamentary chambers invited the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to implement the principles of corporate social responsibility .
