We very much share your preoccupation. The evidence from different sources such as the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe confirms an alarming increase of intolerance and hatred in Europe. There might be several reasons explaining this worrying phenomenon, but let me be clear on this: there can be no justification for it. The EU has adopted specific legislation on combating intolerance and hatred, in particular the 2008 Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. The Presidency is aware that the Commission is currently looking into the national laws of the Member States to assess the framework and to ensure its correct implementation. Only a few months ago, in June, the Council reminded Member States of the need to ensure the effective transposition and implementation of the Framework Decision and other relevant laws at national level to counter the plight of hate crimes. In addition, the Council asked Member States to develop effective methods to report and ensure proper recording of hate crimes. It is also worth mentioning that the Council has adopted a directive that prohibits discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin. It has been in place for more than 15 years and it is an important tool in the fight against racial discrimination.  As for the future: we need to combine our actions and strengthen the existing cooperation between institutions. In this context, I would like to recall the important step made last June, when the Council responded positively to the Commission’s list of actions to advance LGBTI equality. The Council invited the Commission to promote the measures outlined in that list and report regularly on the progress achieved. The Council has likewise invited the Member States to take action to combat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Council has also consistently supported the efforts of the EU and its Member States to improve the situation of the Roma, which is Europe’s largest ethnic minority. Moreover, in the context of interinstitutional cooperation, the Council has supported the ambitious plan of the new Commission high-level group seeking to develop with Member States concrete practices and tools to improve responses to racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. We also welcome the ongoing EU-level dialogue with major IT companies, in cooperation with Member States, to address online hate speech. Last but not least, we should remember and commend the remarkable work done by the Fundamental Rights Agency in this field.  Let me stress once again that racism, xenophobia, homophobia and other forms of intolerance are incompatible with our common values and principles. According to the legal framework in place they can even constitute a crime that should be prosecuted. There is indeed no exception from this for politicians abusing the freedom of expression by inciting to violence or hatred. Our role – and on this I count on your support – is to remind ourselves of our responsibility for what we say. Words have power, including the power to harm. For this reason, freedom of expression has its limits. It is our common responsibility to find the right balance, and this is never an easy task. I look forward to your debates, honourable Members, and I thank you for your attention.

She asked me to replace her and I am glad to do so. Increasing fear and high rates of verbal and physical violence against ethnic, religious or other minorities across Europe are – and remain – a major concern. As we never get tired of reiterating, the Commission condemns all manifestations of racism, xenophobia, homophobia and all other forms of intolerance as these are incompatible with the values and principles upon which the European Union is founded. I personally believe that we all, collectively and individually, have the duty to fight against intolerance and hatred and reject all of its expressions. Political and opinion leaders bear, in this regard, a particularly important responsibility since racist, xenophobic and other attitudes of intolerance expressed by leaders are, by their very nature, incompatible with the responsibilities they are called upon to fulfil. They also contribute to a climate in which hatred and intolerance become normalised. History should have taught us to be wary. But for those who live in the here-and-now, very recent events have shown that this is not simply a theoretical issue, but a very real danger. I commend the efforts that this place, the European Parliament, makes in ensuring that incitement to hatred pronounced by its Members is taken seriously and addressed. Public condemnation of racism and xenophobia by the authorities, political parties and civil society contributes to acknowledging the seriousness of these phenomena and actively fighting against racist and xenophobic speech and behaviour. In the Commission prevention and the fight against racism, xenophobia and all other forms of intolerance are shared priorities. The fact that we devoted the first annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights to combating racism and intolerance last year reflects that commitment. The Commission appointed two Commission coordinators to contribute to combating hate crime, hate speech and intolerance by engaging and listening to the community’s concerns with regard to two particular forms of racism and xenophobia which have reared their heads: anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred. To give one illustration, in 2015 Jews were the target of 40% of all racist crimes committed in France and, as the November Fundamental Rights Agency report on hate crime and the current migration situation puts it, Muslims experience increased hostility as they are often perceived as perpetrators or sympathisers of terrorist attacks or for being part of a refugee movement seen as threatening safety and security. The Commission is acutely aware of this developing narrative and will continue to speak out forcefully against such stigmatisation and incitement to hatred against certain communities. We are also working with Member States to ensure they effectively enforce the legislation criminalising illegal hate speech, with particular regard to the EU’s Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law, which concerns, as you know, the public incitement to violence and hatred on grounds of race, colour, religion, descent, national or ethnic origin. This legislation applies to incitement to violence or hatred, online and offline, including statements by political and opinion leaders. In the bilateral dialogues we have with Member States to ensure the correct transposition and implementation of this instrument, we have raised a series of issues and concerns. As a result, in the past two years, six Member States have made amendments to their criminal law to bring their legislation in line with the framework decision. Commissioner Jourová strongly reiterated the importance of ensuring correct transposition and effective implementation of the instrument at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 14 October and urged national governments to do everything possible to ensure that national provisions can be swiftly and fully aligned to the EU rules and, just as importantly, that they are applied in practice. Member States’ law enforcement authorities and courts remain competent to investigate, prosecute and try individual cases of hate speech and hate crime. So it is only through working together with the Member States and other key actors, including civil society, that we can make a real difference on the ground, supporting national efforts to ensure implementation of the rules and to set up effective policies to prevent and combat this phenomenon. It is a matter of building the necessary commitment, capacity and making available resources and tools. The EU High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance is a unique platform for the exchange of best practice, guidance, strengthening cooperation and synergies, bringing together the key actors: civil society, community representatives, EU agencies, in particular the Fundamental Rights Agency, and relevant international organisations, including the UN, OSCE and the Council of Europe. The engagement of the European Parliament Intergroup against racism with this High Level Group is very welcome. We need to join our efforts to achieve common objectives. The group is focusing on issues such as how to improve awareness, enhance the effectiveness of investigations and prosecutions, better address under-reporting and ensure adequate victims’ support. The group is discussing forms of intolerance in order to develop and improve targeted responses. One priority for the High Level Group is to help all Member States develop sound methodologies for recording and collecting data on hate crimes, which can often go unreported or get mistaken for other offences. This work is carried out by a specific sub-group led by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and that met for the first time in October. We have also taken important steps to counter illegal hate speech on the internet. A Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online was agreed by the Commission with Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and YouTube in May this year. We will present a preliminary assessment of the work in this area on 7 December. We are also looking at how to support further the role of the media and ethical journalism in promoting fundamental rights and to ensure that a pluralistic media environment can foster political debate on crucial issues for democratic societies. These and other related issues were at the heart of the discussion at this year’s annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights, which First Vice-President Frans Timmermans hosted together with Commissioners Oettinger and Jourová earlier in November. Furthermore, we have consistently supported concrete projects to prevent racism, xenophobia homophobia and other forms of intolerance under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme. Through the new call for proposals, which is now open, we are making available EUR 6 million for projects in this area. In addition, the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) continues to support frontline practitioners and civil society actors to effectively address the challenges of radicalisation and polarisation at a local level. Practitioners are concerned about how violent, extremist, racist groups, on one hand, or Daesh, on the other, exploit the refugee crisis to promote their own poisonous narratives. Within the RAN practitioners are developing practical approaches and ways to address and prevent polarisation in schools and local communities with the objective of supporting a cohesive and inclusive society and reaching out to all communities. They will look into more effective ways of countering different types of extremist propaganda, including xenophobic propaganda, also drawing on the expertise within the European Strategic Communications network. Everybody should be able to enjoy their fundamental rights. We are all entitled to the respect of our right to non-discrimination, to human dignity, to life, to integrity of the person, and to protection from violence. That is why the High Level Group will also include exchanges on the intolerance and violence suffered by members of the LGBTI community. All that said, notwithstanding our efforts and the results we have achieved so far, we know there is a lot more to be done. We are ready to report regularly on the progress made and evaluate the need for further actions, and we count on your continued support as well as your constructive engagement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-12-01.json", "name": "Kinga Gál", "mepid": "28150", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. — Mr President, Officer, Minister. All that causes hatred, strengthens violence, intolerance in society is unacceptable. Not only on paper, but also in practice. However, I find it regrettable that, as a rule, EU decision-makers do not condemn intolerant behaviour against traditional national minorities. I would therefore like to draw attention to the intolerant behaviour that is taking place in the Member States of the European Union against European citizens who have always lived in their homeland and have not moved. against minorities. These include discrimination in the press and incitement of hatred, banning and sanctioning the use of their national symbols, and restrictions on the use of their mother tongue. These are deeply contradicted, and the European Commission should deal with these matters.

It shocks me that almost 300 transsgender people have been killed worldwide in the last year alone, according to Transgender Europe data. Brexit and US elections, however, have further fuelled different forms of hate speech and intolerance. These and other forms of hatred heavily poison dialogue and cooperation between people, are often the product of different ideologies and histories, and mostly hit the most vulnerable groups. Even in my country — Slovenia — we are facing an increase in intolerance. I regret that individuals use the plight of people to inflate intolerance and spread untruths. Attacks on refugees, religious facilities or institutions that promote intercultural dialogue are truly discarded acts that I condemn the harshest. We need to address prejudice and fears through education and education and through effective legislative action and policies. In practice, some Member States continue to undertake Framework Decisions and do not provide adequate protection against racist and xenophobic hate speech and hate crimes.

Diversity is the basis of a livable society. Europe has the task of effectively promoting and protecting these principles where and when necessary. Living free and equal should be for everyone. Some groups and individuals experience more than others that their experience of equality and freedom is under pressure. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, intersex, abbreviated LGBTI, are such a vulnerable group. Ten years ago, the Jogjakarta principles were drawn up by a group of international human rights experts. They provide an overview of international principles and human rights, specifically with regard to sexual orientation and identity. After ten years, the concerns expressed in the Yogjakarta principles are still equally relevant. LGBTI is discriminated against or stigmatised in a large number of EU countries. Progress has been made, but there is still a lot of work to be done.

This was Europe 65 years ago, but now we see that we must speak out again. It’s happening to those others, whoever they are. In June, the UK had the most divisive referendum campaigns. Our Equality and Human Rights Commission said that the referendum campaign had, and I quote, ‘legitimised hate’. During the campaign, a young MP doing her job was shot and stabbed to death by a man consumed with hate, and who, shockingly, on his conviction was supported by 60,000 tweets. Two months after the EU referendum, Mr Arkadiusz Jóźwik, a Polish national, was assaulted and killed by six teenagers in what was believed to be a hate crime. In the weeks following the Brexit result, reported hate crime rose by 58% compared to the year before, but it’s not just in the UK. Politicians and leaders on both sides of the Atlantic and across the Union are again peddling hate and fear. It gives permission to others, who feed on this bile and who are deranged enough to think that it’s acceptable.  Many EU citizens living in the UK are very scared, as are those seeking refuge or who have migrated elsewhere in the EU. What has the UK Government’s response been? To ask companies to report to them their foreign-born employees. What message is this sending? This is not the Britain I know. This is not the Europe that I know. The Britain I know is outward—looking, decent and tolerant. The Britain I know stands up for everyone, no matter what their skin colour, what their language, who they love or who they worship. And it was this ethos that founded the European Union as Europe recovered from the horrors that inspired Niemöller’s poem. But in this sea of rising intolerance, there are glimmers of hope. After the death of Mr Jóźwik, the Polish Centre in London was deluged with flowers and messages of sympathy.

I welcome both of you speaking out and welcoming the Directive against discrimination on grounds of race and ethnic origin, and also the list of actions against homophobia.

When we have, in Hungary for example, a Jobbik mayor making sure with a decree that in his city there should not be any propagation of, for example, same-sex marriage, or of the family as anything other than marriage and parent-child relationships, and banning muezzins and other issues, how can we not make stronger efforts for Member States to implement everything we have?

Can I just for one moment join Ms Bearder and Ms Dodds who recalled the tragic murder of Jo Cox, a Member of the British Parliament, and can I just salute her memory and her work promoting tolerance and inclusion. As a number have said – Mr Moraes, Ms Guillaume, Ms Hohlmeier amongst others – we are bound together by our values. One of those values, a key value for me and for us all, is freedom of expression. We are not talking here about limiting freedom of expression. We’re talking about incitement to violence or hatred, which is a crime. Again, of course, we should have respect for the achievements of previous generations, our histories and our cultures. But we also need to be conscious of the lessons of history, the tendencies to intolerance, prejudice and fear, and those we must combat through promotion of tolerance and inclusion. And we need to work altogether, and with our Member States, to pursue that. There have been a number of questions about what the Commission is doing with Member States, so I’ll answer that. In the course of the last year the Commission has initiated bilateral dialogue with 24 Member States with a view to ensuring full and correct transposition and implementation of the Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia that we’re discussing today. In the course of those discussions, I’m glad to say, positive progress has been reported in a number of Member States. But there remains more to be done, as I said at the start of this debate. The Commission has begun pre-infringement proceedings against a number of Member States where there are still substantive gaps in their implementation of this framework decision. We’re going to continue to engage in a constructive discussion, obviously, with national authorities in line with the principle of sincere cooperation, but the Commission will not hesitate to use its power to launch infringement proceedings where these efforts prove unsuccessful. Because – as I said at the beginning, and as has been echoed throughout this debate – we are determined to ensure that everyone is able to enjoy their fundamental rights because we are all entitled to the respect of our rights to non-discrimination, to human dignity, to life, to integrity of the person and to protection from violence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 45, "date": "2016-12-01.json", "name": "Ivan Korčok", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to make two points in conclusion.

Secondly – and more importantly in my view – I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning, namely that hate crimes, racism and discrimination have no place in our societies and we have to fight them with resolve. I believe the problem that we have been discussing here this morning has two dimensions. On the one hand, we have a legal framework at EU level, the Charter of Fundamental Rights Framework Decision, and Member States of course have clear commitments that need to be implemented. But the second dimension of this is that I do not think we can be successful in fighting xenophobia and anti-Semitism successfully unless we mobilise our citizens to actively stand against those who are spreading hatred in Europe. To mobilize our citizens means, of course, raising awareness and showing courage – a civic courage – in protecting those who are victims of acts which we all know are clearly against the values we all share.

The Council, for its part, has already adopted conclusions twice this year as well. The DRC will once again be on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 12 December. This is a huge country with enormous challenges. At the same time, its potential is immense, from the point of view of natural resources, of course, but even more so in terms of human potential and cultural attractiveness. For many years, the European Union has shown its solidarity with the people of the east of the country. We are committing our humanitarian aid to 1.5 million displaced people, for refugees, women victims of sexual violence, used as weapons of war. For example, more than 20 humanitarian partners have invested nearly €40 million this year. We are also working to find solutions to the root causes of conflict, not only through future European regulations on conflict-related minerals, but also through support for the Kimberley Process for Transparency in Diamond Mining and by supporting the initiative of the Regional Conference of the Great Countries Lakes against illegal exploitation of natural resources. The European Union is also committed to combating impunity in eastern Congo. We support the work of Monusco and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. I would also like to reiterate the importance of our CSDP missions, which have now been completed in the areas of police and military, namely EUPOL and EUSEC, for the governance of the country. I wanted to underline this commitment in the DRC, although the political situation has led us to review the usefulness of our partnership. Today, the only way to ensure stability in the DRC is to guarantee a democratic transition for the first time in its history. A clear calming of the situation could be achieved if President Kabila unambiguously confirmed that he will respect the mandate limit and that the current constitution will remain in force during the transitional period without amendment. Derogating from the constitutional deadline is only possible on the basis of a truly inclusive agreement, which can lead to a period of peaceful and as brief transition as possible. That is why the European Union has supported a framework for dialogue facilitated by the African Union. However, the resulting political agreement on 18 October may not satisfy this expectation. The risk of violence at the end of 19 December is significant, especially after the bloody crackdown on 19 and 20 September, which left more than 50 people dead on the streets of Kinshasa. A report by the UN Human Rights Office clearly points out the responsibility of the state's security apparatus. Together with other international partners, we have requested an independent investigation into these events. Since the Council conclusions of 23 May and 17 October, which are in line with Parliament's March resolution, the European Union has recalled the individual responsibility of the heads of justice and security institutions to act in strict respect for the rule of law and rights of man. Unfortunately, the repression of opponents and members of civil society, including largely unjustified arrests, the closure or interference of radio broadcasts, including RFI, has continued in recent weeks. In the coming days, the Council will announce its decision on the first restrictive measures. But our action will not remain there. First, we will continue to fully support the efforts of the Conference of Bishops of Congo to make the political agreement more robust and inclusive. We call on both the government and the opposition to cooperate constructively in this direction. Secondly, the European Union makes a clear appeal to the new government to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and ensure security without repression. The European Union is also committed with its partners to work to strengthen the electoral cycle, and in particular the electoral commission. An electoral commission that enjoys neither the confidence of the Congolese actors nor that of its partners will not be able to fulfill this role. It is only in such a context, and on the basis of a truly inclusive agreement, that the European Union can consider providing financial support to the elections. The European Union will continue to work closely with the region, the African Union and the DRC's neighbours. I have met with several of these representatives recently, and I know that they share the same concern and objectives of a democratic and peaceful transition. Finally, the role of the United Nations Security Council and Monusco will remain crucial. We encourage the Government to further engage in effective collaboration on the ground between the DRC's armed forces and Monusco. The Democratic Republic of the Congo undoubtedly has a special link with Europe. It is our history, it is our interest in the stability of the entire Great Lakes region, it is the relations between our peoples that are at stake. This country has experienced violence that cannot be forgotten. Only a return to dialogue and compromise can prevent further violence. The people of the DRC simply aspire to get involved in the future of their country. Only a true democracy can respond to this request.

These sanctions should also serve as a warning and reminder to all political actors of their responsibilities, including participation in an exit from the crisis and the prevention of violence.

We welcome the mediation of the African Union and CENCO's efforts to broaden consensus around a political transition. It is crucial that any agreement towards a transition include a reasonable timetable with specific deadlines for the realization of its various components. Alongside the political process, every effort must be made to reduce the potential for violence in the country.

Today, he seeks to impose his retention in power by constantly postponing the date of the elections. This is unacceptable, and it is not by appointing an opposition prime minister that he will legitimize his retention, as the repression is taking place every day more strongly against opponents of the regime, peaceful protests and journalists, at the cost of many human lives. Arbitrary arrests cause fear of a major political crisis. Chaos beats us in a country already weakened by systemic instability.

First, I believe that Europe supports strong institutions, not strong politicians in Africa; secondly, we must promote a consensus among political elites on the inviolability of the principle of mandate limits; and, finally, we must make better use of political dialogue within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement before these seizures do not arise.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 72, "date": "2016-12-01.json", "name": "Cécile Kashetu Kyenge (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124801", "text": " — Mr President, Kalev Mutond, deputy head of the National Intelligence Agency of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, John Numbi, former Inspector General of the Congolese Police, General Ilunga Kampete, Commander of the Republican Guard, Gabriel Amisi, commander of the army in the western region of the country, Célestin Kanyama, Chief of the Kinshasa police; these men, among many others, are responsible for confiscating democracy in the DRC, violently repressing freedom to protest, and prevented a peaceful and constitutional transition of power, which justifies targeted sanctions.

Mr President, let me tell you the emotion of meeting you one year after our last meeting in Tunis. I would like to reiterate my gratitude to you for the warm welcome that has been extended to me in your beautiful country. Mr President, at the beginning of this meeting, I would like to congratulate you two days late on your birthday, who were born on 29 November 1926. As you asked me not to say “90th birthday”, I say nine, zero! (Hearty applause) President Béji Caïd Essebsi said to me: “President, don't say 90, say nine, zero”. That is how I said, Mr President. Mr President of the Republic, you are here among your friends and partners. Here you are surrounded by all those who carry in their hearts the democratic future of Tunisia. In five years, your country's journey towards democracy has been exceptional. Your country is now asserting itself as a model of pluralism and tolerance where the rule of law, individual freedoms and equality among all are guaranteed in the constitution. At a time when populists are waving fears and rejection, Tunisia sends us this strong message. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during my official visit to Tunis and Sousse, I was able to realize the magnitude of the economic, social and security challenges facing democratic Tunisia on a daily basis. Nevertheless, I have returned with the firm conviction that your country, despite all these difficulties, has a great wealth: I am referring to these strong, young, trained forces, creative, ready to work for Tunisia's prosperous future. This is a considerable asset you can count on to carry out the major reforms expected. These reforms will restore confidence to Tunisian citizens, local investors and foreign partners, as the economic conference in your country showed yesterday. On this path, Tunisia is not alone. The international investment conference, held earlier this week in Tunis, clearly demonstrates this. Rest assured, Mr President, that the European Parliament will follow closely the commitments made by the European Union and its Member States. This year we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of bilateral cooperation that has made Europe your first trading partner, and we are proud of it. But we decided to go further. We have made a political commitment to build a privileged partnership with you because we believe that it is time to translate in a sustainable, tangible and diverse way the strategic and irreversible nature of our relations. It is no longer a matter of solidarity, but rather the affirmation of a common vision of our future. Mr President, young people on both sides of the Mediterranean have never been better trained. They share the same aspirations: to learn, travel, engage, live with dignity and thrive in their studies and work. We have a historical responsibility to meet their legitimate expectations. In this regard, I welcome the launch of the new European Union Youth Initiative, which demonstrates our commitment to support the development of talent, resources and mobility for young Tunisians and Tunisians. This is the best investment we can make for the well-being and cohesion of society as a whole. We can no longer afford to indulge in the deadly ideologies of young people who no longer have hope. Together, we can thwart the black scenarios of extremists from all sides. Together, we can demonstrate that universal values combine in the same way in Tunisia and Europe. Allow me, in this regard, to welcome the initiative you have taken in launching, from the magnificent Bardo Museum, Tunisia's declaration against terrorism, for tolerance and solidarity among peoples, cultures and religions. Rest assured of the fidelity of our commitment to Tunisia, its youth, its people and its authorities. I thank you once again, Mr. President, for your presence.

It is an honour for my country, and it is a privilege for me to address directly to parliamentarians and, through them, to the States and peoples they represent. I would therefore like, on behalf of my country and my people, to convey to Europe, the European Union, and through you, ladies and gentlemen, to your States and your peoples, a message of friendship, solidarity and trust from Tunisia. Tunisia is presenting itself to you today under a new face because our people have struggled to engage in a democratic process in our country. You know that we now have a modern constitution, a constitution for a civil status, without religious or dogmatic reference. However, we also have a Muslim majority people, and we believe that the well-known, well-applied Islam is not incompatible with democracy. It is even a promising element to take our country in this direction. So we have a constitution, a president elected by universal suffrage, we have a plural parliament with 16 parties, this is the first time in our history in 60 years, and we have a government that is softened by a very large majority in our parliament, namely 168 votes out of 217, which is unprecedented. Thus, from this point of view, Tunisia is presenting itself under a new face and with new perspectives, but, in any case, we can only work even harder for the cohesion of our people, in order to overcome the challenges before us: the challenge of terrorism, that of underdevelopment, from representation to the exterior. We are optimistic, reasonably optimistic, and we are going to work on that. I would therefore like to take this happy opportunity to pay tribute sincere to the European Parliament for its support and solidarity with Tunisia from the first few days following the historic turning point of our revolution of 14 January 2011. The numerous visits and missions of MEPs to Tunisia, as well as the adoption of resolutions on Tunisia — particularly the last one, dated 14 September 2016 — perfectly illustrate the European Parliament's strong interest in the success of the Tunisian democratic experiment. My deep appreciation also goes to the various political groups as well as to the Members of the European Parliament who took part in election observation missions in 2011 and 2014, and who have been the privileged witnesses of the new democratic learning in Tunisia. My presence here today also shows my gratitude to all the institutions of the European Union and the peoples of Europe that you represent here, for their sincere commitment to Tunisia and its democratic process. The visit to Brussels that I am undertaking today comes at a historic and highly symbolic moment for the Tunisian-European relations, which this year marks the 40th anniversary of the first cooperation agreement of 1976, crowned by the holding of meetings at the highest level between Tunisia and the European Union. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am coming here to convey a message of friendship of the Tunisian people to all the peoples of Europe you represent. Tunisia, located in the far north of northern Africa, very close to Europe, has always considered the European continent as a natural anchor area. This proximity to Europe has profoundly marked our history for 3000 years. Tunisia's fate has always been linked to that of Europe. We have suffered the influences and sometimes even vicissitudes and occupation, but Tunisia has always maintained close and harmonious ties with Europe and its peoples, and has always looked to the future rather than looking to the past. These links must form the basis on which we must build an even stronger strategic relationship between Tunisia and Europe today, in line with current challenges and challenges. The revolution of 14 January opened a new chapter in Tunisia's history. The Tunisian people have risen peacefully and spontaneously, without any ideological or religious referent, against established order and despotism. This uprising was carried by young people in search of dignity and freedom. It would not have been possible without the sacrifices of the martyrs who paid with their lives their aspiration to freedom, respect for human dignity and better living conditions. The Tunisian people dared a break. He embarked on a process of political transition and modernization that follows the reform movement initiated in the mid-19th century by precursors such as Kheireddine Pasha, and followed in the 20th century with Moncef Bey, Tahar Haddad, Habib Bourguiba and many others. Was Tunisia not one of the first, and in any case the first Arab country, to abolish slavery in 1846 and to promulgate, with the fundamental pact, the first political constitution in Islam in 1861? Then there was the constitution of 1959, a constitution which, precisely, guaranteed freedom to human beings in Tunisia. It is therefore a constitution of human rights, ahead of its time compared to other countries. It was also the first to grant a single status to women, with the promulgation of the Personal Status Code in 1956, after independence. The place of Tunisian women is an exception today in the Arab-Muslim world. We may be criticized a bit because of this in some parts of the world, but this is our choice and our pride. Reform Tunisia relied on an informed and moderate reading of religion and opposed any rigid or extremist doctrine. This Tunisian specificity today reinforces our irreversible march towards a democratic model to which all the components of political society in our country are attached. Tunisia is determined to prove to the whole world and to all those who have the phobia of Islam, that Islam is not incompatible with democracy. In January 2014, we worked towards the adoption of this modern constitution designed for a Muslim people, and which broadly incorporates the same principles as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The free and transparent elections held that same year helped to consolidate the democratic process through the establishment, inter alia, of constitutional institutions, the most recent of which is the Higher Council of the Judiciary, which guarantees the independence of the judiciary in our country. Of course, this path has not been easy, far from it. In the aftermath of the 2011 elections, the country experienced a serious political and identity crisis, which could have created a profound schism within Tunisian society and undercut the democratic process. But the commitment of Tunisians to their societal model, as it has been shaped over our history, and the refusal of a new authoritarianism in the name of religion, have made it possible to put the democratic transition back on track. Moreover, the initiative I took in 2012 by creating a party bringing together different political sensitivities resolutely oriented towards modernity, is in line with this spirit. Divergences and divisions within the political class have been overcome thanks to a singular Tunisian approach based on dialogue, compromise and consensus as well as the involvement of forces lively of this country. This approach has been recognized by the international community and has earned an international distinction at the National Dialogue Quartet, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the political progress made in the field of human rights and democracy, Tunisia must respond to socio-economic and security challenges. As you know, Tunisia is the only country in the southern neighbourhood that has embarked on a profound political and economic transformation, and at the same time to fight terrorism relentlessly. The democratic transition has a cost, and it is felt in the sectors of socio-economic activity. This cost has led, in particular, to a sharp deterioration of macroeconomic indicators. Whereas, in the previous decade, Tunisia had an average annual growth of 5%, it no longer exceeds 1.5%. Finally, to enable our economy to regain its strength and speed up the pace of reforms, I took the initiative, as you indicated earlier, Mr President, to establish a government of national unity headed by competent young people, with strong female participation. The most important positions currently in Tunisia are occupied by women. This government, supported by major political parties and national organizations, is working to implement the major reforms needed to build a sustainable and inclusive growth model. Moreover, the five-year development plan 2016-2020 is largely part of this policy. The recent adoption of the Investment Code confirms our commitment to provide the Tunisian economy with a framework conducive to domestic and foreign investment. I am delighted that the “Tunisia 2020” conference that just ended yesterday has repositioned Tunisia on the international investment map. I would particularly like to express my appreciation to our European partners, who have contributed to the success of this major economic event. The contracts signed and the commitments made on this occasion demonstrate renewed confidence in Tunisia and its economic potential. Tunisia has undeniable assets capable of enabling it to emerge from this difficult economic crisis. Nevertheless, the economic transition remains fragile and subject to considerable challenges. The Tunisian exception must be supported more, just as other countries in their time have been supported in their democratic process. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Tunisia has always maintained strong and close ties with the European Union. As the first country to conclude an association agreement with the European Union in July 1995, Tunisia made its rapprochement with the Union a constant foreign policy and strategic choice. Our relations have seen a new impetus since 2011, which was realized in 2013 through a privileged partnership, which is supposed to allow for even closer rapprochement between Tunisia and the European Union, with which it now shares the same democratic values. It is therefore quite naturally that Tunisia considers the European Union, its first partner, as its main support during this delicate phase. In this regard, we welcome the important support of the European Union for the success of the early stages of the transition in Tunisia. We particularly welcome the new measures announced recently in the joint communication by the High Representative of the Union and Vice-President of the European Commission, to further strengthen this support in the coming years. However, we believe, and I apologize for saying, that traditional instruments of cooperation remain insufficient to accompany the remarkable transformations undertaken in our country. Our country, which is experiencing an unprecedented experience in its region, is entitled to aspire to differentiated treatment on the part of its first partner. In this regard, we appreciate the fact that the European Parliament has become aware of the magnitude of the support expected to consolidate the success of this experiment by proposing, in its recent resolution, meaningful support measures for Tunisia comparable to the establishment of a Marshall Plan and the conversion of debt into plans for the investments. We hope that this initiative will be echoed favourably with the other European institutions and the Member States for the mobilization of consistent support that is up to the challenges and challenges facing our country. Such support is now essential to accompany Tunisia and help it take this crucial step in its history. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our region is shaken by major crises and is being crossed by doubt and uncertainty. In this context, some are tempted by retreat, refusal of the other and violence. Security and migration issues are constant concerns and are strategic issues that require intensification of dialogue and enhanced cooperation to provide common answers. In Tunisia, we are building our democracy in a tormented regional context because of the situation in a neighbouring country, Libya, and security threats linked to border arms trafficking and attempts to infiltrate terrorist elements. Tunisia is targeted by terrorists because its democratic and sociocultural model is at the antipodes of their obscurantist vision. We are determined to face this scourge that strikes blindly, irrespective of race or religion. Tunisia is at the forefront of the fight against terrorism and deserves full support in its efforts. Our success in this fight will also contribute to the security of Europe. On my initiative, on 18 November, Tunisia adopted a manifesto entitled “Tunis Declaration against Terrorism and for Tolerance and Solidarity among Peoples, Cultures and Religions”. We announced the adoption of this text on the occasion of the inauguration at the Bardo Museum of an exhibition entitled “Shared Holy Places”, which illustrates the common Mediterranean spiritual experience. In opening this exhibition in the presence of families of victims of terrorist acts, I also wanted to recall that Tunisia is an ancestral land of tolerance, hospitality and cultural and religious plurality. It is therefore essential today to further promote the values of dialogue and tolerance and to place the human dimension at the heart of our relations. Our belonging to the common Mediterranean area requires us to remind the world of the virtues of openness and dialogue. By its vocation, its ancient history and its geography, our common sea must restore taste to the blending of cultures and civilizations and become once again the link between spaces and people, and not a boundary that separates them. This hope must be brought first and foremost by young people on both sides. In this way, we must ensure that youth are a priority in our future cooperation. In this regard, we welcome the cooperation initiatives put in place by the European Union in the field of youth, higher education and scientific research. In conclusion, I would like to stress that we prefer to speak of a Tunisian exception rather than a Tunisian model. Our democratic experience, which has gone through important milestones, is still fragile. This experience needs more than ever strong support from European partners because the success of Tunisian democracy is not only in the interest of Tunisia, but also in the interests of Europe. A strong and prosperous democratic Tunisia will help stabilize the EU's southern neighbourhood. This is the message of trust and friendship I wanted to convey here to the European Parliament. Finally, I would like to reiterate my warmest thanks to the European Parliament for giving me the opportunity to address its honourable Members and, through them, to the friendly peoples they represent and whom I invite many to come to visit free and democratic Tunisia because the security situation there is currently very similar to that of Europe. ***", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 83, "date": "2016-12-01.json", "name": "Ana Gomes (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "28306", "text": "   – Mr President, colleagues must have seen a horrendous leaflet that has been dropped in Aleppo, saying that people should run away or be bombed because the world has forgotten them.

Another 500m euros are earmarked for the Youth Employment Initiative. I decided not to support the proposal because there were no reserves available on a number of statutes, no redistribution from wasteful budget lines to priority areas, and because this budget could deepen the gap between commitments and payments.

One such measure must be one that will ensure compensation to farmers for losses incurred due to the Russian embargo, which should continue to be implemented by means outside those intended for agriculture. Secondly, it is also necessary to provide sufficient funds to compensate for the damage caused by climate change. Sprompt assistance in cases of disasters is necessarily required.

However, the rapporteur is now calling for the directive to be revised or to list the shortcomings of the existing directive. For example, the Directive does not deal with civil liability for claims of third parties (personal injury and property damage, purely economic losses). In addition, the existing Directive does not adequately regulate criminal liability (lack of definitions of offences, no minimum sanctions for infringements of offshore safety rules). The rapporteur therefore calls for comprehensive harmonisation in the field of offshore activities, as is already the case in the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law.

The rapporteur is addressing possible improvements in the application of the European order for payment procedure (updating of forms, accruing interest on the main requirement, use of foreign languages, deletion of exemptions from the scope, digitisation).

The resolution stated that the European order for payment procedure is essentially successful and no major changes are needed at the moment. However, I agree that the most problematic, when it is applied, is the ignorance of EU citizens of its existence and how it can facilitate and accelerate the cross-border application of claims. That is why I believe that it is really necessary to raise awareness of this instrument, not only among citizens but also among Member States' institutions, and to ensure duly informed court officials so that they can work with the European order for payment. It is also necessary to ensure that all standardised forms are regularly updated and that there is no problem with the acceptance of forms in a language other than that of the country. Last but not least, it is necessary to systematically require that the Commission's information and reports in this area be submitted to the European Parliament in a timely manner, unlike the last report presented by the Commission only with a two-year delay.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 3461, "date": "2016-12-01.json", "name": "Željana Zovko (PPE)", "mepid": "185341", "text": "written. - I support the assessment of the application of Regulation (EC) 1896/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council to create a European order for payment.
