We were reminded once again that in the digital world our personal data can be misused, abused and used against us. We were reminded again that cybersecurity and disinformation are a serious threat for free and democratic elections and that the digital arms race is not a thing of the future. It is happening right here and right now.  It was a clear warning sign that the election periods are particularly prone to disinformation and manipulation by private and foreign interests and that the European elections are not immune to this threat. We must strengthen our joint response to dangers to our democracy. The Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal was not an isolated case as, since then, we have learned of new data breaches. Every such new case confirms the importance and the urgency of acting. Every such case confirms that the new EU data protection rules are not a privilege. They are a necessity, as you point out in the draft resolution. The Commission shares many of your concerns concerning data protection and misuse of the research argument, and calls for algorithmic accountability. We also support wholeheartedly the call for the prompt adoption of the European political parties regulation by the co—legislators. We also take note of some new ideas for future regulatory action and electoral safeguards. The Commission has already been working to ensure fair and resilient elections or to deal with disinformation, which covers some of Parliament’s ideas.  While we should not shy away from reinforcing our regulations where necessary, Europe is better equipped now than ever before with the powerful tools provided by the new data protection law, which were not in place at the time of the Cambridge Analytica breaches. It is important to enforce the existing rules at their full capacity.  I am in regular contact with the Chair of the European Data Protection Board and the Chair of the UK Data Protection Authority, who is leading the investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. We fully support the coordinated response of the EU data protection authorities.  I have also raised the US investigation into the matter with the Chair of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Mr Simons, who was in Brussels last week for the second annual review of the Privacy Shield. He reassured me that this investigation is a key priority for the FTC and that it is ongoing. We have to wait for the final outcome of the investigation, but we will watch this very closely and stay in contact with the FTC. But we also need to look beyond the case itself because it sent shock waves through the core of our democratic system. Our current election rules, practices and habits stem from our non—digital past. Campaign spending limits, strict rules on political advertising, including transparency on who is campaigning and who paid for it, the silence period, the role of the media in disinformation – all the offline rules – must be enforced online in the digital world. One thing is clear: the upcoming elections will not be business as usual and we cannot treat them as if they were. We cannot be naive and we have very little time to act. The Commission therefore encourages Member States to establish and support a national elections network. The idea is that such a network would be able to quickly detect potential threats and swiftly enforce existing rules, including available financial sanctions. We have also stepped up our game against cyber—threats and to address disinformation. My colleague, Commissioner King, will tell you more about this in the concluding remarks, but I just want to stress that the Commission is not looking idly at those new developments. We have brought in a package of measures to strengthen resilience against classical cybersecurity threats, like hacking in 2017. On disinformation, the Commission proposed a package of measures in the Communication on tackling online disinformation, based around transparency, traceability and accountability. We asked major IT platforms to commit to an EU-wide Code of Practice on Disinformation, which was presented last month. But we also have to recognise the fact that many companies, including Facebook, are trying to fix the mistakes they made and support us in the effort to make elections fairer and more transparent. It goes without saying that the pressure you in this Chamber put on them brings positive results. I am counting on cross-party support for this package because it is ideologically neutral. The truth is that this is not, as such, about politicians. This is about the right of European people to make their choice as freely as possible, free from illegal manipulation, free from disinformation and free from foreign interference. Parliament’s support for this package is crucial and your resolution is a great opportunity to send a clear message to the EU governments, but also to other relevant stakeholders. The European elections take place very soon. If we want to be prepared, we have to act now and we have to act fast. I am encouraged by last week’s European Council, which welcomed the Commission proposals, in the Communication called ‘Securing free and fair European elections’, on election cooperation networks, online transparency, protection against cybersecurity incidents, unlawful data manipulation, fighting disinformation campaigns and tightening the rules on European political party funding. It also called for a rapid examination and operational follow-up by the competent authorities. I therefore hope that together we can advance rapidly and shield ourselves better against manipulation, disinformation and abuse, also in light of the upcoming elections.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Paulo Rangel", "mepid": "96903", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt today that interference through social networks (we are looking at Facebook here, but also others), manipulation from a political point of view and from a more general point of view are a danger, a risk, a threat. The Cambridge Analytica case has clearly shown that it is possible to interfere in an electoral process. We are not only concerned with the electoral issue; of course, as a political chamber, that concerns us, but the use of citizens' data in matters other than just political matters is also reprehensible, is a risk and is a danger. And so, on the basis of this case that we know, based on the strong suspicions that we have in the case of the United States, based, for example, on what is happening now in Brazil, where the suspicions of fake news and manipulation of algorithms to campaign are multiplied from part to part, it is essential that we take measures, measures for the European elections because these are urgent , but measures that are medium and long-term for all electoral processes. As I say, for us, it is not just the electoral issue that is at stake, it is a matter of general citizenship for all matters. This means that it will not only be interference or legislation in this case, but by understanding how we can look at the democratic society of the future, knowing that social networks have to play a role there and that we, as well as have been able to regulate the role of the media in the past society, will be able to regulate the role of the new world of social networks in a modern democratic society. The challenge before us is a constitutional challenge far more ambitious than just this to prevent interference at the moment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Udo Bullmann", "mepid": "4267", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, the Cambridge Analytica scandal is the biggest manipulation of the democratic process so far in the digital age. This is not an isolated incident, Cambridge Analytica is the latest in a long series. A wave of massive data breaches has been rolling across Europe – there's been Yahoo, eBay, Uber and Facebook, to name just a few. In the first half of 2018 alone, 2.2 billion people were affected by data breaches. A study from Oxford University, in cooperation with Lund University has shown that in Sweden, in the Swedish election, about 30% of online communication was fake news, and that a whole lot of all that fake news was imported from foreign countries. That means, today, we are talking about trust in the election. We are talking about our free ability to vote. We are talking about political preferences being manipulated. We are talking about the selection of political leadership. We are talking about freedom and democracy. According to the NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, 80% of disinformation comes from Russia. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. This cannot continue! Our democracy is a democracy of citizens and not of those who manipulate data or buy data. If you have ten likes from someone, then you can describe them as well as a work colleague. With 70 likes you know more than the roommate, with 150 likes more than the family member and with 300 likes as much as the respective spouse. This means that we are in danger of losing personal sovereignty, we are in danger of losing more democratic sovereignty. The people's right to self-determination at the cradle of any democratic movement is in jeopardy. And we have to say that the next European elections will determine whether we win this battle for freedom and democracy, or whether we lose it. We have started with the General Data Protection Regulation. That was the right move. But we need to go further – in legislation, in the reform of our national electoral laws, and in the protection of privacy in the area of electronic data security. I would like to thank the Commissioner for having this discussion with us. It's five minutes to twelve. And I would like to thank – an unusual step – our excellent photographers for accompanying us this morning. If I may ask you to take a picture of the Council bench this morning, that would also be a very impressive picture. Where is the Austrian Presidency in such a discussion? If you are blocking ePrivacy behind the scenes, if you are making sure that we do not make any progress on legislation and that we are not even in this Chamber this morning? What is the Council's basic position when it comes to democracy and freedom? I cannot accept that, and that is not how we can work. I believe, Mr President, that we should make a statement to the Presidency on how serious the debate is now in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "23768", "text": "  Thank you very much, Mr Bullmann.

With more of our lives taking place online and increasing consumer choice, people can, and do, get up and leave when that trust is damaged. What happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica was an unacceptable abuse on a vast scale. Everyone can agree that this must not happen again, and I have been supportive of the ongoing investigations. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which currently handles 30% of all European data protection board cases, is doing a thorough job of investigating. It has already issued a fine to Facebook. Cambridge Analytica is no more. It is clear that Facebook does not walk away from this scandal unscathed. Facebook knows it will need to rebuild its reputation in the eyes of its users, and as politicians it’s not our role to dictate exactly how they do that. Nor is it our role to tell users how they should react. Most Europeans have not given up their Facebook account. Clear legal limits and strict conditions on political profiling have been imposed by the new GDPR rules. Therefore, we should allow the GDPR time to bed in before we throw the baby out with the bathwater and start to chuck more legislation at the problem. And also let’s try not to fool ourselves that Facebook manipulation was responsible for Brexit or Trump. People would have voted for them regardless of Facebook. It was already prevalent in our society. The GDPR is not perfect, but at the speed at which technology moves and innovation moves, any new laws in this area need to keep up with the modern world. We should focus on addressing this, rather than trying to point-score by taking dangerous steps to suspend the privacy shield which is proposed in the resolution we will vote on later. This would deny our citizens the protections that it offers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Sophia in 't Veld", "mepid": "28266", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, although I might not agree with everything Mr Dalton says, I agree with one thing: that we shouldn’t forget in this whole debate that the biggest threat to democracy is still offline and not online, in populist movements, governments, even in the European Union, who are trying to undermine democracy and the rule of law, and we should speak out.  On the GDPR, differently to Mr Dalton, I think that we should go faster. First of all, GDPR is the best privacy law in the world, but if it’s not being implemented properly then it’s useless. We should be looking at the means that the data protection authorities have in order to tackle the challenges on the table. For example, the Dutch Data Protection Authority has about 150 staff. They cannot fight Facebook. They don’t have the same means.  Secondly, you say that the investigations are advancing. But are they advancing fast enough? You say Facebook is trying to fix its mistakes. I don’t know, I’m not terribly convinced myself, to be honest, because they may have fixed some mistakes because they had to, but they’re making new ones in the meantime – they’re not mistakes, they’re actually deliberately trying to circumvent the law. I hear that now Whatsapp is being used increasingly to spread all sorts of nonsense online.  That also brings me to new legislation. Contrary to Mr Dalton, I do believe that we need further legislation in the form of e-privacy, which is indeed being blocked by the Council, but the right-wing parties in this House have also voted against it. I really don’t understand how you can stand here and say ‘I’m terribly worried about what’s happening to our democracy’ and at the same time try to water down e-privacy. How can you do that? It’s hypocrisy.  (Applause) I think we also need to recognise that, in our very legitimate aim to strengthen security, we have very often very rapidly passed legislation that undermines the privacy and the legal protection of our citizens, and risks undermining the rule of law and democracy as well. We should have a proper evaluation before coming up with, yet again, new instruments for massive the collection and processing of personal data.  Finally, on a fake news and disinformation. I think we need a proper legal definition of fake news. What’s fake news? I mean I may think that one of my colleagues in this House is spreading fake news, and they probably think that I am. Where do you draw the line between a political view and fake news? We need a proper legal definition before we take any measures against fake news, because otherwise it becomes arbitrary and then we are undermining our democracy for real.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I hope that Mark Zuckerberg is actually listening to the debate today so that he will understand that we are not letting him off the hook and that we are not happy with just some minor tweaks to the privacy settings of Facebook. The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal is not simply a privacy scandal. It’s a political scandal. It is a threat to our democracies. Facebook is illegally allowing some people to use the data for manipulating voters with psychological profiling, with fake news and with advertising profiling that makes it totally impossible to understand who is actually seeing what – the so-called ‘dark ads’. The consequences are dramatic. This can even lead to voter manipulation, and there is a lot of evidence that shows that this is exactly what happened. Facebook is a very powerful platform with huge influence on our private lives, but also on our political life. If we want to safeguard our democracy, we need clear and strict rules for such online platforms. Transparency is good, but it is just not enough. We cannot leave it to companies like Facebook to decide who gets to see what political content just before the elections. We need to make sure that all voters have access to the same information, and we need to ban micro-targeting of political advertising.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I think that we as a Parliament have done our job so far. We have raised the case of Cambridge Analytica, we have had hearings on which Facebook has, as expected, sent PR staff. Yes, and we have also endured the autocratic behaviour of the President of the European Parliament, Mr Tajani, whose so-called hearing has made us a kind of mockery of the world. But good – we have a resolution, we have positioning, and we also have a sensible statement from the Commissioner. Now we want to have consequences, because it is about Facebook's business practices, which allow it to use data on a large scale for so-called research purposes – but actually to exploit it for political purposes, to abuse it.  Cambridge Analytica was not only a violation of data protection law, but also, in a sense, a staff-abuse operation.  All you hear from Facebook is a verbal apology with an angelic look, in a way, with no guarantee that something like this can't happen again and that something will change in the business model. I want to make one thing very clear: when data is manipulated for political advertising purposes, elections are manipulated. When elections are rigged, it throws us back into a pre-democratic era and elections become a farce, and then, frankly, we can also vote here on socialist lists of unity. That is why action must be taken. There must be regulations for election advertising, as in the offline area. We need transparency, we need disclosure of funding; what we don't need is targeted advertising. This must be prohibited, at least during election periods, and otherwise subject to strict regulations.  Apart from the fact that I am now seriously disturbed by Facebook's market power, I would like to say one more thing: if we lose the race in the Cambridge Analytica case, then we can also bury the citizens' freedoms.

The European Commission protects Facebook, but not the Jewish community. Mr President, for many people, Facebook is the Internet, for social contacts, but also for the news. That news is filtered through Facebook. Only neat – left-wing I assume – opinions come through. Facebook protects its premise, not the free press.  Mr President, the European Commission has reached an agreement with Facebook with a view to the upcoming elections. According to the Commission, stories of fake news and voter influence justify the need to approve or remove opinions from the Internet.

As my colleague, Commissioner Jourová, underlined, the Cambridge Analytica case has thrust into the spotlight an array of threats to our elections: hacks, leaks, fake news, as well as the misuse of personal data, classical cyber—attacks that target our voting systems and cyber—enabled manipulation of voting behaviour. To tackle the classic cybersecurity threats, the Commission brought forward a package of measures in September last year to build greater cyber-resilience, to protect systems and data and to strengthen deterrence against those who would seek to attack us. To tackle the challenge of cyber-manipulation, in April this year, the Commission proposed a package of measures in our communication on tackling online disinformation, based around transparency, traceability and accountability. This set out our clear definition of disinformation. It sent a clear and strong message to all of the internet platforms – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others – who we strongly believe have a real responsibility to take action. We asked them to commit to an EU-wide Code of Practice on Disinformation, presented in fact last month. We set out clear objectives for this code and called for measurable results in a number of areas, not asking the platforms, or indeed public authorities, to judge whether something is true or false, right or wrong, but to shine a light on the provenance of the information that we are seeing. I am encouraged that your resolution, as Claude Moraes underlined, identifies the need for urgent action in a number of these areas. We ask the platforms to restrict targeting options for political advertising, to ensure greater transparency around sponsored content, to step up their efforts to identify and delete fake accounts, and to establish clear rules around bots. There should also be greater clarity around algorithms and information on how they prioritise the content that is on display. This should be combined with tools enabling users more easily to discover content and access new sources representing alternative points of view, as well as to be able to report disinformation. We want to see the code implemented effectively. We’ve said we’ll analyse first results by the end of this year. We hope we can see sufficient progress by working on a voluntary basis, but we’ve been clear: we reserve the right to consider our options again if we do not make the progress that we need to see. As mentioned by Commissioner Jourová earlier, last month President Juncker presented a set of measures specifically on election security, asking Member States to set up a national election cooperation network of all of the relevant authorities and to appoint a contact point to participate in a European-level election cooperation network. As part of this, the Commission will work closely with, and support, data protection authorities to make sure that all data breaches are effectively investigated. Last week, we convened a high-level meeting which brought together, for the first time, public and private actors from the Member States in order to take stock of progress and to identify and share best practices for countering the threats to our democratic processes and our democratic values. This event highlighted again the key importance of engagement, both by the public authorities, but also by the key private-sector actors. With the European elections and numerous national elections on the horizon, it is imperative that we see sufficient commitment from the big online platforms. The Commission very much welcomes your strong engagement on this urgent range of issues. Awareness is the first line of defence, but, as you set out in your resolution, we need to go further. We have a strong shared interest in protecting our democratic institutions, our democratic processes and our elections. The Commission is committed to working with you, with Member States and with the private sector to secure the foundations of our democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 47, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "23768", "text": "  You will allow such a small personal observation.

However, with this decision, we are only in the process of detecting – even more importantly – and taking the first defensive step, knowing that the cambridge analytica case is just the tip of the iceberg, as there are many other businesses in the world that use personal data management algorithms to manipulate and sell information.  I consider the dissemination of 'fake news' organised by individual political forces and even states, political incitement campaigns and manipulation to influence the election results to be particularly dangerous for the democratic functioning of the EU and its Member States. In view of the forthcoming important elections in several countries of Europe, in particular the EP elections in May, I think it is important that our current resolution has a concrete afterlife, and that the Governments of the Member States, too, take decisive measures and targeted legislation to stop this modern attack.

I believe that the phenomenon is all the more important as it can lead to the manipulation of citizens, especially during the electoral process, or it can influence consumers in such a way as to lead to distortion of the market and fair competition. The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal has made it very clear that we must make significant efforts to restore the confidence of our citizens in the democratic process and ensure an adequate level of transparency. In 2019, in Romania we will have two rounds of elections. In this context, the illegal collection of users' personal data is one of the biggest challenges we face in the age of digital technology worldwide.

It is clear to anyone that the possession of the data of hundreds of millions of people - here including not only personal identification data, but also data on political preferences, preferences for certain products and services or other sensitive data, but also access to private discussions - represents a huge opportunity for the big companies that operate these social media platforms.

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the debate on the future of the European Union. The Union has been marked over time, but especially in the last decade, by multiple challenges that have tested our cohesion and unity, from the financial and economic crisis, the migration crisis, terrorist attacks, to the rise of populist movements. It was a decade in which the Union had to \"learn to adapt on the go\". Against the background of these challenges, the Union was marked by the search for a common vision, defined by the need for a 'wise' balance between the specific realities of each Member State and the desire to strengthen together a genuine Union, a future-oriented Union. The main positive finding of this period is that there is one element that unites us: European identity based on common principles, values and interests. And these common values must always be rediscovered, revalued and valued, because the universality of values lies precisely in their regenerative character. We are going through a new chapter in the development and consolidation of the European project, in which we need to develop a new vision for the future of the Union. From this perspective, I strongly advocate unity, cohesion, solidarity and the common European path in efforts to strengthen the European project. The central key to our efforts must remain \"unity.\" For Romania, this principle is the very essence of the European project, which has given it the ability to face the multiple challenges that the Union has faced to date. The European Union is an evolutionary project. The new realities, both at Member State and global level, call for the development and consolidation of the European project and, in no way, a question of the fundamental principles on which the European project was built. A strong Union must not be achieved at the expense of unity. We need an inclusive Union, which leaves no state or european citizen behind. From this point of view, ideas such as a multi-speed Europe or a Union of concentric circles cannot be a solution, in so far as we want to maintain the unitary and indivisible character of the European Union, which gives it value and credibility in its relationship with the rest of the world. President Juncker said last year that Europe must find its breath, breathe with both lungs, the western and the eastern. I hope that our future together will also show us that Europe has only one heart. A heart that beats through all of us, that unites us, from east to west and from north to south, that makes our citizens naturally identify and define themselves as Europeans. We must assume this common ideal and, if necessary, adapt and recalibrate the tools by which we can achieve it. I am confident that the new stage in which the European Union will enter from 2019 and which Romania, as the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, will prepare together with the other Member States and the European institutions, will be a fruitful one. I am confident that the Sibiu Summit of 9 May 2019 will be a milestone in the projection for the future of a stronger, more united, more cohesive and more democratic Union. It is up to our power, wisdom and will - Member States, European institutions and European citizens - for this objective to become a reality. Ladies and gentlemen, the Sibiu Summit is an important moment to strengthen the foundation of this future. A common future, a democratic future, an optimistic future. The future of the European Union can only be edifyed with the direct and active participation and involvement of European citizens. I want Sibiu to be a time of awareness for European citizens. Citizens want concrete measures and tangible results. They want positive news about peace, security and prosperity. Citizens must also see that we are working to protect and strengthen the union's major symbols: the euro, the internal market, the Schengen area and freedom of movement. At the same time, our citizens need more cohesion. And cohesion is not only the ambition of the new Member States, which have a lower level of economic convergence, but it is a necessity for older members of the Union. Cohesion is unity, it is the expression of joint, concerted and coordinated action at Union level. We must return to the essence of the principle of cohesion, as reflected in the Union Treaties - the centripetal force of a community of vision and action, generating added value for the whole Union. The European Union is today in a moment of economic recovery. This would not have been possible in the absence of a common vision and action in the creation and consolidation of an economic and monetary union. Economic security is as important as border security, and the union's prosperity depends on our ability to ensure a strong economic and monetary union capable of meeting citizens' expectations, but also of meeting new challenges. In order to achieve this objective, we need comprehensive measures and decisions to ensure the participation of all Member States in joint efforts to achieve a stronger, more stable and more competitive euro area. For Romania, joining the euro area as soon as possible, when all the conditions are met, is a fundamental national objective. This year we are celebrating 25 years of the internal market. We have come a long way in terms of the freedoms and opportunities to travel, study and work within the European Union for our citizens. We cannot imagine the European Union without the single market and its four fundamental freedoms, the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. We need a functioning, competitive and inclusive internal market. An internal market in which citizens feel its benefits in their daily lives. At the same time, Europe is and must remain an international leader in multiple areas, particularly in terms of the technological and digital revolution. Europe has the ability and strength to transform itself and be a leader in connectivity. Growth and stability, competitiveness, security and improving the quality of life of all Europeans depend on how ambitious and determined Europe is in terms of digitalisation and research and innovation. At the same time, we must ensure that our workforce is better adapted to the needs, requirements and developments of the internal market, in order to ensure that social progress and competitiveness go hand in hand. We must also be aware that the digital transformation of society cannot be achieved without a massive investment in education and the new skills needed. All citizens - from any region and any social group - must be engaged in these developments. This must be our commitment, to those who lead Europe, and in this diversity and scope will lie the strength of our continent in the global competition to come. We are also talking about a future in which the Union will regain its own citizens by strengthening their sense of security here at home inside the Union. The challenges of migration and security are issues of maximum interest to all of us. We must act so that the European project rebuilds the safety of citizens, we must pay greater attention to the fight against terrorism and radicalisation. We need to act in such a way as to become more proactive and increase the Union's capacity to prevent. Responding to crises with contextual measures is not an effective way and, in this key, we need sustainable solutions. The European Union must remain an area of free movement, where all our citizens can move freely and work anywhere in the Community area, where young people can travel, study, thus fully benefiting from one of the most visible and ambitious projects of European construction - the Schengen area. For Romania, accession to the Schengen area is an important objective. This will make a significant contribution to strengthening security for the entire free movement area of the Union. The corollary of a safe and strong Union should be a enlarged Union, because size confers power - a very true and relevant notion in a highly competitive global context. And the Union's enlargement policy has clearly demonstrated its value through successive waves of welcoming new members, contributing, in an undeniable manner, to the prosperity and security of the continent. The enlargement of the Union must not only remain a wish for future generations, but continue sit a real necessity, in which candidate states and potential candidates must anchor their efforts to continue reforms and to take genuine and consistent ownership of European values and principles. Honourable MEPs, we cannot really be globally relevant if we fail to significantly influence the environment in our neighbourhood. Keeping the states in the Southern and Eastern Neighbourhood firmly anchored in European values and maintaining their commitment to irreversible structural reforms also depend on our ability to fulfil our commitments in relation to them. Last but not least, we are also talking about a future in which the Union will have a leading role on the international stage, a future in which Member States will support, on the basis of shared interests and mutual solidarity, the union's affirmation as a global actor, with a decisive contribution to the promotion of the rules-based multilateral system. The implementation of the European Union's Global Strategy has already facilitated important developments both in the area of security and defence and in strengthening links between the Union's internal and external policies. It is our responsibility to ensure that, in the years to come, the Union will have the tools to respond to new challenges. Continuing joint security and defence initiatives under conditions that ensure close cooperation and avoidance of parallelisms with NATO, strengthening the resilience of the Union and its partners, improving strategic communication are objectives that require increased attention and constant action. The consistency of the Union's policy in its neighbourhood, the maintenance of the strong transatlantic partnership, the honouring of commitments - from the continuation of enlargement policy within the agreed parameters, to the strengthening of the institutional relationship with the UN and the firm support of its multilateralism and virtues - are all areas where the Union will be called upon to demonstrate that it can act effectively. Distinguished Members of the European Parliament 11 years ago, when Romania joined the great European family, I felt particularly proud, as a Romanian, that I was living this important moment for my country. Next year, when Romania takes over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first time, the Sibiu Summit will be a turning point for our European family. It is our duty, it is our responsibility to shape the future of Europe. Together with all Romanians, I feel proud as a Romanian citizen and also as a European citizen. Because national pride or European pride are not eroded concepts or parallel realities. It is an assumed state that sustains and gives strength and content to this identity. Because Europe is part of our fiber. A Europe that sums up our diversity. A Europe built on the concept of unity in diversity. That's why Europe is Romania and Romania is Europe. 2018 is the year of the Centenary of Modern Romania, which means for us not so much retrospective-historical analyses, but, above all, projections of the future. In these 100 years, I have learned some important lessons, going through unfortunate experiences and periods. And the lesson of democracy is one of the most important. That is why we appreciate all the more the values of the European family.  For this reason, Romania is a country deeply attached to the European project. We have a vibrant and dynamic, ever-evolving society. We are a young democracy, which has the resources to improve itself. Romanians are actively connected to civic values. They proved it as clearly as possible and made their voices heard when it was necessary to defend the rule of law and democracy. (Strong applause) The Romanians have the will and the strength to go on the European path they have taken. It is the ambition to overcome any obstacle in order to remain strongly anchored in the great European family of which we are fundamentally a part. The younger generation believes in Europe and engages in debates about our future in a positive and, above all, optimistic manner. Our optimism about the future of Europe is also feeding from the enthusiasm of these remarkable young people. At the same time, their enthusiasm makes us particularly responsible. The advantage of this wave of enthusiasm coming from Romania comes primarily from its strength to inspire and reawaken the reflex of the defence of democracy, which is not a given, but implies a continuous responsibility to care for, defend and promote it. Romania is now a dynamic and forward-looking country that has quickly embraced and capitalized on new technological trends and digital services. One of the Romanian companies has been a world leader in defence and cybersecurity solutions for several years. On the other hand, a company initiated by two young engineers became, this spring, the first Romanian \"unicorn\". In just six months, the company tripled its value to a valuation of 3 billion euros, becoming one of the world leaders in software, automation and artificial intelligence robots. All over Romania, from Iaşi to Timişoara, from Cluj to Bucharest, from Craiova and Constanta, thousands of talented Romanian engineers - women and men - are working to advance digital technologies, be they connected machines and intelligent transport systems, 5G telecommunications and the Internet of Things, research and innovation in blockchain, space technologies or digital agriculture. The data economy is the future, and the Romanian IT&amp;C and creative sectors have one of the highest shares of national GDP across the Union. It must therefore not be grudged by anyone that Romania wants and has the capacity to contribute to strengthening the Union's global role in this area. Romania actively supports a Union that invests in the safety of its citizens. European unity is essential when we talk about strengthening the internal security of the Union. For Romania, as a Member State managing one of the European Union's largest external borders, security is a priority area, where we have already demonstrated that we are performing in all respects. We are able, today, to be a security provider, to the highest standards, for the whole Union, as we already do within NATO. As a Member State of the Union, we will attach particular importance to the continuation of measures aimed at reducing the fragmentation of the European Security Area. We have a duty to protect all citizens, whether they are in the Schengen states or not. This is only possible through the full application of state-of-the-art security instruments by all Member States at the Union's external border. Distinguished members of the European Parliament, the European Union has built itself on a desire that is as humane and profound as possible, that of peace on the European continent. This internal peace - with all its ingredients: cooperation between Member States, the principle of the rule of law, fundamental rights and freedoms, diversity, prosperity, social standards, work - has become an extremely valuable export asset. The time has come to return with this model inward and show our citizens what we have managed to create together. Let us see how we protect peace together and how the need for peace translates today to the citizen's interests. I always have in mind the extremely current words of Jean Monnet. Quote: \"... il n'y a pas pour les powders d'Europe d'aumen que dans l'union» I urge you to keep unity as a watchword of the future. But a unity that will not come by itself. A unity that we must constantly protect and strengthen, while caring for the diversity so characteristic of European culture. Thank.

Mr President of the Republic, dear Klaus, Mr President of the European Parliament, it is a great honour for Mrs Creu, and for myself, to have been able to listen to you, who know you and love you. This is a great moment for the European Parliament, because it is the first time, I believe, that a Romanian President-in-Office has spoken, on the eve of the presidency of his country - the first Romanian Presidency - before the representatives of the European people.  Dragi români, I'm not fluent in Romanian but I did understand. My imperfect Romanian means \"my dear Romanians\" because they are watching us and looking at us. It is also a moment of great emotion for me, since I have a long history with Romania and with its President exercise. It is first of all personal, between the two of us, since we have known each other for centuries. The Romanian President was mayor of Sibiu Hermannstadt, and there is an old story between Hermannstadt and Luxembourg. Because contrary to what German historians claim, those who populated Transylvania were not the Saxons but the Luxembourgers. This makes it so that we can talk to each other in an approximate Luxembourgish; Finally, there is a union between us that makes ancient history last in our times and for decades and centuries before us. There are too few Romanians in this room. In December 1997, I chaired the European Council in Luxembourg under the Luxembourg Presidency, and it was then that we opened the doors widely for the countries that were then called 'candidate countries', including Romania. And, under another Luxembourg Presidency, in April 2005, I was able to sign on behalf of the European Union the Treaty on Romania's accession to the European Union. These were unforgettable moments for me, because on that day the reconciliation between European history and geography was definitely achieved and for me Romania is therefore not a neutral country, but a country to which I had my deepest feelings, the few qualities of heart that I can have, and therefore yes, welcome to Parliament and welcome back to Europe Mr President. I think of the Romanian people, whom I like because, through their authorities, they have covered me with distinctions and honours to which I have been sensitive, whereas as a rule, they say that we are not sensitive to these kinds of decorations and honours. I am thinking of the Romanian people who, from the beginning, have been able to integrate into the sphere of European solidarity and complicity as if Romania had been a founding Member State. And so, yes, Romania today and for a long time - even before its accession to the European Union - has been and has become a provider of stability and not a consumer of stability in a region tormented, difficult, dramatically tested, through its history, down to the blood, and so yes, without Romania, the European Union would not be complete. (Applause) Romania, from the first day of its accession, has been at the head of European integration. I know that the President does not like the Europe of concentric circles, an avant-garde Europe and a Europe that would be lagging behind. He doesn't like it at all, just like I don't like these concepts. But Romania has proved in fact that it has nothing to fear from such a scenario which, moreover, is not mine, because it has always ranked at the head of the movement. I take as an example Romania's agreement on the establishment of a European public prosecutor's office. Others, even founding Member States, do not have the courage to do this. Romania was among the first to say yes to the introduction of a European patent, while others did not have this avant-garde will. Romania will celebrate its centenary on 1 December of the current year, the centenary of the great union, as our Romanian friends say. I wanted to say to the President that it is of course a Roman holiday, but it is also a European holiday, because everything about Romania is about Europe. Everything unique to Romania is no stranger to the European Union and therefore on this day we will celebrate together a great moment in Romanian history and a great moment in European history. As early as 2014, when I appeared before this Parliament on 15 July - a date you did not accept but I did - I said that Romania, under the mandate of the Commission which is my own, should be part of the Schengen area. Seit Juli 2014 plediere ich dafar, dass Rumenian Teil der Schengen-Zone wird, und ich hette gerne, dass wir dies bewerkstelligen, bevor das Mandat dieser Kommission endet. (Applaus) Ich sage das aus allgemeinen Grunden, ich sage das aber auch aus Rumenen-spezifischen Grunden. Allerdings mechte ich darauf aufmerksam machen - und das ist eine Bemerkung, die ich nicht so sehr an die Address des Pràsidenten richte, sondern eher an die Address der rumonischen Regierung und des rum-nischen Parlaments: Man darf das nicht dadurch in Gefahr bringen, dass man von rechtsstaatlichen Prinzipien Abstand nimmt. (Applaus) Mein Herzenswunsch wre es, dass man in Rumenen vor Eintritt in die Presidentschaft der European Union einen nationalen Konsensus hinkriegt, was Rechtsstaatlichkeit und Kampf gegen die Korruption anbelangt. Dies ist absolut notwendig.  (Applaus) Ansonsten wird es der Kommission schwerfallen, die zielgerichtete Empfehlung, was den Schengen-Raum anbelangt, einvernehmlich vorschlagen zu kunnen.  And then we have the problem of the budget. I have had more than three talks with my friend the president, insisting on the need to put into place the negotiation boxes after the Austrian Presidency, which will achieve it. Concluding this chapter would be a major performance and much-needed achievement under the Romanian Presidency, in the light of the perspective of the summit in Sibiu. This chapter on the financial perspective has to be concluded before the European elections because we would lose more than the momentum, we would lose several dimensions. It would be a major win for us if we were able to put the financial outlook in place. I know that the Romanian president, my dear friend Klaus, is very committed to achieving this, together with his government. It will be no ordinary summit in Sibiu (Hermannstadt). It will be the moment when and where we have to deliver European perspectives, talking to those who called for the European elections in May 2019. Ich bin sehr davon 'berzeugt, dass der Herr President und die rum-nische Regierung, das rum-nische Parlament, alles in ihren Kr-ften Stehende tun werden, um Sibiu zu einem groeen Moment europeischer Zukunftsgestaltung zu machen. Ich hatte letztes Jahr vorgeschlagen, dass wir diesen Gipfel in Hermannstadt/Sibiu haben sollten, weil ich der Auffassung bin, wenn es ein Land, das erst 2007 mit groeer Versp-tung im europeischen Geschichtsverlauf der Europ-ischen Union beigetreten ist, schaffen wurde, die nechsten sieben Jahre rumenisch - sprich europeisch - europeisch - sprich rum-nisch - zu gestalten, trege dies eine Symbolkraft in sich, die man nicht.

Mr President, it is good to have you here within the format of the Future of Europe discussions in the European Union.  The first lesson, I would say, that we can learn when we listen to you, as a representative of this great country, is optimism: Europe works, Europe delivers. I only want to mention one figure out of the last 20 years: the economic development of Romania, so the growth rate, increased by more than 490% on the GDP base, four times higher than Moldova, for example. So to be part of this Europe, to be part of the European Union, works – on the question of the economy, but also on the question of developing towards a modern society in Romania. Congratulations on this.  But, I must say that Europe is not yet really unified. We cannot talk today about an already really united European Union. Romania is a Member of the European Union but the living conditions inside of our Union differ a lot. The European People’s Party (the PPE) does not want to accept this. We want to change this. We want to really have, in the future, a united Europe where people have an equal standard of living.  There is no Europe of east and west. There is no Europe of north and south. No Europe of poor and rich. There are only Europeans. And that is why, as the PPE, we want to continue our efforts under cohesion policy – you mentioned this – and we have to invest again in infrastructure, but I think new priorities are also needed. In research, for example. Let’s build, for example, the next supercomputer of the European Union in some of the countries in the central and eastern European Member States, and not always in the traditional Western countries, and let’s dream the dream that in the future an Austrian or a French student goes to Krakow or Bucharest to study and not to Oxford or Munich anymore. That is probably one of the dreams we should really dream.  Another element is that Romania is a Member of the European Union but also in terms of the conditions, not yet fully. That is why we welcome the engagement to join the euro, which is for us a crucial element for surviving as Europeans in a globalised world, and we fully support the enlargement process on the Schengen Area. Let’s be engaged. We also fully support what President Jean-Claude Juncker said today, that we should get started; probably the first step is opening the airports already before the European elections in 2019. We have to move on these questions.  I want to show respect also towards the citizens of Romania, because I think it is clear that there is still a need of modernisation, of modernising the country in the direction of a country which fights strongly for fundamental principles and fights against corruption. I want to clarify that this is not only a Romanian problem, but it is also a Romanian problem, and people care about this, people care about the situation in the country. The government has to change the direction.  We discussed this a few weeks ago here in Strasbourg as well. For my political family, I have to underline that today’s government already crossed some of the red lines which are defined in our common understanding about values and I want to thank you, as President, because you gave the people in Romania who demonstrated opposition, who demonstrated too their readiness to go forward for a modern Romania, a voice. You defended modernisation. You are the President of a modern Romania and that is good.  Herr Präsident, Sie werden in ein paar Monaten die Präsidentschaft übernehmen. Da gibt es noch ein paar Punkte, die uns wichtig sind. Das erste ist, dass wir bis dahin versuchen müssen, Antworten zu geben. In der Migrationsfrage, in der Fragestellung des Budgets für die Europäische Union müssen wir liefern, und wir müssen auch über die Erfolge, die wir haben, reden, den Menschen auch vermitteln, dass Europa in ihrem Alltag wirkmächtig und positiv ist. Das Zweite, was aber auch wichtig ist, ist, dass in Ihrer Ratspräsidentschaft die Europawahlen stattfinden werden. Wir alle vertreten ein demokratisches Europa. Wir sind die Kammer der Bürger der Europäischen Union. Für ein demokratisches Europa braucht man Kandidaten und man braucht ein Programm, man braucht Inhalte, man braucht Ideen. Das werden wir praktizieren als Abgeordnete, als Parteien auf diesem Kontinent in den nächsten Jahren. 2014, bei der letzten Wahl, hatten wir beispielsweise zum ersten Mal Spitzenkandidaten nominiert, wie Jean-Claude Juncker, auch Guy Verhofstadt hat kandidiert, Ska Keller hat kandidiert, wir hatten verschiedene Kandidaten. Und wir wollen beim nächsten Mal noch mehr die Programmvielfalt deutlich machen – dass ich für Ceta gestimmt habe und Ska Keller gegen Ceta gestimmt hat beispielsweise –, die Unterschiede deutlich machen. Worum ich Sie bitte, ist, dass Sie im Anschluss Ihren Beitrag dazu leisten, dass dieses demokratische Europa, die Willensbildung der Bürger Europas dann auch nach den Europawahlen Ausdruck findet in einem gemeinsamen Programm für die Zukunft dieses Kontinents und in den Entscheidungen, die dann zu fällen sind. Ich habe mit dem Verweis auf den Optimismus begonnen, den Sie praktizieren, und ich möchte damit auch schließen. Vor 28 Jahren, am Beginn der Neunziger, hat ein junger Mann in Sibiu vor der Entscheidung gestanden, sein Land entweder zu verlassen und in der Ferne seine Zukunft zu suchen, oder dazubleiben und aufzubauen. Er hat sich für das Letztere entschieden, fürs Anpacken. Er hat zunächst seine Stadt in die Zukunft geführt, die Arbeitslosigkeit reduziert und den Menschen einen guten Platz zum Leben geschaffen. Heute steht der gleiche Mann vor uns, nämlich der heutige Präsident Rumäniens, Klaus Iohannis. Und deswegen ist die Botschaft, die Sie mitbringen, Optimismus. Mit viel Arbeit, mit Seriosität, mit Willen und Ideen kann man sein Land und Europa in eine gute Zukunft führen. Danke für diese Botschaft!

Mr President, I would like to thank the Welcome to the European Parliament, Mr President. It is important that you face up to the debate on the future of Europe today. Not only because your country will take over the Presidency of the Council from Austria in a few weeks' time, but also because of developments in Central and Eastern Europe. The euphoria that spread more than ten years ago has faded away. Ditches that are believed to have been overcome open up and new ones are added. This is also linked to non-compliance, such as your country's repeatedly postponed accession to Schengen. Generally speaking, there are imbalances, especially in the economic field, which apply to the entire East. The demographic situation is also a challenge. Most Eastern European countries face a huge brain drain. We should address these developments much more openly, more directly, self-critically. Also to prevent the latent resentment of demagogues from being exploited in order to undermine the European community of values. Often – and you too have done so today – an image is quoted in the context of Eastern and Western Europe, according to which Europe would have to breathe with two lungs. The rule of law, democracy and human rights are the air we need to breathe, and that unites us.  Mr President, it is good to hear that you, too, do not want to call into question European values and that you want to base your actions accordingly. Romania is an important Member State of the Union, a very important one, with great potential. Economic growth is well above the EU average, mainly thanks to a strong commitment to the IT sector. The Romanian diaspora also contributes significantly to the economic development of other Member States. Romania has come a long way. The initial situation was more difficult than in the other former communist countries. The progress made was particularly possible because the country is cooperating with the European Commission in the cooperation and control mechanism. The fight against corruption and the independence of the judiciary are priorities. Only if this succeeds can the positive economic development of the country be secured in the long term. Only when corruption is eliminated will economic success also appeal to ordinary people. Much still needs to be done in this respect. The S&amp;D Group will be a critical supporter here. For us, democracy and the rule of law are at the heart of it. These principles are universal and apply to all Member States, whether in the East or the West.  If you had a little more discipline, you would let me speak out. That is why we are counting on you to support the European Parliament in finally implementing the rule of law and fundamental rights mechanism that we are proposing, which we will be discussing this afternoon. Mr President, we are watching with concern the internal political situation in your country, which is constantly getting worse. It is not for us to interfere in domestic political processes, but it is not good for a society to become increasingly fragmented and to become incompatible. We hope that, by virtue of your office and your personality, you will contribute to overcoming them and to more commonality. That is why we are also asking you to reconsider the role of the secret services, the last remnant of the Ceauescu years. Secret protocols should not play a role in ordinary court proceedings. This would be an important step towards a modern, liberal and European Romania.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Monica Macovei", "mepid": "96824", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR group. – Welcome, President Iohannis! 11 years after accession, Romanians want to Europe - 65% of us want Romania to remain in the Union and more than 60% of the citizens of the Member States also want in the Union - a record level in the last 25 years. European political leaders must not lose this people's trust, but must strengthen it. Romanians put their trust in the Union especially now, when they have been living for months the nightmare of a non-transparent government, which constantly attacks independent justice and weakens the fight against corruption. However, Romanians are a living people and do not hesitate to take to the streets to defend justice, justice and democracy. During this time, the European Parliament has adopted new directives to combat money laundering, for the extensive confiscation of assets, but they are not transposed into Romania, either on time or correctly, but on the contrary, often the other way around than the directives provide. That, by this PSD-ALDE government. In order to preserve its values, Europe must sanction slippages from democracy. President Iohannis publicly criticized and sanctioned the slippages of the PSD-ALDE government, the assault on justice and the amendment of criminal law. But the PSD-ALDE speech, like the speeches of other populist politicians, tries to manipulate public opinion by insisting that Romania or other Member States are losing their identity. However, I say nothing about the advantages of membership of the Union. Extremist discourse divides societies, while extremist politicians go about their business with public money, following the Kremlin's example. We must overcome extremism and populism. Before taking over the Presidency, the government must comply with all the recommendations of the Venice Commission and the warnings of the European Commission regarding the amendment of the codes and laws of justice. It would be a sign of respect for Romanians, foreign partners and democracy. In 2019 it will be the first time since accession that Romania has taken over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The first Union summit, without the UK, will take place in Sibiu in May 2019. In order to preserve its values and Europe must sanction the slippages from democracy, as I said. Romania has the opportunity, taking over the Presidency of the European Council, to be on the world's radar in the first half of 2019. I want Romania to fulfil this role responsibly and professionally.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 58, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, the first time that I went to your country, President Iohannis, to Bucharest, was in December 1989 in one of those old Tarom airplanes. I have to tell you, it was torture. With no leg-room, it was a little bit like flying with Ryanair today. For me it was the first time that I went to a Communist country, because before the fall of the Berlin Wall, we liberals were not allowed to go. In Bucharest – I remember it very well – I met the historical leader of the Romanian liberals, Radu-Anton Câmpeanu, in an empty building, in an empty office with one table and one chair. He had just returned from exile in Paris in December 1989. When I came back here, what I did was immediately to send a truck full of office furniture and computers. A few months later these capitalist gifts were destroyed by a furious mob of miners, the henchmen of Iliescu. So I had to send a second truck to Romania to help Mr Câmpeanu build up his liberal and democratic movement. Not only did I send office furniture and computers, I also sent material for a radio station that became one of the first private radio stations in your country – Radio Contact – with the same name as a station in Belgium. The reason why I’m telling you this story is very simple, because today, so many years later – nearly 30 years later – I am again worried about what is happening in Romania. First of all, these dubious reforms were undermining the judiciary – I said that to your Prime Minister here a few weeks ago. The same applies to the weakening of the Criminal Code, undermining the fight against corruption. Then there was the discovery of secret protocols, which I have never heard about in any other country, between the secret service on the one hand and some parts of the judiciary on the other. My plea to the Prime Minister, but also to you – because you have to work together in this respect – is certainly not to follow that path in the near future and certainly not to follow the examples of countries like Poland and Hungary, which have embarked on illiberal paths, I should say, towards autocracy. I think that only good cooperation between you, as the President of the Romanian Republic, and the Prime Minister, the Government and the majority can avoid this. And I think there is huge support in this House to support you in this endeavour. So what we need, I think, exactly 30 years after the Romanian revolution, at European level is exactly what is also at stake in Romania. There will be, in 2019, a fight between liberal democracy and the tendency in a number of countries – unfortunately mainly eastern European countries – to go the way of illiberal autocracy. It will be a fight between tolerance and racism, a fight of openness against protectionism, and a fight by all the – I should say – true Europeans against all the kinds of narrow-minded nationalists and populists that we have seen in the four corners of Europe. And I think that, just as it did in 1989, Romania will have an important role to play in winning the fight in 2019. This also gives me the opportunity to come back to the debate on the future of the Union. If there is one real reform to be made for the future of the European Union, Mr President, then it is to get rid of the unanimity rule in the European Union. Look again at the Khashoggi case that we have today. On Saturday all the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, together with Mogherini, produced what? A weak condemnation, a soft declaration instead of common action, which is impossible because of the unanimity rule in foreign affairs. What is needed is not a soft declaration or a weak condemnation; what is needed is a ban – a European ban – on exports of weapons to Saudi Arabia. That is what is needed and it can be achieved only... (Applause) ... and this is what I want to hear in this debate about the future of Europe – if we get rid of the unanimity rule, if we can get rid – and Romania is ready to do so – of this veto power, this veto right that all Member States still cherish, but which is in fact the real obstacle to a re-foundation of the European Union. And I’m pleased that Romania and the President will be on our side in this fight for that reform.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 59, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank President Juncker very much for joining this debate on the future of Europe. With the European elections getting close, it is even more important to discuss how that future should look – our common future. That is the question that we need to ask ourselves, but not just those of us in this room. Every citizen of Europe needs to ask themselves what kind of Europe they want to live in. Do we want a Europe where we fight for our common values, where we defend democracy, civil liberties and freedom, or do we let Europe go down a slippery slope of nationalism and governments that hollow out the key foundations of our Union and of democracy? Unfortunately, some governments seem to be going exactly in that way. How the situation looks in a Member State also defines what the European Union as such, and as a whole, looks like. Right now, when our common values are being trampled upon in many Member States, every voice that defends civil liberties and every voice that defends freedom and the rule of law counts, regardless of political affiliation. Therefore, President Juncker, we count on you! The Romanian people count on you! The Romanian people showed in a referendum two weeks ago that they do not want an authoritarian state that discriminates and that tries to play people off against one another. They also protested in their thousands against corruption. They protested against a government that de facto legalises corruption and does not even shy away from weakening a judiciary system to make it easier for some politicians to put public money – the money of all Romanians - into their own pockets. But, instead of listening, the Romanian Government sent tear gas against those people protesting. And now the Government even wants to replace a strong anti-corruption chief prosecutor with somebody who has, let us say, not such a strong record of working against corruption. This is a slap in the face for Romanian citizens. Mr President, it now depends on you to stop that. Mr President, we need you as a strong voice for democracy and the rule of law in Romania and throughout the European Union. Two weeks ago, the Constitutional Court of Romania declared over 60 articles of the new criminal procedure code unconstitutional. On Friday, the Venice Commission warned that the reform would jeopardise the fight against corruption and also against organised crime. Mr President, why don’t you take the lead and call on all political parties to put the recommendations of the Venice Commission into practice? Romania needs to start a broad reassessment of the law reform with all stakeholders involved. Since Romania will take over the presidency in a couple of months, it would be even more important to have a role model at the head of the Presidency for good governance to show how it can be done. Let us be courageous together and stand up for democracy and the rule of law, and let us not be intimidated by all of those who flagrantly undermine that very rule of law and our freedom.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Tania González Peñas", "mepid": "127330", "text": "  GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, thank you, Mr Iohannis, for being here to exchange views with the European Parliament. Romania joined the European Union in 2007, and at that time a period of high hope and close ties between the Romanian people and the other countries of the European Union began. However, recent developments seem to show that the dignity of the Romanian people is putting the Government in check. We're talking about the future of Europe. I'd like to look back and remember that 2014 presidential campaign. At the time, Mr Iohannis, your party focused on fighting corruption and improving the judicial system. Anyone looking through a rearview mirror would be astonished at the decisions the government of their country is making in recent times. You have the prerogative to address your Parliament on matters of national interest, as well as to safeguard compliance with the Constitution and fundamental rights. And in this sense, he must be firm and clear in defending democracy and freedoms and not become complicit in the drift of his Government, which seems to be following in the style of others, such as Polish or Hungarian. We witness with surprise some democratic involutions typical of other times. Specifically, I'm going to mention three well-known cases. First, the referendum against same-sex marriages, convened by the far right and the Orthodox church, a referendum supported by the Romanian Government participating in a campaign of hatred and homophobia that has shown the most retrograde side of a social democratic government, which should embarrass the S&amp;D Group here, Fortunately the citizens of Romania showed their dignity outright with such a high abstention that it even prevented them from succeeding. Second, in August thousands of his compatriots took to the streets against the government's current endemic corruption. Romanian citizenship resists attempts by today's rulers to control the judiciary to dilute the relative success of the fight against corruption. And thirdly, the reforms of the law regulating NGOs. The Council of Europe Conference of International NGOs noted that there are clear deficiencies with regard to compliance with international standards and good practices. From the GUE/NGL Group we would also like to ask the S&amp;D Group about these three elements and their opinion, and we would like to encourage you, Mr Iohannis, to be firm; to stand firm in defending democracy and freedoms and in the fight against corruption; to listen to the voice of his people before other voices and not to continue this confrontation with the common sense that his government is carrying out. Luckily, the events of recent months realize that Romanian citizens know how to make themselves heard. From here we celebrate. We show our support for defending the rights and freedoms conquered with such suffering.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 61, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Rosa D'Amato", "mepid": "124835", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Iohannis, when I think of Romania, I am thinking of the many Romanians living in Italy, the many that I know and have met. In their stories there is the image of a great country, rich in beauties and traditions, but also of a country that has to deal with long-held problems, starting with that of corruption. We saw this this summer with the protests that flooded the streets of Bucharest. Do not be alarmed, Mr President, no one here wants to be a master, we all know that corruption is a phenomenon that affects the whole of Europe, no country excluded. It is estimated that its cost for the union as a whole is EUR 120 billion per year. It is clear to everyone that corruption destroys the economy and social justice, affecting citizens and businesses that operate honestly, punishing those who deserve and rewarding those who are friends of power. Corruption is the most serious theft that can be committed in a state because it steals the future. I understand them well, Mr President, because I too come from a land of emigration and corruption. For decades I have been told that there is little to be done against this, that it must be accepted because all politicians are equal, because that is politics, and public administration and the state will never change. But that's not the case! Politics, the good one, can and must combat corruption. What? With laws, such as the one we have just passed in Italy, increasing the penalties for corrupt and corrupting, protecting those who denounce and introducing a clear principle: those convicted of corruption can have nothing to do with the public administration, let alone receive public funds. These are measures and principles that should be applied at European level, such as whistler blower measures, which Parliament called for a year ago but which are a dead letter. And with regard to dead letters, since the subject is the future of Europe, it would be good if the European Union were to start thinking about guaranteeing a future for its citizens, instead of perched on the defence of failed rules. I am referring to what is happening in the last few hours with the decomposed attacks on the economic manoeuvre proposed by the Italian Government: we have seen European Commissioners who rejected the text before they even read it, calling for atrocious punishments on the part of the markets. There was even a Commissioner who, just after the elections, had already announced that high finance would change italians' minds about who to vote for. The truth is that austerity and its rules have failed. We were told that in order to reduce public debt, social spending and investment had to be cut. In Italy it has been done, but the public debt has remained almost unchanged. We have been told that with the accounts in order growth and employment would be shared, but the reality is that the economy has been stagnant for years, families are corroding their savings, businesses are failing and young people are emigrating. The government that my movement is part of, the 5 Star Movement, said enough. Austerity is killing the Eu ropean Union and the eurozone, if it wants to survive, needs new budgetary rules, but while waiting to change it, a state cannot hang itself and its citizens in compliance with the wrong constraints. Think of an institute, the German Institute for Economic Research, confirms the goodness of the Italian Government's manoeuvre. The institute's director says Italy's problem is not this year's deficit but its economic depression. Europe should admit that more public spending and more deficits are useful if you focus on growth and employment as absolute priorities. Are these also words of a dangerous populist? To those who claim that European standards are being violated, I would remind you that the change in parameters is perfectly compatible with European rules, because Italy is still in an exceptional situation to take into account: 17.5 million people at risk of poverty and social exclusion, 5 million absolute poor people are or are not a situation of real emergency? Economists think so. Strong support is therefore needed for the poorest workings for social stability and for reviving consumption. This is what we did with citizenship income, a measure that this Parliament supported only a year ago by a large majority vote on our resolution. The last six months, Mr President, of this parliamentary term will be the Romanian Presidency: be brave too! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, change is therefore possible.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by its operation, or rather its dysfunctions, but also and above all by its political orientations, the European Union not only does not secure the future of The European nations - this is the debate we are dealing with today - but it is in fact becoming, increasingly, an anti-Europe. Although they defend themselves, some are probably not dissatisfied with this development, since they have never sought to ensure continental independence and power. In reality, they see European integration as a simple step towards a global village and global governance. But for my part, I am convinced that there is still time to save Europe from the current excesses of the European Union. With our allies and the national forces that are advancing all over our continent, we want to build a Europe that lives up to the genius of our civilization and that once again allows our nations to shine throughout the world, to be strong and respected on the international stage, either individually or collectively. This Europe does not go through a European Commission that decides everything and nothing, both all-powerful and at the same time impotent. Unable, for example, to protect our companies from both Chinese dumping and the extra-territoriality of American law. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that the European Union is always in a hurry to give rule of law lessons to Poland, Hungary or, tomorrow, to Romania, to give human rights lessons to Russia, but it is deafeningly silent about the barbaric murder of journalist Khashoggi on the orders of Riyadh in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. So yes, we must put an end to this above-ground bureaucracy without democratic legitimacy. The Commission claims to be transparent and independent in the decisions it takes on a daily basis, which affects more than 500 million Europeans. But it is in total opacity that it concludes all-round free trade treaties. These treaties organize unfair competition, causing the deindustrialization of our countries and the ruin of our agriculture, whether it is CETA, which is already in force but has not been ratified by national parliaments, the projects currently under discussion with Mercosur or with the countries of Oceania, or the agreement signed this summer by Jean-Claude Juncker in secret with Japan and , as recently as last Friday, with Singapore. Subject to the market, the Commission's Europe, is also the Europe of resignation because its leaders do not assume the functions and obey less the peoples than the unelected officials around them, as well as the judges of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the Union. We are regularly told about European protectionism, but in 1997 the Treaty of Amsterdam repealed Article 44, paragraph 2, of the Treaty of Rome, which provided for the development of a natural preference between the Member States. And the European Court of Justice rejected some of the few anti-dumping measures taken by the Commission at the time. This is what the French essayist Éric Zemmour called \"the coup d'etat of the judges\". Indeed, since the 1970s, political power has gradually been stripped of its prerogatives by the judiciary, first at the national level and now at the European level. Thus, beyond our sovereignty, it is democracy and its foundations that are at risk. Nor can we claim European solidarity with a punitive Commission which seeks to sanction Member States that do not submit to its ideology, in particular on migration, which we would now like to make a new human right. We need real cooperation on major challenges such as the protection of external borders or energy and environmental issues. Of course not! we cannot pretend to want to preserve our ecosystem, while constantly encouraging unbridled transcontinental free trade, which is by nature profoundly anti-ecological.

You have touched on several topics, of which the one who is dearest to me - my country, Romania. In December 1989, we Romanians decided that we could no longer bear the communist dictatorship and removed it. Since then, we have been building a democracy that we Romanians want based on what is called the values of European democracy, the values of the European Union. In these nearly 30 years Romania has changed. Romania has changed profoundly. We are an Eastern European country that still believes in European-type democracy. Romania is a country with a growing economy. Romania is a country that represents a pole of stability in the geographical region where we find ourselves. Romania is a country that aspires to leadership in areas such as those I mentioned in the first part of my speech. Romania is a country appreciated and respected for the security it delivers to the region and NATO and elsewhere. We Romanians have long understood that we cannot remain aid and security receivers, but we must take a much harder role, but in which we believe - that of a security provider - and that is what we do. Romania is a rule of law. Romania is a democratic state. In Romania there is a political debate and in Romania there is what we have called \"a very living democracy\". I do not want to go into the details of the internal debate in Romania, but I can assure you that I am determined to remain involved in order to guarantee Romanians the preservation of democratic values, the preservation of the rules and principles of a rule of law and the continuation of a very tough, but just fight against corruption. (Strong applause) I think we have more problems in Europe. One of them is the connection between citizen and politician. Often this connection is a weak one, citizens do not understand what politicians are doing and unfortunately some politicians do not understand what citizens want. In Romania the citizens have made it clear what they want, and I - who have been chosen by a significant number of Romanians - have understood that they want to continue this message with which I have begun, for a democratic Romania, for a European Romania, a Romania deeply integrated into the European Union, a Romania that keeps the rule of law intact and that fights - and I must say , with notable results - against corruption. That there is controversy is true, but tell me what parliamentary democracy would that be without controversy? And I am determined that from this fight will win European Romania, democratic Romania and I will get involved in this. We talked in the first part of our meeting about how I see the future of the European Union. Several positions were more about the near future of the European Union, and then let me also say a few words about how we see it in Romania, how I see the european Union's near future, and I am referring to the first part of 2019, when Romania will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. We have an extremely difficult time ahead of us. We have extremely difficult dossiers, which we want to deal with in a fair way, but also with great determination, towards a positive or optimistic result. It won't always be possible. One of the dossiers is called Brexit and here, certainly, things are still in a phase that depends very much on the negotiation that is being conducted, but we want to reach an agreement with the UK and we want to have this deal very quickly. Romania will be involved as much as the Presidency of the Council can be involved in this. And let me say that here we have, in terms of negotiating Brexit, a first tangible, clear and transparent evidence of the effectiveness of collaboration. The fact that the 27 worked strictly together, accepted only one negotiating team, brought notable results. Here is that unity is not a concept of the day,\" but for unity, but for unity. We have a dossier that I know you discussed in Parliament and which is dear to you and dear to us, it is the multiannual financial framework. We need to make progress on this file. The fact that you, in Parliament, are encouraging us in the Council to move towards an increase in the budget is, in Romania's view, a good thing, but the negotiation will have to continue practically - and here Romania will get involved and we hope to have, if not the completion of the negotiations, at least significant progress in sensitive areas on this budget. A dossier that has also been mentioned by me and some speakers: migration. We need to get to a common approach as quickly as possible. If we fail to define a European policy in this area, then we will have a major problem. And Romania will be involved in making progress in negotiations. At the moment, you know very well, as far as the Dublin reform is concerned, we have 28 views from 28, very different countries. I believe that we can bring these opinions closer together and reach the first common conclusions which, then, allow us to treat this phenomenon on several levels, a treatment that will fundamentally differ from the way we have acted so far. So far we have acted in the wake of a crisis; we must act before a crisis - that is what I meant when I said that the European Union must act preventively. We know how the world works, but we also have to prepare, to cope with the effects of this function. And finally, during the Romanian Presidency, the European elections will take place and during the campaign for the European elections we will have the Summit in Sibiu. This summit is extremely important for Romania and for the European Union and not necessarily because it is my hometown, but because that summit has the unique and clear theme - the future of the European Union. We will discuss and draw up a clear, clear, understandable thinking about the European Union for the European citizen, not just the European politician. And next year's elections to the European Parliament will give us an X-ray, show us whether we have all been credible, whether we have known how to generate credible projects, whether we know how to draw a future for the European Union, or whether we still have a bit of work to do.

Once again, thanks for taking your position.

We’ve taken important steps on endocrine disruptors, on Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and on microplastics in our water. We are responding to the concerns of citizens on the safety and quality of our drinking water. I want to turn though to those people who do not have a tap to turn on, those who are homeless, who live in the makeshift refugee camps we see in European cities. Parliament today could and should have gone much further on the right to water. We have missed an opportunity today to respond in full to those 1.8 million EU citizens who signed the European Citizens’ Initiative on the right to water. Those in this House, who chose not to respond positively to that call from our citizens will have to answer to them next year in the elections. Finally, I want to turn to the issue of water leakage. Leaking water from our pipes, from our networks is not just bad for the environment, it isn’t just wasteful, it means water bills are higher for customers. I particularly want to mention the campaign by the GMB trade union in the UK, the Take Back the Tap campaign, which is seeking to get water back in public hands, and properly accountable to the public. 2.4 billion litres of water wasted every single day in the UK by the privatised water companies, 432 million litres a day leaking from the Severn Trent network in my region and at the same time, those companies in the last five years have paid out GBP 6.5 billion in shareholder dividends.

As a public good, I advocate quality standards and waste prevention that are only achievable through the ethical exploitation of water. It is these values that should be promoted when we talk about the efficiency of distribution systems.  Furthermore, in 2010, the United Nations enshrined water as a human right, alongside sanitation, and that access to drinking water should therefore not be conditioned by the lack of economic resources of the end-user.

I think we are all aware that the next six months will be crucial for our Union. For Europeans going to the polls next May it is not enough that the Commission has made proposals to make their lives better, they want to see results on the ground, concrete decisions.  Together we have a very short window of time in which to find agreement on the many proposals that are on the table and thus show that the European Union can deliver solutions to the challenges that cannot be addressed by any of our Member States acting alone.  Challenges such as ensuring that Europe’s return to economic growth benefits all, and creating opportunity in the transition to the digital and low carbon economy. Challenges such as demographics and migration, climate change and the competition for resources, which require a shared push towards sustainability. Challenges to our values and democratic societies from terrorists, cyber-attackers and disinformation campaigns. In an increasingly volatile world, we have to show that Europe is able to deliver solutions to these biggest of questions.  Today’s work programme reflects fully the ambition of Jean-Claude Juncker’s State of the Union address last month and the accompanying letter of intent. It represents the Commission’s commitment to work intensively with you, and the Council, to deliver what we promised under the 10 priorities on the basis of which this House approved the Commission’s mandate, as well as, of course, to prepare the Union for the future.  Our work programme has been enriched by the fruitful exchanges we have had with Parliament, through the structured dialogue with the Conference of Committee Chairs and with the Conference of Presidents as well. We have also had a good exchange with the Council in line with the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making.  So the first priority for our work in the coming year is all about delivery. With the initiatives presented alongside the State of the Union address, the Commission has tabled all of the legislative proposals needed to deliver on our common agenda for jobs, growth, fairness and democratic change. Together with this House, and the Council, we have found agreement on nearly half of these and a further 20% are well advanced in the legislative process. The priority must now be to turn the remaining proposals into legislation and then to implement it effectively.  The Joint Declaration on the EU’s legislative priorities for 2018 and 2019, signed by the Presidents of the three institutions, has proved valuable in helping us to find shared priorities, and especially to stick to them. I know from our dialogue that this Parliament shares the commitment to maintain and further step up the momentum.  The Commission will be a constructive and energetic partner to you, as well as to the Council, in helping find the agreements needed to deliver what we promised on migration, on the reform of our common asylum system, on the digital single market, on a fairer and deeper economic monetary union, on the European Pillar of Social Rights and on internal security, to name but a few. To keep strong focus on delivery on these shared priorities, we are only proposing a very limited number of new initiatives in our work programme. Some of these are policy initiatives which are needed to complete the 10 priorities in areas such as further boosting investment, addressing the challenges of artificial intelligence or tackling disinformation campaigns which threaten our democracy. Whilst continuing the significant efforts to ensure an agreement with the United Kingdom, we will bring forward the necessary measures to adapt the acquis ahead of Brexit.  We will also continue our better regulation work. To consolidate this as part of our collective DNA, we will present the results of our ongoing stocktaking this spring. Today we are announcing evaluation work and fitness checks to ensure our existing laws are fit for purpose and up to date, including in areas flagged in the opinions of the REFIT platform. We will also pay particular attention to ensuring the laws we already have are properly implemented and applied. In parallel with the work programme, we are also presenting a Communication which sets out how we propose to strengthen the role of subsidiarity and proportionality principles in our policymaking.  Finally, our work programme takes forward the roadmap to the Sibiu Summit on Europe Day next year. This will be a crucial moment for the EU of 27 to shape our collective future. The Commission will help prepare this discussion with contributions on delivering a sustainable European future to implement the sustainable development goals and surpass our Paris commitments.  We will advocate moving to more efficient decision-making in energy and climate, tax and social policies. We will also look at how to strengthen the international role of the euro and, as we will discuss further in the debate later this evening, at strengthening the rule of law framework. To build a strong foundation for our European future it is clearly essential that we find agreement before the Sibiu Summit on a future MFF – multiannual financial framework – which will enable us to deal effectively with the challenges ahead.

There will be a new mandate from next year, both for the European Parliament and our connected institution – the Commission – which is very dependent on us next year. But this debate this year should take place at the same time for that very reason: about the future but also about how we complete our five years’ work together. From that point of view these two elements are mixed here. The first thing I would like to say is that our group is very keen to work on, and insists on the need to deliver on, the legislative proposals which are still pending. Parliament should complete its work and the Commission should table everything which is still missing from the table. From what we have seen so far, this is possible. For the EPP Group, the most important element – and the number-one question we would like to see completed – is, obviously, the security and migration issue, where border protection – not just border management, but real protection of the European Union – should be achieved, as well as cooperation with Africa, keeping a vigilant eye within the continent on the Western Balkans. The Vice-President mentioned cybersecurity, especially concerning the possibilities of disinformation in the European Parliament election campaign. We also insist on implementation, not just on completing pending legislation, for instance in the area of PNR. This is a very important thing. I would also like to use this opportunity to welcome – as we have discussed in this Parliament several times, parallel work is not something which we need to do concerning the Commission work programme – the withdrawal of the mandate from the migration compact, which is a decision that I think the Commission was right to take. It should be left to the Member States and we should find our own way to find our own possibilities at European level. All these aspects are very important to ensure the stability of the continent. On solidarity, I would also like to draw your attention to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which is very important, and also to the fact that the Parliament will be ready – and this is a message to the Council rather than the Commission or ourselves – with the MFF proposals by the end of this year. With all due respect, some elements are still missing, but I think we can achieve it. From there on, it will basically be the Council’s job. But we are delivering our results here.

We, the S&amp;D Group, are really striving for real European solutions, and we need to deliver them in the last months, for sure.

When it comes to climate change, this means having an ambitious strategy for a low-carbon economy. When it comes to the digital revolution, we need to frame it, to conduct it in such a way that we improve working conditions and we control the effects on our democracy. And when it comes to migration management and the refugee crisis, we need to make sure that Europe counts not only on the European border, but the real European Asylum System and a real partnership with Africa. Then we can ask: but do we have the means for this? And we think we have, because if we fight tax evasion – tax avoidance – the means will be there.

In my view, the Commission needs to be realistic in what it wants to achieve before the end of its term and concentrate on a few key priorities, instead of opening a number of new issues. Sometimes less is more.  So what should the Commission do next year? First and foremost is Brexit. In 2019 the EU will go through a major, unprecedented moment in its history. It is in our common interest that this happens as smoothly and peacefully as possible for citizens, for businesses, for the entire European Union. The Commission must do its best to finalise an agreement together with the UK. Beyond Brexit, we must continue our work on key issues, border security and the personal prosperity of EU citizens. We have passed through difficult periods in Europe recently and we need to make sure people understand that the EU is on their side and prevents effectively potential future crises.  I agree that one way to prevent external crises is to work better with our neighbouring regions, including Africa. On the other hand, I wonder if it’s time now to come up at the end of the Commission’s mandate with long-term proposals, such as the voting procedure within the Council, without having an in-depth political debate with this Parliament and the Member States.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, thank you for your presentation, which was, as usual, concise. The Commission cannot be blamed for wanting to deliver results, to your credit. My question to you is this: like me, you are witnessing a growing disaffection among many of our fellow citizens with regard to European integration, while you and I know that it is an essential element in the exercise of our democratic sovereignty. Do you think, then, that it is by continuing to work by doing a little more of the same thing or by working incrementally that we will rekindle the European enthusiasm of those of our fellow citizens who have lost it? I think what we really need is a paradigm shift. I agree with you that it is not on the eve of an election that we are initiating a paradigm shift, but on certain points - the Commission has made proposals, I am thinking of the Euro in particular - which I think are up to the challenge; however, the Council must follow. However, I think we need something much stronger. In fact, our reading of things is that our societies are threatened by two time bombs: on the one hand growing inequalities and on the other, an ecological footprint that exceeds what our planet can bear. So, clearly, we need a paradigm shift, a reorientation of the policies of the European Union, and instead I must note that traditional political families, here in the European Parliament and in the Council, continue for the most part in the same direction. I have listened to you, Mr Sz-jer, when you say that we need to put the package on the issue of security and migration. For my part, I note that for our fellow citizens, these concerns, while important, do not come first. You persist in a path that is also that of your Bavarian friends, but I see that it is in whole battalions that their constituents have left them, for the extremes for some - because in fact, by imitating them you strengthen them - and, for those who were disgusted by this development, for the Greens, and I think their choice was the right one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 121, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "João Pimenta Lopes", "mepid": "136236", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, your speech is nothing new, just the usual rhetoric and propaganda that omits the consequences of the policies that the Commission and the European Union have imposed on workers and peoples.

In 2014, we adopted a joint declaration between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, where we called for greater control of goods that can be used both to violate human rights and also to be used for civil purposes. 2014 - that's four years ago! And we have a proposal. We, as a Parliament, have taken a decision on this – with more than 500 votes, which is a clear signal – and we are still unable to negotiate, the Council is still blocking.

Firstly, when it comes to the supervision of banks and financial markets, we must implement this famous reform of the supervisory authorities, and for that we need the support of the Commission.  You must also convince the Council to move on the deposit guarantee, because otherwise the whole system of the banking union will collapse. We must also convince the Council, with your support, about the famous CCP, those clearing houses that will be shaken by the departure of our British friends.

Vice-President Timmermans, corporate participation – as we can see on every corner in Germany – is a model of success. But this legislative package could damage this model of success.

But there are a few remarks I would like to make.  First of all, there’s no reason to be so gloomy! Look at the Eurobarometer. Our citizens, in a vast majority, believe the European Union is their home and their collective home, and a vast majority believe in the European project. They don’t agree, very often, with proposals we make. They don’t necessarily like the European Commission, or even the European Parliament, but they do understand that they share a destiny with other Europeans.  Sometimes that feels uncomfortable because we don’t know whether we are really fully in control of that destiny. But the very fact, the very basis, that Europeans understand that it is better to solve our differences around a conference table, even if that takes time and it is tedious, rather than to go back to Europe’s history of solving differences on the battlefield, is something that is shared by a vast majority of our citizens – even in countries where political forces do their best to rekindle age-old controversies based on nationalism, even in those countries the majority of the population is in favour of the European Union. So please, take some courage from that. That is a good starting position to be in.  And then yes, of course we need to take steps on issues that have been left alone too long. But if we look, for instance, at the migration issue, has that not been solved because European institutions have failed to act or has that not been solved because Member States, very often based on nationalism, did not come together and did not want to compromise? Answer that question! We have nothing to be ashamed of, neither the Commission nor the European Parliament, but put the onus where it belongs.  Do we really think that going back to nation states on their own is going to solve the problem of climate change, is going to find solutions for migration issues, is going to give us the force to negotiate fair trade agreements with big partners in the world like the United States and China? The leader of Mr Flynn, or the de facto leader of Mr Flynn, does not know whom he admires more – Putin or Trump. Are they going to help us decide the fate of Europe, Putin and Trump, or should we be masters of our own fate in Europe? I believe we should be masters of our own fate.  Somebody ridiculed the plastics strategy. I would say, go and watch what science comes up with now! Our oceans are suffocating in plastic. Every human being has microplastics in his/her body. Every single bought bottle of water has microplastics in it. Is it not urgent? Is this not something that more than 80% of Europeans want us to act upon? Is it not a good choice to interdict single plastic use, stuff that is made in a few seconds and stays in our environment for hundreds of years, and for which we have perfectly feasible alternatives that do not pollute our natural environment? Why ridicule that? It is a great change for our society. It is something our citizens want. This is something we need to do and we can do it now.  On the banking union – let’s complete the banking union. In my political life, one of the most horrible moments I can remember is in 2008 when I was in national government, when we were told we need to save the banks because they are too big to fail. We could not hold the bankers accountable. We needed to pour billions of taxpayers’ money into saving the banks. Do we still want that? No! We never want that to happen again. If that is not to happen again, if banks are to be held accountable themselves for their mistakes, we need a banking union and only the European Union can provide a banking union. There is not a ‘ concert de nations’ that can provide for that.  The same goes for taxation. How fair is it that huge corporations can negotiate with individual Member States so that at the end of the day, they don’t pay tax? Should the rule not be that you pay tax where you make profits? The only way we can achieve that, especially against the big tech corporations, is if we are united on this, as Europeans, and not divided. They will play off one Member State against the other.  Please make speed with the changes in company law, because it will help us on the one hand to especially allow small and medium-sized enterprises to act on a European scale, and at the same time we will protect the rights of workers in this so that you cannot use letterbox companies to avoid taking your responsibility towards your workers and towards your other social responsibilities. Let’s act on that!  Of course, this is not always the big picture, but these are concrete measures that make the lives of European citizens better day by day.  With all the differences we have across the board here in Parliament, compromise is never a bad thing. Why did we bad-mouth compromise at some point? In a democracy, compromise is a thing of beauty because it brings together a majority to make positive change in this society. This is the force. This is where the force of the European Parliament lies and yes, the SDGs can be a good framework for that.  We can certainly mould Europe along this global picture. This is, I think, something we can do in the future, but for the year to come, let’s try and finish a number of the subjects that are still on the table – on fiscal policy, on completing the economic and monetary union, which is urgent. Again, it is not complete. It needs to be completed. But again, solidarity and responsibility go hand in hand. Of course, you can ask solidarity of other Europeans, but then you also have the responsibility to act within the rules in the economic and monetary union. Otherwise, other Europeans will not want to share their destiny with you.  I think on all these subjects, we have so much to do. We have little time, but there is no need to be complacent. There is no need to be fatalistic. We can do this together. With all the political differences we have, the Commission is ready to work with you and the Council to get this done – also dual use, let me insist on that. We salute Parliament’s position on that. Hey, Council, now get going! Make sure we can get this done soon.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for organising this debate so quickly. Once again, thanks to the work of journalists, whom I want to salute, a new tax scandal is revealed that shows that in order to reduce their taxes the richest and most powerful taxpayers do not lack imagination and make fun of solidarity, ethics and sometimes legality. The patterns of fraud that have been revealed are shocking and even unbearable. They are shocking because they involve some banks that abused public treasuries at the height of the crisis, when large sums of public money had just been injected to save the banking sector. Unbearable, because these are less revenue for the Member States and therefore also less investment and additional taxes for businesses and citizens who respect the rules of the game, so this is not permissible, of course. What does this new scandal tell us - one more? That in the past, the rules on the exchange of information could and should have been more effective, but above all more respected. It should be remembered that at the time of the events, these exchanges were said to be \"spontaneous\", that is, left to the discretion of the States, and these rules did not, it must be noted, prevent fraudulent behaviour. They have not prevented these flows from moving from one Member State to another. However, since 2014, this Commission - and I am proud to have contributed to it in my place as Commissioner for Taxation - has started what I have called the 'transparency revolution', following an extremely simple principle which is to strengthen and even systematise cooperation and information exchange between Member States. The exchange of information is really the key concept that made us change, I think, from time to time. As a result, the Directive on Administrative Cooperation has been considerably extended. It now includes the mandatory automatic exchange of information in many cases. It is true that information held by some Member States is indispensable to others, for example on financial accounts - this is the end of bank secrecy - on tax decisions made by Member States, on country-by-country information - these are the famous decisions on tax rulings - or on the CBCR (Country-by-Country reporting), which I still believe should be public. , and finally, on the sharing of information between national tax authorities and anti-money laundering authorities.  More recently, this directive has been supplemented by new reporting provisions for tax intermediaries; you voted for it and I thank you for that. It is scheduled to come into force next year. It will change everything because it will force these intermediaries - bankers, lawyers, legal or tax advisers - to report abusive or aggressive tax arrangements that they sell to their clients. I call on Member States to now use these tools which are available to them to cooperate, to exchange information more quickly. Speed, precisely, is essential to prevent this kind of aggressive scheme from spreading between Member States. Last week's revelations demonstrate, once again, that these tax justice issues are of great interest to the general public. They are even now at the very top of the priorities of our opinions and that is why I call on Parliament and the Council to quickly adopt our proposals on country-by-country reports and on the protection of whistleblowers. In addition to strengthening cooperation with tax administrations, this Commission has systematically proposed to the Member States, as you know, an ambitious collective approach - and here, Parliament and the Commission have always found themselves side by side - by defining a common corporate tax base. Progress on this issue is real and must be achieved, because a harmonized base would significantly reduce the potential for tax evasion by better taking digital activities into account. And I believe that a European response is the only one that can lead the rest of the international community to a serious reform of the legal framework, through the adoption of a common list of tax havens, which has given us enough clout to obtain, I believe, a whole series of reforms that allow us to make progress in the fight against harmful tax regimes around the world. We have also proposed that Member States negotiate certain aspects of double taxation prevention treaties at European level in the FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) agreements with the United States. Some Member States were not 'ripe' for such a coordinated approach and it may be time - it is not a will, it is a proposal - to revive this idea. Here, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, everything is not yet settled, everything is not yet put in place, but precisely with regard to what is raised by this scandal, it turns out that significant progress has been made, although I cannot say that everything we have decided together is likely to make such a scandal impossible. But I can say with great confidence that it would be much, much, much more difficult if the tax administrations fulfilled the legal provisions to which they are now bound. When all these laws are implemented, I believe it will be much more complicated to do this kind of tax optimisation and evasion in Europe and you can count on my determination and that of the Commission to ensure that. I also believe, as always, that we must turn to the Member States because it is up to them to enforce these provisions more than those which dealt with the exchange of spontaneous information at the time.

The role of the banking industry in facilitating this large-scale tax fraud emphasises the need to hold tax administrations, banks and others responsible to account. The question is, why are the authorities not doing more to prevent this form of illegal tax evasion? And how is it that, every time these scandals are uncovered, it is left to investigative journalists to do all the work? In the TAX3 Committee, we will pay the utmost attention to these revelations and continue to work to find solutions to ensure effective legislation, efficient implementation and robust enforcement of rules across the EU.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, your exchanges this afternoon show that we all share three sentiments. First, a legitimate indignation at these new revelations. These are practices, as many have said, that must be stopped. Second, a sincere and profound recognition of journalists. This is further proof that the investigative press is an essential pillar of a real and vibrant democracy and it is a reminder that no one should attack press freedom in any way. Finally, our common determination to act is also a way of paying tribute to the work of these journalists. In this regard, let me correct what may appear to be a false impression: no, the repetition of scandals is not a sign of our impotence. There is always a time lag between what is revealed and the state of the law. The joint action that we have been taking on a continuous basis in recent years is not in vain, but it is the perpetual race. It's an old story between the constable and the thief. Our fight against tax evasion will never be over because, as I said, the imagination of fraudsters is limitless and the possibilities offered by technology must also be explored. These revelations thus show that fraudsters have been able to take full advantage of different laws between states, the lack of information between them and the specific provisions of bilateral conventions. From that point on, the lessons we public policy makers have to learn from it are that we simply have to put an end to purely national, piecemeal approaches, because it does not work. We are faced with international, European mechanisms and the answer must obviously be international and European. I want to make it clear that we now have rules and tools in place that allow states to alert their counterparts to fraud. It is not a question of means, it is a question of will and attitude. Member States need to understand that tax administration is an increasingly Europeanised area. I will ensure that this message is conveyed to the heads of tax administrations at their next meeting in Brussels. I have often had the opportunity to say this in this House: in order to be real, fiscal sovereignty must be exercised in common, at European level, otherwise we are deprived in the face of these phenomena which are for many cross-border phenomena.  I know that this paradigm shift is difficult for everyone, starting with the Member States, especially when it comes to taxation, because they consider - as we know - that this is one of the essential attributes of their regal power. But it is not a question of renouncing this sovereignty, it is a question of exercising it together at European level in order to work in the general interest of the European Union. It is a question of deciding on a collective approach that is the only one that can offer an answer that lives up to the ingenuity, again very great, of the fraudsters. With a coordinated tax policy, no more holes in our tax laws and finished, so the opportunities for fraud. That is the idea I will carry out when I put forward proposals for the change to a qualified majority in tax matters early next year. It is time to start the debate with the Member States. Several questions have been addressed to me about the possibility of extending the exchange of automatic information to dividends. I think it is a perspective that deserves to be explored. Let us recognise, however, that at this stage, when we are in your mandate in the European Parliament and ours in the Commission, this is something that will have to be dug deeper in time. But I want to tell you that we have already extended this exchange of information a great deal, that many Member States do not use the information they receive from other States and that it is important, even fundamental, to put in place what is already adopted. I do not deny the commission's responsibilities, and both the work of Parliament, the work of journalists, the change of mind on the international stage, have together given us tremendous opportunities to move forward. But still, I say, in particular to Mr Giegold, I appeal again and again to the Member States. Their responsibility for implementing what we have decided, including the completion of what is already proposed - such as the ACCIS project (consolidated common corporate tax base) or digital taxation - is absolutely major. Qualified majority or not, they have a responsibility. To us, institutions that embody the public interest, remind them, and I do so in the Council. I hope that under the Austrian Presidency, which is very active on these subjects, in particular on the CGTA and on digital taxation, we will have final results in this semester, because then it will be too late.

As such, I would say it is a crime against our societies everywhere in the world, our way of life, in particular in Europe, our principles and our values. It’s a crime against all of us. Three weeks after the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, we now know that he was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has now arrested a number of officials in connection with the case, yet too many details about what happened to the journalist are still missing. The confirmation of his death is a first step towards the truth and towards accountability, but the explanations offered so far by the Saudi authorities leave many doubts and many unanswered questions. From day one, we have been asking Saudi Arabia to shed light on the events of 2 October through a full, credible, transparent and prompt investigation. We expect the Saudi institutions to provide all the information they have about the case and to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. Last week, the Foreign Affairs Council – all 28 Foreign Ministers of the EU Member States – agreed to demand, united, a credible and transparent investigation. Together with the Foreign Ministers of the countries of the G7, we have coordinated our approach, first asking for a credible investigation and, right now at this moment, working on further statements and steps to be taken together. Just a few days ago, I expressed once again, on behalf of the whole European Union and of all our Member States, our expectation for clarity and full accountability. We have also asked Saudi Arabia for full collaboration with the Turkish authorities. We hope that everyone will work towards the goal of establishing the facts. This is the starting point. The investigation must be driven by the search for the truth, and not by geopolitics. We will not merely wait for more clarity or ask for it: we will also continue to act, together with our partners, for achieving clarity. The European Union’s reaction from now on will depend on the next steps taken by the Saudi authorities. We will continue, first of all, to coordinate among ourselves, with united European Union positions, but we will also continue to coordinate with our partners around the world and continue to follow the case and work to coordinate the appropriate reaction. As I said, this will have to be a united one at European level and together with our international partners. The Saudi leadership has promised ambitious reforms for the country. The way this investigation is managed is a very important test in terms of free speech, human rights and the rule of law for all the people of Saudi Arabia. Just a few months ago, our staff at the External Action Service in Brussels welcomed Jamal Khashoggi for a conference on Saudi Arabia and on the situation in the region. We engaged with him on several occasions as a credible and authoritative voice in the debate about his country and the Middle East. In his last op-ed, which was published after his death, he asked for a free and independent platform for Arab voices. Through the years we, as the European Union, have worked precisely to support young and independent Arab voices. We have trained young Arab journalists, we have financed independent media and we have engaged in policy dialogues through initiatives such as Young Mediterranean Voices.  Free speech lies at the core of our values and it will continue to be the basis for our foreign policy. We believe that national interest can never be a justification for curbing freedom of speech. On the contrary, when basic human rights are violated, our countries get weaker. I think this is the voice that needs to be heard at this point in history from the European Union and from this Parliament, united. It’s a point of strength to respect and protect human rights, starting with freedom of speech. It’s not a point of weakness. It’s a point of strength of our societies. (Applause) When fundamental freedoms come under attack there can be no peace, no security and no human development. Repression makes states and societies weaker and not stronger. Jamal Khashoggi had always advocated not only free speech, but also greater tolerance and respect for diversity. Reading some of his words today is quite painful, thinking of the way in which the story ended, but the best way we have to honour his memory is to be firm and determined in asking for the truth and working for the truth – not only for the truth, but also for accountability, which is different both from scapegoating and from revenge. It is important for us to say this now. We will not only ask for justice, but we will also keep working for justice, for free speech and human rights in Saudi Arabia, in the region – in the whole region of the Gulf – and everywhere in the world.

After hiding two weeks behind lies and disinformation, the Saudi Foreign Minister finally admitted that yes, it was a tremendous mistake. While the whole truth has still to be fully revealed, at this moment it is practically impossible to believe that the Saudi Crown Prince was not informed of the murderers’ plan. Stopping arms sales to this country, at least on a temporary basis, is absolutely needed. The moral we cannot escape is the following: in autocratic systems, even under the so-called modern reformers, worse things can still happen. Real reforms can succeed only under democratic transparency and control. A critical Khashoggi could have been an integral part of credible reforms in Saudi Arabia.

This is an unprecedented crime and case in the history of the world, at least since the Second World War. Never, never have we seen such a case!  I also feel the need to emphasise that this is one of a long series of human rights violations and widespread crackdowns by the autocratic and discriminatory regime on prominent activists – journalists and writers, lawyers and human rights defenders – oppression that has intensified since 2017. Finally, I would like to insist on what are probably the two most important points. First, the explanations given by Riyadh are insufficient and absolutely not credible. They are mostly a whitewash of an appalling and flagrant assassination and violation of human rights, and of diplomatic and consular law.  The second: these events ask for a collective, clear and loud response that goes beyond the short-lived international uproar. It is time to reconsider western relations with the Kingdom. Whereas I can only welcome the position of some Member States, as well as economic actors and international organisations, to boycott today’s future investment initiative in Riyadh, what is key is to have real measures to target those responsible beyond the number of operatives which were acting in Istanbul.

Clearly, there is more to come and an international investigation into the case is urgently needed, as called for by France, the UK and Germany. I also note the comments made by the British Foreign Secretary in which, pending the investigation, a UK arms embargo has not been excluded.

However, we have also witnessed a young despot consolidating his power at home and intervening more widely and aggressively abroad, from the Saudi blockade of Qatar and the atrocious bombing campaign in Yemen to the support for jihadists in Syria. The brazenness and the location of Khashoggi’s murder are, however, without precedent, and the use of torture crosses the line which makes this an international crime under the Torture Convention of 1987.

Reconstructing exactly what happened on October 2 is difficult. The only sure fact is that Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate and never came out alive, probably came out quite in pieces, in a briefcase. The usual ballet of statements began immediately. The latest version is that it was a \"rogue\" operation conducted by the secret services without, of course, Prince Salman and the intelligence chiefs being aware of it. The truth, we all guessed it from the beginning. Never before has we needed a strong signal from us, because in the midst of so many doubts only one thing is clear: Khashoggi was killed also because those responsible believed that they could do it with impunity. Crushing internal dissent works best when it is accompanied by the deafening silence that comes from outside, which, in fact, makes those who dare not dare to protest complicit. Khashoggi is not an isolated case, but a real modus operandi case against dissidents. Kidnappings, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and vicious smear campaigns are sadly common practice. Despite all this, Saudi Arabia inexplicably sits on the UN Human Rights Council. Even in a world of masks and hypocrisy, as ours has become – in other circumstances, turkish rebukes in Riyadh would make us smile – there must be a limit. The king, or rather the prince, is now naked. In the Saudi kingdom, leaf does not fall without him being fully informed. What will be our answer? Will we hide once again behind false indignation, a whisper in a storm, unless we return in a short time to business as usual? How many more Khashoggi, how many more Badawis will we have to tolerate? As long as impunity reigns, as long as the multimillion-dollar contract business triumphs over rights we will have cases like Khashoggi's.

This very much supports and strengthens the work and the words that weʼve been doing and saying in recent weeks, namely that we want to know the truth, that we want justice, and that we will not settle for anything less. We will continue to demand a full, credible and transparent investigation. As this Parliament was debating this murder, we released a common G7 statement going exactly in the same direction, which I think is a good message of unity and strength. We, as the European Union – and myself personally – have been very explicit so far, and we will continue to do so. We are also united. As you know – and as some of you have said – individual Member States have either taken steps or indicated that they would be willing to take steps. Some have decided to withdraw their participation from events in Saudi Arabia and have announced other possible measures. Collectively, I believe that, as the European Union and in the Council in particular (so here I would have to cross the Chamber and sit on the other side), collectively we will have to monitor the situation as it continues to evolve in the coming days – hopefully not weeks – and decide on any measure to be taken collectively, as the European Union, based on, first and foremost, the steps that are taken by the Saudi authorities to establish the truth and to bring those responsible to justice. As I said, accountability, not revenge or any fig leaf that could hide real responsibilities. I can also point to the fact that those of you who have taken the floor come from different political groups and different countries. Most of you come from parties that have a majority in the national governments. Maybe there is something you can also do when it comes to your national governments’ positions. It’s true that there are different attitudes among Member States at the moment on some of the measures. I notice that there are also different attitudes within government coalitions in single countries that are quite evident in this Chamber. So we can all work on more unity, and I think we have the duty to do so in the coming days: to react properly, rationally, united and in coordination with our international partners. I also want to thank the Parliament for a second reason, and I will finish with that. This debate was important, but the constant focus that you help us to put on freedom of speech and the support we give – not only to journalists around the world, but also to human rights activists, civil society organisations, and to political opposition in some cases – is vital. This will remain at the core of our foreign policy, with one key element that some of you mentioned today and that to me is really vital, namely that this is done, and will continue to be done, in the case of the European Union, regardless of geopolitics. It’s not because we like one country more than another; it’s not because one country is more, or less, credible than another that we will stay more silent. We will continue to support civil society, human rights, journalists and activists everywhere in the world, and we will continue to denounce and to oppose all measures against a free, open society everywhere in the world. We will continue to engage in every situation where freedom and human rights are under attack, whoever the victim, wherever it takes place and whatever the country.

We do not and we will not recognise the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula to the Russian Federation.  It is first and foremost a matter of principles, values – principles and values that all European nations agreed in Helsinki in 1975. We all agreed to the basic principle that our frontiers cannot be changed by military force. And this is a principle, it is a value, on which our common living together is based, but it is also a fundamental interest of all Europeans, because this is the foundation of peace and security on our European continent.  When this principle is violated, as it has been, we are all less secure in our continent and the events in the Sea of Azov are a demonstration of this. When the basic rules of peaceful coexistence are disregarded, instability and tensions are bound to rise. The construction of the Kerch Bridge between the Crimean Peninsula and the Russian Federation took place without Ukraine’s consent and it constitutes another violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. On top of that, the bridge hinders the passage of vessels to Ukrainian ports, to the Azov Sea.  Six months ago, Russia started to apply a new inspection regime for cargo vessels coming from Ukrainian ports in the Azov Sea or heading towards them. These inspections lead to long delays, which have increased dramatically over the past months. This has direct consequences on shipping costs, not only for Ukrainian exporters but also for vessels flying a European Union Member State flag. So far, more than 200 vessels, under both Ukrainian and international flags, have been affected by these controls by Russia, which in some cases lasted several days.  Even more worrying, tougher controls on naval traffic in the strait have come in parallel with the militarisation of the Azov Sea. Russia has recently started deploying military vessels to the area in significant numbers and Ukraine has partially responded with an increased military presence.  Let me recall that the Azov Sea used to be almost fully demilitarised and that Ukraine and Russia have signed a cooperation agreement on the use of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait. This agreement implies that disputes between the parties are to be resolved through consultations and negotiations. We appreciate that Ukraine is seeking justice in international courts, such as the ongoing case under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  When international law is violated, when Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are violated, the European Union stands by the people of Ukraine. We immediately condemned the construction of the Kerch Bridge without Ukraine’s consent, in July. The Council added six entities involved in the construction of the bridge to the list of those subject to restrictive measures over actions that undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  A militarisation of the Azov Sea is in no one’s interest and it can only destabilise the delicate security situation in the wider Black Sea region. And let me remind us all that the Black Sea is a European sea and we do not want to witness yet another military build-up in our immediate region. So we will continue to push for the respect of international law and conventions, and to support Ukraine in these challenging circumstances. I am sure I can count on the support of this Parliament in this work we are doing.

The European Union must ensure that there is no technical and military cooperation with the Russian Federation, which may also strengthen the operational capability of the Russian navy. In my opinion, it is essential for the EU to consider how projects can strengthen the ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk. And the EU and NATO must clarify whether they can prevent further escalation through escorts and presence in the region. In any case, new sanctions should be discussed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 232, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Jaromír Kohlíček", "mepid": "28331", "text": "  on the part of the GUE/NGL Group. – Madam President, the Sea of Azov is actually the Gulf of the Black Sea between Crimea and the southern Russian steppe.

These decisions show that Washington, like Kiev, is seeking a confrontation with Russia, in defiance of the Minsk agreements. Once again, the European Union is complicit in this rise to extremes by supporting NATO and its recent military exercises in Ukraine.

That was not with me personally but with our services, on 11 October, and, it helped to prepare for this plenary and helped with the work we are constantly doing on this issue. Keeping the focus on this is essential, for different reasons, and the speakers all mentioned them. First of all, for our principles and values; and then for Ukraine’s sovereignty, and also for the economy – both that of Ukraine and that of the European Union, as the speakers have emphasised – and for our collective security.

Let me assure you, too, that part of the next EU-Ukraine Association Council that I will chair in a couple of months from now – together, I believe, with the Ukrainian Prime Minister – will also focus on to how to address this issue in the best possible manner, and what kind of support the European Union can give to Ukraine in this context. Among other issues on which we are supporting Ukraine, this is also extremely important.  I would like quickly to touch upon a couple of points that were raised, not probably all of them, but a couple of them. Some of you referred to the need to uphold international principles, including the international courts and legislation. As I said at the beginning, we appreciate that Ukraine is seeking justice in the international courts. You know that there is an ongoing case under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). So we trust the international courts, and in this case UNCLOS, as we always do, upholding international jurisdictions. The second point concerns the sanctions. As I mentioned before, we included new persons on our sanctions list in relation to the construction of the bridge. Some of you referred to the implementation of these sanctions. As you know very well, it is for the European Council, in unanimity, to adopt the sanctions and measures, but then it is for Member States to monitor their implementation and to take appropriate measures if needed. Obviously, as the Commission, we have our own say in pushing this monitoring of implementation by Member States, but it is very much an issue that lies in their hands. We will continue to assess the situation and the developments in the Sea of Azov.

Tensions are continuing to rise, social and economic conditions are clearly worsening quite dramatically, and, against this background, over two million Venezuelans have decided to leave the country. We often refer to crises caused by migration to Europe. I would invite you to look at these numbers. There are, as I said, two million Venezuelans fleeing to Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and the Caribbean. Among those people, some are European citizens, so here we have an inverse situation: as you might know, nearly one million EU nationals have dual citizenship. There are also people of European descent who live in Venezuela, although many of them have already left the country. Even though an ocean geographically divides us, we Europeans cannot stand on the sidelines of this crisis. It concerns us simply because of the number of EU nationals who are also Venezuelans, not to mention the social, cultural and economic ties that exist between Europe and Venezuela.  Our response so far has been both humanitarian and political. On the humanitarian side, we are currently mobilising EUR 35 million in assistance to Venezuelans both within and outside the country. We are investing in health assistance, food and water sanitation. We are working to support the socio—economic inclusion of Venezuelans and to help the local economies of host communities in neighbouring countries. Half of this EUR 35 million package is already being implemented in near-record time and the remainder will be made operational by early next year. We are also exploring the possibility of further increasing the Commission’s financial support beyond this already very significant contribution. We have welcomed the appointment of Eduardo Stein as a UNHCR-IOM Joint Special Representative for Venezuelan refugees and migrants, and, with the Foreign Ministers of the 28 Member States, we had the opportunity to discuss the Venezuelan migration crisis last Monday in Luxembourg during the Foreign Affairs Council, expressing our support to both Mr Grandi and Mr Vitorino for this work, which we want to be joint work. On that occasion we had both Mr Grandi and Mr Vitorino with us. We didn’t focus purely on issues relating to migration and Europe, and I believe that to be right. We stand ready to support any further coordinated action, both at regional and international level, to address this humanitarian crisis more effectively. But the only possible solution is political. Last week – again with the Foreign Affairs Council, with the Foreign Ministers – we discussed what more the European Union can do to prevent a further deterioration in the situation or help change the course of these negative developments. Ministers from all 28 Member States have confirmed that, first of all, any sustainable political solution to the Venezuelan crisis has to be democratic and peaceful, and those are the two pillars that are guiding our action. External intervention or any use of force would simply be unacceptable to us and would make things much worse.  Our immediate request to the Government of Venezuela is that it takes unilateral confidence-building measures to ease tensions, first and foremost by restoring the full constitutional powers of the National Assembly and respecting the immunity of its members, releasing all political prisoners and taking concrete steps to restore political pluralism and guarantee respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We expect, in particular, a full, independent and impartial investigation into the circumstances of Councillor Albán’s death. It is the duty of the State to ensure the safety and physical integrity of all people in its custody. Finally, we ask the Government to allow free, credible and transparent elections with full respect for the Constitution. On all these points, we have not changed our minds. You have heard them and have said as much yourselves several times. The requests from our side remain on the table and we don’t intend to change our minds on these starting points: the people of Venezuela are simply asking for democracy, and this crisis will end only with a political process heading in that direction. This is very clear to us Europeans.  In response to the human rights violations in Venezuela and the ongoing attack on democratic institutions, we decided a year ago to impose targeted restrictive measures on a number of individuals who are responsible for the current situation. This is the first time that we are imposing these kinds of measures in Latin America and, as you can imagine, we didn’t take the decision lightly. We took it not only because of the deteriorating situation, but also as a message for the authorities in Venezuela, with which we are keeping a channel of dialogue open, to commit themselves seriously to a negotiated political solution to the current crisis. Today, the situation has not improved at all. On the contrary. So we are sticking to our decision, and the restrictive measures will stay for as long as human rights are violated and democratic principles are disregarded. We do not intend to soften our position while there is no substantive progress on the ground. At the Foreign Affairs Council last week, we started a discussion with the Ministers on what else we, as the European Union and as Member States, can do, in addition to these positions and the decision to continue the sanctions, to end the downward spiral and help start some kind of political process, as the absence of a political process might in itself lead to a further deterioration in the situation. So we will explore, first of all together with Latin American countries, the possibility of establishing a contact group with relevant and interested countries, not only from the region, and international players. We don’t think that, at this point in time, mediation or a dialogue would have any chance of succeeding. I want to be very clear on that point. It’s not a question of buying time. No way. The conditions for either a dialogue or for mediation are not there, but an international initiative – a European initiative together with others – could, with plenty of question marks, help build the conditions that would eventually make it possible to relaunch a political process. For the moment, this is just a possibility that we are exploring. I don’t want to raise expectations. We are simply worried about the lack of a political process and, personally, I don’t want to be in a position, six months or a year from now, of looking back and asking whether we could have done more on the political side to prevent the situation from deteriorating even further.  So again, without raising expectations or launching an initiative today, the idea is simply to explore whether it might be possible to put something in place that could help create the conditions for something to happen in the future. I believe that we should try any peaceful option to end the current stalemate and prevent a violent escalation because, if the situation does not improve –  and we do not see the situation improving – an escalation of violence cannot be ruled out, and that would mean even greater suffering for the people of Venezuela. This is an option that we have to avert and prevent. We don’t want to impose any outside outsourced solution. That is never the European approach. We believe in democracy, we believe in ownership, we believe in cooperation and we believe in respect. We believe that the future of Venezuela – and also the present of Venezuela – must be written by its people and no one else, without any external intervention. But we will do everything we can to help the Venezuelan people take the future and the present of the country back into their hands. I am looking forward to listening to your views.

It is true that aid is needed to support neighbouring nations in meeting the enormous humanitarian effort to ensure a dignified reception for all refugees, but we need a long-term peaceful solution, and that is why Europe will need to step up its international mediation effort with the Venezuelan Government in order to put an end to the violation of rights and the restoration of democracy.

These ad hoc attempts at dialogue with the illegitimate and dictatorial regime, which is part of the problem and not the solution, only serve to weaken the Union's joint position and fuel the oxygen balloon of a government that has transformed a democratic and prosperous nation into a narco-state that condemns its own citizens to the most abject tyranny and misery.

Sorry, I am being blunt, but I want to start from just describing the situation as I have seen it in the past four years and still saw it last week. There is no Member State asking for a review of our sanctions policy and there is no Member State arguing that we should currently engage in mediation. We have to start from a point of clarity and truth about this. We can be against something but if nobody else is proposing that something then it’s a pure exercise of rhetoric. I think we need to discuss things as they are. Things as they are currently are as I described them at the start – and maybe some of you joined the debate after my initial contribution – that we are keeping our position exactly as it has been in recent years, on the need for freeing the political prisoners, the need for elections, the need to have the constitution fully respected and applied, and so on and so forth. We are keeping our sanctions in place. As I said, that was quite something because it was the first time we had introduced targeted sanctions in Latin America, which was not a decision taken lightly by our Member States. They were united on that, and they continue to be united in that respect. In the meantime, we are saying two things, and I think we can agree on these two things. One: that the solution has to be peaceful, and I would have liked to have heard that a bit more clearly in some of the speeches from around the Chamber, because the idea of some form of military pressure or intervention is floating around. I think that, as Europeans, we are fully united on the fact that, in Venezuela, any sort of military pressure or intervention could actually be counterproductive because we know the nature of Maduro’s attitude. That is all he is waiting for. Come on! The negative outside effect could strengthen the fight against the outside. And we are worried: not worried, or at least I am not worried, about having an ideological fight as to whether we support one kind of ideology or the other, but we are seriously concerned about the situation of a country that has millions of people in a difficult situation, among them one million European citizens. So we care: we care about finding a solution. How can that solution be found? The European position – which I think has been reflected well in the great majority of your positions – is first that any solution can only be a political, peaceful solution; and second, and equally importantly, that it has to be a democratic outcome – a democratic outcome, involving all Venezuelans because, as I said earlier, we are not, and we will never be, in favour of an external imposed solution. It has to be a Venezuelan solution and it has to involve all Venezuelans. This is the difficulty of the simple exercise of looking for democracy. This is the balanced, united position that the European Union has stressed in recent weeks. We will now try to explore whether the conditions exist for establishing the contact group. As I said, I would not want to raise expectations, because I think this is extremely complicated as an exercise. However, I think it’s worth trying not to initiate a mediation process or a dialogue but to see if the conditions are in place to establish a contact group that could start working on establishing the conditions – which are currently not there – for re-launching this political process. I said this very clearly at the beginning, perhaps some of you were not there when I said it. I want to say something else very clearly, even if I ought to be sitting on the Council side to say it, namely that I have seen no divisions among Member States on this position. I have seen a very clearly united stand behind this effort that we are now starting to explore. One last point on the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation. Some of you raised this. Currently, a preliminary examination is being conducted by the office of the ICC prosecutor and, as you know, the European Union is a strong supporter – probably the strongest supporter – of the ICC’s role in bringing perpetrators to justice. So we now trust the ICC prosecutor’s assessment on whether or not the Rome Statute requirements to initiate an investigation have been met in the case of Venezuela. We trust the ICC, as an institution, to carry out the preliminary examination that is currently being undertaken, and then we’ll take it from there.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 284, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   Motions for resolutions to be tabled in accordance with Rule 123(2) (or Rule 128(5) of the Rules of Procedure will be announced at a later date.

The most recent to receive this accusation is Mr. Julio Borges, President of the National Assembly and awarded the Sakharov Prize. In any case, it is not for me to judge the facts, so I support the need for an independent and transparent investigation with international experts to clarify the facts and convict the culprits.

This Parliament has indeed always shown great dedication to protection of the rule of law, of democracy and of fundamental rights in our Union.  The protection and promotion of our core values as stated in Article 2 of the Treaty of the European Union is a constant challenge. This challenge requires unwavering attention and effort across all institutions and all policy areas. Democracy, freedom, equality, the rule of law and human rights are the cornerstones of the European Union. Each Member State must therefore respect, protect and promote them.  The Austrian Presidency, and indeed all of us, agree that protection of the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights in our Union cannot be taken for granted. To address this challenge, the Council and a Member State established a meeting within the Council, the so-called ‘annual rule of law dialogue’. The last rule of law dialogue was organised by the Estonian Presidency in October 2017 on media pluralism and the rule of law in a digital age. The next rule of law dialogue will be organised in November by the Austrian Presidency. It will deal with the issue of trust in public institutions and rule of law. From the beginning we were aware that the Council’s response to rule of law issues needed to be reviewed at a regular pace and if needed, improved or adapted to current challenges. The last evaluation in 2016 showed, among others, that the preparation of dialogues should be more systematic and include the organisation of other accompanying events. This would provide for the possibility to assemble broad input at expert level, including the involvement of other EU institutions or other institutional organisations.  The Estonian Presidency and now our Presidency have followed these recommendations and included experts in the preparation of the annual ministerial dialogue. By the end of 2019 the Council will conduct a re—evaluation of the rule of law dialogue and consider ways to further strengthen it. In the meantime, the Council must task it with conducting two Article 7 procedures, on Poland and Hungary. Since the procedure was triggered, every General Affairs Council meeting has discussed the situation in Poland and in Hungary.  Of course, the Council is not acting alone in these matters of fundamental importance. The Presidency notes with interest the commitment of this Parliament and its legislative initiative report on the establishment of an EU mechanism on democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights. In addition, the Commission plays a vital role in monitoring developments in this field across the Union.  We also wish to highlight the role played by the Council of Europe and the Venice Commission in these questions and I note that in its working programme 2019, the Commission indicated that it would come up with a further strengthening of the 2014 rule of law framework. Let me conclude by stressing that safeguarding democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights goes to the heart of our commitment to this Union. The success of this political project will be measured by its ability and determination to uphold these core values. We will play our part.

Like Parliament, the Commission is deeply committed to ensuring that our common European values, including in particular democracy and the rule of law, are respected. I believe the actions of the Commission over the past four years leave no grounds for any doubt on that matter. So we agree on the end, and the discussion between us is about identifying the best means.  The developments which have occurred over the past two years have only made the Commission more convinced of the importance of using the instruments we already have to uphold EU values in the most effective way. The diversity of challenges we are facing requires a diversity of responses at EU level. Among these developments, the deterioration of the situation with the rule of law in Poland led the Commission, in December 2017, to initiate the procedure set out in Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union. Last month Parliament decided to initiate the same procedure as regards Hungary. These are unprecedented steps in the history of our Union. The Commission has recently launched a number of values-related infringement proceedings, and with regard to the Polish Law on the Supreme Court we have also invited the Court of Justice to impose interim measures. In addition, we have used other instruments, including audits and investigations relating to the use of EU funds, as well as measures through the European Semester to monitor justice reforms in Member States. The Commission has used its powers as initiator of legislation to propose, as a key component of our next Multiannual Financial Framework, a regulation on protecting the Union’s budget in the event of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. The rules we propose would allow the Union to suspend, reduce or restrict access to EU funding when generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law impair or threaten to impair sound financial management or the Union’s financial interest. These actions show the Commission’s determination to use all of the instruments at its disposal to address value-related concerns. In each case the Commission uses the instruments that we consider can be most effective. However, this does not mean there is no need to improve the EU’s capacity to promote and uphold our common values. On the contrary, we need to make better use of the enforcement toolbox at our disposal. Parliament’s 2016 resolution contained a number of ideas that the Commission supports: for example, setting up an interparliamentary dialogue between the European Parliament and national parliaments. The national parliaments are involved in many of the problems related to the rule of law that we have witnessed recently in some Member States. Such interparliamentary dialogue could, as a first step, discuss the various options and the means currently on the table to ensure that our common values are respected and enforced. The Commission will be ready to contribute to such a dialogue. The Commission also supports the aim of making the variety of existing data and reports more accessible and visible including a national level. The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights has a role to play in this respect.  There are other elements in the resolution which continue to raise questions. For example, the Commission maintains its strong doubts about the need for and the feasibility of an annual report and a policy cycle on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights, prepared by a committee of experts. The central role attributed to an independent expert panel raises serious questions of legality, institutional legitimacy and accountability. Furthermore, the recent developments show that the problem we have is not a lack of reporting mechanisms in Europe, but rather a lack of capacity to act and enforce the rule of law and uphold our values in an effective manner. We know the facts. We need to act. For this reason, as was also announced in the letter of intent which accompanied Jean-Claude Juncker’s State of the Union speech and which was just today confirmed by the Work Programme, the Commission intends to present an initiative on further strengthening the 2014 Rule of Law framework. The initiative will draw lessons from the experiences of recent years. It will also take due account of the work of the European Parliament, including your resolution on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights mechanism, and the discussion that has ensued.  To conclude, I can assure you that the Commission is ready to continue the discussion with you to determine how best the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights can be promoted and upheld.

We do not disagree on the deficiencies we see in this area because they are numerous and they are becoming more and more pervasive. The number of states that would now have to be listed if the list of states in which the rule of law is not what it should be, is increasing. Instead of going back to what we demanded in a resolution a few years ago, I would just like to point out the main observation and the main problem in my view. Unfortunately, we do not agree in Europe on how to govern. And what we need to hear when we go to Hungary or elsewhere, Poland, Romania, Malta, Slovakia - the list will probably grow even longer - is not what we would expect in other parts of Europe. And I would remind you that Parliament has made this observation by saying precisely, for this reason, that we must have a permanent interaction with each other, representatives of all the Member States, on how we can govern legitimately and on what we should not do in Europe if we are to claim common values. common principles, a common governance base.

Unfortunately, the Commission has shown no particular zeal to take up this proposal, unlike some Member States, where there has been very positive feedback.  Such a mechanism, also known as the DRF package, would help us to ensure a more effective and sustainable safeguarding of fundamental democratic rights. The starting point is simple. It is true that the Copenhagen criteria have a clear hurdle to becoming a member of the Union. Once this is done, there are hardly any adequate means to punish a non-observance or willful violation. The existing instruments are often too powerful and too under-targeted to influence threatening developments at an early stage.  Once the problems are addressed at EU level, criticism from the Member States concerned is usually stylised as an external threat and it is very difficult to solve the problem. We have seen this time and again in recent years. The new mechanism, on the other hand, proposes interlinking existing instruments, starts at an early stage and puts all Member States – the old and the new – on an equal footing. A democracy scoreboard, similar to the Venice Commission, is developing a format that opens up possibilities for comparison and starts at an early stage.

The actions taken by the Commission and the European Parliament were selective, arbitrary and extremely politicised. For example, even the \"greatest friends\" (in quotes) of my country acknowledged in the back room that another Member State could also be of concern to them.  And that's the way it is. This is by no means the case, for example, malta mentioned here by a colleague. Take, for example, a country that is considered a model of liberal democracy. I mean Germany. For decades, the judicial community in Germany has been demanding reforms that fully implement the principles of democracy, the tripartite power and judicial independence in the German justice system. Calls for judicial reform were made before the 2017 Bundestag elections. Neue Richtervereinigung, for example, issued the so-called Berlin appeal, which included the following statement, and I quote: 'The Federal Republic of Germany, as a member of the Union, may request that third parties comply with the subjective rules in a credible manner if it organises itself in this way. That is why we demand a commitment to ensure that the German judicial system meets the principles of separation of powers, which has long been part of the European standard.\" However, these demands have not yet been met, and the Deutscher Richterverbund published its position on 11 September 2018 entitled 'The third authority must govern itself', which states, inter alia, that the judiciary and the public prosecutor's office in the German Federal Republic are dependent on the executive and that many Länder decide on the employment and promotion of judges and prosecutors by the Minister of Justice. It is therefore called for personal decisions to be taken within the judicial self-government. This is the request of the judges. Recently, as you know, public opinion in Germany has been appalled by the question of filling the posts of judges at the Constitutional Tribunal in Brandenburg, where, as usual, the various seats are shared between large political parties. This time, the SPD decided to appoint, among other things, a politically engaged writer with no judicial experience, who was so sensible that she signed up for the party a year ago. I could multiply these examples. The same is true in many other countries where judges can be members of a political party. There is political influence everywhere on the choice of judges.  I therefore ask, Mr Timmermans: why, then, has the European Commission not taken action to ensure that the German Federal Republic respects the values set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. You can answer: because Germany is Germany, and Poland is Poland. But such thinking will lead sooner or later to the disaster of the Union, and perhaps of Europe.  But this catastrophe could also lead to the belief that it is the official of the European Commission or the European Parliament who would decide the rule of law or constitutionality in a country. Moreover, nothing would be a greater violation of the principle of constitutionality and the rule of law, and the proposed mechanism for verifying democracy and the rule of law would be a denial of it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 292, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Sophia in 't Veld", "mepid": "28266", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, in today’s EU, independent judges are being dismissed, journalists are threatened and even murdered, NGOs are harassed and intimidated. In the last two years alone, since we adopted the proposal for the DRF Pact, two Article 7 procedures have been launched: one by Parliament and one by the Commission. The Commission has also launched infringement cases and took a Member State to court. The Council organised hearings on the rule of law in that same Member State, and Parliament created the rule of law monitoring group for two other Member States, as well as a plenary debate on yet another Member State. So a lot is being done – and I have to commend the Commissioner for his actions – but it is piecemeal and erratic. It is too little and, too often, too late. We need a pan-European mechanism for democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights in the EU that is comprehensive and not fragmented; evidence based, not politicised; one that monitors all Member States annually and is not ad hoc or incident-driven. Exactly two years ago in this House, we adopted such a proposal: the DRF Pact. We proposed a fully—fledged interinstitutional agreement that we could have agreed on today. So why have the Commission and the Council so far failed to act on our proposal? You work on the rule of law, but your refusal to agree the comprehensive DRF Pact means that forces that demolish our way of life are always ahead of us. So it’s time to act because, Commissioner, I don’t agree with you. The toolkit that we currently have at our disposal is visibly not enough. So, as the Commission and Member States drag their feet, Parliament should move ahead anyway.

This is all the more so in view of the risk that the issue of the rule of law will become an area of electoral contention or between States, that it will be called into question selectively on the basis of party political considerations, leading in fact to a draining of the rule of law itself.

Mr President, a genuinely democratic Europe should respect the sovereignty of each of its European nations, but the European Union does not. It is scandalously interfering in the internal affairs of some of its Member States, such as Hungary, Poland or now Romania. Even more seriously, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 25 October 2016, envisioned the vade-mecum of the political tutelage of the Member States. It recommends that a panel of experts, elected by no one and out of nowhere, be entrusted with the power to rate states as children on respect for different principles. The separation of powers, freedom of expression or the independence of the judiciary. In an involuntary tribute to the French poet, Jacques Prévert, who would have laughed, the resolution instructs this panel of experts to give notes of color to the states. Green to the good guys, orange to suspects and red to the bad guys. For the States that get a red note, the sanction is terrible, it is the activation of Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union that leads to the suspension of the right to vote of the offending State in the Council.

Having such a mechanism would be a huge step forward and would go some way in allaying the fears of so many citizens in Europe from different States who look to us when their rights are in danger, or when their institutions cannot be relied on or when the promise that is Europe is under threat.  This is not about going after any single state or government. It is about making the protection of the rights we have future—proof. Our focus must be on protection, about building up systems, about helping people and not about punishment.  Having this mechanism will mean that every Member State will be subjected to the same level of scrutiny. It will remove the politics from that equation and create equality among States. It will mean that governments who think that they have carte blanche to do as they please after winning an election will be in for a surprise. It will give Europe the tools to act.

I have two points that I want to make. One is that, in reaching this objective, we must not dismiss what we are currently doing, and not give an excuse to anyone to diminish the work that has been done, either by the Commission or by Members of Parliament here on these fundamental rights mechanisms under Article 7. To do so would be to diminish the key work that has been done and that will also happen when we have this other mechanism that is less crisis-driven, because what I mean by that is the capacity to act in case of a breach, the capacity to uphold the rule of law, and indeed human rights, will be difficult in this mechanism also. It will be difficult to monitor every Member State, and to act when there is something wrong there, so please, bear this in mind.  So, to ensure that we complete the work that we are doing currently, but then in the future we look at this mechanism, and yes, hopefully we fulfil the 2016 resolution.

Member States and the Commission must meet deadlines and budgets. Within the estimated cost schedule, the new SIS must be fully operational. The impact of this reform is profound. The new Schengen Information System will change the way border police authorities share information in Europe. We don't need more information, we need better information. We will better protect our children, not only when the worst has already happened and we do not know their whereabouts, on the contrary, through new alerts for children at risk. We will be able to prevent these abductions or realities as dramatic as genital mutilation, but we will also improve the safety of all through closer monitoring of so-called foreign fighters and other criminals, through new means of obtaining information, inquiry checks, through better biomedical data such as fingerprints and facial images. It will be possible not only to carry out research with these elements, but also to search throughout Europe for perpetrators of unknown crimes, but whose fingerprint was found at the crime scene.  We will improve controls at our external borders. We are carry out the largest ever revision of the bans on entry into Schengen. It will be virtually impossible for anyone refused by Portugal to be able to enter Germany, but certain requirements will have to be met.  We improve the responsiveness of the system, increase its processing capacity, and strengthen your defenses against potential attacks, security issues, or simple failures. And we ask for more effectiveness from the Member States. The response times of the Siren Offices have been shortened and requests for information in cases relating to children or terrorism require immediate response. Last but not least, we put The SIS at the heart of European action by providing access to Frontex and Europol, further increasing the value of its action. I am confident, Mr President, that tomorrow this House will approve without reservation the third reform of the Schengen Information System. I believe that more Europe, which more SIS allows better information and better coordination, allows more security and more freedom.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 321, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Jeroen Lenaers", "mepid": "95074", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, let me first of all thank Mr Carlos Coelho, Commissioners King and Avromopoulos and all the shadow rapporteurs who worked with us on this result, and of course the Council, in particular the Estonian and Bulgarian Presidency. I think we have achieved a very good result. The Schengen Information System is a crucial part of our security policy. It is a part that actually works very well, but about which we often hear very little. It is crucial that national authorities, the police, the judiciary can access information about, for example, wanted persons, persons who need to be monitored discreetly, who need to be apprehended, missing persons and missing children, but also stolen items such as cars, passports or weapons. Let me mention some numbers to tell you what happens to that system. It is consulted five billion times a year. We've included over 70 million of these kinds of alerts in that system. 450 times a day in the EU we have a hit based on this system. We have arrested 40 000 suspects on the basis of this system, 150 000 people refused at the border, 28 000 missing persons found, 200 000 objects recovered. These are all very impressive figures, but we can always do better and it always has to be better, and that is why this reform of the Schengen Information System. Carlos Coelho has already said a number of things, so let me go a little deeper into one specific part, which is to include return decisions in the Schengen Information System. This is an important step, because we all know that today we are struggling to actually return people who have not been granted asylum in Europe and who actually have to return to their country of origin. At present, only 37% of cases succeed. This means that in almost two thirds of cases, people who have come here, who have not been granted asylum, will still stay. That number, that percentage must definitely go up, if we want to maintain support under the common asylum policy. This needs to be improved and the Schengen Information System can help.  Now, when a Member State has decided not to grant asylum and a person has to go back to the country of origin, we offer a voluntary return, so to speak, put a check mark behind it and believe that it is good. There are two problems here. First of all, we don't know if that person actually left. Secondly, if that person turns up in another Member State, the authorities there often do not know that a return decision has already been taken in another country and we start from scratch. We are solving these two problems today. Once someone has actually crossed the EU's external border, the original Member State is informed and corrected so that we can focus our energies on the people who are still here. From now on, police forces can see in the system whether someone has already been identified as a person who has to return to their country of origin, so that cooperation is much easier to make that happen efficiently. This is an important step towards making the return policy more efficient. At the same time, we must therefore be careful. It is precisely for this reason that we in the European Parliament have ensured that the guarantees in this area are also seriously strengthened. When a return decision is suspended or postponed, the alert is removed. The principle of non-refoulement and the Geneva Convention are explicitly incorporated. Safeguards in the field of data protection are being greatly improved, both in terms of data retention and cooperation with third countries in this area. So in summary, Mr President, we have managed to bring the return policy one step closer to real efficiency, while at the same time ensuring that the safeguards and rights of individuals are respected at all times. That is a very good result and we should be proud of that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 322, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am very pleased to be here with you tonight for the final debate on our three proposals for a reinforced Schengen Information System. I would like to thank wholeheartedly the rapporteurs, Mr Coelho and Mr Lenaers; the shadow rapporteurs, their teams and all those involved on this file for enabling us to have this debate tonight. This agreement was the result of intense work and I would like to congratulate them for it. At the core, the Schengen Information System is about one thing: trust. The trust to share sensitive information with EU partners. The trust to follow up on alerts shared by EU partners. The trust to rely on the Schengen Information System when the security of our citizens is at stake. The SIS today contains over 80 million alerts on wanted and missing persons and objects. Just last year it was accessed 5.2 billion times. Since 2013, when we first had SIS in its current form, it has led to 50 000 arrests and the tracking of 200 000 serious criminals. These numbers are clear testament to its value for our Member States. It is no exaggeration to say that it is the centrepiece of our security cooperation in Europe and our most important instrument for information exchange in the European Union. It was against this background that we proposed – in December 2016, as you will remember – to further strengthen the system. But the question is: why change a system that performed so well? Because with the dramatic improvements in information-sharing during the past three years, a stronger SIS can open a new chapter in our cooperation on internal security and can contribute to the coherent application of the rules and principles governing the Schengen area. The new rules will help with the effective enforcement of entry bans for third-country nationals at the external borders by making the entry of their data into the SIS compulsory. With the introduction of a new alert category for return decisions, the SIS will also provide an efficient tool for the implementation of EU policies on return. Member States will now be obliged to enter alerts where a person or an object is sought for a terrorist offence. The role of Europol will be strengthened, as it will now have access to all alerts and supplementary information exchanges, while Member States will be obliged to inform Europol of any alerts related to terrorist offences. The operational teams of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency will also have their own access to SIS in order to carry out checks at the hotspots. The new SIS will make better use of biometric data, with the possibilities of using palm prints, facial images and DNA profiles in specific cases, when safeguards are met. This will build on the Automated Fingerprint Identification System we introduced to SIS earlier this year, which has already led to a 25% increase in the number of alerts containing fingerprints. In parallel, the reinforcement of SIS will strengthen the protection of personal data by aligning the SIS provisions with the new data protection framework. There will also be important improvements for the work of law enforcement authorities and strong links to our work on interoperability, which Julian will tell you more about in a minute. Interoperability, like our security initiatives on electronic evidence, explosives and terrorist content online, is vital for the security of our citizens, and it is essential that they advance rapidly to adoption before the May elections. What I would like to leave you with is that, with this debate tonight and tomorrow’s vote, Europe’s most widely-used secure database will become even stronger. A strengthened SIS will provide police and border guards with the information they need to do their jobs and help keep Europeans safe. It is the most concrete example of all our work to change the culture on how we cooperate on security in the European Union: a Europe that protects; a genuine and effective Security Union to ensure the security of our citizens. With this in mind, I encourage you to support this important initiative when you vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 323, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Schengen Information System (SIS) is the centrepiece of our network of information exchange and the main law enforcement database that we have. But its real strength lies in the fact that it is used. It is used every day. It has been integrated into the everyday work of over two million police officers and border guards across Europe, whose job it is to try and keep us safe. It is an undoubted success. In addition to some of the figures that we’ve already heard, between 2013 and 2017 the SIS also contributed to over 28 000 missing persons being found; to the tracing of more than 180 000 persons needed to assist with a criminal judicial procedure; and to almost 200 000 cases concerning stolen objects – vehicles, identity, travel documents and firearms – being solved, all using the SIS. I would like to join the speakers who have already thanked Mr Coelho, Mr Lenaers and all those who worked on reaching agreement on these proposals for improving the system. The improvements that we’ve agreed – that you’ve agreed – will make a real, positive contribution to the fight against terrorism and serious and organised crime. As we have heard, they will make the exchange of information more efficient. The new obligation to enter an alert in relation to a terrorist offence will be applicable immediately. Together with the provisions on information sharing in the directive on countering terrorism, this is an important step towards information sharing by default, which many of you in this House have argued for. New alert categories, like the new inquiry check, will provide key investigative tools for law enforcement authorities. The proposed changes will also allow the SIS alerts to be used for unknown persons wanted in connection with a crime on the basis of fingerprints or palm prints discovered at the scene of the crime – for instance, when fingerprints are found on a weapon that has been used – all subject to certain safeguards. The new SIS will strengthen support for the prevention and investigation of theft and counterfeiting by providing for alerts to be issued on a wider range of stolen and falsified goods and documents. In parallel to these measures, we’ve also been working with the Member States to make the system more user friendly for frontline officers, and we have thus seen the number of checks made against the SIS increase by 40% in 2016, compared with the year before, and by a further 30% year-on-year in 2017. Dimitris Avramopoulos has already mentioned the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). To date, 12 Member States are using AFIS to identify people at the external borders or on their territory. This has already led to a number of hits on people who would not have been identified otherwise, such as, to give one example, the man who claimed asylum on arrival at Schiphol without identity documents. After a fingerprint check on AFIS, it was found that there was a warrant out for his arrest in Germany. That’s the kind of practical result that these new systems, incorporating biometrics, can deliver. We are now working with the other Member States to ensure that they too implement biometrics. Under the new proposals, the use of AFIS will be mandatory for all Member States by the end of 2020, which in itself will mark an important milestone in the fight against multiple or fraudulent identities. But, as Dimitris Avramopoulos underlined, there’s still more to do on this. So, finally, let me briefly link the strengthening of the SIS with our wider work towards the interoperability of EU information systems for security, border and migration management. The reinforced SIS sits at the core of our proposals on interoperability, i.e. our work to ensure that national authorities have the information they need, when and where they need it, with all the safeguards offered by our fundamental rights framework. By closing down the gaps that terrorists and criminals can exploit, we can cut down on identity fraud and strengthen our external border security and our internal security. I very much welcomed the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) Committee adopting its negotiating mandate on interoperability last week, and I look forward to the start of trilogues soon on this important subject.

Mr President, Commissioner, we have already heard it, the Schengen Information System is at the heart of security cooperation within the European Union.

They are all necessary adjustments. But today I am particularly pleased with what my colleague Gérard Deprez has achieved. The preventive warnings for children at risk of being victimised by a parent abduction, child marriage or genital mutilation. That reform was desperately needed.

The Schengen Information System, like the Schengen area, is itself a European success story. It represents the most tangible achievement of European citizens, internal borderlessness, while not jeopardising their security. After all, in 2015 only, the competent national authorities inspected persons and objects nearly 2.9 billion times for safety on the basis of data stored in the SIS. The new proposal to be voted on tomorrow will further strengthen this security element of the Schengen system so that it can respond adequately to the challenges posed by new migration and terrorism. It is to be welcomed that the procedure for the search for missing children will finally be given greater attention, faster and more effective, the success of which can often depend on the first twenty-four hours. The procedure against illegal migrants awaiting deportation or subject to entry bans will become more effective. Storing portraits makes it easier to identify criminals and terrorists. The renewed system is in line with the aspirations of the European People's Party, as it reflects all its convictions that there is no freedom without security. And this next-generation information system will increase our security.

I can say that the Schengen Information System that we negotiated together is a valuable tool which can help build resilience against terrorist threats and can help keep our citizens secure and safe. The effectiveness and efficiency of the system can always be further strengthened, but I believe that what we have achieved is a good balance to ensure the safety of our citizens across the European Union. As the S&amp;D Group we have welcomed the revision of SIS. However, we wanted to strike the right balance between gathering data and the fundamental rights of our citizens. This is a system primarily designed for the purpose of police and border control, and with this in mind, it is crucial to establish a system that will not jeopardise the right to privacy, the right to the protection of personal data, and procedural rights in criminal cases. On behalf of my Group, I have pushed for proper safeguards for the biometric data stored in the system. Our focus was to establish uniform rules for securely addressing and processing Schengen Information System data. We have given special attention to the safety of all civilians and included preventive alerts for vulnerable third-country nationals and victims of human trafficking, but also for missing children or children at high risk of parental abduction. For me, it was pivotal not only to address the fight against human trafficking and child abduction but also to ensure that their fundamental rights with regard to their personal data are protected. Information exchange in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and in the field of border checks is essential, particularly since the great majority of individuals involved in perpetrating terrorist attacks in Europe within the last decade have been EU citizens. Many were foreign fighters; most were already known to the European authorities. Let me emphasise a final point about SIS II. SIS II is based on the principle of mutual trust and requires Schengen states to enforce each other’s SIS alerts. It means that states have a duty to check an alert’s lawfulness and proportionality, particularly if its enforcement would violate the fundamental rights of the person involved. Based on this principle, the relevant authorities should check first whether any action would violate the person’s fundamental rights, because the improvement of the system should never come at the expense of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. We have the tools to guarantee the safety of our citizens; now we need to make sure that Member States implement properly this regulation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the legislative package on the Schengen Information System. This increases the efficiency of the SIS database in terms of border security, monitoring the return of illegal immigrants and police cooperation. Moreover, this database is crucial for our security in the light of the free movement of people within the Schengen area. However, an evaluation revealed shortcomings, ranging from quality problems, a lack of training among police officers to insufficient information on signalling and delays in the follow-up of hits. These proposals are now eliminating these shortcomings, but it goes beyond purely cosmetic adjustments or technical improvements. Now, people can only be searched in the database by, for example, their name or date of birth. But in the future, criminals can be tracked down by their fingerprints. So we're done with identity fraud. Also important is that fingerprints, found at the crime scene, can be entered into the system. This increases the chances of criminals fleeing. A more efficient and user-friendly database is absolutely necessary so that our police forces and border guards can do their job properly. Together with the interoperability of databases by linking all kinds of databases, we are taking a new step forward in the fight against crime, people smuggling and terror.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there are many European citizens - and I am in this way - who rejoice and enjoy freedom of movement in the European area. But what the citizens know less and what our two excellent rapporteurs Carlos Coelho and Jeroen Lenaers know perfectly - I would like to congratulate them - is the central role that the Schengen Information System (SIS) plays in guaranteeing this freedom. For the obligatory corollary of freedom of movement is the effective control of external borders and increased cooperation between police forces within the European common area. Commissioners Avramopoulos and King, as well as Jeroen Lenaers, recalled indisputable figures on the current effectiveness of the Schengen information system. But this efficiency, however great it was already, still had too many shortcomings that we had denounced. So it was necessary to improve it. That is what is proposed to this house in these three reports. Firstly, from now on Member States will have to introduce a report into the SIS for anyone involved in terrorist offences or crimes. Europol will be instantly notified, which will allow the rapid initiation of cooperation between European police forces. Secondly, from now on, Member States will have to introduce a report in the SIS for anyone who has been banned from staying on European territory. This is not currently the case and this significantly impedes the enforcement of decisions to leave the territory. Thirdly, from now on, Member States will be able to include in the SIS a report for missing children, children at risk of abduction, girls threatened with forced marriage or genital mutilation. With these changes, ladies and gentlemen, the SIS will no longer only be a repressive tool, which remains necessary, but will also become an effective means of protecting the most vulnerable, which should please us all.

This data is particularly sensitive and should not be recorded in the system unless it has been carefully examined and analysed.  Particular attention should be paid to biometric data from vulnerable groups, such as young children. On the other hand, it is also necessary to ensure the security of this data so that it is not used in a way that infringes fundamental rights. Furthermore, we should bear in mind that the purpose of this system is to protect us from terrorism and organised crime and not to create a 'big brother'.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 339, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Innocenzo Leontini (PPE).", "mepid": "72754", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, improving the effectiveness of returns is essential in order to maintain public confidence in the European Union's immigration and asylum policies.

This system will make it possible to verify whether third-country nationals have actually left the territory of the Member States.

This increases not only the chances of proper identification, but also our security. From my perspective, it is extremely important that the new arrangements improve Schengen and increase the security of Europeans, but do not force us to give up the values and freedoms that are at the heart of the Union, the essence of a secure Europe, a Europe without borders.

The adaptation of the Schengen Information System II with a view to a more efficient joint resolution of border control security problems should be welcomed. However, it should be noted that security needs must not serve as an excuse to violate accepted standards of protection of human rights or personal data. Improving the system should by no means lead to difficult access to the Union for those legally seeking entry and/or exit. Cooperation is the cornerstone of the European Union's performance and is essential for its security, with Schengen playing an important role.  The inclusion of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, which of all members has the longest external land border of the European Union, in the Schengen area therefore has an important security component. Croatia has carried out 75 million controls and identified over 4,000 violations in just 4 months since joining the Schengen Information System.

Therefore, one of the most important issues is the effective return of non-EU citizens who find themselves and reside illegally in Europe. Unfortunately, this system is not fully effective. Often people who are in one EU country illegally are ordered to leave. However, as there is no smooth flow of information on these orders, such persons mostly do not leave Europe but only move to another EU country. Eurostat data confirm that only around 40% of irregular migrants have been asked to leave the EU. For this reason, I wanted to strongly support the creation of an effective EU-wide system for communicating return decisions. The point is that decisions taken in only one EU country reach and enforce all countries as soon as possible.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Minister, thank you for coming, filling the benches and listening to the indications that this Parliament will now give. For the second time this year, we are talking about the Council's discharge. The management of administrative expenditure is a fundamental issue: taxpayers' resources must be managed efficiently and the work we are called upon to do and do in this Parliament must undoubtedly go in this direction. Unfortunately, however, I have to remind you of the difficulties that have been encountered several times to date, and I therefore say that the Council's expenditure should be controlled in the same way as that of the other institutions. However, the Council, following the trend of previous years, has not yet given any answers to the comments we made in its resolution of 18 April. In this second report, I therefore wanted to reiterate the outstanding issues. We are waiting to receive, for example, information on the progress made since the Ombudsman's re-election on the transparency of the Council's legislative process, despite the Ombudsman himself asking for feedback on his recommendations by 9 May. I therefore call on the Council to forward its conclusions to this Parliament as soon as possible. I certainly welcome the interinstitutional negotiations currently under way to strengthen the transparency register, but these negotiations will be successful and lead to the Council's accession to the register. With regard to the part linked to buildings policy, despite the occasional exchanges of information between the building services of the two institutions, the Council still does not provide the details we have requested in this regard. I therefore call for all data and related expenditure to be fully accessible to the public, as a sign of transparency towards the citizens we all represent. I therefore repeat my call on the Council to submit progress reports on real estate projects and to present a detailed breakdown of the expenditure incurred so far. The key point therefore always remains the same: respect for Parliament's role in the discharge procedure, as governed by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Financial Regulation. This is a matter of primary importance, as is the control of the expenditure of all the institutions. I am therefore very pleased that the Council considers it necessary to deal with the discharge procedure, and the fact that it is here this evening is proof of this. As we know, informal exchanges are currently taking place between Parliament and the Council to discuss possible solutions to this current impasse. I therefore stress the importance of constructive bilateral negotiations leading to a mutually acceptable solution, while maintaining the distinction in the discharge procedure between the role of Parliament and the role of the Council. I therefore conclude by hoping that the negotiations will proceed and that an agreement will be reached as soon as possible, so that taxpayers' resources are guaranteed and accounted for in the utmost transparency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 371, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Karoline Edtstadler", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and assure him that with regard to his words about feeling disappointed, I was told that they are all watching our debate on TV so there are more people watching than are here in the room. Let’s come to the subject of the debate. This issue has been controversial between Parliament and the Council for a long time. Let me first say something about the specific exercise of discharge for the 2016 budget and then comment on the state of play in general. In relation to the implementation of the 2016 budget, you know of course that the Court of Auditors, in its annual report, and I quote: ‘did not identify any issue concerning the Council’. This will, most probably, not affect your vote this week, which is expected to be the same as in previous years, but it is worth underlining. I would now like to share with you my assessment of where we are on this issue in more general terms. Since 2011, the Council has proposed a memorandum of understanding to Parliament in order to better organise the cooperation between our two institutions during the discharge procedure. For several years this initiative was not followed up by any concrete discussion between our two institutions. Finally, over the last 11 months, some new efforts have been made on both sides. The idea is to reach an understanding which allows a pragmatic cooperation, while preserving the position of principle of both institutions. The Council has contributed to these efforts by revising its 2011 position and sent a new proposal to Parliament in May 2018. Following further contacts and exchanges, the competent preparatory bodies of the Council are currently examining the situation. I can assure you that the Austrian Presidency of the Council is ready to do its utmost to find a solution if there is sufficient political will on both sides to bridge the gap.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 372, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra", "mepid": "2002", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Valli, for his work in preparing this report, which reproduces an old and long controversy which we have been having with the Council of Ministers of the Union. The rapporteur reminded us very well of the powers assigned by the Treaties by the European Parliament with regard to discharge, and since 2009 this Parliament has been systematically rejecting the approval of the annual accounts, which will also take place in 2016. It is not a problem of equivalence and reciprocity, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it is a question of respect for the powers assigned by the Treaties and, in this regard, the European Parliament cannot accept equivalence or reciprocity within the respective competences. We do greet the willingness to find an understanding that is respectful of the competences of both institutions. In the meantime, the rapporteur's report points out some aspects that need to be improved. The Council did not present separate accounts of the European Council and the Council of the Union. Staff costs must be separated by categories, by sex, by function, by grade and by professional competence. And it is also clear that we must welcome the efforts that have been made in the framework of consolidating the European Union's register of transparency, which also affects the Council of Ministers of the Union. It is therefore clear, Mr President, that this situation should be overcome, but it should be overcome — as the representative of the Council has said - on the basis of a mobilisation of political will which may in some way represent respect for the rules, respect for the institutions, respect for the Treaties and the derived rules, such as the Union's Financial Regulation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 373, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Arndt Kohn", "mepid": "186884", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

For the eighth time in a row, the European Parliament is likely to refuse discharge to the European Council and the Council of the European Union. Why has this been the case for so many years? Why does the Council consistently refuse to answer the European Parliament's questions in the context of the discharge? Where is the Council when we discuss its responsibility towards the citizens during the debate in the Committee on Budgetary Control? I am all the more pleased that you are here tonight to send out a signal, and I think so too.  The discharge, however, is about all the EU institutions being accountable to the citizens for how they handle their taxpayers' money. Information on the Council's budget and activities can be found in the annual reports. But that is not enough. The figures must be comprehensible and comprehensible to the public. If this is not the case in the annual report, then clarity must be provided within the framework of the discharge. What, please, distinguishes the Council from the other EU institutions and their duty to be transparent in the use of funds? I warmly welcome the discussions between the Council and Parliament and hope for an early agreement, but this must take into account the principle that the European Parliament is the only directly elected chamber to have discharge sovereignty.

These answers to our unanswered questions are essential to the discharge procedure. We need answers on the main shortcomings identified by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg regarding the high amounts transferred or the unclear construction policy. The Council has still not prepared a response to the European Ombudsman's strategic report on the transparency of the Council's legislative process, even though the Ombudsman has asked for a response to her recommendations and proposals for improvements by 9 May 2018.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very I very much regret that this year, as in previous years, we are once again having to say that we are not giving discharge to the Council. We are not doing this because we are evil to the Council, or because we are insisting here on rights that we do not have. We do so because we believe it is our duty to actually critically check for the taxpayer where his tax payments have actually remained and whether they have been spent wisely. The Council refers here to a gentlemen's agreement of 1970, in which the two institutions stipulated that they would accept each other's payments or expenditure without much critical examination.  That may have been fine 48 years ago. But today, in my opinion, it is a gross violation of the rules, and we should no longer accept it. I am glad that the President of the Council referred to the memorandum of understanding and said that she now wants to continue working on the basis and to reach an agreement with us as soon as possible. It is unacceptable for the Council to treat its expenditure as a state secret and to deny the citizen access to this expenditure and, therefore, the transparency to which it is actually obliged. As my predecessors have already said, the Council must play by the rules of the game, as must all the other institutions. We Liberals attach great importance to sound financial management, good administration and transparency. We can only assess whether these objectives will be achieved if we can ensure an appropriate assessment of the budget and its use. That is not the case.

This is probably one of the few issues I actually agree with the Parliament on: that there should be more transparency and oversight over the use of the EU Council budget. It of course begs the question: does the Council have something to hide? Well, let’s take a look at some of their spending. The Council spent EUR 55 000 to hold a staff party for up to 1 200 people on their premises in early 2018. The party included butlers, cooks, bartenders, champagne, wine and beer and a bar open until 3am in the morning. All very nice, no doubt. The Council also spent another EUR 25 000 for the staff and their children to have a party at an adventure park in Belgium, and in the previous year, the Council put a tender out to purchase 4 000 bottles of champagne. It’s no wonder the Council doesn’t want parliamentary oversight of their budget. The EU institutions are public entities, paid for with taxpayers’ money. It’s outrageous that, certainly, British taxpayers have to pay for such vain and frivolous events, while at home we have front-line public services cuts. Thank goodness Brexit will mean we no longer have to give vast contributions to Brussels. But because of the Tory betrayal we are having at the moment and the never-ending transitional period proposed, the UK will still be giving billions to Brussels for many years to come.

Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we postponed the discharge for EASO in April, and I think we did a good job of doing so. We had plenty of reasons for that, too. There were comments from the Court of Auditors, there was an initial OLAF investigation, there was whistleblower information, and the then executive director of EASO minimized all cases. The European Parliament's attitude was sensible, because the refusal to discharge led to action. During that whole time I was in close contact with the dg home managers and I also had a number of conversations with Commissioner Avramopoulos.  I dare testify here honestly that DG Home took over the case. Pressure was put on the then executive director, who resigned in June. The Commission decided to appoint a new director, a new executive director ad interim, Jamil Addou. I met Mr. Addou in early July. We heard him in a closed session in the Committee on Budgetary Control and I was impressed by his swift and decisive action. It is clear that the new leadership within EASO has learned lessons from the past. It is clear that DG Home is now following the case closely. Lessons are learned from the mistakes of the past. It is clear that within EASO there was too much power in the hands of one person. There were insufficient checks-and-balances. The Commission is now acting preventively, because it shall, at each meeting, issue a Director-General or a Deputy Director-General of DG Home at each meeting to ensure that things are decided pre-emptively. There is better management and on 17 September the Management Board adopted a 16-page action plan. There are now logical decision-making mechanisms, predictable decision-making mechanisms and predictable decision lines. That is a positive political signal, and it is precisely for this reason that I propose to grant discharge to the new Executive Director ad interim.  I must admit that the final results of the OLAF report are not yet available. That is why I urge OLAF to continue the work intensively and to come up with conclusions and recommendations quickly, so that all disturbances are on the table, that there are recommendations, that there are conclusions, that that can also be cleared up.  I would like to appeal to all colleagues here tonight, both on the left and on the right. Let us not play party political games in this dossier. Let's not argue in the air. EASO is an important agency. EASO must be able to work. EASO will soon be transformed into an even more powerful agency, with more resources, with more staff. Let EASO work with the current staff who now have confidence in the new executive director ad interim. Let us acknowledge that trust has been restored. Let's honor that by granting discharge to the new leadership. I would like to say to Mr Sarvamaa that it is not the case that everything is now peis and vree and that all the disturbances have been resolved, but the political signal is that the Commission, that DG Home, that the new Director has taken matters into his own hands.

I am counting on an open and frank discussion because we share the same concerns and goals in dealing with this issue and making sure it will not be repeated. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has a key role at the core of our migration policy. It has been supporting and continues to support Member State asylum systems in processing an increasing number of asylum applications and providing assistance to asylum seekers and refugees.   The EASO ensures an important part of the workload on the ground: it currently deploys more than 274 people directly to support the Greek and Italian asylum services. To ensure the convergence of the national asylum systems, EASO has developed standards for reception conditions, to be applied across Europe. All Member States can benefit from its expertise, for instance from its reports on the situation in countries of origin, in the assessment of asylum applications. The Commission made a proposal, in 2016, to transform the EASO into a fully-fledged European Asylum Agency. To ensure that the EASO will be able to continue effectively facing the increasing migratory challenges and building on the agreement reached between the co-legislators last September, we have proposed that it be further strengthened to make sure it can provide Member States with all the technical support they may need. Both proposals reinforce the governance of the agency. The importance of the work of this agency is one of the reasons why the Commission takes the matter of its governance, and the past issues, very seriously. We want to make sure that measures are implemented immediately to improve the agency’s management and prevent something like this from happening again. We want to leave this story behind and concentrate on reinforcing the agency and ensuring the efficiency of its work. That is why, when the first alleged irregularities were reported to the Commission, a number of mitigating and precautionary measures were immediately taken to improve oversight of the agency, including through reinforced and rigorous monitoring and control of the former Executive Director. Several of these measures were initiated by the Commission itself, with support from the Chair of the Board. The rapporteur, Mr Staes, has rightly highlighted some points. But it should also be clear to everyone that the EASO is a decentralised and independent agency of the Union. It is governed by a Management Board composed of Member States’ representatives. The Commission has only two members sitting on that board. The agency’s Executive Director is appointed by the Management Board and is accountable for his actions to the Management Board, as well as to the European Parliament and the Council when his actions relate to the use of EU funds. It is therefore primarily the responsibility of the agency to remedy any shortcomings identified. As I said, the Commission is closely and continuously following the situation in the EASO and it supports the ongoing efforts to improve the agency’s governance and functioning. We are paying special attention to procedures in the areas of recruitment, procurement, budget and audits, and to the internal governance framework. To this end, the Commission is closely following the implementation of the interim Executive Director’s detailed Governance Action Plan that enumerates 53 detailed corrective measures to restore trust, reinforce the internal governance framework and rebuild the internal capacity of the agency. I would like to express my thanks to Parliament for welcoming the actions implemented so far, in its second report on the 2016 EASO discharge, which we are discussing tonight. In addition, let me stress that the Commission takes equally seriously the 2017 Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors, as well as the recommendations of the Commission’s Internal Audit Service and any upcoming report from OLAF. We are monitoring the implementation by the EASO of these recommendations, and we will continue to do so. The Commission is counting, first and foremost, on the EASO management to take all the necessary measures to ensure the proper functioning of the agency, and it stands ready to provide its support and expertise.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 387, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Petri Sarvamaa", "mepid": "112611", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I have to say that, having dealt with the agency’s discharge for several years now, this one is a really tricky one and I’ll tell you why. Usually, I don’t want to mix different discharge years with each other – we should be dealing only with the discharge year that we are dealing with – but, in this case, we have a situation which is a little complicated.  I respect the rapporteur’s creativity to get us all off this unpleasant hook, but I have to say, quite honestly – and noting also what Commissioner Avramopoulos said – that the Commission had rather limited ways and chances of really knowing what was going on, but that means that Parliament’s role in this one is exceptionally important and that is why we should not make a compromise. Most of the problems and irregular activities were related to the actions of the previous management and now some people are mixing up whether we are discharging the person or the institution, but even looking at it both ways, it is the same outcome. We should not discharge an agency for actions that were taken in 2016 when, as a matter of fact, the European Court of Auditors is telling us that the situation got even worse after that in 2017. So how are we going to deal with the 2017 discharge if we give them discharge now? This is why I honestly think that, in this case, it is a little different. We should look at 2016 and 2017. Also we don’t have the report from OLAF yet so we are blindfoldedly giving discharge if we give one tomorrow. That’s why I am asking all of you to reconsider this once more.

For the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) however, you will not be surprised to hear that we very much agree with Mr Staes and I thank him for his report, because this was a very difficult situation.  Can I just say for the Commissioner, for the Commission and for Members like Mr Staes, that it is when we have difficulties with such sensitive and important agencies that we see Parliament acting at its best, when we have such tough situations. For the LIBE Committee, we have just had a very experienced delegation, very experienced, and an experienced rapporteur, Mr Niedermüller, coming back. These are people who are highly independently minded, who have investigated thoroughly for our Committee and taken their responsibilities seriously.  They believe the improvements Mr Staes has mentioned have indeed been made – sorry, Mr President, I am just over-running slightly, if you’ll allow me – they believe these improvements have been made as the Commissioner has underlined how important EASO is at this very sensitive moment relating not just to its activities – Italy and Greece – but to other files and other important developments. So I return to what Mr Staes has said. He is satisfied that the key improvements have been made. Mr Sarvamaa is right, there were improvements that needed to be made. For the LIBE Committee, we have spent some considerable time on this, and indeed with the new Executive Director, and for this reason, we believe that discharge should be made. This is our recommendation. I thank the Commission again and thank you to Mr Staes for an excellent report.

Mr President, what happened at EASO has injured the credibility of this agency and I do not think that the removal of the previous leadership, the previous Executive Director, will cure the problems. The problems are deep, you are well aware that the OLAF investigation is ongoing and we do not know exactly what will arise, as well as the Court of Auditors' observations on the 2017 activity, which also observes particular problems. Problems in the legality, regularity of the operations on which the accounts and allocations of funds are based. So for us, the problem is serious. We do not agree with the rapporteur. As ECR we will not grant discharge to EASO. We believe that questions and research should remain. We understand that some people make the need for philosophies, such as the Socialist side, but that does not mean that we should dispense with the EAS. But on the substance, Mr Avramopoule, you know that he has not done a very serious job in Greece. We have thousands of applications that remain, asylum applications. EASO should have helped more decisively in this regard, although we certainly recognise the responsibility of the Greek authorities in this matter.  There must therefore be serious intervention on the substantive issues. We cannot have thousands waiting for the asylum application to be heard. Everyone comes to Greece, makes an application within ten days and waits three years for their application to be judged, which, if judged, in the large part of the applications will be rejected and re-promoted. Let us therefore also see the essential part, Mr Avramopoule, apart from the essential fact that we do not grant discharge to the functions of EASO.

When the dust has settled, after tomorrow, I will ask you, and also the rest of the right side of the Chamber: how on earth can you mix the work that the Agency is doing and the role that the Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs (DG Home) and the Commission is playing with the irregularities of a couple of people back in 2016 and 2017? How can you mix those two things?

Because if the executive director and his executives were really concerned with how the service should work and not partying on spending, then obviously they would be much more focused on the work they had to provide and the help they had to provide to Greece. Therefore, there is a direct link between the maladministration that has been demonstrated and the removal that was rightly made by the inability of EASO to operate and assist the Greek authorities. So this is very, very important. The fact that I have also pointed out that functioning needs to be improved in the future is a policy that needs to be made, since here is Mr Avramopoulos who is the Commissioner responsible.

EASO is delivering technical and operational support to those states whose asylum systems are subject to excessive refugee pressure by deploying expert teams. All of this necessitates the recovery of the full capacity of the EU agencies as soon as possible. After Parliament’s decision to postpone the granting of discharge to EASO for the year 2016, a number of developments occurred, answering our recommendations. A remedial action plan was produced, proposing a set of measurable objectives and deliverable aims to reinforce the internal governance of the office, rebuild internal capacity and restore trust. In addition, the office took some practical measures to overcome the mistakes made in the field of procurement. The former executive director was released from his duties and an interim director was designated. The situation in the year 2016 was exceptional. It was the peak year of the refugee crisis. Many procedures were carried out in extreme circumstances with understaffed teams and in a situation where systems and procedures were still in the process of being adapted to cope with the new and rapidly-evolving scenario. Bearing in mind the overall picture during the voting on 27 September, with a slim majority the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) recommended granting discharge to EASO, carefully taking into account the ambitious remedial action plan of the office.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 393, "date": "2018-10-23.json", "name": "Jonathan Bullock", "mepid": "188733", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, we are debating whether to approve the accounts for the European Asylum Support Office, based in Malta, which provides assistance for the arrival and processing of migrants. The agency has a budget of around EUR 70 million. However, OLAF, the anti-fraud body, is currently investigating several former and current members occupying middle or senior management positions, reportedly over a culture of irresponsibility and bullying. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, the executive director, was released from the position and an interim appointed. Irregular payments made by the Asylum Office for 2016 are estimated at over EUR 1.5 million. The Courts of Auditors in 2017 found there was inadequate or total lack of internal control and governance, and recently the Asylum Office put out a tender, worth EUR 1.5 million, for branded promotional items, merchandise garments and apparels. This tender included Christmas cards, virtual reality glasses, car chargers, inflatable flight pillows, leather goods, crystal glassware, gold/silver goods, ponchos, luggage, even executive gifts for VIPs. This is an absolute waste of taxpayers’ money, and the Asylum Office clearly has little internal control over its spending.

We are in a currently complex situation in relation to EASO, because we have to admit that the director has changed only on the first of June and the plan is just one month.  OLAF's investigations, because they are not just one, are still under secret; we have not managed to have information, but they continue and, above all, in the Court of Auditors' 2017 report we are told that, after 2016, serious problems also remained in EASO.

The specialists in this Parliament, led by Mr Moraes in the LIBE Committee, have been looking at it and are also impressed by the new wind blowing within EASO.  If we grant discharge, ladies and gentlemen, it does not mean that we look away from the facts. It just means we're sending a political signal. That we say, look, important steps have been taken. There's progress. The case is more under control than it was in April. It is not a look away from the facts, because we have added to our report a very solid resolution with a whole series of things that we say: this and that must be better.
