This day has deep into everyone's memory: 30 years ago, on 26 April 1986, the reactor block number 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded in the former Soviet Union – in the Soviet Republic of Ukraine. There was a total meltdown, what is called a super-GAU, a tragedy with incredible consequences: radioactive material was thrown into the atmosphere, large parts of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were contaminated, the radioactive cloud moved to Central Europe and up to the North Cape. To this day, the exact number of people who have fallen ill and died as a result of radiation is disputed; it is likely that the figure will never be determined in detail. Estimates of health impacts and deaths vary. But no matter what the order of magnitude, these orders of magnitude are dramatic. Tens of thousands are thought to have died, and in some estimates hundreds of thousands of deaths. Few have remembered that so-called liquidators – mostly young men – were sent into this disaster without protection and without warning in order to contain it. It is probably thanks to these people that things did not get any worse. But many of these people, these heroes, paid for their efforts with their lives. In the region, hundreds of thousands of people have had to leave their homes and give up their homes. Many families had to be resettled, communities were torn apart. To this day, soils and food in the region remain polluted. Many people still suffer from the aftermath, even the children born many years after the disaster. Chernobyl, as a ruin, certainly remains a monument to the disaster – and Chernobyl remains a problem. The dismantling of the nuclear plants is extremely complex both technically and financially. The new protective cover, for example, which is intended to replace the 1986 temporary protective jacket, will not be completed until 2017 at the earliest and will cost between 1.5 and 2 billion euros. In the European Union, the decision on the use of nuclear energy is the responsibility of the Member States. But nuclear clouds and radiation certainly know no national borders. That is why our efforts to ensure safety and prevention must not stop at national borders. At European level, therefore, the Fukushima nuclear disaster has, i think, rightly been used as an opportunity to subject 145 European nuclear power plants to a comprehensive risk and safety assessment. Beyond partisan and national disputes – there are many different views on the use of nuclear power – we must, in any case, also in remembrance of this disaster, agree that we must ensure that nuclear power plants in Europe and in our surroundings are safe. That is the warning and certainly the mission that this Chernobyl super-GAU triggered 30 years ago and the Fukushima disaster a few years ago. Ladies and gentlemen, we in the European Parliament must also take this task very seriously.

Just as we have now appreciated the fact that we are thinking of these victims. It came about on the initiative of Teresa Jiménez of my group. The background to this minute of remembrance was that at the same time an event was held by a group in the European Parliament, namely the GUE, at which a former ETA terrorist, Mr Otegi, was invited. A convicted terrorist had been given the forum in the GUE Group to speak and discuss. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is asking for this to be examined. In our view, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in the interests of the victims, is a provocation when former terrorists are given the right to speak and speak in this Parliament in order to defend their positions here. In view of the fact that we experienced terror on our doorstep a few days ago, I would like to underline once again that we will not tolerate this approach. The European Parliament stands for democracy, for freedom, for peace, and it stands together – hopefully – against terror.

As you have seen, this is a comprehensive analysis, it takes a lot of technical work. So both to the shadow rapporteurs, and to all those from the secretariats that worked on this report, I would like to extend my very heartfelt gratitude.  Now as to the substance, in the light of the extraordinary challenges confronting the European Union and Member States at present, it is even more urgent that the Bank fully commits to implementing its core task: to support projects that contribute to the balanced development of the internal market and to social, economic and territorial cohesion. The fact that in 2014 the EIB successfully implemented one of its most ambitious business plans, amounting to EUR 80.3 billion, is undoubtedly a most important achievement. However, virtually 60% of all projects signed in 2014 were allocated to the top five EU economies. In this regard, there is an urgent request for the Bank to substantially step up its technical assistance and financial advice in order to overcome insufficient project-generating capacity and low levels of borrowing in some Member States.  The draft resolution also notes the lack of meaningful follow-up to previous Parliament resolutions. In this regard, I would like to highlight some such issues and invite President Hoyer and Commissioner Moscovici to respond.  Regarding transparency and work with intermediaries, already in 2013 Parliament called on the EIB to refrain from cooperation with financial intermediaries having a negative track record in terms of transparency, tax evasion or aggressive tax planning practices and abusive transfer pricing, or concerning substantial local ownership. It also encouraged the EIB to make funding contingent upon the disclosure of country-by-country tax-relevant data and called on the Bank, jointly with the Commission, to establish a stringent public list of criteria, ensuring the proper selection of financial intermediaries. Regarding Parliament-Bank cooperation, Parliament repeats its call for regular dialogue between its relevant committees and the Bank, similar to the practices with the ECB, and strongly encourages that an interinstitutional agreement be concluded without further delay. As to Bank supervision, another previous call envisages putting in place effective prudential banking supervision of the EIB. Regrettably this and other calls have not been taken up by either the Commission or the EIB so far. As for the European Fund for Strategic Investments, the draft resolution specifically calls on the EIB to ensure that the EFSI is not indirectly used as a means of increasing the EIB’s capital, to regularly review the Bank’s involvement in EFSI, and to show that the conditions on additionality laid down in Article 5 of the EFSI Regulation have been met. So far it remains to be demonstrated that the Fund is in fact generating additional investments beyond the usual financing arrangements. I do trust that this resolution will contribute to further enhancing the key role of the EIB, as the bank of the European Union, in achieving the Union’s strategic political objectives in the immediate future and in the longer-term perspective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 35, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Werner Hoyer", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Investment Bank. – Mr President, it is a pleasure and an honour to be back at Parliament and to report to you about the Annual Report for 2014 and to respond to the remarks by the rapporteur, Mr Pirinski, whom I thank for his great work and very good, close cooperation with the services of the Bank and myself.  Having said this, let me start by expressing my appreciation for the support you, as the European Parliament, give us to ensure that the EU bank will continue to deliver benefits for the EU economy and for EU citizens, as well as contribute to common European objectives in our external activities.  Let me recap on what we have achieved since 2014, the year under review. Our plans were ambitious both in form and substance. Higher volumes of traditional lending and advising activities were and are still needed to make an imperative contribution to European goals and to respect the EIB’s ongoing responsibilities as the EU bank. At the same time the EU bank took upon itself an unprecedented challenge and gladly accepted to play a central role in the Investment Plan for Europe, a role which required a quantum change in the business, in the bank’s business profile, for some years to come.  After the crisis began in 2007, we increased our lending by 60% in two years. Following up with a EUR 10 billion capital increase in 2012, we increased lending by EUR 60 billion, supporting an extra EUR 180 billion of investment not, as was foreseen, by the end of 2015 but already in March 2015. Above target and ahead of time.  The Investment Plan for Europe, the Juncker Plan, with its three pillars, is another exceptional response to exceptional needs. Negotiations between the Council, Parliament and the Commission to finalise the regulation were concluded in May last year. That was in record time and we are very grateful for that.  The Plan consists, of course, of three elements. We only talk about one normally – the EFSI, the European Fund for Strategic Investments – backed by a EUR 16 billion EU budget guarantee and EUR 5 billion of cash from the European Investment Bank in order to increase the risk-taking capacity of the EIB Group.  I take it from the rapporteur that we do indeed have an obligation to demonstrate that, with this additional manoeuvre space, we are targeting investments which make a difference and which are additional to what we would have been able to do, at least on this scale, under normal circumstances. And I think we can prove that.  Then of course we have the enhancement of our advisory capacities within the framework of the European Advisory Hub, and the third pillar is all about removing barriers to investment and structural reforms.  Let me take the opportunity to update you. So far the EIB Group, that is both the EIB and the European Investment Fund (which supports smaller businesses) has approved through EFSI financing an amount of EUR 11.2 billion to more than 220 projects in 25 Member States, which will trigger an overall additional investment in Europe of over EUR 82.1 billion. In other words, although the institutional setup was only completed at the beginning of this year, we have also done more than 25% of the volumes we have promised within three years. So you can see that the pace of our delivery has taken up speed.  Very importantly, the Advisory Hub is also proving to be a successful initiative, having as of March 2016 received and processed 108 requests, of which 87 are project-specific. Simultaneously a network of partner institutions keen to work in cooperation with the Hub is being established across the EU. Fifteen memoranda of understanding have been signed with the national promotion institutions, with an additional seven in the pipeline.  The Investment Plan for Europe is important for our economy but Europe also has global responsibilities and the Council, the Commission and sometimes Parliament remind us of that as well. We need to ensure that in future the EU bank will have the necessary personnel and financial resources, instruments and platforms to support EU external policy and development efforts, all the way to climate policies in particular.  While EU Member States already provide considerable official development assistance to the nations, the challenges in the developing world need a more coordinated approach and the financial instruments that we use to leverage private capital within the European Union every day. As such I foresee a situation where we will reach the limits of the bank’s current 10% level for activities outside the European Union.  First among these current pressing issues is the EIB’s response to the refugee crisis and how the EIB can contribute beyond what is already being done both in Europe and in the region of the Middle East and North Africa. We have proposed to our board that the EIB could do more both in Europe, to finance the infrastructure needed to cope with the new arrivals, and outside Europe, on private sector development in countries of origin and transit. We are currently actively working on concrete proposals that will be presented to the European Council in June, as we have been asked to do.  We also look forward to continuing our very close cooperation with the Commission in this crucial effort. A final word about our parliamentary responsibility, our responsibility vis-à-vis Parliament: for me, as a parliamentary veteran of 25 years, it goes without saying that Europe’s citizens expect and deserve parliamentary oversight for their bank. Therefore it goes without saying that I am ready, just like my colleagues are, to report to Parliament and its committees and parliamentary groups when you so wish.  Your bank, the EU bank, is nowadays the world’s biggest international financial institution in terms of lending volume, operating in many different sectors in parts of the world. Over past years we have been delivering approximately EUR 70 to 80 billion a year of investments in sound and sustainable projects, mostly inside the EU and increasingly also in our partner countries. We will continue to do so, including by using the additional firepower under EFSI, because we have to address the huge investment needs.  The last year has been particularly intense and challenging, with the EIB under sharp scrutiny because what we do matters, and people and parliaments care. The message we get from your report is one of support, encouragement and urgency, and I take the remarks also on transparency, the remarks on NCJ policies, very seriously and I think we will report to the relevant committees separately on this very issue.  Let me assure you that we are willing to live up fully to our institutional responsibilities and will continue to exchange with you regularly on our activities and their impact on the ground. Thank you very much for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 36, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Pierre Moscovici", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Mr President, Mr rapporteur, Mr President of the EIB, dear Werner Hoyer, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of our discussion today is a number. Investment in Europe is 15% below pre-crisis levels. It is imperative that the European Union close this gap in order to return to more robust growth and to strengthen its global competitiveness. That is the whole point of the investment plan for Europe. Your report rightly underlines the role of the EIB - our bank, the bank of Europeans - as a catalyst for investment on our continent and, by extension, it is its support for the economic recovery that you have welcomed. Of course, we share and I personally share that appreciation. The investment plan has seen a real increase in strength in recent months since the EFSI regulation came into force less than a year ago. The number of projects, as well as their geographical coverage and sectoral distribution, have continued to increase. I mean here that the EIB Group and the EIB itself, the European Investment Fund have approved more than 200 EFSI-guaranteed transactions in 25 Member States. These projects are already expected to generate more than 82 billion investments, more than a quarter of the overall plan target, which is to be achieved in three years. So it's a good rhythm. The objective is indeed increased coverage of countries and sectors. Your report is an opportunity to go back in more detail on this ramp-up and on the progress that is being made.  I will focus in particular on three of the detailed aspects of your work, namely support for SMEs, tax aspects and external actions. A word first of all on the operational level. The Commission is currently building an electronic portal for European investment projects designed to be easy to use. This portal will provide investment projects with visibility to potential international investors. Similarly, in collaboration with the EIB, we have also set up a European investment advisory platform, operational since September 2015, which offers project owners a single entry point for technical assistance or advice. Your report talks at length about the role of SMEs, the main source of growth and employment in Europe. Three brief remarks on this subject. First, a quarter of the new investments generated by the EFSI will benefit SMEs and mid-sized enterprises. In practical terms, we are talking about EUR 75 billion over three years. This means, in fact, that this plan is not a 'big business' plan or an 'infrastructure' plan, it is a plan that is geared towards the whole European economy.  Under the SME component of the EFSI, this is my second thought, access to finance for SMEs has improved significantly thanks to tools such as COSME, such as InnovFin, and, more recently, the guarantee facility for the EU programme for employment and social innovation. The EIB's mandate for venture capital has also been expanded.  In total, and this is my third thought, 125 transactions were signed by the EIF under the SME-EFSI component at the end of March 2016. More than 122,000 SMEs and mid-sized enterprises in 19 Member States are expected to benefit. Again, we find the same characteristics: geographical and broad sectoral coverage.  A few words then of a subject that is particularly close to my heart and which your report evokes, namely the fiscal dimension.  In January 2016, the Commission, as you know, adopted a new package against tax evasion, which contains proposals for stronger EU-wide action against tax evasion and evasion. In this context, the Commission is closely monitoring ongoing developments in the EIB's policy on combating tax evasion and evasion. On this point, I want to acknowledge the expertise of the EIB, under the authority of President Hoyer. This allows the bank to promote transparency and tax efficiency alongside the Commission. The last aspect I wanted to talk about in more detail is external actions. Like Parliament, I welcome the renewal of the mandate for 2014-2020, providing a guarantee from the Union to the tune of EUR 27 billion. We will establish a mid-term evaluation report by the end of 2016, which will measure the overall implementation of the current external mandate and consider a commission proposal for an update of Parliament's and council's decision on the external mandate.  In particular, it will be a question of measuring the coherence of this mandate with the EU's foreign policy geopolitical context. This revision of the mandate will also be an opportunity to analyse the possible activation of the optional amount of three billion euros.  At the same time, the EIB integrates its operations into a broader framework that promotes complementarities. This is particularly the case with the refugee crisis, which we talk about very often with Werner, and I know the importance, the size, the role of the EIB and its involvement in this area. While we are both aware of the limitations of the EIB's mandate, we appreciate its willingness to take part in the development of Community resources, both inside and outside the Union. I will end by mentioning a point of methodology. The Commission, of course, welcomes the approval in 2015 of the EIB's new transparency policy. Transparency, openness and accountability are key concepts for the European Union. We appreciate the EIB's commitment to comply with the EU's transparency initiative and to follow international best practices in this area.  In total, I want to say here, in the presence of its President, I see how the institution is changing and how much - which was the political intention of those who thought of the Juncker plan and then launched it - it is capable of supporting companies that take risks more than in the past. For it is, for the most part, private investment. All this is underway, and it is a great success for Europe if we succeed in achieving this collective success. Ladies and gentlemen, you have noticed that our February 2016 forecasts for growth to accelerate to 1.9% in 2017 for the euro area. But we have also stressed - and I will repeat this next week, as we will present our outlook for the spring - that this acceleration would clearly depend on a rebound in investment. Investment is still the weakest link in European growth. For the Commission, and for Europeans for that matter, this rebound is of paramount importance. In this sense, the Juncker plan is more than a signal, it is an engine.  We therefore share this House's determination to materialize, to further increase this rebound. I think that this work that is currently being done on the Juncker plan is very encouraging for the Europeans and the Commission, which is a co-author. I would also like to acknowledge the exemplary work done by the EIB.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 37, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Daniele Viotti", "mepid": "124791", "text": "  Deputy to the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

In the meantime, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pirinski, for his excellent report. The European Investment Bank is, of course, a key asset of the European Union, all the more so now that it has been tasked with managing the operational side of the Juncker plan. But more powers also mean more transparency and more accountability.  Greater transparency means transparency towards the citizens with regard to management and careful monitoring by Parliament as well. Careful responsibility means greater responsibility and to be aware of the objectives of the European Investment Bank with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, with regard to the management of the Juncker plan, as was said, but also in relations and its external dimension, operating more effectively in the areas of the world that must also be stabilised from an economic and financial point of view.  I will end by saying that we hope that there will be ever greater cooperation between the European Investment Bank and the national investment banks – in the case of Italy, the Deposit and Loan Fund but, of course, the national investment banks in all countries.

Especially in countries plagued by a great recession, high unemployment, a large reduction in investment, such as my country, Greece which, moreover, also faces the additional problem of refugees, as Commissioner Moscovici rightly noted. The persistence of blind dogmatic austerity harms both the economy and democracy but also social and regional cohesion and needs more effective and combined action by the European Investment Bank, the 'Juncker Fund' as it was called, and private capital and structural funds, in order to have a stronger shift in growth and, Mr Moscovici, the last thing Europe needs at the moment is instability or destabilisation in Greece.

The crisis in many countries has been going on for too long and that is why expectations are directed towards the European Investment Bank, in support of the public sector and the private sector, rightly very high.  For example, many eastern European countries, Croatia from which I come, need big investments. Our expectations go towards what you put forward earlier, the reform you are making at the European Investment Bank itself and trying to finally have the synergy of cohesion policy, the financing of the European Investment Bank and the Juncker Fund as part of your bank or our bank.

I also welcome to Parliament President Hoyer, on behalf of the European Investment Bank. The EIB is Europe’s bank. It must be part of our recovery and it plays an increasing role in long-term European investment which, as Commissioner Moscovici pointed out, is EUR 15 billion down in public and private terms from the start of the crisis.  Now the priorities of this Parliament in obtaining more public-private models of funding, more solutions for long-term investment, and the emergence of a genuine Capital Markets Union, all point to a new era, to the future-proofing of the EU economy. In all of that, the EIB plays an increasingly active role. What is particularly encouraging for countries like my own, which have gone through terrible adjustment programmes and seen a massive fall-off in public and private investment, is that when confidence is restored and when a country is turned around, the EIB’s investment significantly improves new investment opportunities in countries such as Ireland.  Now 2014 was a very significant year for the Bank. I welcome especially, on behalf of the EPP Group, the fact that SME lending in 2014 was EUR 25 billion, which was a significant improvement on previous years. Obviously the EIB plays a crucial role in the success of the EFSI Juncker Investment Plan, and the great challenge we face is to realise the private sector contribution, given the capital from the EU budget and the EFSI itself. While over EUR 20 billion was released for strategic investment in 2014, we have to be more ambitious now at this especially important time for Europe. Across the EU the private sector has cash-rich balance sheets which we need to find a way to unlock for all our investment needs.  Finally, I want to agree with President Hoyer when he said repeatedly that he wants further engagement with the European Parliament. We need to find a means of doing that for the satisfaction of this Parliament and its committees and the EIB, and the satisfaction with the integrity of the entire process.

And I would also like to thank Commissioner Moscovici for clearly saying that the outstanding subject in Europe is investment: there are some people, even in this House, who still think that these are costs and not benefits.  And that is a little impression which then comes to us, Mr. Hoyer; that is the problem we have with regard to how you are doing, that is, how the European Investment Bank is doing, taking into account the investments that are coming from the European budget.  In other words, we are increasingly under the impression – and the citizens with us – that the Union budget is getting smaller and that its capacity for subsidies, direct aid – in short, funds – is being reduced and, on the other hand, a part, which is increasingly in our interest, passes or is transferred to its bank, to the European Investment Bank.  There was already a recapitalisation from the Member States in 2009 – EUR 232 billion – and in 2013 with great pain from our hearts, and you know this because even some of your compatriots and their own political group fought to the end to prevent funds coming out of the CEF and Horizon 2020 for the guarantee that the EIES or the plan needed , which at the time we called the Juncker Plan, and yet finally this Parliament was adopted, and I was one of the people who fought for you to have precisely the guarantees necessary to multiply.  This was one of the mandates: multiplication, a kind of miraculous multiplication, through guarantees, to achieve 315 billion to precisely mobilisation European development and, secondly, to mobilisation of private initiative.  And there are some reproaches regarding how it has been worked, even though you now come up with a beginning, we would say, of results.  We did not like that, with the haste and little participation before the adoption of the EIE FEIE by the European Parliament itself, there were some mistakes such as the Beaver project, which you know well and which we will still have to talk about in the Committee on Budgetary Control.  We also continue to have ongoing complaints from SMEs and local administrations that the projects you generate or manage have to be projects of a huge amount.

In 2014, almost 60% (59.4%, to be precise) of European Investment Bank-signed projects were allocated to the top five EU economies, while the other 23 Member States received only 30.3%. This means that the Bank should definitely implement a more balanced lending policy towards Member States.

So why then are British steel workers subsidising foreign steel companies in the form of soft loans totalling GBP 80 million? One of these companies mentioned as having loans under consideration is the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, the world’s eighth largest producer based on tonnage. Its products now are subject to 36.6% anti-dumping tariffs. The loan was to reduce the cost of energy. One of the main complaints of Tata is the high cost of energy in the UK. Another plant, in Guangdong, was given EUR 35 million in the interests of improving energy efficiency. The EIB has been making loans to state-owned Chinese steel companies who are then able to sell back to the EU below cost price, and our own UK Government has been powerless to stop it.  This situation has been branded insane by a director of a UK steel company although the words I would use are ‘an absolute disgrace’. The North of England in particular is suffering from higher and higher unemployment, lower wages and fewer career opportunities, yet our own taxes are being given to Chinese steel plants, which has helped put our workers on the dole.

The report is impressive, and this is also reflected in Mr Pirinski's report, because one thing is clear: the European Investment Bank is important in overcoming the investment gap that we have had since the financial and debt crisis broke out, and the figures in the report are an expression of this. In 2014, the EIB lent 80.3 billion, 7.9 billion of which went abroad and went to third countries. Of course, President Hoyer, as you yourself mentioned, this maximum 10% limit is unlikely to last in the future, especially with regard to migration. If I look at the fact that a billion has flowed into Ukraine from a 3 billion package in 2014, it is probably also questionable how this can continue.

I also wanted to know if it was used in the selection process and, more specifically, how you evaluate job creation during the selections, because, in Paris as in Brussels, I meet innovative project owners and job creators who have their cases rejected because they are too risky.

The major source of employment across the EU are SMEs – small and medium enterprises. The best way to grow our way out of the malaise currently afflicting the EU is through expanding our SMEs. The cheapest source of money in the EU at the moment is the ECB. Given all the above, I suggest the EIB should lower its sights a little and, in a proactive way, open its arms and its coffers to SMEs. I suggest also, rather than go to international money markets for its millions, the EIB should go to the ECB for funding at negative interest rates.  If there are some rules preventing that, I am sure the same ECB will find a way around them. After all, they managed it in Ireland in 2010 when they found a way around their own rules and the use of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) to create EUR 31 billion to bail out failed creditors of two failed Irish banks.

I would like to remind you that this plan foresees EUR 315 billion in new investments in Europe, with an additional 60 billion investments from the EIB.  My fear is therefore that, in order to display politics, EFSI funding will be substituted for those of the EIB. The total amount of EIB loans will thus decrease over a 4-year horizon in favour of EFSI loans, which are much more expensive.

If we have five Member States – top economies in the EU – that receive 60% of EIB projects, there is certainly a good case for this.

Magic, however, is in danger of being paid dearly if the money needed for the Juncker plan is also issued by China, which, coincidentally, would unfortunately like to be given market economy status, with deleterious effects in Europe.  Then there is the EIB's support for a great many lines of credit for banks: are these actions really going to support small and medium-sized enterprises? With what financial instruments? Will we not again be faced with the great finance that takes oxygen away from the real economy? In addition, we have heard in here about the circular economy, about paradigm shifts, but as long as the EIB supports projects such as TAP, incinerators, relifiers, oil refineries, there will be no real transition from fossil to renewable.  Finally, I would like to point out that the EIB was created almost 60 years ago to support the political objectives of the European Union and that the only union that is totally lacking is that of the citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 79, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Marco Valli (EFDD).", "mepid": "124778", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Investment Bank is the largest public bank in the world, that is, the one that provides the most funding in the world: we are talking about 75 billion investments.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you for the very fruitful, quality and very serene debate we have had today, which shows that we are really dealing with a project of general interest.  The current economic and financial situation requires determined political action. We are convinced that the EIB's activities are a crucial component of the European Union's efforts to restore sustainable growth and employment levels in Europe, particularly through the partnership between the Commission and the EIB in the implementation of the Investment Plan for Europe, the 315 billion euro Juncker Plan.  I once again welcome Parliament's report on the EIB's activities and welcome the continued fruitful cooperation between the Commission and the EIB.  A few words on two topics that have often been mentioned: transparency and the fight against tax evasion, cohesion and convergence. I will also talk about Greece, since this subject has been raised, even if it is not quite in the scheme, but I know that Werner Hoyer is very interested. On transparency and tax evasion, I recall that in January 2016 the Commission adopted an anti-tax evasion package, which reflects the discussions that have taken place in the OECD and the G20 - this is called the BEPS - but also the discussions in the European Parliament on the fight against aggressive tax planning.  For the Commission , as I said at the informal Ecofin Council in Amsterdam eight days ago - we had to go further and this package was a whole, a global package that had to be adopted as such. I really, and rightly, count on the Dutch Presidency to achieve this. In this context, the Commission is working intensively with the EIB to explore how EIB policies could evolve to reflect the new measures we will implement. On cohesion and convergence, let me be clear. We want the convergence of the European economy, that of the euro area. That's our priority. The eurozone is a tremendous success story. It has been able to protect the economies that have made this choice, but there remains a dynamic problem, which is also a problem of equitable sharing. The EIB and the Juncker Plan are major tools for the recovery of the European economy, but we cannot have a political criterion in the choice of investments.  Of course, it is better, of course, that the EIB and the Commission are working on them are desired- and that the selected projects cover a whole range of sectors. Of course, it is desirable - of course, the EIB and the Commission are working on it - that all countries should be affected by the Juncker plan and I think it is very good that we already have 22, 23 or 25 countries that are already the subject of projects.  But logic was a logic of projects. It's a quality job. It is a matter of encouraging those who know how to innovate and those who know how to carry projects within the sectors that are the priorities of the Juncker plan. Projects, I want to say here, must be chosen for their own merits. They have to prepare for the future and, moreover, it is not a service to a particular country to think that you have to have some form of credit dusting. There are capacities for invention and innovation in all the countries of the European Union, regardless of their size. That is what needs to be sought. A word about Greece, since the subject has been raised, I do not want to shy away from it, we are in the news. In my view and in the sense of the Commission, we are really in a condition of getting close to an agreement. There are probably a few steps to take, but a lot has been done and we must not pretend that this is a new crisis that is brewing, when we have come very close in defining the necessary measures and necessary reforms.  I am hopeful that we will reach this agreement quickly. In any case, this is what the Commission will tackle with great determination. We must work on this subject with great composure, with great objectivity and with a shared will that a reformed Greece, a strengthened Greece regain growth and be able to create jobs.  On this point, of course, the Juncker plan and the action of the EIB, which is a major contributor, are returning to their full role. Yes, we need growth all over Europe, all over the eurozone and for that we really need to ensure that the reforms come to Greece, quickly, very determinedly. In conclusion, I would say that the Juncker plan, for us, is on track, in the sense that the projects funded - and that's the test - are really additional projects, in the sense that they are riskier projects than before. I usually say , Werner Hoyer knows - that the main criterion for the success of the plan is not so much quantitative as qualitative. The question is: Is there a culture change? Is there a culture change in the economies, with the capacity to carry projects, and a culture change in European policies, in what we do in the Commission, in what we do with the EIB, to ensure that it is the risk that is encouraged?  We must remain vigilant, it is not a question of giving in complacency. I think that the Juncker plan does not exhaust the whole subject and I tend to think that, if it succeeds, what I want and what I believe, it will have to be extended. This is not a three-year affair, but a much longer matter. Our investment deficit will not end in mid-2018.  But, without being complacent, I frankly believe that with this plan we are working usefully to fill the investment gap that Europe is suffering from. This is once again the key if we are to raise our level of potential growth, raise our effective level of growth, create many more jobs, reduce unemployment.  This is our common objective on all the benches of this House, in the Commission, in the Bank and in the Member States. That is why, once again, we are facing a debate that I see as a debate of general interest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Werner Hoyer", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Président de la Banque européenne d'investissement. – Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs, laissez-moi commencer par adresser un grand merci à M. Pirinski pour son rapport et à M. le commissaire Moscovici pour sa coopération très étroite et fructueuse ainsi que son soutien, dont nous bénéficions toujours. I think that more than 40 Members of the European Parliament have taken the floor today, and I am expected to respond to each and every detailed question – I beg your pardon; this will not be possible. I promise you that each issue that has been raised today will be responded to by our services or by myself within the next couple of days or weeks, because you deserve the answers. Let me concentrate on around seven points which I would like to raise. Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Liberadzki – I think he is not here anymore, but I would still like to thank him – because he pointed out that this is the EU’s bank, and we are the EU. If you mandate a bank in Europe or outside Europe with jobs that need to be done on behalf of Europe, then you are well advised to give that job to the EU’s bank – to those whom you can control, steer and have an influence on, and whom you can require to stick to the principles and criteria which the European Union sets for lending and the granting of guarantees. In this context, I would like to say that Greece is of course a country of specific preoccupation for us, because we have seen over the last few years how difficult it is. We are the bank that was the strongest there before the crisis; we stayed there during the crisis – as the only one, practically; and we are very active now that the crisis is, hopefully, soon over. We have even changed the business model of the bank for the case of Greece a little bit – our other centralised model for lending and granting of guarantees is not deployed in Greece any more, because we have strengthened our presence on the ground as we want to reach the customers, the clients, the companies and the corporates directly with our personnel. Thirdly: transparency, NCJ policies, and everything that has to do with that. We have received the message and understood Mr Pirinski, and we will follow it up. We support the Commission with all their efforts in this field. This is going to be very difficult in detail, because sometimes you move between the legitimate and the legal; sometimes the devil is in the use of illegitimate but legal means, and that sometimes poses very difficult challenges to a bank and to many other actors. Sometimes you wish the legislator would step in and clarify the situation – not only what is legal, but also what is legitimate. Next point: the interinstitutional agreement. I completely agree that it is high time to bring it to a conclusion – I talked to several members of the leadership of this European Parliament today – and we are resolved to bringing this to a conclusion very soon. I want to have that done before the summer break, because this issue should be discussed in substance after the summer break when we have analyses of what the first year of the Juncker plan has brought. The key thing is – and it has been raised by several people – that we must make sure that we have a balanced approach to all Member States of the European Union. What does that mean? Well, of course, the EU bank does not have quotas – that is completely impossible, because we go for economically viable and sustainable projects and we observe criteria which are also ecological and of course social, and if these projects do not appear on the list of proposals, then there will not be such a programme. We will not give grants just in order to be present in the country if there is not a good project. But let us look at the realities, and I would like to remove the myth of a lack of balance in the activities of the bank in the European Union. If you look at the total investment supported in 2015, the four countries with the highest percentage of activity are Latvia with 13.8% of GDP, Slovakia with 12.9%, Greece with 11.4% and Slovenia with 11.4%. At the end of the list you find Romania with the 0.3%, Bulgaria with 0.3%, Ireland with 0.3% and the Czech Republic with 0.4%. Now let us go to the exposure of the bank: where is the Bank the most exposed? Well, the highest exposure is in Cyprus at 15.3% of GDP, Slovenia at 11.7%, Portugal at 11.0% and Hungary 9.9%. At the end of the list are Denmark at 1.1%, the Netherlands at 1.7%, Germany at 1.7% and the UK at 1.9%. This is the reality, and it shows the balance sheet of the bank as an expression of the spirit of solidarity in this European Union. Anything else is a myth. On the question of steel production in China: what we have heard today in the European Parliament, unfortunately, is complete nonsense. The bank has never had – and does not have – any steel project in China, and the only one that has ever been brought to our attention as an idea by the Chinese has been rejected by us. So it is a propaganda thing that we have heard here today; it is not supported by facts. I would like to conclude by saying, on social questions and social housing, that this is a very important point that we have sped up quite a bit, also in connection with the migration crisis, because migration solutions must not go to the detriment of those people in need who also need social housing. So, therefore, we see this as one big area where we have done some considerable stepping—up of business. More can be done, however, also in combination or in cooperation with the Member States or regions that are interested in that. Probably, in some countries, it is not really known on the national level what we do on the regional level, in particular when it comes to migration and to social housing. Finally, I would like to say: don’t overdraw our capabilities. When the bank was founded in the 1950s in the Treaties of Rome, nobody would have thought that we would one day be an SME Bank. But nowadays we need this tool because of lack of access to finance for SMEs, and we used it for over 300 000 SMEs last year. That is 30% of our business volume. An additional business volume percentage of 27% is expected to go into climate—related lending. Of course, everybody thinks that 11.15% or more of lending should go into innovation and research and development. If you add that up and then come also to the question of digitalisation, which we have not touched upon here today but which is the key ingredient for preserving or restoring Europe’s competitiveness in the next couple of years, you easily end up at above 100%, and that cannot work either. We have to have a balance in this respect as well. We are trying to achieve this with your help.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 82, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Georgi Pirinski", "mepid": "124855", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, may I join in the evaluation of this discussion as one that has been particularly interesting, substantial, substantive, and, I believe, indicative of the further actions that should be taken on behalf of the Bank, the Commission and Parliament – all of us. Permit me to highlight three issues. The first, of course, has to do with investment. Commissioner Moscovici has pointed out that this, after all, is the weak link in the expectations for a more rapid upturn in the growth rate and, in general, improving the employment and growth situation.  There is one aspect which I would like to address at the very beginning, which has to do with cohesion and the distribution of investment resources. It might be true in relation to GDP, but the relationship – 60% to 5% and 40% to 23% – is  a simple reflection of the facts of the signatures in 2014. Those are the facts. The disappointments that have been voiced are a reflection that there is not a feeling that the activities of the Investment Bank are addressing vigorously enough those parts of the European Union where the crisis has had its severest consequences. One of my colleagues has said that this call for a greater spread of resources goes against the activities of the Bank as a bank. He has even challenged me by saying that the point I made is the product of political and country prejudices. I would simply like to refer to Protocol 28 to the Treaty, connected to Article 3, which has to do with cohesion, and which very clearly states that the contracting parties: ‘reaffirm their conviction that the European Investment Bank should continue to devote the majority of resources to the promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion and declare their willingness to review the capital needs of the European Investment Bank as soon as this is necessary for that purpose.’  I would say further that, after all, in these countries receiving far fewer resources there are a sufficient number of viable, profitable and effective investment projects, which, however, require on-the-spot additional active engagement by the Bank and the services of the Commission in generating them in the proper investment mode. This also has to do with the concerns relating to ecology and social aspects. This cannot be, so to speak, a ‘business as usual’ development of projects. I see that my time is up so I will name only two other urgent considerations. One was voiced by my colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control. I have heard President Hoyer commit to giving answers as soon as they are ready. I would invite the President to ask for a meeting of the Commission and really take the initiative in addressing questions which have been on the table for a number of years.  The third consideration has to do with the interaction with Parliament. Again, I believe that there is room for a rapid conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement and for the introduction of a regular process of parliamentary oversight, where the Bank can make its case and give information and we can work out a positive way of going forward. I would like to thank President Hoyer for his words regarding the report, as well as Commissioner Moscovici and all those who took part in the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 83, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Commissioner, President of the European Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, today we are awaiting the approval of one of the most important documents aimed at managing common financial resources at European Union level. We will express our position on how the European Commission used the means at its disposal to implement its policies in 2014. The discharge process appears on the European Parliament's agenda every spring, and the rapporteurs regularly present and defend their report as I do this year. Nevertheless, I tried to bring new perspectives and new ideas into the routine process. This is because the new economic paradigm and the requirements for it represent a good opportunity right now to make some changes to the established standards of economic control of the European Commission. These changes are not self-serving. On the contrary, their sole purpose is to assess whether the EU budget' resources, when spent, not only respect the formal and legislative rules, but also contribute to the real effects and impacts of the European Union's economic, social or environmental development. Whether we are able to allocate resources to the areas where this effect is greatest. Whether we are able to identify new European priorities or are still living in the grip of stereotypes of recent decades. And whether we can adequately measure and evaluate these effects and learn lessons from the conclusions for developing new policy strategies. I have devoted almost the entire past year to the process of change towards performance culture. I believe that we simply cannot answer many of the above questions in the a positive way if we are to remain objective. Although economic developments and investment activities in Europe are now recovering modestly and the unemployment rate is decreasing, the consequences of the crisis have not yet been fully overcome. It is precisely this fact that entitles us, in the area of budgetary policy, to think differently, especially in order to be able to better cope with other crises that inevitably arise.  The European Union budget should be equipped with such control tools and mechanisms that European funds cannot be misused, but that every euro actually spent can be assessed. We are not alone in this effort to strengthen performance and simplify the budget in the European Parliament. The Same approach is declared by the European Court of Auditors in its 2014 annual report. It is also confirmed by the initiatives of the European Commission and the role of the Council, especially during the current Dutch Presidency.  Discharge must, in my view, be a logical political document, a standard process, not an instrument of unsystematic pillion of the culprits, only randomly selected and detected. Let us, please focus, in particular, on how to identify and describe the manifestations of possible undesirable loading with 1% of the EU's GDP, and, in particular, together, let us look for a solution to this situation. Simply attracting attention to some of the suspects, without the proposed measures and solutions, makes no sense. I am aware that political compromises need to be sought when promoting new elements. Nevertheless, I maintain my view that discharge should be as objective and competent as possible and should not become an instrument of political struggle or account-taking between Member States. I know that it will take many years to implement the changes in the procedures in place. However, I believe that if the European Parliament had not followed this trend, it would have become alone and outside the mainstream of the European Union's budgetary policy in its pursuit of the European Union budget. And i'm sure none of us want that. Thank you all for your professional approach, thank you for the cooperation of my team, the Secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control, all my shadow rapporteurs, the Court of Auditors, the entire European Commission, headed by Vice-President Georgieva, and thank you, colleagues, for having the greatest possible objectivity in considering my report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 94, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Claudia Schmidt", "mepid": "125016", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent report As rapporteur for the European Development Fund, I am particularly keen to highlight a number of important points very clearly. This year, as last year, there are many similar points, because the principle of development aid does not change much. It is right, it is important, and we need it to enable decent living conditions, mainly in the poorest countries of Africa. What I have had to say with regret is that the problems do not change much either. Project controls are only of limited effectiveness and there is a huge need for improvement here. I would like to stress that it is not a question of creating an avalanche of bureaucracy, because there are already enough control systems in place. What is not yet sufficient is the enforcement of these very control mechanisms, the willingness to learn from mistakes and to respond to the findings of the control committee. The comments made by Commissioner Mimica were instructive. It has been made very clear that refugees who are now arriving in Europe come from Afghanistan and Syria. People from the ACP countries are currently more likely to flee to neighbouring countries, but are also likely to come to Europe. That is why I have incorporated a chapter in the report in which I am clearly in favour of a more flexible use of EDF funds. Thanks to the very good work of the Court of Auditors, we know that almost EUR 10 billion is blocked at various stages of project implementation, and these are not only the money that is sensibly committed to multiannual projects, but also those that are involved in projects that have difficulties in implementation and may be wasted. In addition, funds from the 8th EDF, which was already stocked in 1995, are still being spent. If we want to deal with the refugee crisis, we need to rethink and, above all, to realise that development aid is not a gift, it is to fight the causes. Let us use common sense by redistributing the money and setting new priorities and prevention measures! The EU Commission, represented here by DG DEVCO, as well as the European External Action Service and in particular the EU ambassadors deployed on the ground, who are the link between the EU Commission and the EEAS, need to pay even more attention to development aid projects. For example, if of 918 EDF-funded projects, 428, worth EUR 9.2 billion, have difficulties in implementation, action must be taken instead of continuing to distribute money where the added value is questionable. In order to achieve this, however, there must also be a willingness to allow criticism and to learn from mistakes. I am therefore addressing the S&amp;D Group very clearly, because I would very much like to see the figures mentioned above and confirmed by the Commission not being voted in the report. Those who do not allow criticism will keep alive a system that could bring even more benefits in an improved form. By 2020, EUR 30 billion will be taken into account that is not included in the EU budget – that is, flowing directly from the national finance ministries to the Commission and then to Africa. I also call for a quarter of the funds to be earmarked to counteract the current refugee crisis. I am very happy to quote the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, who herself says that development aid is not a gift, but an investment, and that a new form of partnership with the African partner countries must be found. I am also very happy to quote President Martin Schulz, who said that we should, however, make development cooperation dependent on democracy and the rule of law and on what we call good governance. It is not acceptable for every dictator who oppresses his own people to be promoted in the economic sphere, and then people flee the countries. One statement – my statement is clear: development aid must be the fight against causes, and if there are no results, consequences must be drawn. I call on all colleagues from all the political groups not to prolong the outdated, but to send development aid in new, more sensible ways and adapted to the demands of the present, and to support the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 95, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Markus Pieper", "mepid": "28224", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her First of all, thank you very much for the cooperation with the shadows in the discharge procedure and also thanks to the assistant advisers, to the administration for the information and support. The budget discharge for one's own house is always a sensitive issue. The people rightly expect us to lead by example. Example: Building policy. The moderate extensions are appropriate, the transfer to own property reduces costs. However, we are critical of the modernisation, which sometimes takes off too late, which then increases costs disproportionately. We are not asking for plans on the basis of additional enlargements of the European Union, but we want the qualitative improvement of the existing substance. We should always be careful if we want to set our own monuments. If Lux price, then please not as an elitist project for very few, but with broad impact. I think that the House of History should also have been better combined with existing facilities for visitors, which would also show greater proximity to the citizens and a sense of cost. Leading by example, however, also means going with the times. The new rules of the game between the Commission, the Council and Parliament give us more power in the legislative process, and here the upgrading of scientific services is just right. But our claim that we must work here away from any ideology must really apply. Going with the times also means reforming our interpreting services: firstly, in terms of technical equipment, but also in terms of working hours, they must be more efficient and fairly allocated. Unfortunately, security in the European Parliament is also very topical. Cost awareness: Yes, but this must not lead to the dangers of endangering the safety of visitors, staff and Members of Parliament. It is sometimes better if we have our own safety and driving services than to get into the hands of uncontrollable private services. Also structurally, we really should not save at the wrong end. Finally, dismantling privileges. Sins of the past are gradually being remedied, a great deal has been achieved in catering, the voluntary pension fund is closed, but the recovery of the financial legacy must now be much faster. We are now finally calling for the results and recommendations of the external audit of the Fund! Reducing privileges and role models also means that there must be no mixing of presidential function and campaign appearances. There is a very clear criticism of Martin Schulz in the report and, accordingly, a recommendation to other leading candidates. Mr Schulz sometimes cannot distinguish between personal self-promotion and a presidential task: often what he does is not in Parliament's overall interest, and I find it remarkable that the S&amp;D shares this criticism. Finally, a word about the Members themselves: yes, pension funds, flat rates for air travel, catering, many other things – many of the legacy issues have been abolished here. Well, keep it that way, but in the end it must not go so far as to shift the well-being and woe of the EU's image only to us and to our offices. We are taking on more and more things in our offices that an administration would actually have to do. We are now saving on coffee, now we are also saving on water, and some want to force us to put everything on the net from our own ranks, our telephone bills, our movement profiles. Indeed, we even allow the success of our work to be measured by the number of one minute speeches. We should not question the dignity of our activities in such a way that we become a mockery of the people. Our job has value, and we should therefore not sell ourselves below value, which is also taken up in the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 96, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Ryszard Czarnecki", "mepid": "28372", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, the main problem of the discharge procedure, which has been ongoing for years, is the discharge procedure concerning the Council and the European Council. Starting from the weakness observed during the budgetary control procedure, we have to indicate the high underspending rate that covers almost all categories, the very high number of appropriations being carried over from 2014-2015, particularly those for property, plant and equipment, as well as major transfers within budget lines. These problems could be avoided with better budgetary programming. For better budgetary programming, key performance indicators have to be developed. Moreover, the Council has still not adopted a code of conduct, which is indispensable to the transparency, accountability and integrity of the institution. There is also a worrying lack of transparency with regard to the legislative process, negotiations and Member States’ positions at meetings within the Council. The Council definitely should disclose the relevant documents and put in place a clearer reporting system that will enable the public to follow the legislative procedures in an open and transparent manner. There is also the problem of the lack of transparency of the trilogues and conciliation meetings. The Council definitely has to increase transparency and integrity with regard to their negotiations. Taking into consideration political problems, as far as cooperation between Parliament and the Council is concerned, we have to indicate that the Council ought to be transparent and fully accountable to Union citizens for the funds entrusted to it by taking part fully and in good faith in the annual discharge procedure, just as other Union institutions do. In this regard, effective supervision of the Union’s budget implementation requires cooperation between Parliament and the Council through a working arrangement. But, as a matter of fact, there is no cooperation, no dialogue. The Council does not participate in the budgetary control procedure and does not provide answers to written questions asked by our Committee on Budgetary Control or by particular members of our Committee. The Council does not participate in the hearings or debates concerning budgetary control procedure regarding the Council. We cannot forget that the procedure of granting discharge separately to the individual Union institutions’ bodies is a long-standing practice which has been developed to guarantee transparency and democratic accountability towards Union taxpayers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 97, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Anders Primdahl Vistisen", "mepid": "124875", "text": "   Rapporteur. Madam President! As rapporteur for two of the reports we are debating here today, I shall briefly review them before moving on to my shadow rapporteurs.  The first concerns the Court of Justice of the European Union, which, in the course of the audit procedure, did very well. Since then, however, there have been media reports and media criticism that the Belgian member of the Court of First Instance has criticised the procedure and reluctance to bring more judges to the Court of Justice. At the same time, it has been a challenge for the Committee on Budgetary Control to have access to the side activities of judges of the Court of Justice alongside their work. In view of these two things, the ECR Group is very concerned about granting discharge to the Court of Justice, as we consider that the uncertainties that have been raised are quite serious. With regard to the European Economic and Social Committee, for which I have also been rapporteur, I would like to commend the committee for following the recommendations made by the European Parliament in previous years in a wide range of areas. You've been able to cut back. It has been able to reach an agreement with Parliament and the Committee of the Regions which has meant better and more efficient procedures. I would therefore recommend that discharge be granted, although I believe that the committee should generally focus more on teleconferences and videoconferencing, and that travel costs are well high and should be cut in the future. With regard to the reports on discharge to the Commission and its agencies and to the European Parliament, I would like to thank my colleagues, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and rapporteurs, for constructive cooperation. Overall, we in the ECR Group believe that it is a problem that the error rate is still too high. We believe that there is too little focus on the efficiency and added value of the money spent at European level, and we believe that fundamental reforms of the two major items of expenditure, namely agricultural and regional development aid, are needed. In relation to the Accounts of the European Commission, we believe that a good and critical and constructive report has come out of our work. A report that goes a long way in the balance with the ecr's wishes. However, because it contains support for both the Joint European Public Prosecutor's Office and refers to the desire for own resources to a greater extent than we already have today, we in the ECR Group have to vote blankly on the report. In view of the high error rates, we are voting, as is tradition, against granting discharge to the European Commission and the agencies involved. In relation to the European Parliament's own accounts, we think that a line could have been drawn that was a bit more critical. We recognise that in a number of areas good and constructive action has been taken, and we particularly recognise that christian Schulz's behaviour has been approached, but we think there is a need to reject the proposal for a more expensive driver service. We think there is a need to revise our general expenditure surcharge and we think there is a need to move away from the idea of supporting the House of European History. That is why we are voting against both discharge reports. In relation to the joint ventures, we will vote against from the point of view that there is too high a failure rate in the general EU budget.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Monica Macovei", "mepid": "96824", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, for the Committee of the Regions, where I am rapporteur of Parliament, I say from the outset that I have decided to grant discharge because it is a discharge of encouragement precisely to reform this Committee of the Regions, to understand that we live in a world where every penny counts and it matters how and on what we spend it. A first criticism: we do not walk on citizens' money. In 2014, the Committee of the Regions carried out 787 missions in the Member States and, of these, more than 200 missions in Greece and Italy in September. More than EUR 8 million was spent on members' travel and meeting allowances alone and more than EUR 400,000 for staff. I do not know what European citizens have gained from these missions, but I know for a fact that they have lost EUR 9 million. The documents we received from the Committee of the Regions contained hundreds of pages, they were vague, they were not clear, they were imprecise and without exact figures. A second criticism, speaking of the documents sent, I asked for answers to short questions and could be answered on an A4 page. Instead, i got hundreds of pages again in response. What does this mean? It means that there is an inability to summarise those who work at the Committee of the Regions, it is an excessive bureaucracy, and also sending hundreds of pages to the rapporteur also means a kind of disrespect. Now, a few good things: efforts have been made to adopt rules on whistle-blowers, those in institutions that basically tell us what works, what does not work legally in institutions, so what is illegal, but they only came into force on 1 January 2016. The case of whistleblower McCoy, who has been unable to complete his case since 2003, has already been famous. It's 2016, it's been on trial with the Committee of the Regions for 13 years and I think every man is going crazy to spend 13 years in trials. And OLAF said that this man is right, so it is appropriate for the Committee of the Regions to say, yes, he is right, to end this conflict and, by June 2016, to report to Parliament on how he has resolved this case. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues at the Committee of the Regions for their cooperation, and I have also visited them. I hope that we will all eliminate excessive and costly bureaucracy because we need to adapt to the rapidly changing world. All of us. Whoever stays behind then should change their jobs. I am also rapporteur for the discharge of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Here I have a few observations: firstly, the Authority must include in its 2015 annual report the decision on whistle-blowers - those who say about illegalities in institutions - in order to comply with the Staff Regulations. I also remind the European Data Protection Supervisor that our CVs, of people are public, circulate freely, as is normal, on the Internet, on Wikipedia, everywhere and, as such, the CVs of European officials or national experts do not fall into the category of data to be protected because, at the moment, the European Data Protection Supervisor is telling the European institutions that CVs should not be published because there is personal data that needs to be protected. No, there are European officials who are at the expense of citizens and their CVs must be published to see them by everyone. I also recommend discharge to the Authority in this case, also for encouragement in the changes it has to make. A few comments ago on the discharge of justice and home affairs agencies because I was rapporteur of the LIBE Committee's opinion for these agencies. Firstly, we still have a problem with the publication of CVs - this one at several agencies. We have a problem with protecting or not protecting, specifically, those who disclose illegalities in institutions, and we have a conflict of interest problem, it seems that the conflict of interest is not yet understood, that it is not normal for people from food companies who participated in the manufacture of that product to work in an agency that says yes or no to a food product. I particularly stop at two agencies: the Agency for Fundamental Rights, where several legal actions have been brought against the Agency due to abuses committed against persons who have reported irregularities and have not complied with the judgments of the Civil Service Tribunal. Let's not make fun of people who tell the truth. And the second agency I want to talk about and conclude is the Food Safety Agency, where I had a blatant case of conflict of interest in January 2016: the agency announced a possible employment as director of a person coming from the food industry. So, even if it subsequently withdrew its candidacy, the agency's mere intention to such employment is inadmissible. How to hire someone in the food industry in a company that gives notice to the food industry and we don't know what we eat, and they get rich at the cost of our health. There are also good examples, Eurojust, for example.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Derek Vaughan", "mepid": "96918", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, like the previous speaker I would like to use all my time now and not come back at the end of the debate. I wrote 33 reports for the decentralised agencies. This was a lot of work, and therefore I want to thank my staff – not only the S&amp;D staff, but also the Budget Control Secretariat – for their help, plus the shadow rapporteurs worked with me very closely. At this point, I would like to make a general point about the discharge process and to thank all the rapporteurs for all the discharge reports, particularly the rapporteur for the general discharge – I think she produced a good and well balanced report, which I think will be supported by a majority of this House. For the agencies, I would also like to thank the Commission and the Court of Auditors and all the agencies for working very closely with me. Overall, the agencies received pleasing reports from the Court of Auditors. I shadowed the agencies’ discharge last year, and I am pleased to report that there has been a great deal of progress since then. There were fewer comments from the Court and, importantly, there were no qualified opinions. This means the Court found no reason to call into question the reliability of the accounts, and the transactions underlying the accounts were also legal and were regular in all material respects. I am also pleased to report that the agencies are well advanced in terms of the implementation of actions foreseen in the common approach agreed in 2012, reaching a 99% rate of completion of agency-specific actions. Also, 93% of agencies stated that they now share services with other agencies and institutions, and 75% of the agencies have cooperation agreements. I would therefore encourage all agencies to look at this further in order to make increased efficiency savings. Agencies now also put in place guidelines for inter-agency procurement procedures and for agencies’ participation in Commission-led procurement procedures, which again will, hopefully, lead to efficiencies. Most agencies have already met the 5% required staff reductions. However, I know many agencies are concerned that they are also being asked to contribute 5% extra into a redeployment pool, and I think this is something which needs to be looked at. Over 80% of all agencies have anti-fraud strategies in place. More than 90% of agencies have policies in place on the publication of the CVs and declarations of interest of the management board members and also senior staff and in-house experts. So the picture is looking pretty good, but of course – as with all reports – there are some concerns and some areas which need to be improved. For example, since January 2014 four agencies have been in the same negotiation process with a host Member State about headquarters agreements. Some good progress has been made, but I would urge all Member States to conclude negotiations with their agencies in order that those headquarters agreements can be put in place as quickly as possible. On carryovers, which is a topic that is raised most years, I am pleased to say that most of the carryovers were planned. However, a higher level of cancellations of carryovers from previous years was noted in some cases, which may indicate that the appropriations carried over were made on the basis of overestimated needs or were otherwise not justified. I am pleased, however, to note that most of the agencies concerned are putting in place measures to deal with this issue. In some agencies there is still an issue over gender balance, particularly in senior management positions, and I have asked the agencies network to provide us, as the discharge authority, with a detailed report on steps being taken to address this problem. In addition to this, I would also ask Member States to pursue gender balance when they make appointments to board members for the agencies. Lastly, I wanted to call on agencies to further strengthen their efforts to improve their communication policies, expand their visibility and raise awareness of their activities and achievements. All these agencies do a huge amount of good work for citizens right across the European Union, and they should publicise this work more than they have been doing in the past. That would raise awareness of what they do, but I also think it would be good for the individual agencies as well. The Budgetary Control Committee voted overwhelmingly to grant discharge for all the agencies. This was due to them all receiving an unqualified opinion from the Court of Auditors and because of the progress which they demonstrated in recent years. I therefore hope that tomorrow, when this House votes on the agencies’ discharge, we would once again grant discharge to all the agencies in my report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Marian-Jean Marinescu", "mepid": "33982", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, first of all I would like to thank my fellow rapporteurs and colleagues on the committee for their cooperation. There is only one amendment on all eight reports on joint ventures, so I think the work in committee has been very good. I think that joint ventures are extremely important during this period, we talk a lot about economic development, growth, jobs. The first condition is to have research, development and, in particular, innovation and implementation in practice of research results. I believe that the joint ventures that are now in operation in the Union have already shown that they are useful, especially in terms of application in practice, especially if we take as a first example, SESAR which has already started implementing the results of research in air traffic management systems, this example is a very good example. Clean Sky has reached the stage of having extremely important technological demonstrators and which can bring great benefits to the aviation industry, I hope that we will also find the financial means to apply in practice. IMI I think it is now going well, to have the results of the research applied in practice. FCH is the only of the joint ventures that used, which in fact contracted all the money allocated during fp7, during the old MFF period. F4energy is a case, let's say more special. Of course it's the domestic agency for ITER, for the international itER organization. I think 80% of what needs to be done there is ordered. There is still a problem in terms of programme and funding. There is a plan tabled by the new director, we are waiting to see this plan approved, that is why we have proposed postponing the discharge until the autumn, but the report supports this international project and, of course, it also supports the joint venture. You know that there were two other joint ventures, ARTEMIS and ENIAC, united into one in ECSEL. ARTEMIS, ENIAC and ECSEL received a qualified opinion from the Court of Auditors on the ground that it is not possible to determine exactly whether the error rates calculated on national rules, because that is the regulation of the three joint ventures, so it cannot be determined exactly whether these error rates fall within the level required by the institutions. I believe that we can take a step forward, I believe that with documents from the national institutions in this area, the national authorities in this area, we could determine whether or not what has been done so far is right. It is Parliament's request, we ask the Court of Auditors and, of course, ECSEL, the joint venture which is now responsible for the work of these former two joint ventures, to request the receipt of these two additional documents and, in this way, to resolve this situation in the future. So we ask for the postponement for ARTEMIS and ENIAC and the award of the discharge for ECSEL. Next, we ask the Court of Auditors in its resolution to provide detailed information or to go further in detail on the assessment of the contribution in kind and the overall contribution of private partners on the error rate and on how the expenditure and use of fp7 and Horizon2020 funds is carried out in parallel, as this activity will take place for a further three years in parallel with the , say, different budget lines. Moreover, I also thank the Court of Auditors for the cooperation we have had and for the repeated meetings and consultation we have had during this period, and I hope that we will continue to resolve what we have to deal with the three deferred discharges.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 101, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I am happy to be here and to participate today in this important debate on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2014 in the context of the annual discharge procedures, as foreseen in Article 319 of the Treaty. On 23 February my colleague Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch Finance Minister, had the honour of presenting the Council’s recommendation to grant discharge to the Commission – to the Committee on Budgetary Control – and tomorrow this plenary will cast its vote. Clearly the citizens of Europe expect us to be particularly attentive to the quality of EU spending, and rightly so. However, sound financial management is not only important from a public opinion perspective; it is our legal obligation to execute the EU budget in compliance with the agreed rules. Keeping EU expenditure under strict control is crucial for all of us. The Council recommended that discharge be granted to the Commission and outlined the reasons leading to this recommendation. Nevertheless, the Council also reaffirmed that there is still a lot to improve in the execution of the EU budget. First of all, the Council regrets the insufficient reduction of the error rate of 4.4% and thus the fact that most spending is still affected by a material level of error, and that important policy areas such as agriculture, cohesion and research remain prone to error. The Council was particularly concerned about the fact that, according to the Court’s findings, the Commission, national authorities and independent auditors had enough information to prevent, detect and correct these errors. Clearly, all financial actors involved in the management of EU funds need to assume their responsibilities in full, including Member States. The Council urged the Commission and Member States to strengthen their mutual cooperation and stressed the importance of avoiding errors in the first place. Therefore it highlighted the need to increase the quality of controls in order to prevent or detect and correct errors before declaring costs to the Commission. So yes, I agree with the rapporteur, Claudia Schmidt, that what we need is not more controls but better implementation of the existing control mechanisms. In other words, this should – and could – be done in a cost-efficient way without adding extra layers of control. Moreover, the Council recommendation also recalled that recoveries and financial corrections are essential elements in the protection of the Union’s financial interests. Payments should be interrupted and suspended whenever significant deficiencies are identified and until corrective action has been fully implemented. Unduly-paid amounts must be recovered without delay, and full transparency regarding the implementation of corrective action must be ensured. The Council further calls upon the Commission to provide the budgetary authority in the year 2016 with a comprehensive report based on systematic data already available on the areas where the level of error identified is persistently high, as well as on the root causes. Additionally, the Council also agrees with Parliament that the simplification of rules remains paramount in achieving an unqualified audit opinion. Simplification and improved guidance not only reduces the administrative burden on the beneficiaries and respective authorities but also allows for more efficient and less costly controls. The Council welcomes the Commission’s work in the management of payment appropriations and calls for a constant monitoring of outstanding commitments. It also recalls its request to the Commission to provide transparent and timely information on the long-term cash flow forecast in order to better match payments and available funds with needs. Despite the fact that the revenue part of the budget was not affected by material error, the Council underlines the importance of mitigating the impact of revisions of national GNI data as well as measures to reduce the length of outstanding reservations. Finally, the Council welcomes the Court’s approach in evaluating the results of EU spending and measuring aspects related to performance. The Council encourages the Commission, following the Court’s recommendation, to identify the most suitable and effective performance systems for the EU budget in cooperation with the Court and Member States. So I agree with the emphasis that rapporteur Dlabajová puts on a performance—based budget. Within this context, the Council – while of course being cautious not to prejudge conclusions – welcomes the Commission’s initiative budget, for the results of which I believe the first expert meeting took place last week. It is evident that we are still far from the overall aim of an unqualified audit opinion from the Court. The Council therefore reiterates its wish to see year—on-year improvements in the financial management systems and in the estimated level of errors across all policy areas. The Council is constructively engaged in discussions on how to improve the performance framework of the EU budget and to ensure that this budget delivers better results in view of the Multiannual Financial Framework mid—term review and of the next MFF. The Council invites the Court to provide its input for this review in a timely manner. In conclusion, the Presidency has started to work on the next MFF through the Conference in January and the following discussion at the General Affairs Council on 12 April. The aim is to explore, at an early stage, possibilities for improvement and reform. From this several principles have been identified that could provide a way forward, and the joint results of these discussions will be presented in a Presidency report to the Council, Parliament and the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 102, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   I just want to announce to colleagues that I know that because of an interinstitutional commitment you will be leaving the Chamber, but you will return and we thank you for that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 103, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, dear rapporteurs, Madam Minister, President Caldeira, honourable members of the European Parliament, of the Court of Auditors, I would like to start by thanking all of you, and in particular the rapporteurs we have listened to, and the Court of Auditors, the Council, for the seriousness with which you approach the debates on the 2014 discharge procedure. We are at a time when Europe requires from us to concentrate on making absolutely best use of our people’s sacrifice. They are those who fund our budget. This year’s discharge is remarkable, with the alignment of all institutions – Parliament the Council, the Court of Auditors, the Commission – on the importance we assign to focusing on the performance of the budget, What and how well it delivers for the EU economy and for our citizens, as well as the compliance with the rules: I recognise we have work to do in both areas. We have stabilised the error rate – we have to continue to drive it down – and, very importantly, we have to work on extracting the highest possible value from our budget. As the Minister just mentioned, five or six days ago, on 22 April, we had the first meeting of the Interinstitutional Working Group on Performance. We start by defining what is performance so we see eye to eye, how we should measure it, as well as how we can move most systematically towards performance-based budgeting. I want to recognise the rapporteur Madam Dlabajová for her determination to make us expand our discussions from what used to be primarily focus on the error rate to a very strong footing in policy objectives and results achieved, and in that spirit I would draw four conclusions for us (not pretending that this exhausts all we have learned from the debate) in the following. First: alignment of budgetary priorities; second: better reporting on performance and budget focus on results; third: dealing with persistently high error rates, a topic that the minister brought up; and last but not least: how we strike the right balance between risk management and risk avoidance. So let me start with the first point. As we approach the midterm review revision, it is time to honestly identify to what degree we are capable of matching political priorities with the dedication of our budget. It is a question that will take us, hopefully, to important conclusions for the rest of this financial perspective, and also it would help us to see whether we are fully and entirely using the flexibility of the budget that has been granted in this multi-year financial perspective. Another part of the debate would be how these political objectives are translated into operational objectives on the ground and how to ensure adequate reporting back on the results achieved. We know that in the current financial perspective we have made a very big step forward in respect of priorities and measures to what extent we achieved what we have said we would achieve, but we are not perfect; there are lessons to be learnt and fed into the preparation for the next generation of programmes, and I want to stress again the importance of interinstitutional dialogue. Working together we can achieve significant improvements. Second, the debate showed a need for better reporting on performance. We have a lot of information available, but we have to organise it so it guides our allocation of resources that we streamlined reporting better, we improved the quality of our indicators. In this respect, I want to announce that we will take an important step this year when the synthesis report in the Article 318 report are combined in one, and this would provide a more complete picture on the implementation of the EU budget. In addition, we are very much aware of the necessity to insensitise earlier detection of risks of errors and errors. Avoiding them in the first place is the best way to deal with them. We also will continue our work on the multi-annual nature of errors. We know that we measure them on an annual basis, but our programmes are multi-annual. We want to provide incentives for corrections so they are actually driving down the cost on errors on our citizens. Third, we have been asked to look into the persistently high level of errors. We are going to present, later in this year, a report with analysis in this area. I want to stress that it would be drawn mostly on the prior experience from the previous multi-year financial framework 2007-2013. There are limitations how much we can translate lessons from there, but we would do our best to assess, on the basis of the latest information, what are the systemic risks and how we can best reduce them. Last but not least, we want people to be mindful of risk management opportunities. The Minister talked about simplification – very important. We have a huge opportunity with the changes in the Financial Regulation to achieve simplification, but we can never bring errors to zero, and we do not want us to shy away from what may be riskier but very high-value activity. Take for example development. If we want to prevent conflicts, to reduce the catastrophic impact of lack of development, we ought to invest in fragile situations. They are riskier, and therefore we have to help our teams to manage these risks. But we do not want them to not to do the right thing because they want to be protected by inaction. Similarly in migration: speed of action there is critical, and we are going to be working under demanding circumstances, where challenges change every day. Let me finish with a quote from Ms Dlabajová. She says: ‘the future becomes the past’. I would add that we should learn from the past to secure a better future, and discharge is fantastic in this regard.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 104, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Vítor Caldeira", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Court of Auditors. – Madam President, the European Court of Auditors welcomes this opportunity to participate again in the closing debate of the discharge procedure for the financial year 2014. I would first like to congratulate all the rapporteurs who have intervened and, in particular, Mrs Dlabajová for the huge amount of work she has done, and of course the whole Committee on Budgetary Control. Their reports are indeed valuable for this exercise, and the report on the European Union budget, in particular, draws important lessons that we cannot afford to ignore. Many of those are based on the work we have performed in our reports, so for those working at the Court – for our Members, for our staff – it is very gratifying to see how seriously our recommendations are being addressed in the different discharge reports. In particular, as regards the European Union budget discharge, we think indeed that the challenge now is to ensure that the lessons we have learned from the past, in particular in the 2014 financial year, will lead to short and long-term improvements in the way the European Union funds are used. It is very encouraging to have already listened today to the commitment that all the institutions are showing on the need to act. For that to happen, we need those lessons to be reflected in the mid term review of the current multiannual financial framework; we need them also to be reflected in the revision of the Financial Regulation, and we need to work together – all the institutions in their different roles and capacities – to develop a budget more focused on results. As I said in November last year, we believe it is time to start developing a wholly new approach for European Union spending and investment. That implies the European Union budget being better targeted to the European Union’s strategic objectives; it needs to be more flexible in a crisis – refugees and migration were mentioned – and it also needs to be used more efficiently, and then there is also huge room for improvement. Our 2000 Annual Report highlighted the scope for tackling financial backlogs, reducing payment errors, and improving reports on results. The Commission has welcomed the message, has accepted our recommendations and, as we listen now, is acting upon them. That is very encouraging. In turn, the Court will follow up all these developments in our 2015 annual report, which we are currently preparing. This year we hope to be able to publish it in October, earlier than in previous years. I want to thank the Commission, and in particular Vice-President Georgieva, for their support in achieving this target, and we also very much count on Parliament’s acceptance of this. We are also actively engaged in strengthening dialogue with this Parliament and its committees to ensure that we produce reports that provide you in this House with the maximum assistance for you to exercise effective public oversight over the implementation of the European budget and European Union legislation.

I think that when we discuss how the money related to foreign policy activity has been and is being spent in third countries, it is essential not to forget that the impact we will have depends on a lot of factors: local, regional, factors that we cannot control. I therefore believe that the management of the budget attributed to the Union's external activities must be flexible enough that it can respond quickly and efficiently to developments in third countries.

First, in both the Committee on Development and the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT), we expressed concerns at the inclusion by the rapporteur of some critical and unjustified phrasing and figures drawn from an unofficial working document by a colleague on the CONT Committee and which had never been approved by the CONT Committee.

We have an issue that strongly concerns the performance of this committee: the so-called Juncker Plan. This plan is a plan on which we invest a great deal politically because it aims to pool the investment potential of all the countries of the Union, but it is also a plan that places a great doubt on us, as the Committee on Transport: the misappropriation of resources from the CEF, that is, an instrument that has historically strongly encouraged investment where the relationship between public and private struggles to generate the necessary investments and the necessary resources.  We cannot continue to take resources away from the CEF in order to take them where we are not sure that investment will go in the same direction. The case of rail transport documents this plastically.

The level of error in cohesion policy in 2014 has increased compared to 2013, which should not really surprise us. We have so complicated the system with various additional instructions and interpretations that often even the auditors themselves are not sure what is right and what is irregular and have different interpretations.  A complicated system subject to interpretations and changes leads either to irregularities or to non-implementation of activities and standing, because in fear of error, many prefer not to use the means and opportunities provided to them. We have this case with financial instruments for which the instructions are so complicated that it is easier not to use them despite the benefits and benefits they bring.  A clear and simple system is the way to reduce irregularities, as well as to invest in education and the establishment of quality financial management and control systems.

The Council refuses to give its accounts to the European Parliament and the Commission refuses to include the Council's budget in its own accounts. We parliamentarians are therefore unable to control accounts at a time when transparency and the need for information appear more than necessary.

On the other hand, we have a number of criticisms regarding the way in which these authorities operate, the methodology of these authorities. I find it very shameful that an authority has not managed to advertise its IT infrastructure in such a way that it can also fully implement the legislation that we have adopted, and that we must therefore now postpone important legislation on financial market regulation by one year. In another supervisory authority, we find that it is likely to interfere with the financial markets far from the legislation in order to work with a variety of guidelines, that is to say, general rules that it enissues.

At the same time, however, it is clear that people ultimately care about how much and how their lives are changing, how much job opportunities, income, security are improved thanks to the contribution of budgetary events under the European Commission.  And I would like to point out here, and this is the second point, that Ms Dlabayova's report in this regard represents, in my view, an appropriate combination of attention and analysis on both sides of the commission's assessment of actions. I would also like to thank her in this regard as one of the shadow rapporteurs who sought to contribute to this report. The third point relates to an important aspect of the report, it is contained in paragraph 73, where there is an explicit call that citizens do not understand this error rate very well and that the European Court of Auditors, together with the Commission, needs to try to achieve unity in the methodology for error assessments and omissions on the basis of single standards and reporting procedures.

With regard to the expenditure of this section, I would like to draw attention to two serious problems in my opinion. The first is a worryingly high level of error, which averaged 4.4% in payments and was similar to 2012-13. Moreover, in budget measures such as cohesion and agriculture, which account for nearly 70% of expenditure, it was even higher at 5.7% and 6.2% respectively. Although the error rate is not synonymous with fraud or waste, it may also mean spending in violation of the current rules, but nevertheless reservations are about spending around EUR 5 billion in this way, and unfortunately this amount is increasing from year to year.

Whether it is a result-oriented and performance-oriented view or the conclusions and formulation of recommendations for the next period. In the area of development aid, too, economic criteria must be respected and reality perceived. However, I admit that the reality is still changing, quite significantly, even in the portfolio of activities of the European Development Fund. As I propose in the case of discharge for the european commission's management, the European Development Fund should evaluate whether its funds are focused on real priorities. In my opinion, these are currently two main areas: migration issues and protection against terrorist risks. Their non-implementation may jeopardise any other development activities supported by the European Union. Limited resources need to be allocated in a targeted way where the greatest benefits for the countries to which they are addressed are identified, while at the same time benefiting Europe, its integrity, development and future existence based on the values on which European integration was founded almost seventy years ago.

It has to be said that the error rate - that is, how many errors are made in the payment of money - is still too high. I know that the Commission says that you would like to do something, but I have to say that it is often as if you are trying to shift responsibility away from you and onto others.

This year, all agencies received a statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors, and during the closure procedure, the still open issues were clarified with the agencies. The financial situation of the agencies and the regularity of their operation have steadily improved in recent years. The Opinion of the European Court of Auditors on the financial year 2014 was positive compared to previous years and did not raise any objections.  I believe that the 'common approach' approach, the unification of the functioning of the agencies, has been effective and that a much more orderly and transparent agency structure has already been developed. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that in some agencies the Court of Auditors has made remarks called 'emphasis of matter'. These minor objections were processed by the reporter in the discharge reports, and the agencies promised to remedy these problems. In the coming years, we will have to focus on further strengthening the transparency and efficiency of the agencies and, where action is still needed, helping the agencies concerned.

The European Union, through Fusion for Energy, is one of the most important partners. Together, these countries are building the so-called tokamak, a pre-escalation to the commercial use of thermonuclear fusion in the energy sector.

It is so important because the European Parliament is the only European institution that is directly elected by citizens, and therefore we have a crucial role in supervising the use of the taxpayers’ money. Our role is to enhance the transparency of financial management and improve democratic accountability to EU taxpayers. Our role is to make sure that our common rules are obeyed.

On the positive side, there is an approach towards the introduction of performance-based budgeting in most of the agencies, increasing the level of implementation of the budget and promotion of their work to the citizens. Nevertheless, there is still a need to improve the principles which would increase the value-added aspect and to identify possible improvements to the performance models currently applied in the agencies. Conflicts of interest and transparency within the structures that spend the money of the European taxpayer is an important issue. While most of the agencies have taken the appropriate steps, there is still a need for overall improvement in the public sector and for a holistic approach. Concerning communication and visibility, there is a need for the agencies to further strengthen their efforts to improve their communication policies. In order to raise awareness of their activities and achievements and to ensure that citizens are well informed about their work, they should expand their visibility through different social media tools.

We have been under considerable pressure from DG DEVCO and, of course, from the Development Assistance Committee. I believe that we need to exploit the information we have, otherwise we will be completely implausible.

The European Court of Auditors is truly extremely grateful for this excellent work.

What we need to do is address the root causes of the problems. I welcome the reference from Vice President Georgieva to matters of risk. Those who draft laws, those who agree on the projects and programmes to be funded, have to acknowledge, from the beginning, how much risk they want to take. Do not ask the auditors to do that. The auditors have to identify whether or not there is a material level of error. So we take good note, but if you look on this as a methodological issue to be solved between the manager and the auditor, we will not make progress.

This is progress and at the moment we are playing together in one team, a team of auditors, and I think that is a good signal for the European taxpayer and for all those who want European money to be spent as prudently as possible.  The second point is that it seems necessary to make it very clear, in the context of the European External Action Service, in the context of EU diplomacy, that certain geographical quotas are still needed. This is absolutely obvious and absolutely basic. If we hear that out of the 128 heads of delegation, the Delegations of the European Union, 60 are almost from the Member States and from these 60 only 20 from the countries of the new Union, then of course we can talk about some important disparities. If my country should have 11 EU ambassadors by population (Poland by population) and it has 4, then indeed these disparities are a fact, and this also applies to other countries of the new Union, and that is to be said. Similarly, since it is not just the European External Action Service, it is the same in the European institutions. Not yet the best, but it is relatively good in the European Parliament, worse in the European Commission, the worst in the European Council. And here we come to the European Council. I wanted to say that I have the feeling that every year there is the same spectacle played: we are right all the time complaining and complaining about the Council, we stress the lack of willingness to cooperate, the lack of this political will – political will – on the part of the Council, and we are right all the time, we are constantly declaring the same thing and, of course, no response. There is an old Polish saying: he talked grandfather to the picture, the image to him not once. We bounce these balls to the Council and it has no effect.

The Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Committee on Development wanted to bring this debate to this plenary session of the European Parliament because we believe that the international community is not doing enough: it is failing all of them and also the populations they protect.  We are witnessing an increase in attacks on civilian facilities, particularly schools and hospitals, in multiple conflicts, and we are not doing enough to prevent this. I'm not talking about isolated cases; it is a pattern of behavior already being seen in conflicts such as those in Syria or Yemen, where attacks on schools and hospitals are counted by dozens and those killed by hundreds.  The impact of all this affects thousands of innocents who are deprived of all assistance. It's war crimes, because there are rules in war too, and those rules, today, are neither being enforced nor enforced. The problem is getting worse and we have to end this impunity.  Unlike the past, today the victims of armed conflict are mostly civilians. The growing role of non-state actors, for example in Syria or Iraq, further complicates respect for human rights. We need to adapt the system to the new contexts, but above all we have to implement the mechanisms that already exist.  Much of what we have to do is written. What this Parliament wants to know and asks the Council today is what it has done and what the European Union intends to do in the face of this systematic violation of international humanitarian law.

I would like to add, of course, to the words of my colleague Elena Valenciano, paying tribute to the humanitarian aid workers who around the world expose their lives to save those of others and who, in many cases, are precisely punished for it. Violations of international humanitarian law in multiple conflicts—whether in Syria, or Yemen, or in Area C of Palestine—are becoming a routine succession of criminal acts. These are no longer unexpected and unavoidable side effects, this is a consciously sought-after action. And this is a serious setback in civilization, because the first rules for humanitarian protection in cases of conflict have been put in place 150 years ago. Today we do not lack standards, nor do we have enough, but what is left over are violations and disrespect for these international standards. We are at the highest peak of humanitarian need and armed conflict in the world: 120 million people are displaced, refugees, in need of humanitarian aid. If we grouped them together, they'd be like France and Spain together. Many conflicts in Africa last more than a decade. Syria's war lasts five years. The situation in Palestine lasts four generations in a row. We cannot accept with impunity that this situation continues as such. We have a moral obligation, a legal obligation and a political obligation to call for the cessation of such attacks on hospitals, schools, places of worship, killing civilians, killing children, killing women. The question, as Elena Valenciano has asked, is what has been done so far, what actions are being taken. But, looking ahead, in the face of the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, I call on the Member States, as the representative of Parliament to chair the delegation, for a clear commitment to the humanitarian dimension, to respect for international humanitarian law and also to facilitate access to the people in need of this humanitarian aid.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 162, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I am very pleased to be here tonight. Let me be clear: attacks on hospitals and schools in conflict areas are simply intolerable. The Council – as you do – explicitly condemns such atrocious acts. As you know, promoting compliance with international humanitarian law is a clear commitment by the European Union, including the Council. In this respect the EU guidelines on promoting compliance with international humanitarian law were adopted by the Council in 2005 and reviewed in 2009.  The Union’s support for compliance with international humanitarian law is also reflected in the Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy for 2015—2019. At the 32nd International Conference of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement, the Union quite rightly reiterated its commitment to advocate strongly and consistently respect for international humanitarian law. In the context of the World Humanitarian Summit’s global consultation, common messages were also agreed. The Council noted in December in the Council conclusions that the World Humanitarian Summit should produce practical outcomes and specific commitments made by all relevant actors, in particular as regards safeguarding humanitarian access and respect for international humanitarian law. We definitely look forward to discussing summit preparations at your next plenary in May. When it comes to specific situations, the Council, for example, in October last year addressed the situation in Syria and called upon all parties – and will continue to call upon all parties – to stop all forms of indiscriminate shelling and bombardment against civilian areas and structures, such as hospitals and schools. Concerning Syria and Iraq, in view of the Third Kuwait Pledging Conference, the EU and its Member States have expressed their concern regarding grave violations of international humanitarian law, including attacks against schools, medical facilities, markets and other civilian areas. Regarding Yemen, the Council, in November 2015, stated that ensuring accountability for humanitarian law violations is an important part of the process to achieve a lasting settlement of the current conflict. It also reiterated its call for the independent investigation of all alleged violations. The monitoring, control and promotion of international humanitarian law is also an essential part of the conclusions on the EU regional strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the ISIL/Da’esh threat, adopted by the Council in March 2015. Also on this occasion, the Council called for the protection of medical facilities to be ensured at all times and, on many other occasions, the Council has discussed the situation in Libya, South Sudan, Sudan, Iraq, Nigeria and Ukraine and addressed the specific situation of – yet again – educational and medical facilities. As regards the promotion by the Union of the prevention and repression of such international humanitarian law violations, the Council adopted its CFSP decision in 2011, under which the Union and its Member States must raise the issue of the widest possible participation in the International Criminal Court in negotiations or political dialogues with third states, groups of states or regional organisations as an essential means of promoting respect for international humanitarian law. Finally, violations of international humanitarian law are targeted by many of the restrictive measures imposed by the Union against third states in the context of its external action, for example, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Burundi and other third countries. Without a doubt, the Council shares your deep concern regarding violations of international humanitarian law, including those relating to medical and educational facilities. The Council continuously monitors situations, undertakes action, and will continue to act accordingly. In closing, why is this important? Let me stress that once more that we should never forget what international law is all about. It is about human beings – men, women, children, families – and we cannot, and should not, lose sight of humanity in our foreign policy.

As a result, the distinction between military and civilian objectives is eroded, as well as the protection of the special status assigned to structures and personnel given the role of impartial and neutral aid playing between the parties to the conflict. On the contrary, I would say that it is precisely with a view to seeing the enemy in anyone who helps my enemy, the staff of international humanitarian organisations are often seen as targets to be hit.  In recent months there have even been cases of violations by state entities and partners of the European Union: just think of the attacks on doctors without borders hospitals in October in Afghanistan, the greatest suspicions of which fall on the US air force, and in January in Yemen, by the Saudi coalition. It is precisely for this reason that, at the forthcoming summit on international humanitarian law convened in Istanbul, it is necessary and urgent to find concrete action that will activate the international community in the protection of civilians and humanitarian aid workers at risk and those responsible for indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population and aid areas must be identified and answerable before appropriate war crimes tribunals.  That is why we need a coercive mechanism that can investigate the violation of international humanitarian law.

Today, the fast means of communication leave nothing to the imagination. We see the horror immediately on the screen of our television or the PC and we are shocked because civilians are affected because hospitals and schools are not spared. These should be just safe havens, neutral and protected places. Moreover, this is not only happening in Syria, Afghanistan or Yemen, outside Europe. I myself witnessed how in eastern Ukraine, in Europe, schools are militarised and hospitals are deliberately targeted. All too often, international humanitarian law has to give way to raw power politics. All too easily, the loss of life is simply dismissed as collateral damage, which of course it is not. The unique and ambitious EU tools to promote compliance with the basic principles of humanitarian law are well known. It is now up to the European Union and its Member States to show that they are in their right hands. The World Summit on Humanitarian Aid in Istanbul at the end of next month is therefore not a day too soon. This international toolbox and this momentum must be seized on with both hands. Madam Minister, I have another question: can you tell me why the countries that participated in the 32nd International Conference of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent in December 2015 have failed to agree on a new mechanism to strengthen the governance system of international humanitarian law, and how do we avoid the same scenario at the forthcoming world summit?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 167, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Charles Goerens", "mepid": "840", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Our resolution aims to promote preventive and/or deterrent measures in light of the many violations of international humanitarian law. These include a ban on supplying arms to actors involved or who may be involved in operations that flout international humanitarian law. We also add the need to launch independent investigations and bring recognized crimes before the competent courts, including the International Criminal Court.

The Americans investigated the whole event internally, and the affair fell silent, as did the destroyed hospital and the voices of the patients and doctors in it. Doctors Without Borders has since been calling for the International Humanitarian Commission of Inquiry to be involved. This mechanism, which is only intended to as much information as possible about the incident, was introduced as early as 1991 by the additional protocols of the Geneva Convention and has never, I repeat, been used in real life. Thus, while there is a tool for concentrating information, the signatories are still afraid to apply it in order not to set a precedent. So can it also mean that we all accept every once in a while that hospitals will be being destroyed? I hope not. If we do not investigate the attacks and clearly point to the culprits, hospitals will continue to be destroyed. As we see it today in Yemen or Syria.

The EU guidelines on international humanitarian law also provide for other measures, but we – the European Union – do not do enough to implement them. They include the support for information-gathering missions that can be useful for investigations of war crimes and for the International Criminal Court as well. Investigations into violations with a view to prosecute are crucial in order to send a clear message to those responsible and to prevent further killings of civilians. The rising number of attacks on schools and hospitals is a horrific example of growing indifference towards international humanitarian law. It is vital that schools and hospitals remain – and are protected – as a neutral secure space during situations of armed conflict.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs with whom fruitful meetings and constructive debates have taken place. And then I would also like to thank all the citizens who have contributed with suggestions and proposals, to the drafting of the resolution, the draft of which was published on the online platform of the 5 Star Movement. The result of the work carried out in close synergy in recent months is a good text and I am satisfied because it goes in the direction of ensuring greater transparency and greater and better involvement of citizens in the work carried out in the institutions.  This step forward is all the more important because it comes at a time when public confidence in the European Union is faltering: the buildings of the European institutions are seen as opaque places, where decisions are taken that directly affect them but of which they often know nothing or almost nothing. We must take note of the fact that there is a lot of talk about transparency, but unfortunately words are not always followed by deeds. Suffice it to say that many of the recommendations made in parliament's similar resolutions in previous years have not been followed up. Yet transparency, as well as participatory democracy, are fundamental democratic principles, recognised by the Treaty on European Union.  It is therefore precisely in the wake, traced by the principle of participatory democracy on which the European Union is founded, that the text was drawn up, calling for the establishment of a public telematic register on the work of citizens' representatives, on the decision-making process and on the way in which public money and the results obtained are allocated and spent. It calls for the accessibility of information to be improved, increased and simplified, through the development of a common access point to the portals of the EU institutions, while also providing for access arrangements that take into account the needs of people with disabilities. On the other hand, the transparency of the institutions cannot be separated from adequate protection for whistle-blowers, who must be protected both morally and financially. We therefore call on the Commission to present a proposal to keep whistleblowers as part of the democratic system.  The transparency of the entire legislative process is also of central importance. In this context, the consolidation of the practice of trialogues, of which the citizens know practically nothing, is destroying the necessary public control, which is inherent in the ordinary legislative procedure, favouring the hidden work of lobbyists who can, thanks to the leak of documents, have easier access to the information necessary to influence the decision-making process. Therefore, while acknowledging the importance and effectiveness of informal trialogues, we call for greater transparency of informal trialogues and, consequently, greater control by citizens. With regard to lobbyists, we also call on the Commission to present, without delay, its proposal for an agreement on the establishment of a compulsory interinstitutional register of lobbyists.  We also stress the need to ensure greater transparency in the negotiations for the conclusion of international agreements. The public should have access to as many documents as possible. We also believe that there is a need for greater transparency in the procedures for late payment and infringement of Member States. Then, with regard to the Structural Funds, data on procedures and beneficiaries must be made easily accessible, in order to combat and prevent abuse, fraud and corruption.  As I said at the beginning of my speech, the lack of transparency is one of the main causes of the loss of confidence in the European institutions and it would be a fatal mistake to turn a blind eye, trying to forget the growing abstentionism, the re-founding of nationalist sentiments, the risk of corruption and conflicts of interest.  As one of the founders of the 5 Star Movement, Gian Roberto Casaleggio, said: \"It is not correct for someone to decide for citizens on the basis of inscrutable logics and without accountable. The Member is an employee of the citizens: he cannot escape their control. Otherwise, there can be no talk of direct democracy, or perhaps not even of democracy.\" As a Member of the European Parliament who believes in the values of freedom and democratic participation, I call on you to work together to ensure real public access to information.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 193, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, this Commission – as President Juncker committed to this House – has made democratic change and transparency one of its ten political priorities. Our decisions affect millions of European citizens and therefore must be taken as democratically and transparently as possibly. The Commission already applies high transparency standards, but we are always open to examining our tools and practices and to adapting them further where necessary and appropriate.  The Commission welcomes that the resolution calls for Members of the Parliament and the Council to follow the Commission’s practice regarding the publication of information on meetings held by top political leaders and decision makers. At the Commission, information on more than 10 000 such meetings has been published. This transparency standard should become part of the culture of all EU institutions, as far as bilateral encounters with lobbyists, elected politicians and top decision—makers are concerned. The Commission also welcomes Parliament’s clear support for our intention to present a proposal for an inter—institutional agreement on a mandatory transparency register covering the three main institutions. To this effect, the Commission launched a public consultation on 1 March 2016, with a view to submitting a proposal in the second half of this year.  The Commission is convinced that across the three EU institutions involved in law—making, the same standards of transparency should be applied. The Commission also strongly welcomes the new inter-institutional agreement on better law—making. In that agreement, the Commission together with the other two institutions committed itself to further improving transparency in legislative procedures, and to setting up practical arrangements for cooperation in future international negotiations. Similarly, the creation of a joint the register of delegated acts by the end of 2017 will further increase the transparency of acts impacting on citizens and businesses.  The Commission calls on the co—legislators to adopt its proposals on access to documents aimed at extending the right of access to documents to all EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. The Commission has consistently supported, and will continue supporting, the co-legislators in finding common ground on the two pending proposals updating and upgrading Regulation 1049/2001. As regards the proactive publication of documents, I would like to recall that the Commission has established a solid practice of document registration and publication in its document register. It actively supports the pilot project introduced by Parliament, which is aimed at providing easier access to a wide range of unclassified documents held by EU institutions. The overall success of the project depends on building consistency between the institutions’ document management systems, including the need to avoid duplication of existing tools.  The Commission also makes constant efforts to comply with its publication requirements as defined in the sectorial legal bases. We take the view that the current rules and practices strike the right balance between transparency and the protection of personal data. As regards the suggestion to establish the post of Transparency Commissioner, I can assure you that First Vice—President Timmermans, who regrets he is unable to be here in person, is the Commissioner who ensures compliance and improves administrative practices in the field of access to documents. I can also confirm that transparency is seen as an issue off paramount importance by the Commission as a whole.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 194, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Anna Maria Corazza Bildt", "mepid": "96674", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, public access to documents is essential to enhance people’s trust in our work and to bridge the gap between citizens and the EU institutions.

We are committed to transparency, openness and accountability. We should open the doors of the European institutions to show that decisions are taken democratically. The European Parliament is at the forefront, but more needs to be done, especially in the Council. I call on the Presidency to relaunch the negotiations on the regulation on public access to documents. Citizens have the right to know what their representatives do on their behalf and how EU funds are spent in a fast, simple and user-friendly way. For instance, a common search and access point between the three institutions, like we have with the Your Europe portal, could make it easier for the public to find information. The people of Europe should be able to be involved in, participate in and influence EU decisions. This does not mean direct democracy. In Europe, we live in representative democracies and, of course, openness goes with responsibility. Public access is not about Wikileaks and it is not about whistle—blowers. Privacy has to be respected, while ensuring transparency.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Access to documents is a fundamental right protected both by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and by the Treaties.  The report we are debating today states precisely that a prerequisite for a democratic political system is that citizens have the opportunity to know and examine how decisions are taken.  I am also the rapporteur for the legislative report itself on the regulation on access to documents, the so-called transparency regulation, where, unfortunately, there is blockage at the moment. In view of this blockage, I think it is particularly important that we clearly demand in the Ferrara report that all the European institutions and authorities apply the regulation and fair practices in force in full and respect the amendments made by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  A good proposal in the Ferrara report is that the EU institutions should facilitate the exercise of the right to access documents and promote good administrative practices. This should be done through a uniform set of principles for access to documents, which should provide greater clarity for citizens. In addition, the report also comes with the proposal to create an administrative law for the EU.  One issue that was discussed a lot in committee concerns rules for trilogues. They are important and effective from a legislative point of view, but they can raise questions about the transparency of the legislative procedure. The S&amp;D Group believes that greater transparency in trilogues is important in order to strengthen democracy, but it is also important that the co-legislators be given sufficient space for reflection.  That is why we support the proposal to extend the reporting back to the responsible parliamentary committees on the state of play of the trialogue negotiations. Documents drawn up in the framework of trilogues, such as agendas, summaries, minutes and general positions in the Council should be made public to the extent that they exist.

I was her predecessor and I recognise much of the work we did two years ago.  A lot has been said about trust. The trust of citizens is at an all—time low and we need to get it back. At the same time, in this debate I often get the feeling that we do not trust the citizens because we are afraid to show the work that we are actually doing. I notice that, despite all the nice words, in all three institutions there is still not a culture of openness and transparency. There is a culture of secrecy and trying to disclose as little as possible. I know what I am talking about because I have carried out so many procedures trying to get access to documents and this even brought me to the Luxembourg Court twice. We should also realise that transparency is the rule. It is not a fancy liberal choice, but it is the law and we seem to forget that. Sometimes we say that we do not need to disclose this or that because we do not like it, it is awkward or we want space to think, but transparency is a legal obligation. If we do not want transparency, secrecy has to be justified specifically. I refer to the resolution that we adopted two years ago that I had the honour of drafting. I note that the follow up to that resolution has been wafer thin.

The European Union talks a great deal about democracy and transparency, and so its dealings should be open to the scrutiny of the European citizens that it claims to represent.  One issue that concerns many people is TTIP – the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership trade treaty between the USA and the EU. TTIP is being negotiated in secret. MEPs have no say in those negotiations; we cannot influence their outcome. So far I have had over 20 000 e—mails from constituents concerned about TTIP, which will open up our public services and the National Health Service to US corporations. Of particular concern is the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism that would allow private companies to sue governments in tribunals should those governments try to protect their national interests. Last week, President Obama came to London, where he threatened the British public against voting to leave the European Union in the referendum on 23 June. How low has Britain sunk when a foreign leader can come to threaten us in our own capital while our prime minister looks on approvingly? It makes one want to vomit. Obama said that we should vote not to leave the EU or there will be no trade deal with the USA anytime soon, and indeed that we would have to wait at the end of the queue. He overlooked the fact that the UK is a major trading partner of the USA and yet we have no trade deal. He overlooked the fact that the USA is one of the top ten trading partners with the EU, and yet it has no trade deal with the EU. When Britain leaves the EU, precisely nothing will change regarding our trading arrangements with the USA. Obama wants Britain to remain in the EU because he wants TTIP forced through on all of us. The British people should stop deluding themselves. We do not have a special relationship with the USA; we have a servile relationship.

Transparency has as the ultimate objective to be achieved and at the same time as a means of bridging the gap between citizens and the European institutions, of involving citizens more, in accordance with the principle of participatory democracy, and in increasing the confidence that – I repeat – seems to be faltering towards the European Union today.  I was sorry to hear, sometimes in some discussions with colleagues, that citizens are not interested in certain types of documents or that they do not understand them. Well, it is also possible that certain information is not understood or that it is of little interest. In fact, by interfacing with the citizens, many things are not understood because of the technical terminology or the vastness of information and therefore the difficulty in orienting one's way between everything that is made available.  So the challenge facing the European Parliament, but also for the Commission and the Council, is precisely the increased involvement, making information more accessible to citizens, guaranteeing the right to information, leaving it to the citizens to decide what might arouse their interest and what is not to their attention. Making information accessible and more accessible: the difficulties still arise in finding their way around the different sites of the three European institutions, so the appeal once again is to create a single point of access in such a way as to facilitate the right to information.  International negotiations, such as TTIP, are also key points. What is most disrespectful to the citizens, even before the content, is the secrecy of these negotiations, the influence of lobbyists and the negotiations between the European institutions, the so-called trialogues, which still have darkness.

In this respect it appears that the regulation has been overtaken by events – that is to say, the growing number of transnational family dissolution proceedings, which has been aggravated by the increasing divergences between the legal rules applicable to family dissolutions. On top of this, family law, which is a competence of the Member States, has been fragmented into different types of family models: marriage; registered partnership; simple cohabitation. As a result, it appears that society has moved on, and that the regulation has been left behind. Members of the European Parliament are confronted with the shortcomings of Brussels IIa on a regular basis, not only in the Committee on Petitions, but also in correspondence and contacts with citizens who are at the end of their tether. We are all aware that the law is a blunt instrument when it comes to family questions, that judges and lawyers are not necessarily the persons best equipped to deal with such questions and that the courts are not necessarily the best or most cost—effective forum. We need to reflect on this and try to identify ways to help our citizens in these painful moments of their lives, while safeguarding and promoting the best interests of the child.

I would like to recall the importance the Presidency attaches to the work on civil law, in particular on family matters and e-Justice solutions, and I take this opportunity to thank the Chairs of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Petitions, Svoboda Pavel, and of course my former colleague Cecilia Wikström. I thank them for coming with these questions and ideas to complement the EU message already in place to protect the best interests of the child in cross-border situations. On adoption: as you know the issue of adoption of children is a matter which is not regulated at EU level but by national laws and by some international conventions, particularly the Hague Convention of 1993, to which all EU Member States are parties. This Convention aims at protecting adopted children in their countries, if possible by offering them a home in those countries. It provides for cooperation between the authorities of the different States. The Council may adopt measures concerning family law with cross-border implications following Article 81.3 of the Treaty, including in the field of adoption – but only on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. On welfare and child poverty: concerning the issue of the welfare of children, I would like to say a few words on the fight against poverty, which is a complex reality affecting many children unfortunately. The fight against poverty is one of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and it is also one of the Presidency’s priorities. Working closely with the Social Protection Committee, the Presidency has therefore tabled Council Conclusions on an integrated approach for combating poverty and social inclusion. In this document, which is to be adopted in June, the Council encourages Member States to address child poverty and promote children’s wellbeing through integrated strategies in accordance with the Commission recommendation ‘Investing in children’. The Council also invites Member States to intensify the exchange of knowledge, experiences and best practices in this field. Let me mention in particular the Roma children because, yes, we must also continue to address other longstanding challenges in addition to the situation faced by Roma children, and I thank the European Parliament for keeping this issue on the EU agenda, including on International Roma Day earlier this month, on 8 April to be precise. As regards mediation, the EU has put in place the 2008 Mediation Directive, which aims at facilitating access to alternative dispute resolution. It promotes the amicable settlement of disputes by encouraging the use of mediation and by ensuring a balanced relationship between mediation and judicial proceedings. Moreover, the Brussels IIa Regulation foresees mediation as one of the functions of cooperation between central authorities in matters of parental responsibility. There is common understanding in Council that the revision of Brussels IIa is a topic of great importance and, to be honest, it is about time. On e-Justice, on improving access to information in the justice field: you know that the e-Justice Portal was launched in 2010 in collaboration with the Commission and the Member States. The Council’s Second Action Plan on e-Justice stresses that information relating to minors should be included in the e-Justice Portal. A specific expert group is now examining the ways to expand information on minors already available on the Portal, and your specific question relating to adoption procedures could indeed be considered in this context. In closing, I wish to say that the Council awaits with great interest the Commission proposal amending the Brussels IIa Regulation, as this is the cornerstone of EU judicial cooperation in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 220, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) and the Committee on Petitions (PETI) for organising this debate which I very much welcome. As has been said several times already, the Brussels IIa Regulation is an extremely important piece of legislation for many families in Europe. It has been applied for ten years and has proved to be very useful, but the time has come to review it. The Commission intends to come forward with a proposal late June this year. Our assessment is that the Brussels IIa Regulation works overall well with regard to matrimonial matters. We do not envisage, at this stage, the need to revise it in this respect. On the other hand, there is clear evidence for the urgent need to revise the regulation as regards parental responsibility aspects. Parliament, better than anyone, is aware of numerous cross-border cases in which the judicial cooperation based on this regulation is not fast enough, to say the least. Children end up being hostage of lengthy legal disputes. The mechanisms put in place by the Brussels IIa Regulation have helped in determining parental responsibility or settling child abduction cases, but we have to take additional steps.  I intend to further clarify the rules on parental responsibility, to improve the enforcement of judicial decisions, to speed up the procedures and make sure that the best interests of the child are of primary consideration and effectively protected. More concretely we are considering measures on the following aspects. Firstly, to speed up the return procedure. There are still far too many child abduction cases in which parents with an enforceable return order are stuck in lengthy proceedings. Abducted children must be returned swiftly as passing of time can have irreversible consequences for the relationship with their parents. Evidence shows that in those Member States with specialised courts the return procedure can be much smoother and quicker. Secondly, to see whether the existing exequatur procedure is still needed and to define the grounds for refusal of the enforcement of judgements. It is unacceptable that currently a parent can be left without any possibility to see his or her child for years due to delays in the enforcement of judgments. Thirdly, to increase judicial cooperation and mutual trust between Member States, for example when it comes to the specificity of family proceedings.  Fourthly, to smoothen the differences in national rules governing the hearing of the child. Too often these rules are invoked to refuse a judgement from another Member State. I am convinced that while acknowledging different legal traditions we can – and must – do better to respect the child’s right to be heard. Finally, to improve the cooperation between national authorities with responsibility for child protection or parental responsibility matters. We need a strong network of these authorities to help parents in enforcing their parental rights abroad.  Besides these key changes to the Brussels IIa Regulation, we will also continue our awareness raising activities, targeting also child welfare and consular authorities. This is duly reflected in our funding priorities and calls for proposals.  To conclude, let me refer to the aspects related to adoptions. The Brussels IIa Regulation does not cover these aspects. The functioning of child protection and welfare services is governed by national law. The Commission has thoroughly examined the numerous petitions concerning adoptions without parental consent that you have recently received. None of them fall into the remit of EU law. However, the Commission is contributing to the elaboration of a common understanding of how the rights of the child can best be protected and promoted. For instance, let me point to the Ten Principles on integrated child protection systems, which were debated in the last European Forum on the Rights of the Child and which are also mentioned in your draft resolution.  We will continue to support Member States in implementing a child rights—based approach and I know that you also, through dialogue and awareness raising, can have a real impact on improving the situation on this very important matter. I am looking forward to our close cooperation on these files, in the best interest of children and for the benefit of families in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 221, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Roberta Metsola", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  f'isem group PPE. – Bħalissa qegħdin ngħixu fi żmien fejn aktar u aktar familji jikkonsistu minn nies li twieldu f'pajjiżi differenti.

Cross-border cases cannot be limited to just two states, but can often include several states. This creates many legal problems. I have, for example, a case where a Hungarian woman who worked in Belgium has separated from a Frenchman and the custody dispute is now being fought in Belgium, even though no one lives in Belgium any more. There are many such cases involving more than two states. And the revision of the regulation must take this into account in particular. In the case of legal ambiguity and a long duration of proceedings, it is usually the children who suffer from it. I know from experience that in most procedures the best interests of the child are neglected. A very important demand, therefore, is that the regulation strengthens children's rights in such a way that children can also be interviewed separately from their parents and that the length of the proceedings is as short as possible.

There are also complaints of non-recognition and non-enforcement of judicial decisions in another Member State.  The system built must be multidirectional, it must reach for different tools. I know from Polish experience that many problems arise, for example, from difficult access to information and legal aid. It is therefore necessary to establish a system of financing and supporting organisations for information and assistance in family matters.

The whole thing falls on the rights of children and their protection because they are the weak subject of the family unit, so much so that they often turn foster care into a kind of dispute that penalises them beyond imagination.  The second concerns the issue of adoption: we need a legislative framework with social protection. It is not simply a question of entrusting small people to someone – hopefully a solid family unit – but also of giving them the appropriate protections they need to live with dignity.  The third issue is the fight against poverty: poverty has increased in all European countries, including the richest countries, because there has been a gap between the most solid part of society, the one with the highest incomes, and the poorest; the people who pay for this gap in the first place are the children.

It is therefore essential that judicial decision-making on children is also dealt with, coordinated and, where appropriate, minimum standards for decision-making are set at European level.

There is a Regulation, which is the 2003 Regulation, the Brussels IIa – the Commission has said so. After a few years of operation, its gaps have been detected and, in some ways, what it suffers from. And so this debate is very good for a revision of this Regulation.  And basically it seems that we have to guarantee, first of all, what the authority and the rule are so that no one is left without a reference and there is legal certainty; second, the free movement of judgments because sometimes a court decision of one country does not apply as quickly as it plays in another country; third, that the executions of judgments are real, because there is now also a long delay and, in some cases, there are appeals – in others no – that delay the procedure; fourth, that in the case of child abduction there will be agility – it will be six weeks, but this deadline should really be met; and, fifth, make the return effective and fast.

After all, many citizens have expressed concerns about adoption practices followed by specific Member States of the Union, with implications for children and their families when they move to those countries.

That is why what we least need to do when we already have mobility and when we already have the life of different families from different countries or when it comes to different countries and when we have our mobility, we must really do everything to have the right legal regulation at the European level.  That's where I want to emphasize another detail. There are a lot of situations in the area I come from, in the Balkans.

It is our duty to address the situation with the proper legislative act.  Several of you mentioned adoptions without parental consent. Let me repeat that adoptions are regulated at national and not EU level. Adoptions are therefore not also in the scope of the Brussels IIa Regulation. But it can be generally noted that Article 21 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child imposes on participating countries to ensure that the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration with regard to adoption. But the Convention does not preclude adoption without parental consent. On Norway – and yes, I expected to be asked about the situation and about the position of the European Union – I can only repeat that due to the fact that Norway is not a Member State of the European Union and moreover, as I said already before, the functioning of child welfare services is not governed by EU law, but by national law , the Commission does not have any competence to intervene with the Member States and it is even more difficult in the case in Norway, when it comes to the functioning of child protection and welfare services. This is the dry answer. From the legal point of view, I can only assure you that I try every time when I am contact with the regional authorities to raise this problem informally, and the answer is always the same that everything is happening according to Norwegian legislation. In cases where the right to family life or the rights of the children involved are allegedly violated by the Norwegian child welfare services, it is for Norway – including its judicial authorities – to ensure that fundamental rights and especially the rights of the child are effectively respected and protected in accordance with their national legislation. The parents concerned can seek redress at the national level only, through the competent national authorities, such as through an ombudsman or through the courts – and at the European Court of Human Rights, once they have exhausted domestic remedies. Just a short note on what Mrs Ward said on the need to cooperate with children’s organisations. I can assure you that we are now in very intensive contact and cooperation with them in trying to ease the situation for children in migration, where we, together with UNICEF and others, have prepared comprehensive material which addresses the problems from various angles. Thank you very much again for this debate. We all agree that the best interest of the child belongs among our highest priorities, and that the Brussels IIa Regulation tries to tackle the situation of cross—border disputes and the cross-border scope and character of the problems, which fully authorises the European Union to take further action and well-targeted legislative solutions, as well as other actions like improving the functioning of the judicial systems in the EU Member States so as to increase also the trust between the Member States and the judiciary. I am convinced that the proposal which we are preparing, and which I will soon submit, on the amendment of the Brussels IIa Regulation provides such a well-targeted solution, which will improve the situation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 249, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, let me underline once more tonight that it is important to stay true to our founding values. It is our duty to protect those most vulnerable, including adopted children. At the same time – and I repeat – it is important to understand that the issue of the adoption of children is a matter which is not regulated at EU level but by national laws and by some international conventions. As I said earlier, the Council awaits with great interest the Commission proposal amending the Brussels IIa Regulation. I am convinced that the amendment will further improve the functioning of this regulation, particularly with regard to the rules on parental responsibility. Clearly we share the same goal: strengthening the rights of the child in the EU. This is an investment not only in their future but also in the foundations of the Union. A reference was made to unaccompanied minors disappearing upon arrival in Europe, and I think it is important to stress that as well. First of all, it is important that we get the facts and figures straight and that these things are further investigated, but clearly the thought alone sickens me already. Unaccompanied children are among those most vulnerable, and it is deeply troubling that professional gangs might exploit them. The question is: what is the EU doing? I will give you just a few examples. More than EUR 200 million is being earmarked to target the protection of children. Europol and Eurojust are active in helping to dismantle networks involving the smuggling of children. The European Asylum Support Office works on best practice guidance on the assessment of the best interests of the child. The EU helps Member States to be better equipped to deal with the specific needs of child victims of trafficking. Outside the EU, we earmarked EUR 120 million for protection programmes for vulnerable Syrian refugee children, working with NGOs in, for example, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. To conclude, it is important that EU Member States work together to prevent children falling into the hands of criminals.

Unfortunately, the proportion of such children in Europe is small, despite recommendations made by UNICEF to deinstitutionalise care. This is due both to socio-economic factors and to some extent to the different legislative frameworks of adoptions in Europe, providing for different rules and deadlines. Unfortunately, adoption procedures are often very cumbersome, especially in the case of transnational adoptions, where there is insufficient prior information on the related requirements, deadlines and procedures. I believe that the Commission must do its best to improve awareness of adoption procedures and to assist Member States by exchanging good practices in this regard. I also believe that the Commission and the Member States need to take particular care of prevention by developing policies to support families to raise children with the greatest possible concern for their well-being, especially with regard to families at risk of social exclusion and poverty, so as to reduce the number of children being put up for adoption.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we trust our homes, our children, our parents, our sick. These people, who provide us with the opportunity to continue our careers and enjoy our social life, are \"invisible\", undeclared, uninsured, socially excluded and are, above all, women. Two and a half million domestic workers in Europe, 88% of whom are women who work endless hours without leave without medical cover without pensions. They work in conditions that cannot be controlled because there are no appropriate inspection methods in place to identify and protect them where necessary. Our ageing population and women's entry into the labour market create greater needs for domestic and care staff. Member States are aware of this but allow gaps to be filled through the shadow economy. They reduce public spending and exploit waves of migrants as a new cheap workforce that fills such shortages. It is necessary to: - immediately record the situation in the Member States; - adequate legislation on human working conditions; - ratification and implementation of International Labour Organisation Convention 189 on domestic workers; to collectively address their needs; - recognition of these services as a professional activity and certification; - adoption of good practices - France and Belgium are examples in a different way; - approach by trade unions because these workers do not know where to go; - checks with respect to privacy; - updating the workers for their rights and employers for their obligations. I would particularly like to thank Tania González Peñas for the cooperation we have had in drafting the opinion on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as well as all the bodies that have helped to raise the issue. We need their support, especially now, before the vote on the report tomorrow because the conservative side of the European Parliament has called for a separate vote on many important points in the report so that, by voting against them, it will weaken it. If the Conservative majority does not want any binding measures, if it does not want the profession to be recognised, if it does not want workers to be entitled either to a specific working time, to medical cover or maternity leave, if they do not want the Convention of the International Labour Organisation to be ratified, then they must admit that they want undeclared workers without rights.

I am glad that Parliament welcomes our approach for a ‘New start for working parents and care—givers’ because our aim is to take account of recent developments and the needs of the families – those with elderly or dependent relatives, not only parents – and make more equitable use of family-related leave arrangements between partners. Several Commission studies show the importance of the professionalising of domestic work and care. In this regard, the Commission financed three projects to explore the cost—effectiveness of public support for this sector, the quality of services and the productivity gain. The European Quality Framework for long-term care services, launched in 2012, aims to improve the quality of life for older people in need of care and assistance. I also note the request for further analysis on the added value of a professionalisation of the sector of domestic work. I agree that the professionalisation of household service workers and care workers will increase the attractiveness of the sector and the quality of the service provided because it can create jobs. The Commission staff working document on ‘Exploiting the potential of personal and household services’, published in 2012, recognised the potential for job opportunities for the relatively low skilled, in particular as far as housework services are concerned, at a low cost for public finance. To this end, the provision of housework services in the formal economy, rather than in the shadow one, should be encouraged. Some Member States have already put in place a policy on personal and household services: for example, France and Belgium with service vouchers, Finland with tax credit for domestic help or Sweden with tax deduction for service acquisition. Promoting the professional recognition of skills and qualifications is also a priority for domestic workers and carers. All people in Europe must have the right skills for jobs. This can improve their life opportunities. This is why the upcoming Skills Agenda will have a particular focus on improving the transparency of skills and qualifications. This could be very relevant for people with a migrant background or for refugees’ labour market integration.  As regards the International Labour Organisation Convention on fair and decent work for domestic workers (No. 189), the Commission has regularly promoted its ratification. In December 2015, together with the Luxembourg EU Council Presidency, we invited Member States to an expert meeting on the ratification of this Convention.  We acknowledge the plea for an appropriate level of health and safety at work for the workers of this sector. The question of the exclusion of domestic servants from the scope of Directive 89/391/EEC on Safety and Health at Work will be examined in the light of the outcome of the ongoing evaluation of the EU acquis in the area of occupational safety and health. As is mentioned in the report, there has been an increase in recent years in the proportion of female domestic workers who are migrants. I also take note of the recommendation, both to the Commission and the Member States, to ensure the availability of legal avenues for migration to the EU and to introduce targeted legal migration programmes. The Commission has launched a global action programme on migrant domestic workers and their families, which entails pilot projects supporting migrant domestic workers including in Europe. I share the concerns about undeclared work, which is particularly high in this sector and has a negative impact on these people’s working conditions, the quality of their services and, more broadly, the economy. The formalisation of their work would provide adequate social protection and create additional revenues for public finance. It would also increase the quality of their services, which is strongly linked to their working conditions and the recognition of their qualifications. I am confident that the newly—established European Platform to Enhance Cooperation in the Prevention and Deterrence of Undeclared Work will contribute to raising awareness and sharing good practices, analysis and experiences to find solutions to the challenges faced by this sector. I am glad that Parliament stresses the important role social partners can play in addressing sector—specific challenges in the care work sector. We will be interested in following their activities in that domain, while of course respecting their autonomy. In conclusion, I would like to recall that it is the Commission’s firm intention to steer the Union more strongly towards social fairness. No one should be left behind, and that includes domestic workers. The report is therefore both timely and helpful to move forward on several policy files and help us connect the dots between them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 267, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "El Presidente. –", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   This point is closed.

Many are irregular immigrants. Others are relatives who care for dependents without pay or rights. The EU must resolve this unfair situation by introducing a legal framework for the professionalisation of domestic work and care, and by presenting a directive to regulate the situation of non-professional caregivers assisting dependents. States should define a specific legal framework for the regular recruitment of domestic workers and caregivers and establish the rights and duties of employers and workers. These people take care of our dependent children and relatives and also of us so that we can develop our jobs and vocations outside the home, which they care for.

Firstly, they are often people employed in the grey economy, deprived of workers' rights, irregular status and working hours. This makes them devoid of job security and social security.  Secondly, there are also cases of gender discrimination, harassment and harassment. This makes it necessary to take certain measures to lift the sector out of the grey economy and to empower its people.

However, their employers must realise that they must respect their labour and social rights, such as working hours or privacy requirements.

Compliance with basic labour standards is also ensured by the International Convention on Domestic Workers of the International Labour Organisation. I would therefore like to support my colleague Kuneva's report and call for the ratification of this convention even by those States that have not yet done so.

The first is that digitalisation is only about technological development. It is not. Digitalisation will completely shape our societies and will have an impact on all areas of our lives. So digital policies are in fact societal policies, and that is exactly why gender equality should be at the core of this debate.  The second stereotype is that women are not interested in the digital revolution. I must tell you that they are. Working on this report, talking to many women who are already active in the digital sector today, I became convinced of this myself. The problem is just that they very often face obstacles in the ICT sector or in STEM education. What we need to do is to create the right preconditions for them to fully conquer the digital arena. These stupid stereotypes are not our fate. We can challenge them and that is exactly what this report is doing. The report does indeed show the challenges, but it also gives concrete tools to overcome them and the amazing potential that the digital world holds both for women and for the enhancement of gender equality in our societies, be it the Bulgarian game developer who is facing everyday sexism in her job, be it the French Cameroonian digital entrepreneur who does not get access to funding because she is not considered creditworthy , or be it the Irish mother of two who is being stalked by a troll on Facebook. This report provides answers to all of these examples. It calls for more efforts to make the educational sector more inclusive and e-skills attainable to all. It calls for more funding opportunities for female entrepreneurs, and it asks for better cooperation between police authorities to combat stalking and harassment online European-wide. So we can see that the tools are there. Now we will just have to make them reality. Ms Jourová, I hope that not only you, but the whole Commission, will stand behind this and push this in the future. All this great work and the great results that we see in this report could not have been possible without input from great activists, civil society, female entrepreneurs and many other people who have given input, and the great work of all my colleagues who have shadowed this report and contributed a lot to making it such a success. I thank you all for your constructive work.

Consequently, Member States must recognise that compulsory education is to include a relevant ICT education from the earlier stages of education that will enable women and girls to obtain the necessary e-skills to fully participate in socio-economic development, as well as to foster amongst them the understanding that they, too, are contributors to digital innovation and are able to obtain skills for employment in the digital sector.

Of course, gender discrimination can also be seen in the workplace in general, since the wage and pension differences are quite large, whereas in countries such as Greece, which is affected by the Memorandums, women are the group of the population most affected.

This is a topic that deserves our undivided attention. The fact that women are under-represented throughout the ICT sector is a key challenge that we need to tackle. The report by Mrs Reintke very much contributes to raising awareness of this challenge and offers solid recommendations that are aimed at strengthening women’s participation in the ICT sector. The report brings us a step closer to closing the gender gap in the sector, and for this reason I would like to thank the rapporteur of this excellent and forward—looking report. The Commission is fully committed to take further action in this area, as outlined in the ‘Strategic Engagement for gender equality’. The Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs, for example, is a multi-stakeholder partnership, which tackles the lack of digital skills in Europe. Some of the pledges target only women. The Strategic Engagement includes a key action that focuses on using the Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs to support measures enhancing digital skills among women and girls and promoting female employment in the ICT sector. The Commission has been active in promoting opportunities for girls and women in the sector as well. The ICT sector is rapidly growing, creating around 120 000 new jobs every year. In view of the good job and salary prospects, we would like to see more women take advantage of this situation and consider a career in the sector. Women active in this sector generally enjoy higher flexibility to arrange their working schedules and will be less susceptible to unemployment. When considering economic arguments for increasing female participation in the ICT sector, the Commission’s study on women active in the sector found that more women entering the digital jobs market can create an annual EUR 9 billion GDP boost in the EU area. Furthermore, women working in the sector earn almost 9% more than women in similar positions in other service sectors.  In order to increase women’s opportunities in the digital age, it is of the utmost importance to tackle women’s under-representation in the sector. At this moment, only nine in 100 European app developers are female; 19% of ICT managers are women and less than 30% of the ICT workforce is female. When we look at the educational aspect we see that, today, only 29 out of every 1 000 female graduates have a computing or related degree.  The Commission supports several initiatives that promote getting more women into digital jobs and encourage girls to pursue ICT-related subjects. For example, the European Network of Women Web Entrepreneurs Hubs (WeHubs) is the first network of partners which specifically supports women to create and scale-up their web enterprises, building links between women entrepreneurs, investors and the web entrepreneurship ecosystems.  The Digital Single Market with its e-society dimension constitutes a great opportunity for women in digital. But we need more role models, mentoring, greater engagement of business and industry by offering even more targeted programmes to study and work in the ICT sector. More grass-root initiatives like the Code Week are needed – during the 2015 EU Code Week half of the almost half a million young coders were young girls! We also need to get men involved in the debate on diversity. I strongly believe that tackling gender stereotypes will contribute to creating equal opportunities in the workplace and will attract more women to the sector.  As also highlighted in the report, the increasing digitalisation of society also poses some threats to gender equality, including cyber—bullying, cyber—harassment, cyber—stalking and sexist forms of hate speech. The Fundamental Rights Agency survey on women’s experiences of violence shows that one in ten women has experienced sexual harassment or stalking through new technologies. All forms of violence against women and girls, including cyber-violence, are rooted in gender inequalities and reinforce them further.  The EU is committed to fighting against such violence as affirmed in a number of strategic documents. An important action that the Commission has undertaken in this area is the proposals for the European Union to sign and conclude the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention, a comprehensive international treaty on combatting violence against women and domestic violence. This includes provisions to encourage the participation of the information and communication technology sector in combating this phenomenon, also in the online sphere. Considering the excellent recommendations outlined in the report, it is clear that there are significant challenges ahead of us. Let us take advantage of the new and great opportunities and explore ways to advance women’s empowerment in the digital age. I look forward to tackling the challenges together in order to break down gender stereotypes and use the technological innovations as drivers of progress towards gender equality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 283, "date": "2016-04-27.json", "name": "El Presidente. –", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   This point is closed.
