It sets up an EU system of self—certification of importers of 3Ts and gold, modelled on the OECD due diligence guidelines for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict-affected areas.  What the conflict-affected areas are, entrepreneurs will receive guidance to establish, but this regulation does not tell them. This is not country-specific: it is conflict-specific, if I may put it that way, so it does not deal with any specific country or region.  Let me emphasise that our aim here is to build a coalition of responsible stakeholders in the interests of the people and the local communities in conflict-affected areas. Responsible sourcing of minerals from those areas is a very complex challenge. The objective of the EU approach is to break the link between economic activity and transparently—managed industry and trade, and conflict financing and conflict fuelling.  Parliament has called on the Commission to take action on this issue. Therefore, last March the Commission came up with the draft regulation and the joint communication to accompany it.  Let me take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, the coordinators in Parliament’s Committee on International Trade (INTA), Committee on Development and Committee on Foreign Affairs, the shadow rapporteurs, all colleagues and all the stakeholders involved in the debate in the past months, for the great amount of work invested in this.  My objective as rapporteur is to contribute and draw up an efficient regulation which has to be coherent with the integrated EU approach, an approach which is built on three pillars: a trade regulation which is setting up the supply chain due diligence self-certification mechanism; accompanying measures to assist European Union companies in their uptake of the self-certification system, firstly and with a special focus on European SMEs; and accompanying measures on the ground to be deployed through political, diplomatic and development cooperation specially designed to support capacity-building, better governance and, first of all, education of all the stakeholders involved.  In order to achieve these effects and Parliamentʼs intentions, trade regulation has to be efficient and workable. The compromise voted in INTA, which is on the table for the vote tomorrow, is a compromise that fulfils this objective. It provides the voluntary responsibility-based approach with mandatory due diligence obligations for EU smelters and refiners, and also importers of minerals. It takes on board existing experience and incorporates already—functioning self-certification mechanisms, so it takes on board a great deal of work which has already been done by industry initiatives by providing the possibility of recognition for already established and OECD-compatible schemes.  It introduces the European ʽresponsible importerʼ label for the importers under the regulation and it draws up a list of responsible European importers. It introduces voluntary labelling for companies operating in the downstream European certification of responsibility, which is introduced also under the regulation proposed. This proposal, voted in INTA, respects the principles of prudent and proportionate legislating. It does not unilaterally impose obligations on EU companies; it respects and ensures a consistent uptake of the minerals market towards responsible conflict-free certification.  This proposal also focuses specially on the large number of European SMEs involved. It protects these SMEs with the right incentives and assistance, and does this under the umbrella of the COSME programme. It includes a strong and clear review clause that provides for the possibility to assess the effects of the regulation on the ground. The review also provides the opportunity to accommodate evolutions in the OECD due diligence framework regarding additional minerals beyond 3TG as they are elaborated by the OECD.  The proposal also avoids the risk of trade diversion, disengagement from conflict areas, unwanted but de facto embargoes effects, and any surge in smuggling and illegal trade with a negative price effect on the market. It does all this because it provides a functional and workable implementing framework for the regulation.  I believe that the proposal voted in the INTA Committee and tabled in this plenary fulfils the objective of the integrated EU approach, so I ask Members to support this proposal in the vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this is an important occasion to debate a very important issue, namely how to eliminate conflict minerals from our supply chains. By doing so, we will reduce the great hardship, endless wars and human rights abuses that have traditionally come with them. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Winkler, the Committee on International Trade (INTA), the other committees and all the Members who have been active in working on this issue.  One of the challenges in trade policy is to harness the potential of our economies while creating effective systems to avoid negative consequences, like the one we are discussing today. This challenge is particularly acute in developing countries, and the issue of conflict minerals is one of the most glaring examples.  On the one hand, we do need a global market-based approach to raw materials that provides developing countries with a vital source of stable income through trade in natural resources. On the other hand, we need to break the link between minerals and conflict, the most obvious example of which is the conflict in the Great Lakes region in Africa. The situation there is horrific. Millions of people have been killed and millions more injured and traumatised since the outbreak of the first Congo war in the mid-1990s. While Congo is the most dramatic example of the phenomenon, it is not the only one. Therefore, following calls for action by the United States, the G8 and this Parliament, based on the work of the OECD, the Commission developed, jointly with the High Representative, an integrated approach. The draft regulation we are discussing here today is only one of its components. I insist on this integrated approach because it is crucial to understand – and I know you all do – that there is no silver bullet to deal with this problem. It is by nature multidimensional and extremely complicated. So we must look at it from different angles – development, political, the trade perspective – all at the same time.  The size of Europe’s trade footprint is such that businesses here must play their part. The EU is amongst the world’s largest importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold ores and concentrates, with a share of almost 35% of global trade. The EU is also a relatively large importer of tin, tantalum and tungsten and gold metals which presently represent almost 25% and 15% of global trade respectively.  But precisely because of our importance in trade, we can also make things worse if we do not approach it in the right way. If we impose a mandatory scheme without making sure that the conditions on the ground in the conflict regions are right in order to support the implementation of such a system, we do run a high risk of further disrupting global supply chains and driving them away from Africa altogether.  We also risk creating trade diversion, resulting in prejudice against individual countries, or even the whole continent, and that would lead to plummeting prices for minerals from certain origins. We can also risk continuing to have thriving underground markets in conflict and high-risk areas and a prosperous smuggling sector. We can also create a severe shortage in the EU for companies that are – most of the time – willing, but unable, to check their supply chains effectively, and we will have achieved nothing on the ground since we will have placed fragile mining areas and local communities under additional pressure from international markets.  If you do not believe me, you can have a look at the situation in the Great Lakes region since the US mandatory scheme in the Dodd-Frank Act came into effect. The difficulties there are described in United Nations reports year after year. The Commission proposal has taken these key considerations into account, following an in-depth impact assessment exercise. Our plan is focused, proportionate and designed to complement the other components of the integrated approach.  Our proposal focuses on smelters and refiners. Until they know where they source their minerals from, we cannot reasonably ask the majority of downstream companies to know. Many of them might be tempted to lie. It will include responsible smelters and refiners in the EU and worldwide on a white list and consequently a ‘name and shame’ system for those that do not appear on it. There are no more than 40 smelters in the EU. How many of them do you think are able not to appear on that list? There will be a lot of pressure from you, from NGOs and from other business. I would argue not a single one. Moreover, the Commission proposal sets up an enforcement structure to be deployed by Member States’ competent authorities to ensure that operators claiming to be responsible are truly so. It also includes a strong review clause to open the possibility for switching – in a staged manner – to a mandatory approach in the event that the current proposal does not deliver. It operates in parallel to the EUR 20 million package that the High Representative and the Commission have announced to further support capacity building in conflict regions. So I think this voluntary, incentives-based approach, integrated for responsible sourcing, is the most appropriate one to achieve the common goal that we have here. I thank you for this possibility to debate it and am looking forward to the debate.

The creation of a responsible trade in minerals in the EU countries offers hope for improving the situation of the inhabitants in those regions from which these minerals are extracted. Therefore, it is important to flow information at different stages of the supply chain: from extraction to the final product. In my opinion, I have proposed commitments for the top of the chain, particularly refiners, smelters and importers, and due diligence for the bottom of the chain in line with OECD guidelines. It is necessary to take into account the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which often do not have sufficient resources. From the point of view of the Committee on Development, accompanying measures are very important to continue cooperation with developing countries.

We need regulation that helps the people on the ground quickly. We do not need regulation that never comes into force, which may please one or the other political activist in Europe better, but which will ultimately not reach the people. We need something that passes through Parliament and the Council quickly and arrives on the ground. Congratulations to the Commission for the comprehensive approach! I think it is important that you have once again attached importance, Commissioner, to the fact that it is not just a question of legislation alone, but also of the accompanying measures. In our Committee on External Trade, we have sharpened up a little bit and made certain areas binding, e.B. for melting. But I think we should also learn from the negative experiences of other states. I believe that the Dodd-Frank Act was not only positive for the people on the ground. The rapporteur and also the Commissioner have mentioned this: it is a de facto partial embargo against Congo. It has led to small mines being closed in some areas today, the employees there no longer having any income, us driving families into illegality, the increase in smuggling, the fact that we have new dependencies. And that is precisely what we do not want from our European legislation. We should also learn from the mistakes of others. That is why I would like us to adopt the legislation somewhat readjusted, as we decided today in the Committee on External Trade. I would be grateful if we could support them together. I call on the Council not to let the dossier fall asleep, but also to let it pass quickly. And I would like to send out an explicit signal of our group's willingness: if, contrary to expectations, nothing turns for the better on the ground in two or three years' time, then we are happy to talk about the next steps.

You know perfectly well that there is, as my fellow Members know, a link between mineral extraction and the financing of armed militias, and this link must be broken because breaking it would mean cutting off the economic funding that feeds the guerrillas. Breaking this link would also help limit the odious violence against women and children who are used by warlords as slaves to work in mines. In order to do this, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need compulsory traceability of minerals throughout the production and trade chain. We Socialists are not prepared to support a fetish regulation, a bluff, a buffet on the cheeks of the lords of death and major financial interests. In view of tomorrow's vote on the table, there is already a possible compromise solution which represents a balance between the different positions of the political groups and which also takes into account the legitimate needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises.

While we cannot agree on the form of the EU’s approach and which direction it should take, at least we can agree that this is a problem that must be overcome. Unfortunately, in my view, there is a real risk that by going in a certain direction we make matters worse for those on the ground. This is not what we want to do. While there are differences between the US Dodd-Frank Act and the mandatory measures being proposed by some groups, my concern is that the effects of a full mandatory approach will have similarly cumbersome requirements, particularly for the downstream supply chain. The response of many European companies, following the implementation of these requirements, will be to source elsewhere, creating de facto embargoes to the detriment of innocent miners and their families. Evidence from the Congo already points to this very problem. So my alternative proposals are clear. We have established that there is a pinch point in the supply chain where there is a very realistic opportunity to determine the source of the minerals. A political compromise in the committee vote led to a mandatory approach being taken for this critical part of the supply chain, and I am happy to support it. Whether we like it or not, further down the supply chain it becomes more and more unfeasible for companies to prove where minerals used in finished products have come from. This does not mean that attempts cannot in fact be made to find verification, and they are already being made through many industry schemes which we should recognise and also encourage. But as long as we adopt a strong review clause, which I believe we have done in our committee vote, it gives us the opportunity to assess the impact of our legislation and particularly to take into consideration the voluntary uptake for the scheme for downstream companies and the impact that it has really had on the ground. If changes need to be made at that point, then we will make them in full possession of the facts, rather than rushing into creating a top-down scheme that may do more harm than good. At this point we will see what works, what does not work, and what more needs to be done to eliminate the use of these minerals and metals to fund conflict worldwide.

This legislation will therefore have to be supported by the Commission and the Council in the long run. For the European Parliament, traceability must be mandatory for all key players in the sector; that is the meaning of our vote in the INTA committee. If we continue to adopt this approach tomorrow, any importer of minerals, smelters or european refineries will now have to certify that their imported ores are clean, that they do not come from a conflict zone. At the same time, European SMEs will receive financial assistance to establish traceability of these minerals and then be granted a \"conflict-free\" label. We have an appointment clause and, after three years, we will be able to take stock of these regulations and assess very concretely what has or has not worked. The Commission will therefore be able - this is the meaning of the amendment I will table tomorrow - to increase the obligations, including that of informing, and we will also be able to increase the number of minerals affected by this legislation.

We know that, in fact, an embargo has taken place on the mines in southern Congo, and that this is not going in the right direction. I believe that our legislation and our approach can serve as a model and that at the international level of the United Nations, we will have to agree on the issue of natural resources, which belong to the planet, to the people of the countries and which therefore must be taken into account in a sustainable way.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Let us once again see why we want to pass this law: people are becoming victims of conflicts that are fought over raw materials, or at least financed by the sale of raw materials. The profit chain of the perpetrators extends as far as the European Union. This regulation is intended to help bring transparency to the procurement channels of the manufacturing industry, thereby ending or at least making it more difficult to do business with war, rape and child labour. To this end, one, this law – Mrs Malmström, Mr Caspary, ladies and gentlemen – must be effective. Let us listen to Denis Mukwege, let us listen to many experts from the conflict regions, to church representatives, even to business circles! They all say that voluntary commitment by companies is not enough; there is an urgent need for a binding regulation for the entire supply chain. However, the draft of the INTA Committee, which was narrowly adopted by a majority, would require only 20 European smelters to cooperate. In other words, 80% of the raw materials for conflict sold from Congo alone would have no effect on this regulation, because the smelting takes place mainly in Asia. We can still make this regulation binding on the entire processing chain. Amendments to this are now again before the Plenary. It is time to finally make concrete work for the victims of the atrocities of the conflicts. And this is where the ring for the root cause of conflict, which we are all talking about, closes, in the face of refugee dramas in the Mediterranean and elsewhere.

This situation is not limited to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Around the world, there is general talk of the curse of resources that enrich the North and impoverish the South.  It is to end this curse of resources that we call for transparent and responsible management of the trade of resources.

Twenty years have already passed since the UN report, and we are still debating it today. Millions of deaths today are involved. Our group calls for an ambitious settlement immediately, which requires all companies using 3TGs throughout the european supply chain to submit to the duty of information.

We put forward amendments with mandatory schemes for smelters and refiners, which are the key players in this market and cover most of the global market.

Through a review, we ensure that adequate enough mechanisms are in place to make sure that we accomplished in practice what we hope to accomplish now with this regulation. There are important lessons to be learned from the past, such as from the Dodd-Frank Act which unintentionally led to Congo-free instead of conflict-free implications and hurt many people in their legitimate work and livelihoods.

Limiting the obligation to comply with the duty of care to smelters, refineries and importers of minerals and metals without the slightest duty of information for the 879,000 downstream companies - that is, 99% of the companies concerned - has more disadvantages than benefits for European companies. What for? Because, without any obligation, downstream companies will always have the choice of buying conflict minerals from other international operators not covered by the regulation, or even sourcing through the illegal trafficking channel. There is therefore a major economic reason - which some obviously do not want to understand - for European companies to impose at least a duty to inform all companies.

Parliament has today, as over the last year, contributed greatly to raising awareness of this very important issue. That awareness and that public pressure has also made many of the global mineral supply chains increasingly aware of the need to set due diligence standards as part of their corporate social responsibility. This debate shows that we all share the same goals. We need to break the link between conflict trade minerals and the terrible violence that we have all witnessed, which affects so many children, women and men. We need to promote transparent, responsible mineral supply chains so that we can keep the money out of the hands of rebel groups; so that we can ensure that the revenue from this trade is available for good governance, for health, for schools and for other vital public services; and so that we can encourage economic growth that provides conflict-affected areas with hope for a better future. In the Commission proposal we do address the upstream part of the supply chains, and with the accompanying measures we have set aside EUR 20 million: this money is to improve the conditions on the ground but also to help companies – especially small and medium-size companies – to be able to do the checks, the audits and the traceability because that is not easy today. We should not fool ourselves. It is not easy even for the best meaning company to be fully sure of where all its supplies come from. So this is to support them in doing this.  We also create an EU list of due diligence for the downstream companies with a possibility to name and shame, and I am quite confident – and this has strengthened in me after this debate – that most, if not all, companies will be on that list. If this is not effective there is a review clause to push further. I think there has been a lot of work going on in this Parliament and I would like to pay tribute to the work in the Committee on International Trade and others to improve the Commission proposal, to make it even stronger, to make a proposal that we can be proud of here in the European Union and so that we can also achieve our goals while learning from some of the experiences in the past.

The interests of people and communities caught in war and conflict cannot be served by an EU regulation alone; that is why we need an EU integrated approach.

At this last plenary session, the important dossier concerning the proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European system of self-certification for importers of certain minerals or metals originating in conflict and high-risk areas, so-called conflict minerals, was discussed and voted on. The debate and subsequent vote focused mainly on a particular point that proved controversial: extending traceability obligations (self-certification) not only to foundries, refineries and importers of certain minerals, but also to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are part of the supply chain. This has been considered by many to be essential in order to make effective the traceability obligations imposed on the main players in the supply chain, which would otherwise be easily circumvented. A company would have every interest, and the real possibility, of accessing the most advantageous black market if it were to act on a voluntary basis in declaring and guaranteeing the origin of the minerals.

Therefore, this regulation, which attempts to break the link between the illegal exploitation of minerals and international disputes, deserves to be examined again.

It is the fruit of six months of constructive work within the Commission and with all of you in the European Parliament. During this time I had many contacts with various parliamentary committees. They expressed their support for building a Digital Single Market for Europe. We all recognise its importance and the benefits that it will bring for people and business, for creating economic growth and employment. Our strategy has a clear timetable, with 16 ambitious initiatives based around three interlinked policy pillars: better access for consumers and businesses to digital goods and services across Europe; and high—quality infrastructure that works smoothly across Europe. We also need to create the right and fair conditions in the underlying environment, preparing for the future to maximise the growth potential of the digital economy. I will highlight a few initiatives under each pillar. An urgent first task is to secure and guarantee free movement of goods and services in a unified digital space and to improve online access generally. The Digital Single Market aims to boost cross-border e-commerce by encouraging SMEs to sell across borders.  One of our first initiatives will be to bring rules for online purchases more into line across the European Union. People could save EUR 11.7 billion per year if they could choose from a full range of EU goods and services when they shop online. The Digital Single Market is also about modernising today’s copyright system. We want to improve people’s access to cultural content online while opening new opportunities for creators and the content industry. This will also promote cultural diversity.  We will present legislative proposals before the end of 2015 to reduce the differences between national copyright regimes and allow for wider online access to works across the European Union. Then, under its second pillar, the strategy will look to improve conditions for digital networks and services to underpin the Digital Single Market. The Commission will propose an ambitious reform of EU telecoms rules. This will include more effective spectrum coordination. It will also tackle regulatory differences around EU national markets and create better incentives for investments in high-speed broadband. The Commission will also conduct a comprehensive analysis of the role of online platforms. It will focus on transparency, liability and equal conditions for competition. Lastly, we will build a solid foundation for long-term growth. Europe needs to take full advantage of the digital economy where data is becoming all-important and where people have the skills needed to fill new jobs. They must also have trust and confidence when they go online. Common standards and interoperability are essential to make the best of fast-growing sectors such as cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. We also need them in the context of promoting e—government services around Europe and a more inclusive e-society. Together, these initiatives form a realistic roadmap for us to work together over the next four and a half years. They will prepare Europe for a bright digital future. They will help people and companies to get the best from the online world. I want Europeans to have better protection when buying online, lower cost for deliveries, more choice and better access to content, goods and services from other EU countries. With the Digital Single Market strategy, the Commission is looking at opportunities that our citizens could enjoy to help us create a vibrant, creative digital economy and society in Europe. For businesses, the Commission will focus on bringing opportunities for them to create new innovative products for a single market of 500 million people, not 28 splintered national markets. European companies and industries must be at the forefront of the digital revolution using the Digital Single Market to scale up, not to move out. We need equal conditions for all to compete openly and fairly in this digital market. Every company, large or small, plays by the same rules: no discrimination, no favouritism.  I do not have enough time now to go into the details of each initiative that we are planning. However, one thing I do want to say is that they must be taken together as a coordinated and balanced package. If we only succeed in putting half of them into effect, then we will not end up with a true Digital Single Market. I look forward now to your comments and views.

It must therefore be given great importance, without wasting time.

Europe must be digital creator and not just a consumer, that is, as you said, Mr Vice-President, that it must support the authors' markets and guarantee copyright.

The Socialists and Democrats support strongly this development because it is a way for growth. It is a way for new jobs, for quality jobs. The impact of the digital single market on the labour market is at the core of our interest and our concern, because we know very well that there are huge opportunities, but also huge risks. It is not only about consumption, it is about the digitalisation of the traditional industries and creating new services, which means there is also a need for creation of new skills. We know that there is a shortage of skilled labour in this area. At the same time, there are a lot of people who will lose their jobs and will need retraining. So we hope that the Commission will bring us not only the legislation needed for new services and new technologies, but also ways to invest in education, in retraining and in the development of human resources. When we look at the digital scoreboard, then huge inequalities between regions are there; between different social groups, in terms of access as well as skills. So the Socialists and Democrats are very much concerned to ensure that these inequalities do not grow, but will be covered in our new developments. We call on the Commission to make new efforts for new legislation, as well as for new research in this area. All of these impacts – the social impact and the impact on the labour market – need deep assessment so that we will be conscious and will not have unexpected negative risks. We hope that we will go all together; we saw last night and see today that the Parliament is unanimous in supporting the development.

The single market is meant to make it easy to trade across 28 countries, and it must be fit for purpose in the digital age. The Commission strategy is good in parts, but needs more work in others. We need to focus on practical solutions to break down barriers to trade, to remove unnecessary red tape and to encourage investment. We must make it easier, not harder, for innovation to flourish, and be mindful that the digital market is a global market. Building a fortress around Europe will not work.  We should listen to what users are asking for. Businesses want it to be easy to set up and sell on line to 500 million consumers with lower costs and simple secure systems so that they get paid. Consumers want to be able to trust that their purchases will arrive and that faulty goods can be returned, replaced or refunded. Platforms in the shared economy are growing because businesses and consumers want to use them, and people do want to be able to shop wherever they are and take their films, books and music with them when they travel. But enabling portability must not create a back door for piracy. Creators do need to know that their work, their copyright, has value and can be enforced. Security is key, especially for parents who want to know that their children are safe online.  Researchers want to unlock the benefits of big data – huge benefits for medicine, for the environment, for the economy – but individuals also want to know that their data is safe. Then there is the call for more modern manufacturing and more modern infrastructure. In all of this, investors in enterprises want legal clarity and the certainty of a level playing field. The digital economy must be fair, transparent and open. In Europe, sometimes our grand plans do stall, and many times small steps reach a destination faster. Top-down legislation, heavy-handed bans and centralised controls – we know how these can put a handbrake on innovation and investment.

The World Wide Web was developed in Europe, and it was a marketplace, if you like, an exchange place, for opinions and knowledge, and not just a commercial place. That is the direction in which it should go. The development of a free infrastructure should be particularly important to us.

We therefore welcome an inclusive multiannual strategy and welcome the three pillars, but be ware of the timetable for implementing and implementing the measures outlined in the package. In this area, in fact, even more than in others, it is essential that the legislative process is in step with the times. And if, to date, only 7% of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises sell beyond the borders of their own country and only 15% of consumers buy online in a country other than their own, it is clear that there is a long way to go.  Developing the potential of e-commerce represents a new frontier for European businesses and the effects for consumers will be tangible: lower prices, wider choice and a higher quality of goods and services. It is necessary to simplify and clarify transactions between the different Member States: all too often, in fact, entrepreneurs and consumers give up because of certain complexities. And this is just one of the things that we can work on together to make sure that industries and citizens make full use of the potential of new digital services and goods.

From the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we can see - and we have heard many testimonies in our committee - that there is indeed still a great deal of work to be done to create this internal digital market.  We see that there are still far too many barriers that make it difficult, or sometimes impossible, for consumers and producers to take advantage of the many digital opportunities that exist. I am thinking, for example, of a Netflix subscription. Someone who buys a Netflix subscription in Belgium cannot yet benefit from this in all Member States, which is a pity and surpassed today. We also see that many companies still face a great deal of administrative and financial burden, because they often have to abide by the consumer rights of the 28 different Member States. These thresholds must therefore be removed as soon as possible. Your plan contains broad objectives and does want to address some of these thresholds, but In my opinion the plan is far too broad and lacks concrete action points. I fear that this will lead us to pursue the facts on important points.

That is the question! And we think there are two things that need to be repackaged. The first is to create a copyright reform worthy of the name. To this end, the catalogue of restrictions must be opened up and made binding in order to actually remove the patchwork of exceptions and restrictions in the European Union. This is the only way to achieve a truly meaningful harmonisation of copyright and not by following the money. However, there is no such consequence in the paper.

But they also need to know that their communication is secure. Therefore, I am very worried about the recent talk about creating a backdoor to the encrypted software. This will greatly undermine the trust in e—commerce, but also in the economy as a whole. So my question is this: how does that fit into the digital market strategy?

It is a good first mark to adapt European regulations to the realities of today's technological developments. However, it needs to be deepened and fleshed out in many areas. The Digital Single Market is essential for the economic development of the European Union, but it has just as great potential to preserve and disseminate cultural creative content. The Internet has radically changed the way we consume content. Therefore, the legal requirements must be adapted to technological changes in such a way as to facilitate legal access to online content, including across borders or from abroad. However, we must take a special approach to this. For some European artistic and creative sectors, the territorial principle is at the heart of their financing structures and thus the prerequisite for diversity in creativity, for the production of new European content, especially for small and medium-sized producers, for special cultural films that are adequately adapted to their respective markets. We need to strike a balance between copyright-protected rights and consumer demand to consume digital content across national borders. I agree with the Commission: portability is essential, but without destroying the economic framework for professional creation of creative content. A complete abolition of the territorial principle in every area would seriously jeopardise European cultural diversity. The result would be a concentration on some large producers and mainstream offerings, which we certainly do not want. That is why we must take special care in this regard. On the subject of AVMD, I would like to call on the Commission to include more closely the issue of platform regulation and to find regulations in the area of access and discoverability. The diversity of cultural and audiovisual offerings must be accessible and discoverable for all European citizens, especially if equipment manufacturers, network operators or content providers already pre-sort the content offered.

I would like to start with Marju Lauristin. Yes, I agree. Some people will lose their jobs, but digital is creating many more jobs than it is destroying. But we have to help those people who lose their jobs to find new ones. We have to pay much more attention to the lifelong learning process.  The cost of non-Europe in a digital sense is huge. According to the latest analyses prepared by the European Parliament, the cost of non-Europe in this sense is EUR 415 billion. I am afraid that if we do not act immediately, this cost of non—Europe will even increase in the future.  The Commission is planning to make all its proposals during this year and next. We do not want to leave those proposals to the end of our mandate. There is a sense of urgency in the Commission too. I would also like to ask you to speed up those processes.  Data protection reform, the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive, and the Telecoms Single Market package are essential building blocks for a Digital Single Market. A date for the end of roaming is something our people are really expecting to get from those negotiations. I would like to ask you to push for an end to roaming in the European Union. I would like to state that very clearly. (Applause) The European Commission is also asking for end dates for roaming in the European Union.  I would like to respond to Kaja Kallas’s question. I have also followed the discussions in the Estonian press and I would like to state very clearly that in the Commission we never had – and we do not have – any kind of plans to create backdoors for identification systems. There is no basis for that kind of rumour. Trust is a must and we do not want to destroy the people’s trust by creating backdoor identification systems. If there are any backdoors, sooner or later somebody will misuse them anyway. There were many questions about copyright, the principle of territoriality and the abolishing of geo-blocking. We have to allow our people to have cross—border access to digital content and the portability of the content. We have to allow cross-border access to digital content, to movies, music, e—books etc. We have to allow the portability of digital content to our people. When we talk about copyright reform, we do not want to change, with this Digital Single Market strategy, the release window system, such as six months for movies in cinemas. It is up to the industry to say for how long a period of time they would like to keep those movies in cinemas. If six months, then six months, if 16, then 16, if 60 months, then once again it is up to the industry and not up to the Commission to say for how long a period of time the producers would like to keep their movies in cinemas. It is a question about entrepreneurial freedom as I understand it.  Regarding DVDs, once again it is up to the industry to say for how long a period they would like to keep those movies on DVD. But when it comes to video on demand, I would like to ask for cross-border access to the content and for portability of the content. Today, everybody knows that piracy is free; you do not have to pay. I am sorry to say that many people are using those possibilities. According to public opinion polls as many as 68% of film viewers in Europe use so-called free downloads; 20% of internet users in the European Union are using VPNs. So we have to tackle piracy, but first we have to provide legal access to digital content for our people.  Thank you very much once again for this very fruitful debate. The Digital Single Market is not the finishing line. The Digital Single Market strategy is not the finishing line. They are just starting points. I look forward to having fruitful cooperation with all of you over the next four and a half years.

Firstly, I believe it is essential to promote digital innovation in our traditional companies, particularly manufacturing companies; We also have a duty to create an environment favourable to European start-ups, so that they cannot find a development space only overseas.

Digitising traditional industries and creating new services also means developing new skills. The fast-growing Internet of Things and online platforms require expertise, and with the current shortage of skilled labour in this area, adequate facilities for this type of education urgently need to be created. For young people who choose this type of profession, as well as for those who have lost their jobs and are forced to retrain. I hope that the Commission will draw up such a plan for investing in education and the development of human resources, together with an analysis of its impact on society and its impact on the labour market.

A supportive and customer-friendly legal and structural framework is needed at EU level as well as at national level both for citizens and businesses.  To provide for cross-border e—European solutions, the Commission has to come forward with ambitious legislative proposals. Only 7 % of SMEs sell cross-border. Lack of trust among sellers and buyers is based on prejudices, high delivery prices and complicated tax systems. Providing a minimum commonality in rules would change the picture. Online content – music, newspapers, books – must be made available for customers. Ironically it is practically impossible to purchase any audiovisual products online from another EU Member State. Europeanising copyright and ending geo-blocking must happen.  I call on the Commission and the Member States to tear down these protective walls and enable a genuine e-Europe!

Only such a market will allow the creation of a knowledge-based society that develops evenly, for the benefit of all citizens. Current social and social priorities must be reflected in the digital world. We must also ensure consumer protection and freedom of establishment in the digital age.  These challenges need a clear and personalised action plan and training for different social groups to meet their expectations, needs and new opportunities for growth in the digital age.

Only through investment in innovation and new technologies can Europe remain a leader in the world economy. Unfortunately, today, national bureaucracy and regulations are hindering the development of top companies at European level and expressing the real potential of European digital entrepreneurs.  The European Union has the human resources and innovative ideas that can lead to technological progress worldwide, but in order to do so, it must facilitate the connecting entrepreneurs and creative people with the financial resources capable of enabling their ideas to be implemented. I like to think that in such a context my country, Romania, can become a central actor at European level and a regional leader in new technologies. To do this, the EU needs to raise awareness of the importance of new technologies, develop digital-friendly investment programmes, create an unrestricted digital market, but also facilitate the training and education of the population, regardless of generation or region, in the development of these skills either at the usual or professional level.

In order to take full advantage of the opportunities of interconnected e-services, it is necessary to stimulate the development of digital skills, which significantly increases the chances of young people finding a job. Statistics show that 40% of the EU workforce does not have adequate digital skills and 14% do not have them at all. The results of the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) are also alarming. In Bulgaria, for example, only 1.3% of Bulgarians aged 20 to 29 are graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

It is high time to put an end to persistent discrimination on grounds of nationality, not only in the case of so-called geo-blocking, but in general in access to goods and services. I have been drawing the Commission's attention to this for a long time. But the digitisation of society is far from just about the internal market. We're hearing about hundreds of thousands of new jobs. But do we know how many will be lost? How will the status of workers change?

A common European approach is a guarantor of achieving this objective. Since technology is used in all segments of life, from private to business use, it is crucial to create a market that will allow freedom of movement of goods, persons, services and capital, and where individuals and companies can easily access and carry out online activities in conditions of fair competition. In doing so, it is necessary to achieve a high level of protection of personal data. I also think it is essential that Europe becomes a world leader in the digital economy, and will achieve this goal by creating a Digital Single Market that will enable european companies to develop globally. I support the 3 pillars of the decision, which state the need to eliminate key differences between online and offline worlds in order to break the barrier on the way to cross-border online activity. In addition, high-speed, secure and reliable content infrastructures and services are needed, supported by the right regulatory conditions for innovation, investment and fair competition.

One can wonder, for example, about the situation of Disneyland Paris, which discriminates against European consumers.

Therefore, in my opinion, extending benchmarks to regulated activities rather than subjecting them to market play only is essential to restore customer confidence in the financial markets.  Published indicators, so important e.g. for borrowers, must be transparent. The point is that the public is not only aware of these indicators, but also of the methods on which exchange rates and LIBOR indicators are set.

Unfortunately, however, the economic crisis has put increasing pressure on Member States' budgets, affecting patient safety, and many Member States have dramatically reduced the budget and staffing levels of healthcare systems without properly addressing the issue of effectiveness. In addition, the economic crisis has exacerbated the already existing disparities in access to healthcare. It is therefore necessary, first of all, to note that the threat to patient safety is due to austerity measures, which are subject to cuts in healthcare costs. These horizontal cuts directly affect the quality of treatment, which is certainly unacceptable. Thus, the essence of treatment must be the well-being of the patient, so the funds allocated to healthcare systems cannot be allowed to be unjustifiably cared for in order to save.

Madam President, Madam High Representative, never since the launch of the European Common Security and Defence Policy 16 years ago has Europe faced so many simultaneous crises on its borders and on its soil, as well as multifaceted threats to its external and internal security: regional conflicts, civil wars, terrorism, migration dramas. nuclear and conventional proliferation.  The immense geopolitical recomposition underway poses unprecedented challenges to our continent, particularly in its eastern and southern flanks, if not in their nature - wars and terrorism, we have known them for a long time - but, in any case, in their magnitude.  In the face of these dramatic developments, the European Union and its member states have a dual duty to act: to act to protect themselves and to act in our environment to reduce instability. Unfortunately, we must recognize that the impression that prevails among our fellow citizens but also outside our borders is that of a European powerlessness: in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, the Middle East, Libya, the Horn of Africa, the Sahel. There are very few crises and conflicts today in which Europe, collectively or through its Member States, plays a truly decisive role in the measure of its interests, its values and its diplomatic, economic and military weight. Even where the action of some Europeans seems the most assertive and robust, such as that of France in the Sahel, the scale of the diplomatic, military and economic task, our budgetary constraints and our capacity limits leave no illusions about the very relative impact of what is being undertaken by a few. In this context, the common security and defence policy could and should be a major instrument for Europe to finally assume its responsibilities for its own security and that of its environment. I am a realist, so I am not saying that this common policy is the only possible one because national policies as well as multilateral partnerships such as the Atlantic Alliance are permanently essential structures for the defence of the continent and our nations. That is recognized in the treaties. Similarly, the common security and defence policy is not and will not be a genuine defence policy in the near future. It is an instrument, a crisis management policy, and we must first consider it as such.  The problem is that the crises are there. They are always more intense, ever closer, and our \"management\" is less and less up to these challenges.  The guidelines that you are proposing, Madam High Representative, with the defence ministers you met yesterday in Brussels for the European Council in June are a step in the right direction, and I congratulate you on the determined action you have taken since you took office. These guidelines are based on the same observation that I have just made, of dissatisfaction, inadequacy and urgency. You pointed out that the European Union is currently deploying 11 civilian missions and five military operations. The professionalism and dedication of our civilian and military personnel is remarkable, and we must salute them. But the respect we owe to these personnel, who are deployed in difficult theatres on behalf of the European Union, also obliges us to recognise that these missions and operations all too often become forms of alibi for our presence. I will say that our visibility sometimes takes a step on our effectiveness in our judgment on these missions. Therefore, I hope that you will carry out this evaluation work. In conclusion, because time is running out and there would be a lot to say also industrially and with capacity, of course, I would just like to point out that today we do not need creativity, inventiveness or imagination. We need to know how to read. Everything we need in terms of security and defence is in the Treaty: enhanced cooperation, permanent structured cooperation, flexibility with Article 44, financing and solidarity mechanisms, all of this is in the Treaty.  We are counting on you, High Representative, to remind the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1650, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Eduard Kukan", "mepid": "96651", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Today's debate on the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) is taking place at a time of unprecedented challenges and risks to our defence and security. Today, more than ever, we can feel the consequences of conflicts and instability in the immediate vicinity of our borders. We are debating at a time that is not the most favourable to the Union. In addition, we know that defence and security spending has been limited for a long time within the EU. We must therefore look at how we can deal with these funds more efficiently, more flexibly, but also more transparently. We need to start seriously addressing the vision of European defence by improving the coordination of our military and civilian missions, raising the issue of more flexible financial procedures and improving the setting up of structures responsible for broadcasting and operating our missions. In this sense, I am also directing a call on you, the High Representative, and the representatives of the Member States to give full use of the relevant part of the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular Article 44 on the entrustment of the implementation of the mission to the Group of Member States and Article 46 on permanent structured cooperation. As regards saving and improving efficiency, I would like to welcome the fact that some financial procedures relating to civilian missions have been shortened. It has also been possible to identify measures that will lead to an investigation. However, many situations require the rapid deployment and operationality of missions where financial flexibility and efficiency are needed. There are still problems. The Shared Service Centre , together with an integrated resource management system, could contribute to the improvement. As far as possible, we should also expand the operation of the permanent CSDP warehouse – CSDP warehouse – and allow existing mission to be fully utilization. Another challenge is greater coherence and complementarity in the functioning of civilian and military missions and operations. We need to improve coordination in the areas of logistics, transport, health security and mission protection. At the same time, we should pay greater attention to the coordination and interconnection of areas such as industry, the common market, research and development. As regards the financing of military operations through the Athena mechanism, it is essential that the philosophy of its operation is gradually changed. We need to move towards a better distribution of the financial burden among the Member States and certainly ensure long-term financing of military operations. The rapid deployment of missions and their effective functioning are proving increasingly problematic. In order to improve their funding, we need to start looking at the issue of opening Athena for contributions from third countries and international organisations. The next European Council, which will address security issues, should also be used to reform and improve the setting up of financial mechanisms for missions and operations. Finally, High Representative, the CSDP is an increasingly pressing issue. You need to be fully in control of it and ensure better coordination between Member States, European institutions and organisations such as NATO. You are surely well aware that, at the moment, we simply cannot afford to neglect the key issues of European defence and security.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1651, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Indrek Tarand", "mepid": "97136", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, let me first of all inform you and Vice-President Mogherini what a great pleasure it was to work with a connoisseur like Mr Kukan. Everything we wanted to say is written in the report. Please allow me to paint a small illustration about the things we are really talking about, knowing very well that security threats to Europe are triangular. They come from the south, the east and the south-east.  I will concentrate on the Baltic Sea. In recent months, Russian military ships have been harassing and sabotaging the crews that are laying the NordBalt power cable between Sweden and Lithuania. This cable would enable the Baltic states to reduce their dependence on Russian energy, which clearly is not in Russiaʼs interests, not only for financial reasons but because Russia likes to wield energy as a political weapon. This is a prime example of how the absence of an effective CSDP has negative spillover effects into other important European policy areas such as the energy union. Russia is effectively sabotaging European energy security and the energy union by disrupting the creation of new energy interconnections. We are also in a situation in which France has two Mistral-class warships that have been built but are now collecting dust as their delivery to Russia would constitute a significant security threat to the EU. Due to underfunding and lack of political will up to now, the European Union has not yet been able to purchase these ships. This must now change.  These ships would make an effective contribution to the CSDP naval branch and could be used in a variety of ways. For instance, they could be of critical help in solving the crisis in the Mediterranean, particularly close to the coast of Libya, or they could patrol in the Baltic Sea and offer support to the crews laying the NordBalt cable. This does not mean that the ships would need to engage with the Russian vessels currently harassing the crews. Their mere presence would be enough.  Right now it is the mere absence of any European forces that allows Russian warships and fighter planes to perform these demonstrations of force whenever they please. So actually what we have discovered is that the European Union’s budget is an incredibly useful tool. If we create a budget line, the political goals will eventually be achieved, and that is why we suggest bringing a lot more order to the current financing of the common security and defence policy.  Let us be brave and forget about the dogmas. The European Union’s common defence will be based on physical facts, one of them – most importantly – being the European common defence force. That is why I am one of the supporters of Mr Juncker’s new proposals. So let us create the budget line and start with the things which need to be done. Otherwise our children will have little reason to be grateful to us.

Only then to dismantle the slave networks that instrumentalize the tragedies that drive refugees and immigrants to Europe.  It is deplorable in this context that some governments refuse to accept quotas for the reception of people in need of protection. This is a slow-moving mission, the tragedy of the Mediterranean did not begin yesterday and it is a problem for everyone in Europe and not just a few states on the front line. It is with a strategic sense and coherence between all internal security and external action policies, including development, trade and energy supply policies, that the European Union must act on all fronts to help peoples resolve conflicts, get rid of oppressive regimes and to tackle other causes of migration flows, such as poverty. Opening up legal avenues for migrants is indispensable to take profit from traffickers and give opportunities to those who are desperate for them, and Europe, in demographic decline, must assume that it needs immigrants. It is necessary not to take longer and to put eunavfor Mediterranean at sea. Development security work and support for governance in the neighbourhood, in the south, in particular Libya, Syria and Iraq, must also be done. It is shocking that there is no coordination between Europeans, with military supplies to forces in Iraq and Syria to form fighters against the Islamic State. On the other hand, it is urgent to prepare a compromise that will have to be long-term. I speak of Libya where we have special responsibilities for action and omission and where we have strategic interests and even have today the vital interest of not letting it become a terrorist sanctuary on our doorstep. European commitment to capacity building, including in the organisation of the security sector, needs to be programmed on the assumption that the UN Special Representative Bernardino Léon is able to forge an agreement for a government of national unity. But if it does not succeed and the state failure in Libya continues and worsens, let us agree that we will need to intervene for our own security and defence, and we must work now to seek support from the United Nations Security Council. For this mission in the Mediterranean, we have made progress without a security council warrant and, despite the efforts of the High Representative recently in New York, it is in fact a matter, as I said, to protect, save lives and combat the slavers. But this failure highlights the pressing need for reform of the United Nations Security Council. This has to be put on the European agenda: it is time to demand the reform of the Security Council and to re-refer to a mandate, a permanent membership for Europe. For EUNAVFOR Mediterranean to be operational as soon as possible, as the Council wants, Member States need to make human resources and equipment available, because the Union does not have its own civilian or military resources.  Now, in the report that I am the author and which we will look at today, we demand precisely a drastic change in the culture of our governments. It is essential that Member States, under the guidance of the High Representative, cooperate more in the field of the acquisition of military equipment and equipment. It is essential that they articulate their policies and weapons options. It is essential that they invest in pooling and sharing, and that a plan of needs and objectives in the field of joint military equipment is drawn up, which actually responds to the needs and allows us, as the Union, to fulfil our obligations. Let us recognize that good intentions do not serve when we know in advance that it will take months before EUNAVFOR Mediterranean is operational. The price to pay is too expensive. We cannot allow the soberant illusion and protectionist opacity of some governments to curb the Action of the European Union in a matter so fundamental to the collective security and credibility of the Union. We therefore ask the Commission to invest in monitoring the implementation of the two internal market directives in the field of procurement and transfers of defence equipment and equipment, and to require member states to comply with the new rules.  In place of having a functional internal market in this area, it is crucial that the corrupt and opaque practices that undermine the sector, which prevent possibilities for cooperation, competition and technological development, and are, moreover, a bad return on taxpayers' money invested in national budgets of Defense. The good implementation of these directives is fundamental to the defence industrial and technological base, which, as the Council also identified yesterday, is the key part of the Union's strategy for collective security and defence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1653, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, let me start by thanking everyone, and in particular the four rapporteurs, for the excellent work done on the reports – this is my personal opinion – but also for the very clear, determined way in which you have worked and also presented the reports today, but even more than that, for the ambitious approach.  This is what we need at this moment. We all start by saying never before have we needed a more ambitious approach than we do now. Well, I think it is time to translate this analysis, which is right, into action and I find your words, your work, your reports, and the overall attitude of this Parliament in this respect extremely helpful in supporting an ambitious approach, including openly addressing some of the shortcomings that are the basis for changing and for delivering more of this sense of openness, of frankness, concerning the shortcomings and the needs we have to increase our level of ambition. It is also my approach, and that level of ambition that your reports are expressing is also my level of ambition in this field. As Members have said, Europe is facing multiple security challenges today and there is no doubt that we need to step up our common efforts in Europe. I would say, in one sentence, that we need more defence in our European work and we need a more European approach in defence. This is the substance of what we are discussing here this afternoon.  CSDP and defence cooperation are crucial, yet they only work fully, they only unfold their full potential, if they are part of a comprehensive strategy, of a comprehensive policy, using all the instruments that we have as Europeans, linking the external and internal dimension of our policies in an intelligent way. Not only that – this is not the issue for debate this afternoon – we also need to use the tools that we have, including CSDP, not only in reaction to events, but also in a strategic way to build security.  Building security is not only defence, it is also building the conditions for security worldwide and in particular in the regions around us: conflict prevention, development cooperation, promotion of human rights and democracy, coherence, economic and trade policies, including our own ones, even prevention and management of natural disasters and climate change. All of this is building security in the world, in the key areas in our neighbourhood and, at the end of the day, our own citizens’ security. This is going to be tackled in a systematic way when we discuss, in the European Council at the end of June with Heads of State and Government, not only CSDP but also our need for a new strategy, our strategic review. I will present in June the assessment I was asked and tasked to present on the global challenges we have in front of us, on the EU role in facing this. I hope that from there we will define and decide whether – or rather how – we need to develop a new European strategy to tackle the different and more challenging environment facing us.  I think that the need to put together all the instruments we have is more obvious than ever in the challenges that we are facing in tackling the human tragedies that we see in the Mediterranean Sea. Some of you mentioned that. Finally we have started to mobilise all our efforts to prevent further loss of life at sea. I say finally, and I say finally in the European way.  As one of these efforts, the European Council at the end of April asked me to prepare a CSDP operation to disrupt the business model of human trafficking networks across the Mediterranean. Yesterday, at the Joint Council meeting of Foreign and Defence Ministers which I chaired, all Member States agreed to establish a CSDP operation to disrupt trafficking and smuggling networks. We took the decision yesterday to activate an operational headquarters and appoint an operational commander.  There is still obviously some work to be done before the launch of this mission, namely on operational planning and on force generation. But let me say that the decision on establishing the operation being taken less than one month after the European Council was asking, or tasking, for preparation on that is an absolute record. I was told that it normally takes six to ten months to take the decision to establish an operation. I know that time is not in itself an element of evaluation, but in this case time is an element of urgency that we need to face, especially when summer is coming.  So I have to say that I think that this is the best way of addressing the issue of better and more effective CSDP in Europe, specifically using the instruments we have on the basis of the situations we are facing on a day-to-day basis. Let me remind you in this Hemicycle that it is exactly one month today since we faced that tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea when 700 to 800 hundred people died.  It is still not enough, we still have a lot more work to do in different areas, but I think that for the first time we can say that we have a quick and European response to this crisis.  Still, the preparation of a CSDP mission in the Mediterranean and the reinforcement of the existing CSDP mission, especially the one in Niger that was decided last week, are only two elements, important ones but only two elements of our strategy to tackle this challenge.  Last week the Commission presented the European Agenda on Migration – which this House will be debating tomorrow – outlining the immediate measures to respond to the crisis in the Mediterranean, both on the humanitarian and on the security side, and the steps to be taken, both immediate ones and the long-term ones. Let me stress here that no Member State can be left alone – should not be left alone – to face the huge migratory pressure, as this is a European responsibility. I think that finally we are beginning to realise that. The way forward is, and will still be, hard and long, but we are probably now starting to realise that.  We are finally proposing a European response which has never been the case before: combining internal and external policies, working together as Europeans on the immediate humanitarian emergency, on the security situation, as well as the root causes in countries of origin and transit. Tackling the root causes means tackling poverty, unequal access to resources, be they natural or financial, tackling conflicts, crises and the violation of human rights; conflicts and crises, starting obviously with Libya, and the support we are giving to the dialogue led by Bernardino León. This is specifically what ‘comprehensive approach’ means. To me the point is to make this comprehensive approach – which I understand is also sometimes criticised in the Danjean report – real, to make it happen, to make it work, using all the instruments that we have – and they are many – and achieving more coherence among the different instruments and the way we are using them. We need that more than ever. Since December 2013, when the European leaders took some decisions on security and defence, you have all said that the security situation in and around the European Union has changed dramatically. It has clearly not changed in a positive way. The concurrency, intensity, frequency and complexity of conflicts and crises in our neighbourhood is unique and the speed with which this has happened is even more unique. That is also why we need to seriously rethink our way of building security while we manage the urgency of current crises. That is also why we need a strategy to move ahead.  The demand for the European Union to act as a provider of security is increasing and will, most probably, continue to increase. We will only be able to respond to this demand in a credible way if we make the CSDP more effective and if we make sure we have the right kinds of capabilities, which in turn needs a solid, defence industrial base. The European Council in June will be an occasion to take stock of progress in this regard and to show the way ahead.  I have just presented my report to the Foreign Affairs Council, ahead of the June Council, and simultaneously the Commission delivered its report on the implementation of its 2013 Defence Communication. Both documents register progress in most areas where the European Council in 2013 set tasks, and point to areas where we need, and we can have, further progress. I would say we need, we can and we must have further progress. We worked on this just yesterday, as you mentioned, with the defence and foreign ministers together, putting together – this is also a comprehensive approach – different sides of our CSDP work. Among the achievements I can mention, we have the adoption of the EU’s first comprehensive maritime strategy and action plan, or the cyber policy framework. I would like to mention specifically one element: the security development nexus.  On this, I think we learned an important lesson from the CSDP training missions in Somalia, in Mali and in Niger, which is that the troops we train must often be supplied with equipment – tents, uniforms, radios, basic infrastructure. At the end of April the Commission adopted a joint communication based on my proposal to enable the European Union to train and equip the forces of local partners. It was addressed to the Council and to Parliament and I count on your support to take this forward, as it would be an extremely relevant and precious step. Being completely frank, as you are, there are also areas where the picture is much less encouraging. I am thinking of rapid response where the lack of political will has so far made it impossible to move. I know this is frustrating for many Members of this Parliament. It is frustrating for me, as well. Force generation, too, is problematic. I raised this with Ministers yesterday in a very clear and open way. If we take decisions then we need to translate them into action. This is a matter of being operational, this is also a matter of credibility, and this means taking responsibilities in the Member States with concrete decisions to follow up on force generation.  I also know that some of you are very eager to see the full potential of CSDP-related articles of the Lisbon Treaty fully used. The relevant sections of Mr Danjeanʼs report are very precious in this regard and let me say that I am completely determined to work with your support, with your help, to build the political conditions for having this done. Progress has also remained limited on CSDP financing more broadly. Indeed, the tension between our level of ambition and the level of resources has grown even bigger. The Kukan and Tarand report rightly raises a number of issues for both civilian and military CSDP financing. On cost saving and efficiency measures in civilian missions: we will continue working with the Commission to facilitate a faster deployment of civilian missions and improvements in the financial management. In that context, I would like to stress the importance of sufficient payment appropriations for the CFSP budget. On financing of military operations, the review of the Athena mechanism took place recently. A new Council decision was adopted at the end of March. While largely inconclusive, these debates will continue. I am ready, and most of all I am willing, to support and to lead the debate among Member States and, I hope, to lead it to some results. This is going to be key. The question of burden-sharing among Member States, which is what this question is, is crucial and needed if we are to face a future – and hopefully also a present – CSDP that really works. As the demand for CSDP will remain high, we also need to fill our defence capability gaps. At a time of reduced public spending, the pooling and sharing of capacities and resources, especially of high-end capabilities, is more than ever a recipe that can reconcile possibilities and needs in this regard.  We have made some important steps toward implementing collaborative projects. We agreed back in 2013 on air-to-air refuelling capacity, remotely piloted craft systems, satellite communications and cyber. Their development, notably on the first of these projects, is now in an advanced stage but I made it very clear to the Ministers yesterday that we also need to embark on new collaborative projects. We have to bring forward the ones that we already have, and we need to put new ones on the table. This Parliament has calculated – as you said, we do not need to be imaginative, we need to read the things that we already know and make them real – that the cost of non-Europe in defence amounts to some EUR 26 billion per year, an enormous amount of money, especially in these times, and more than that, as we are all politicians in this room, 70% of European citizens support more integration in defence. This is the clearest call for action that we could receive and I count on your support. Count, please, on my full determination to make this real, to have more European integration in defence.  We also need to spend better, and better together. This is a crucial point, especially in these times of austerity, and we need to focus on the output. We need to invest too in our partnerships. The one with NATO – that is essential. Hybrid, non-linear risks: I have put a premium on enhanced cooperation and contingency planning. If the old debate on a NATO-EU rivalry ever had any sense it does not anymore; it does not make any sense in these times.  I was happy to welcome the NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, yesterday at our ministerial meeting, just as I was happy to be at the Foreign Ministers NATO meeting last week in Antalya. Our cooperation is increasing, not only our cooperation at the highest political level, but staff-to-staff cooperation is also going on very well. We are different in nature, but we have some common points on the agenda that we can coordinate and cooperate on. The other extremely relevant cooperation we have to invest in is the one with the United Nations. All Member States have just agreed on a new action plan to announce EU support for UN peacekeeping, and the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will be at the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 June. We need to work on different aspects on different levels, as your reports clearly identify.  The Gomes report on the impact of developments in European defence markets on the security and defence capabilities in Europe indicates that the competitiveness of the European defence industry is a priority, and I fully support this. A strong competitive European defence industrial base needs more cooperation between Member States, a more efficient internal market, more robust security of supply guarantees, competitive and integrated supply chains, and support for research and innovation.  A healthy industrial base is indeed key in support of any credible defence policy as, among others, it generates cutting-edge programmes, innovation with spillover effects into the civilian domain and vice versa, and a highly skilled workforce that accounts for 400 000 direct and 960 000 indirect jobs across Europe. At the same time, our industry faces a wide range of challenges both at the global and at the European level: increasingly globalised supply chains, increased defence of said demands, global shifts in defence spending.  Our ratio regarding R&amp;D investment is 1:7 as compared to the US but, and this is the news, 1:3 in comparison with the so-called BRICs. The plunge in defence R&amp;D since 2006, more than 29% in real terms, is detrimental to much needed innovation in Europe and puts at risk our capability in producing defence equipment and the competitiveness of our industry.  The European industrial landscape remains characterised by a fragmented demand side, a plethora of national programmes and variance of equipment, generating high costs for industry. Increasingly integrated civilian military supply chains with a growing reliance on civilian technologies means that companies more and more rely on civil production in terms of turnover and revenues. If nothing is done, we could face the risk in the longer term of having a lower level of technological sophistication due to slower rates of innovation. We could also face decreasing competitiveness with the ultimate loss of production capacities and jobs and thus increasing dependence on foreign supplies – and we are talking about the European Union.  The Gomes report also highlights the need for a full and correct implementation of the two Defence Directives of 2009 with a view to opening up the defence market chains for companies from all over Europe. An open and transparent European defence equipment market is a precondition for our defence companies to access European supply chains in view of building strategic and sustainable alliances with European partners. I fully share the objective to ensure the effective implementation of the Defence Procurement and the Defence Transfers Directives. The Commission has started evaluating the Defence Directives and in 2016 will report to Parliament and Council on their implementation and on whether they have achieved their objectives.  In December 2013, Heads of State and Government called for more investment in cooperative research programmes, more synergies between defence and civil research, as well as for a preparatory action on CSDP-related research to be set up. Here we have three avenues. First, collaborative defence R&amp;T. The European Defence Agency (EDA) has a longstanding track record in defence R&amp;T projects and programmes. Second, dual-use research, and third, the establishment of the preparatory action on CSDP-related research, a potential game-changer testing the viability of defence-oriented and CSDP-related research at European Union level.  The Commission has the lead here, but the EDA, having long experience in defence R&amp;T, can provide support. Joint Commission-EDA workshops with stakeholders to discuss the modalities, content and the process to establish such a preparatory action, are paving the way.  Another potential game-changer could be the Council mandate on developing a European Union-wide security and supply regime. Security of supply is essential for the sustainment of operations, the development of long-term planning and cooperation, and the functioning of the internal market for defence. We expect the roadmap for the comprehensive EU-wide security of supply regime in early 2016.  To conclude, let me thank you for the work you have done, for the work of this Parliament in general on CSDP, and also on the preparation for the June Council. I know you have been working very hard and intensively on this and this is extremely helpful.  Let me conclude by mentioning those 7 000 men and women who are currently deployed under the EU flag in military and civilian missions under dangerous and difficult conditions, from Afghanistan to Somalia, from Mali to the Central African Republic. I want to end my comments today by saluting the work of men and women deployed in the field under the EU flag and thank them for what they are doing. This is what we should remember all the time: that our discussions, our decisions, are then translated in their work on a daily basis, in very difficult conditions, for the security of our citizens, the stability of the regions where they are deployed and peace in our world.

The problem is that the CSDP, as mentioned by Mr Danjean, is only a crisis management instrument conceived for use primarily outside Europe and in obvious need of more flexible implementation procedures. It does not provide for the defence of either the EU Member States, who rely for that on NATO, or the EU non—NATO Member States who, in absence of NATO membership, have to rely exclusively on the EU for their defence.  The truth is that in view of the intensity, complexity and localisation of the current crisis, the UN and NATO have a mutual need of each other more than at any time before.

It is difficult to address all the issues raised, allow me, therefore, to focus on paragraph 42 of the Arnaud Danjean report, which raises the need for increased spending, increased defence burdens by the Member States of the European Union in achieving nato targets, namely to reach 2% of GDP (for several countries it is already more than 2% of GDP), but also to spend 20% of their expenditure on important defence, on major armaments and also on research and development.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her All three reports outline a steady deterioration in security worldwide, especially in Europe's neighbours to the south and east. There seems to be only one consequence here: more armament, more money for the arms industry and arms research, more so-called robust EU operations and, best of all, everything paid for from the EU budget. But what is cause, what is effect? If one does not debate the causes and one's own share of them – of course, then the spectrum of consequences is logically small, a change of policy is not an issue. For example.B the impact of the EU's external economic policy, which has led to disastrous trade balances, including in the Countries of the Southern Neighbourhood Policy. The pursuit of one's own geostrategic interests, the creation of sales markets, access to resources: when one's own interest is at the top, when countries are even regarded as the power-political backyards, conflicts arise. In order to counter this, military resources are needed. The rapporteurs find a further conclusion from the threats in a concoathing of internal and external security, which thus also makes military operations in The European country possible. This is a huge problem for democracy. We are talking about more armaments cooperation, more spending on defence and the use of civilian funds for military purposes, e.B. for the development of drones, on the grounds that it would increase security and save money. Wrong! Constant structured cooperation, pooling and sharing and battlegroups, all of this does not serve to relieve the burden on state budgets. These measures, and this has been demonstrated, do not save money. And the veto rights of parliaments in decisions on wars and arms spending are being undermined.

Militarising migration policy is completely the wrong way to go. The only thing we can achieve with such an effort is that people die elsewhere and that the smugglers find new ways. As long as their market exists, they will continue to shoe themselves to people's misfortune. The only way we have to take out their market is to combat the root causes of people fleeing. It is better to get a decision in the Security Council to end the conflict in Syria than to try to get a decision to enter Libyan waters to sink boats. It is not worthy, as a Nobel Peace Prize winner, to look more at one's own internal interests than to work towards more peaceful development in the world around us. It is not the people who are fleeing to us who are a security problem, but the wars in our neighbouring countries that are. Then, with regard to the reports we are talking about today, we Greens believe that they have too much focus on the military rather than the civilian one. They talk more about territorial security rather than human security. Not least, we have a major problem with the proposal that all Member States should spend 2% of their GDP on defence.

I have always argued that the CSDP must not be pursued to the detriment of NATO by causing duplication of effort or the decoupling of European defence from that of the United States or Canada – rather it should be developed as a complementary alternative in scenarios for which NATO is ill-suited.  For instance, the successful anti-piracy EUNAVFOR Atalanta naval mission was able to coordinate with the Indian navy which, as a non-aligned movement country, was unable to contribute meaningfully to NATOʼs Operation Ocean Shield, also in the Indian Ocean. This is one example where CSDP can offer real added value without, of course, undermining NATO.

We know very well, however, that Parliament cannot do it alone. The Council must also address this emergency with the greatest possible determination. In December 2013, the Council recognised the need to strengthen defence capacity and strengthen industry. Unfortunately, however, not much has been done in practice, the European Union's missions seem to be a formal fact, sometimes an ideal fact. That has to change.  We need more funding: without money it is difficult to be effective. We must coordinate with the other international institutions – the UN, NATO, the African Union, the OSCE – if we are to have a chance of success.

Today we know that looking for security savings in defence is a mistake.  I am not convinced by such very simple demands to increase defence spending to two per cent of GDP. That's not enough. It is important what this funding will be spent on and what the cooperation between the European defence industry and defence will look like, but it is also important how this expenditure will be built in individual European countries. Thank you very much, Mr Arnaud Danjean, because his report, in my opinion, is extremely specific, extremely accurate, very cost-effective in terms of words, but very precise in terms of diagnosis.

Firstly, on defence spending, I think those who raised this matter are quite right. There is not only the target, for those Member States which belong to NATO, of 2% of GDP, there is also the fact that 12 Member States have already increased – or are currently planning to increase – defence spending. However, there is a need to focus not only on how much has been spent. I think many of you were right to raise this. The other real point is how we spend, if we manage to spend together in a coordinated way, and how we manage to spend the money we invest in defence better. This means looking at the output of our investments in defence. This is obviously very much a national debate, but there are components of this debate which are European – especially when we look at incentives on defence spending. There is work on the way, especially in view of the June Council.  Many of you raised the issue of EU-NATO cooperation, and some of you raised the need to strengthen the relations or the coordination. Let me say that this is already being done in a very fruitful way. I see no risk, at this historical time, that increasing our own defence and security policy can in any way be to the detriment of NATO. On the contrary, we have a complementarity on which we can work even more, especially when we tackle the hybrid threats. Strategic communication was mentioned. There are a variety of tools in respect of which putting together different elements of our work can be extremely helpful for us both, keeping in mind the fact that we are completely different in nature – as I said several times – and that we obviously have different decision-making and agendas on many issues. But still, strong cooperation is not only a need for the future – it is also already a reality. I do not see the danger of duplication that someone mentioned. I see rather the need to fill the gaps we have in common. This is a problem the European Union has, but also one that NATO has. One timely question was raised by Mr Plenković about the possible CSDP operation in Ukraine. Let me say that we discussed this at length inside the European Union with the Member States and obviously with the Ukrainian authorities. We already have a civilian mission in Ukraine, which is assisting with the reform of the security sector. We are ready to increase that kind of support which is, as I said, civilian work and a non-executive mission on security sector reform. We will also continue to channel our support for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreement through the OSCE. We commonly believe that this is the path we have to follow in full support of the efforts that, especially in the Normandy format, are continuing to be made. Let me close with some general remarks. Many of you in this room – and I mention them in good faith and with no purely domestic audience purposes – referred to the need to move on, to go beyond mere declarations and take concrete steps. Some, quite rightly, made reference to the fact that not all the instruments in the Lisbon Treaty are being used, and that the security situation calls for this. I think I was the first, on 6 October 2014, in my hearing in front of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to mention this. To me, one of the challenges of my mandate in these five years is to make full use of the instruments of the Lisbon Treaty. It requires hard work to create the political conditions for doing this. Let me also say that when we in this room – or outside of this room – translate this, it rightly highlights that there are still gaps and still limits in our action. I am the first to recognise this. When we move this to the point of saying that Europe does not have a policy, that Europe is divided, that Europe is not acting, that Europe is not Europe – as someone said in this room – I understand that this is a narrative we are used to. But sometimes this does not reflect reality. I said in my opening remarks that today we are talking about CSDP, as yesterday the 28 – united in less than a month – took the decision to establish an operation. The two things, the narrative and the reality of these days, do not match. This does not mean that we have solved all the limits that we still have in our CSDP – not at all – but to me the most concrete way of having a real CSDP, a real common security and defence policy, is by specifically using the instruments, by specifically building the political conditions for making decisions in the Council, and by having the operations and the missions we need, when we need them and in the way we need them. This is work that we have to do together, because Europe is not an abstract entity existing somewhere. Europe is what we make of it, all of us – the Member States, the European Parliament. Each of you has a political family, a political party, a Member State of nationality, and we have a common responsibility to build the political conditions for making full use of all the instruments we have, and to recognise – when we are taking steps that are going in that positive direction – to say that this is a step, take responsibility and move forward with the difficult work of realising what the European dream, but also need, is about.  This means a lot of consistency. I will not go back over many of the details that I discussed in my opening remarks, especially about the last decisions we have taken, except for one point. Pablo Iglesias mentioned the need for all our missions and operations to fulfil the requirements of international law. For me, that is the basic starting point and is natural. For me, the reference to international law obviously means full respect for, and working fully in, the framework of the United Nations. That is why we are developing such strong cooperation with the UN and with the UN system, and, particularly in this case, when we talk about the situation in the Mediterranean, the work with the UNHCR. This is the basis for our work, because these were the principles and the values on which Europe was based. These are the principles and values that have to be at the basis of the European Union missions and operations around the world.

I believe that the debate has shown this, on the whole, well today, through the positive reception that has been given to it.

I would simply like to urge a strategic direction – in the College of the Commission as well – in implementing these Directives, in order to avoid totally contradictory decisions, such as Commissioner Vestager’s recent one. On the implementation of these directives, which enable a country like mine, Portugal, to go on with the dismantling of crucial Portuguese shipyards that have been producing for our navy, and then rubber-stamping that in a very distorted interpretation of the Directive.

We in this Parliament definitely support your endeavours to push the Member States to deliver on the common financing of CSDP missions, namely military missions, because this is not just about facilitating fairer burden-sharing, it is about the only way to encourage the generational forces. Equally important is overcoming the bureaucratic and political barriers which prevent cooperation between Member States and the Union, and even among EU specialised agencies, to ensure a more synergetic use, by civilian and military CSDP operations, of the existing capacities.

The European Union is not only an economic and political union, providing its citizens with an opportunity of freedom of movement and a single market. It is also the Union of shared fundamental values. These fundamental values are set out in the Treaties and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. These rights, freedoms and principles are also enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights to which all EU Member States are party. In this respect, all the institutions have their role, as defined in the Treaties. Parliament has an important and valued role, not least to call the attention of the Commission and the Council to specific situations. Being the forum of European pluralistic democracy, Parliament has always been particularly attached to the preservation of democratic values. The Council has always valued your opinions. As you know, the Council has not discussed the situation in Hungary. Nor has it agreed any position on the issue. However, I would like to recall that the Presidency, and the Council as a whole, attaches great importance to ensuring that EU fundamental values are fully respected throughout the Union in all policies. Promoting tolerance and diversity is the most effective response to the evolving human rights challenges or threats to fundamental freedoms. At the same time, let me express our gratitude to Parliament for giving the Hungarian authorities, as the party directly concerned, an opportunity to take part in the debate. The Presidency is also grateful to the Hungarian authorities for being with us today. I am not in a position to say more at this stage. The Council will follow this debate closely and pay due attention to the views that will be expressed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1728, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank, through you, the European Parliament for putting this topic on the agenda, as two recent developments in Hungary have given rise to important concerns. Let me start with the debate launched by Prime Minister Orbán on the reintroduction of the death penalty.  President Juncker and I have already made clear statements on this, and these represent the official position of the Commission. Article 2 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits, explicitly and clearly, any person from being condemned to death or executed. In addition, the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the death penalty is a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. The abolition of the death penalty is a condition which States are required to meet in order to become members of the Council of Europe or of the European Union. This is part of our common values.  As far as the Commission is concerned, there is no doubt that the reintroduction of capital punishment would be contrary to the EU’s fundamental values. A reintroduction of the death penalty by a Member State would, therefore, lead to the application of Article 7 of the Treaty of the European Union.  The mechanisms of Article 7 relate to the values referred to in Article 2, including human dignity and respect for human rights. As you know, the Treaties do not foresee suspending or withdrawing the membership of a Member State of the European Union. However, Article 7 provides for a far-reaching sanction mechanism specifically designed to ensure respect for the fundamental values of Article 2.  More specifically on the situation in Hungary, let me make the following comments. President Juncker stated on 30 April that Prime Minister Orbán should immediately clarify that it is not his intention to reintroduce the death penalty. If that were his intention, and I quote, ‘it would be a fight’. The Commission has in the meantime understood that the Hungarian Government does not have concrete plans to take any steps to introduce the death penalty, and that Prime Minister Orbán has assured you, President Schulz, that the Hungarian Government will respect and honour all European Treaties and legislation. I refer to the press release you gave President Schulz on 30 April. However, if the Hungarian Government were to take steps to reintroduce the death penalty, let me underline that the Commission is ready to use immediately all the means at its disposal to ensure that Hungary, as well as any other Member State, complies with its obligations under Union law and respects the values of the Union enshrined in Article 2. We will not hesitate for one second in such a case.  On the public consultation on immigration announced by the Hungarian Government – the second subject – let me make the following comments. In general, the Commission considers that public consultation can be an important tool of governments and other public authorities to develop policies that can count on support of the population. However, and I repeat what I already stated earlier, a public consultation based on bias, on leading and even misleading questions, on prejudice about immigrants, can hardly be considered a fair and objective basis for designing sound policies. Framing immigration in the context of terrorism, depicting migrants as a threat to jobs and the livelihood of people, is malicious and simply wrong. It will only feed misconceptions and prejudice.  We cannot, and should not, close our eyes to the sometimes serious challenges posed by migration in our societies. But in doing so, we should never lose sight of our fundamental values and of the need to preserve a pluralistic and diverse society based on mutual respect and equal treatment of every single individual.  The European Union and its Member States are developing common answers to the current challenges, as Europe is based on mutual respect, solidarity and sincere cooperation. We need political leaders who are willing to explain EU policy to the citizens in an open, fair and balanced manner, and who will stand firm for joint and common European values. This is the only way we can make progress together in Europe. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation closely, and I thank the European Parliament explicitly for its continued support in these important matters. (Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1729, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has said. First of all, I would like to say thank you that Viktor Orban is here. When we discuss Hungary, the Prime Minister comes – that shows his willingness to exchange ideas, to be present, and also to respect the European Parliament. Thank you for that. And I would like to begin by saying once again that six months ago, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we asked that we talk about the scandalous electoral events in Romania, where Ponta ensured that hundreds of thousands of people were unable to vote in the presidential election. The left-wing side of this House has said that we do not need to talk about the issue, that it is not important for Europe. I would like to say that, for the fifth time, in the presence of Viktor Orban, we are now discussing Hungary issues. And this clearly shows for me that the PPE-DE is ready to discuss, but the left is blind to its failures on the issues that we unfortunately have in Europe. (Applause) When we talk about Hungary today, I think of something quite different from the issues that we are obviously discussing, namely.B that Hungary, with an economic growth rate of 2.8%, is a growth engine in Europe, that Hungary, with 6.8% unemployment, is much better off than many left-wing states in this European Union. And It strikes me that Viktor Orban has been confirmed in office by his constituents since 2010 with more than 50% each. Fidesz recently won 51% of the European elections. Obviously, it does not suit many here on the left to look at the political situation in this country, which is expressing strong support for Viktor Orban. This for the analysis of the situation in Hungary. And now to the problems, to the questions. We are discussing the issue of the death penalty today. For us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is part of the civilisational success of our continent, alongside democracy, the rule of law, the right to strike and many other points, that we have banned the death penalty and banned it from this continent. That is why a debate on the death penalty is harmful to us as the European Union. We reject it, we do not want it to be reintroduced. And I would like to thank Viktor Orban for clarifying that he is not taking any initiatives in this direction. We would seriously damage Europe if we were to have this debate. The second thing we are discussing is how we deal with citizen participation. First of all, it is positive to see that Hungary is questioning its citizens; it is now evidently being consulted for the third time. But I too would like to take up the point raised by Frans Timmermans. If it is said in the wording, Prime Minister, 'the one in Brussels and we in Budapest', then that is a mood that is not good, which is not supported by the PPE-DE either. In other words, there is a lot of explosives in the wording, which many in my group do not like either. However, I would like to say again to the left side of the House: we can argue about the wording, but we have to talk about the things that Viktor Orban is addressing and which he is going to address today. Z.B. the fact that the repatriation of rejected asylum seekers in this European Union is not working, that two thirds of all applicants in Europe have been rejected and that they must be repatriated from this European Union in order for law to be implemented: this is an issue that Viktor Orban rightly raises. And he is also right to say that it cannot be the case that, as in my own region in Bavaria, one of the highest numbers of refugees from acceding countries to the European Union in the Balkans is now coming, with which we are currently negotiating accession. It cannot be right that asylum seekers come to Europe from countries with which we are in accession talks. These questions, dear party friends, ladies and gentlemen, must also be addressed. And then we should listen to the substance, not the wording, but the substance, Viktor Orban.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1730, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the national consultation on immigration and terrorism (as if the two phenomena were linked), the invocation of the death penalty as a deterrent, provocations on the merits of supposed illiberal democracy are some of the points that Timmermans rightly mentioned. I will stop there because that is only part of what President Orbán said recently.  Our debate, of course, does not stem from prevention of President Orbán, from dislike, from the fact that President Orbán belongs to a political family other than the one to which I belong, from a biased calculation or from a claim to give lessons. The point is that President Orbán has exceeded the bounds of decency with these statements, and the seriousness of his statements cannot be underestimated.  I say to Mr Weber that we do not exorcise the problems by passing the responsibility on to others, who have a different political shack. I repeat: I do not discuss these things because Orbán belongs to the people's family, of which I have the greatest respect and also great cooperation. I discuss these matters because they are inslaiving the plenum of values and ideals on which the European Union is founded, and we will not compromise and monitor that. In Hungary, the real stakes, as it seems to us, are not the attack on democracy in the classic forms we know but the emptying of democracy through its trivialisation. An empty democracy in which everything is said and then refuted, in which words, even the most important ones, such as democracy and freedom, are abused and turned into empty and meaningless slogans, a sort of confusing state in which democracy becomes a low-level spectacle, a game in the mud that legitimizes the return of the most extreme forces – and this should worry all of us! Like the fascists, the Nazis.  What worries me most is not only the seriousness of the statements, but the gloomy climate that these statements create, and it is at this time the news of the death threats made to a homosexual activist in Budapest to whom I and our solidarity go.  But that also reveals something else. I believe that your provocations are also weapons of mass distraction, that is to say, you want to divert the attention of hungarian citizens from the real problems that Hungary is experiencing, which are very serious and very profound economic and social problems. I will conclude: I have a great deal of sympathy and affection for the Hungarian people; As an Italian, I remember the years when a Prime Minister undermined the credibility and prestige of our country, and I do not think you should do the same, Mr Orbán. Hungary is a great country and deserves more, it cannot turn into a stage where everything is allowed, in which even the values of our living together become games to risk a few votes.

It is clear that we can discuss immigration – we always do, we too, there are different thoughts.

Now, if a head of government, who is not just any ordinary citizen who stands in the middle of the street and speaks at the bar, says that he wants to abolish the death penalty in a country that belongs to the European Union, that must make us worry. We are not exploiting anything. If a head of government in a country of 28 members of the European Union refers to a so-called illiberal democracy, should we not worry?

But the death penalty issue is just a distraction from a much more serious issue and that is the immigration questionnaire. That, Commissioner, is official government policy, it is not just somebody’s opinion. So what will the Commission actually do? Has the Commission undertaken a legal analysis of its compatibility with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and has it checked how it sits with the agreed asylum and immigration policies of the European Union? The Commission has a duty to act. I much agree with your very critical blog, but I expect more of the European Commission.  Now, as for the EPP, having listened to Mr Weber, to me it is crystal clear. EPP: you may choose critical words but you are squarely behind Prime Minister Orbán and his policies. That is your right but at least the people know where the EPP stands now. There is no more doubt and, to be clear, ALDE rejects the policies of Mr Orbán and his government.

I know, Commissioner Timmermans, that you say that fundamental rights, the rule of law cannot be measured or quantified, but I think they can.

Mr President, once again we are debating the situation in Hungary. We hear the same cries of gold to the right of the Chamber. No doubt Mr Orbon will tell us again that others in the European Union are violating human rights, regardless of the political colour of their government. He'll be right. Governments across the European Union are playing with populism. This is not a right-left debate but Hungary is a kind of condensed, a bad collection of what not to do. Since our last debate last October, Amnesty International has pointed out that NGOs have been subjected to unprecedented repression; the Commissioner for Human Rights pointed out that hate speech and acts were increasing against Roma, Jews, LGBT, asylum seekers, the homeless, and that media freedom should be strengthened. There is this famous questionnaire, which links migration to terrorism, and there are statements on the death penalty. These are not just proposals for debate, as we were told in the LIBE committee. On 8 May, Mr Orbon declared that the reintroduction of the death penalty should once again become a national competence and that if the protection of citizens did not work without the death penalty, it should be restored. How far are we going to go without reacting other than by words? Section 7 is a decoy, it is unenforceable, it is not even a deterrent.

I must say that I could not believe this at first and, when I listened to the debate on the death penalty in Hungary, I wondered whether it would really be possible for a European head of government today – in 2015 – to be prepared to reintroduce the death penalty: that is a question I would like to ask you seriously. Because, as Sophia and others have said, that would be the declared end to membership of the European Union. The second topic concerned this questionnaire on refugee policy. The style of this questionnaire, the language of this questionnaire – this is not a serious contribution to solving this major problem of refugees, which the European Union must tackle together, but is simply a contribution to the incitement of a nation, not to the solution, but to incitement. In Germany, the term \"well poisoning\" used to be coined for this. With both debates, Mr Orban, you have set yourself apart from the fundamental values and rights of the European Union. That is why we are not just talking about Viktor Orban and Hungary, but we are talking about ourselves. What does this mean when Member States seek distance from basic values? Accession to the European Union simply means an obligation to these fundamental values and to the fundamental rights on which we have agreed. It is simply inconceivable that the European Union project can function without these fundamental rights being fully respected. In my opinion, a policy of interests in which we put the economy ahead and otherwise dominate nationalist currents would very quickly lead to the end of the European Union. I think it is important that the European Union does not pinch itself in this dispute – like the Latvian Presidency – but that the European Union, based on the disputes that Viviane Reding has had with a number of Member States, not just Hungary, on freedom of the press, agrees on the mechanisms we need to ensure that not only our robust interests in terms of budget and stability are asserted. , but how we can enforce in Europe that the values that we have established and which mark the end of barbarism in Europe can be guaranteed to our citizens in the long term. We have seen lately: demonstration rights in Spain – I was thinking of a police state when I read about it. I have read what security laws are being made in France. I was dismayed by this.

It is unacceptable to ignore this undemocratic drift in the heart of Europe and to wash our consciences, as do ostriches who put their heads in the sand.  Everyone must play their part, starting with the Commission, which must promote an absolutely essential monitoring of respect for fundamental rights, country by country. As rapporteur for the report on fundamental rights in the European Union, I have proposed the establishment of a mechanism to guarantee a higher level of protection in this regard. The Union must develop a proactive action plan defining the actions to be taken to ensure the full realisation of all rights and principles protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  We also need to create a database on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and in the individual Member States, and finally we need to extend the European Union's justice scoreboard to the assessment of criminal justice systems and respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law. All this is necessary to prevent the risks from being translated into concrete violations, as is probably happening or could soon happen in Hungary.

I am always honoured to have MEPs to hold a debate on the situation in Hungary. And for me, it is a commanding duty to speak Hungary of my country, the People and the Hungarian people. I would like to remind you that the Hungarians voted in favour of membership of the European Union in a referendum, and we have been proud of this decision ever since. Mr President, we should also think – it would be logical – that we are here today because Europe is curious about the successes of Hungarians, curious about what Hungary has achieved and how it has achieved over the last five years. There's something to talk about. In 2010, Hungary was 21st out of 28 Member States in terms of the growth rate of total national product and was 2nd last year. While public debt is rising elsewhere, we have reduced it from 85% to less than 77% in Hungary. And in 2010, unemployment was well above 11%, and now it is below 7%, and within three years I hope to achieve full employment. Ladies and gentlemen, however, you have called this debate day because I understand that you want to talk about political issues under the label 'Hungarian situation', especially the issue of immigration. As far as political issues are concerned, I would like to inform you that Hungary is considered to be the most frequently reviewed Member State by X-rays of the rule of law of the European Union. At the same time, I welcome the fact that you are on the agenda on important issues that really concern the people of Europe: legal order, public security, immigration. These issues are a matter of destiny for our common future. Answering these questions may depend on what Kind of Union we will leave to our children. But these problems are not Hungarian problems, but Europeans. And yet the only reason they come up today in connection with my country is that Hungarians generally like to talk straight about difficult things. That's who we are, we don't like talking or talking. We like to talk straight or not. So we talk directly about the death penalty, about immigration, and we also feel that the discourse that many people have been \"p.c.\" They say it's politically correct, it hasn't brought us Europeans any closer to a solution.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are also talking straight and openly about saying our opinion that we Hungarians want Europe to remain european, and we want to preserve Hungary as a Hungarian country. Both of our goals are legitimate goals, and I believe that both are fully in line with europe's core values and the intentions of the Union's founders. Ladies and gentlemen, I propose that we make a sharp difference between free movement within Europe and the free movement of labour from migration from outside Europe. And within the latter, let us also make the case for refugees different from the case of immigrants who come here only because they want to live in a higher standard of living and prosperity than their home country would offer. Pain, Commissioner Timmermans, the situation in Hungary is that we cannot give jobs to immigrants. We'd better talk about this honestly and straight.  Ladies and gentlemen, we want to tackle the issue of livelihood immigration in our own way in the first place. Hungary and the European Union have good reason to address the issue of subsistence immigration. Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that what we now know as a proposal from the European Commission is absurd, in our straight language, close to what we might call madness. I am convinced that it is a dangerous attitude to say that there is no problem here, open the gates wide and come whoever you want. The facts are clear, there is huge migratory pressure on Europe today. Compared to 2010, illegal immigration in Europe has tripled. In Hungary, the number of illegal border crossings has increased 20-20 times in a short period of time.  We openly believe that the current conventions should be revised, revised and the right of EU countries to defend their own borders should be returned to a nation-state competence. We believe this would be a sober, humane and realistic position. I say this with due respect, but I am convinced that the proposal to allow refugees into Europe and distribute them on the basis of some artificially defined quota is crazy. Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the quota will only encourage people smugglers, lure more people to Europe and encourage them to attempt to reach EU territory by dangerous sea crossings. I am therefore convinced that it would be more fortunate if the regulation of immigration was would be delegated to the commission. My position is that I am pleased that the debate has started on this, that instead of a quota, individual Member States should be allowed to decide on this issue themselves. We Hungarians want to decide for ourselves whether or not we want immigrants in Hungary.  We are a Christian, we are a national government, we have mercy in our hearts, and we have always accepted refugees, real refugees, and we will continue to do so in the future. Immigrants, however, are not refugees. They want a better life, and that's why they're coming. We understand that, but we can't accept it. Illegal border crossing is a criminal offence that needs to be combated. Hungary must also protect its legal order and its borders. We do not want Hungary be a destination for illegal immigrants. There are countries that have decided that they want to live with this problem. They decided they wanted immigration policy. We respect that decision. That is why we have launched a consultation on immigration. We see it as fair and fair to ask our citizens about it.  I would like to say to one of the contributors that there is no consultation on the death penalty in Hungary at this moment, there may be some fatal misunderstanding here.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that Hungary has not signed any agreements or agreements with anyone on what cannot be discussed in Hungary or what can be said. We have also not signed an agreement on what we can and cannot consult on. Our Association Treaty with the Union does not contain any sycathing provisions on the fact that certain things should not be discussed or raised in the Member States of the European Union. Therefore, we consider it a violation of the EU Treaty if anyone tries to have a say in what we Hungarians can or cannot comment on.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the number of asylum seekers as a proportion of the national total per capita, Hungary the 2nd most-touched Member State after Germany. If we look at the number of asylum seekers per 1 000 inhabitants, we are also in second place after Sweden. It is here that I draw your attention to the fact that insufficient attention is paid to the Western Balkans region in the European Commission's migration arm. In the first quarter of 2015, 24,000 of the 43,000 asylum applications made in Hungary came from Kosovans. Cooperation with countries along the Balkan migration route and the development of their migration, asylum and border management capacities are therefore essential. And the Crisis in Ukraine, I ask you not to ignore it, because this ordeal is still ahead of us.  Ladies and gentlemen, as far as the death penalty is concerned, I believe that Europe must not bury its head in the sand. In no case would I like us to return to the Middle Ages, and again there are issues that are forbidden to be talked about. In fact, this debate is not about the death penalty, but about the issue of thought, opinion and freedom of expression. I insist on talking about the death penalty. We have a constitutional basis, and the rules can only be changed in line with the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, the principles, conventions and rules of the European Union are not engraved on stone, not brought by gods and inspired by them. They were made by humans, which is why people can change them at any time. This is freedom and this is democracy. Ladies and gentlemen, everyone's opinion on these subjects is the opinion of one person and no more, whoever he is. Whether you are a philosopher, a European Commissioner, a prime minister or a party chairman. Your opinion is the opinion of a European citizen. It's not holies, it's not dogma, it's not superior truth. Therefore Hungary will continue to stand up for freedom, stand up for the idea of free expression and its European value.

We would be wrong if we considered what a European problem is a Hungarian problem, because political discourses against immigrants and political discourses against Europe are in France and Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy, all over Europe.  It is not a question of discussing Hungary's guilt; it is about discussing our own guilt for not being able to make the European project and European values respected throughout our territory.

I understand that the European Union wanted to try a new regulation in Hungary. It's been a few years, it hasn't been good. Please allow us to defend Hungary ourselves.

We want to avoid this; You, on the other hand, if you continue like this, take Hungary out of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1783, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Manfred Weber (PPE).", "mepid": "28229", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to thank the I would like to thank you for the discussion and also for the exchange, and I have to say once again that in many areas the left criticises what is to be criticised – which I too did as a representative of the PPE - but is once again excessive. When Mrs Harms makes comparisons with Nazi methods, if Mr Verhofstadt assumes dull nationalism here, then excessively excessive is being done. And Mrs Zimmer then shoots the bird by saying that we need to end the Orban debate. After all, who asked for the debate? It was her group that asked for this. It shows that everything that is on the table in terms of criticism sits now excessive. Today, we have heard little about the real issues that Viktor Orban raised in the migration debate, that Hungary is a model for the issue of taking in migrants in Europe. Many of the Member States that have spoken here, from the left, could cut off a slice of Hungary. We have not heard anything about it. However, prime minister, Mr Viktor Orban, I have one thing to say very clearly on the question of the principles of the European Union: everything can be talked about in Europe, but freedom of speech always goes hand in hand with responsibility. That always belongs together. And when we speak out in the debate, it must be clear that we are also responsible, including for what has been achieved in civilisation on this continent, namely that the state does not murder and does not kill. Everyone must discuss this principle very responsibly, and we, as European politicians, must defend it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1784, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr. President, I have a few comments to make on what was said, if I may. First of all, of course it is very important and interesting to hear of the economic success of Hungary, and I know Prime Minister Orbán is a formidable campaigner, who has won some of the most astonishing election victories and therefore has a huge democratic mandate. But neither economic success nor democratic mandate can weaken the position of the rule of law in any Member State of the European Union. You cannot use an electoral victory or economic success as a sort of condition to say ‘we do not then have to observe the rule of law in a Member State’. So I am interested in hearing the stories about economic success and electoral success, but it is neither here nor there in this debate, frankly. This debate is about the rule of law.  Secondly, this debate in my perception is not about party politics. I respect everybody who wants to make it a debate about party politics but for the Commission it is not, and I am sure that many in the ALDE Group would be surprised to be categorised as left-wing today, but this is a completely different matter. Thirdly, I am all in favour of freedom of speech, it is one of the fundamental values we cherish. It is one of the values Mr Orbán fought very hard for when he was in opposition against the Communist regime before the end of the European divide, because that is when I got to know him and, indeed, he was a Liberal at the time. But this freedom of speech is also limited by the rule of law. If you say: ‘I want to have a debate on abolishing the death penalty’, of course you can have a debate on that, but the consequence of having a proposal on the abolishment of the death penalty would be a violation of international and European obligations. Now the Prime Minister has said it is incompatible with membership of the European Union. Prime Minister Orbán has been very clear about this. He is never intending to put a proposal forward to do that. Well, my political question is: if you never intend to make a proposal, why then have a debate? What is then the reason for the debate? But that is a different matter, and let me also sometimes pose a rhetorical question like this. And finally, if we have a debate – and I salute Prime Minister Orbán, I respect the fact that he comes here because he knows exactly what is going to happen here; he comes here, he stands for his position, he defends it, and I as a democrat respect that.  But my respect would be bigger if the proposals of the Commission were not put forward as a caricature, as has been done by Prime Minister Orbán today. Where, Prime Minister, in the proposal of the Commission, does the Commission propose to have an open-door policy for migration into the European Union? Where is that, please tell me? Where in the proposals of the Commission, the migration proposals that we have presented, do we propose to have freedom for all economic migrants to come here? Where do we do that?  On the contrary, we want to have a much firmer policy so that people who do not have the right to asylum must return where they came from. That is part and parcel of the Commission’s proposals. And if we have the issue of quotas, it is in very, very limited, very serious cases of a very serious crisis, in a situation where a very, very high number of asylum requests are indeed attributed as they are because they come in this case from Syria or Eritrea, where we know that these people are fleeing war and conflict. But this quota idea is for a very, very limited number of people, and it would help the debate, honestly, if we did not make a caricature of the proposals of the Commission, because it would also help to have the European public better informed of what we intend to do. And indeed, we need to do something to prevent masses of people coming to Europe who do not have the right to asylum. We should help them stay in the countries where they belong. We should help them stay in the region where they belong. And this is all part of the Commission proposal. I make this point so strongly because I do believe that the only way forward in the migration debate is to be honest and clear about each other’s intention and each other’s plans.  So my plea from the bottom of my heart to the Hungarian Government is, and to everybody else, do not make a caricature of the plans of the European Commission, because we are on the same page in terms of fighting illegal migration. But we are also advocating a humane approach in full accordance with values we share. Values, Prime Minister, that you fought for as a young man when your people and country were being oppressed by Communism. Those values are values we share in the European Union, and you participate in the debate because you know full well that we are entitled to address each other about these values. You cannot say ‘nobody from an outside EU Member State can talk about the situation in my country’. It is part and parcel of being members of the European community of values that we do address the internal situation in each other’s countries. We should do it with respect, I fully agree with you, Prime Minister, but you cannot be excluded from debating the situation in a Member State simply because you are not a national of that Member State. That is also being part of the community of values that is the European Union. Let me end on this, talking about the very, very difficult case of refugees. I think of the country I know best, my country of origin the Netherlands: Németh, Szass, Tóth, these are now Dutch names. These are now names of sometimes the most successful people in Dutch society. These are people or children of people who had to flee Communist oppression when the Soviet Union crushed Hungary’s wish for liberty in 1956. And I as a Dutchman am proud of having Németh, Tóth, Szass and all the other Hungarian names as part of the Netherlands, as part of our community of values.  And they could do that because the Dutch people and many other Europeans in 1956 knew that the desperate people fleeing from Hungary needed a place to go, and they opened their hearts, they opened their homes, they opened their societies, and this is an example that we should follow. This is an example that tells us what European values are really, really about.

It is a fundamental condition for EU membership. The EU has gone a very long way to enshrine this principle in the Treaties. We cannot forbid anyone from having a debate, but, at the same time, we hope that the outcome of this debate will reconfirm the commitment to this fundamental principle. Freedom of expression is our common fundamental value but it has its limits. Extremist speech is forbidden. I have not heard in this debate today that anyone in this room disagrees that the right to work, the right to a fair trial, and the right to free and fair elections are not among the European Union’s core values. At the same time, there should be caution when choosing the means for defending our own values. Extreme measures may not produce the expected results.

I want to make my position very clear against the introduction of the death penalty in any EU country. Judicial errors in many states may be a warning sign for the reintroduction of the death penalty.

It is fair to say that this political witch-hunt, which takes place on the scale of general anti-Hungarianism, could not take place without the complicity of the hungarian national opposition parties.

In particular, we have developed the new anti-money laundering legislation. First of all, I would like to thank, of course, Mrs Sargentini, the co-rapporteur from the LIBE Committee, my colleagues as shadow rapporteurs, the European Commission, of course, and also the Italian Presidency, with whom we had the opportunity to conclude a final agreement between Parliament and the Council. Then the question is, what have we done in these two years? Firstly, the European Commission, as we know, came forward with a proposal to improve anti-money laundering legislation so that the law can keep up and even ahead of the criminal world. A number of valuable proposals came from the European Commission, which have been approved, namely that a risk-based approach to catching criminals will now be taken, say, money transfers, where the European Commission will play a very important role and will also help banks to carry out their work, find out what their customers really are or not, and, of course, a so-called blacklist will be created to help law enforcement banks, etc. understand in which cases an in-depth study of potential customers or money transfers should be carried out. But we have also introduced a novelty from Parliament that has finally received support, and that is, as an additional means of creating a European Union-wide register of beneficial owners in the fight against money laundering. What is this register? So far, we have a business register in all Member States indicating the structure of the owners of the company. But we know that there can be individuals and can be firms, companies where the owner can be another firm, etc., and so-called out-of-chains are formed, even within the European Union, and finally no one can understand who then ends up behind which company. Now our proposal, which is supported by the new law, will, along with business registers, create a requirement in all Member States, with all companies, to disclose the true beneficiary, hence to the individual who benefits from it. What does that mean? This means that in this chain of outlining, which makes law enforcement work very difficult, we will make it open that we will finally be able to see who is behind the company and whether or not its money or money transfers are legal. This will even help in terms of tax collection, since such schemes are probably used not only to launder the proceeds of crime, but also simply to avoid tax. So this is an innovation that will make the criminal world react realistically. What will it do? This will make these schemes increasingly difficult, which in turn will mean that the criminal world will have to move further away from the European Union. But in Europe, we have everything our heart might want : we have the power of law, we have secure banks, so the financial system. We also have, of course, all the properties, etc., that anyone might want. This means that, with this change in the law, we will not only make money laundering much more difficult, but we will push the criminal world, squeeze slowly beyond the borders of the European Union, forcing them to operate in jurisdictions where the rule of law is not so important. Thank you everyone for your cooperation! I call for support for this bill in tomorrow's vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1794, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Judith Sargentini", "mepid": "96815", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, thank you to my co-rapporteur, Mr Kariņš, to the shadows who have helped us in this term and in the previous term, to the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Roberto Gualtieri, and thanks to the Council, particularly the Italians, and the Commission.  It has been a very long process. We started in the previous term and we managed to conclude last December, and let me remind you that we had a plenary vote before the elections that gave Mr Kariņš and myself a mandate that was very strong: 643 votes in favour of a public register for ultimate beneficiary owners and 30 against. It gave us a mandate that did not allow us to backtrack, and that I really appreciate. We acted on that and my motivation has always been to deal with tax avoidance and tax evasion.  We had Thabo Mbeki visiting this House and he said that the amount of money fleeing out of Africa because multinationals are not paying their taxes in the country where the work is done is immense. We had the scandal with the son of the former President of the Ukraine, who put the money he stole from the Ukrainian people into a shell company in the Netherlands and then we had LuxLeaks. That helped to clarify why we are doing this.  The FATF and the Commission made tax offences a predicate offence, which is good, which helped us work, and then we created this public register on ultimate beneficiary owners. It is Article 30. We agreed to have 28 registers. There are countries that do not have an ultimate beneficiary ownership register at the moment and they are now obliged to have one. In future, these 28 registers will be interconnected, allowing people to search from shell company to shell company, from country to country. Who can look at these registers? Well the authorities, of course, they have full access, the obligatory entities – banks, casinos, etc. – but also anybody who has a legitimate interest, anybody who can show they have an interest in looking at them because of money-laundering, terrorism and issues like corruption, tax crime and fraud. So in the near future journalists and NGOs and every citizen in Europe will be able to look at the register and make sure that we collectively clean up our act, that we do not allow shell companies to steer away funding, to steer away tax money that can be used for education, for health, for everything we need in our society.  I am proud of that, and if Member States want to go further than that, if they want to add more causes, they can, and I think they should. We cleaned up the data protection and may I thank Commissioner Jourová, because as soon as the file moved from DG Markt to DG Justice we got a better hearing on the issue of data protection. So we made sure that the data subject, the person who wants to know something – perhaps they have a feeling that something went wrong with their data – has rights to redress, without tipping off criminals, but they have the right to redress. We respect data retention rules. Data retention is set at five years and I am happy to have that. That is Article 40.  So let us make this an example for other countries in the world. Would it not be fantastic if the USA were to follow us, would it not be marvellous in our fight against tax avoidance and tax evasion? I want everyone to help us reach that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1795, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Timothy Kirkhope", "mepid": "4542", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, with anti-money laundering, if you cut off the flow in money, you cut off the long reach of criminal groups and terrorists and help better protect the stability of our economy as a whole and individuals in it. The damage that money laundering can cause should never be underestimated. Where criminal activity in our economic markets is concerned, transparency is a powerful weapon. Therefore, the opportunity presented to myself, my fellow rapporteurs and shadows to right the wrongs of past legislation has been both a challenge and a privilege. Throughout the process, we have looked at international standards, at FATF, and at the need to combat money laundering beyond the borders of the EU and in full cooperation with the rest of the world. The ability to follow money across borders and seize back assets is important, and so is the space in which criminals are able to operate.  I believe that this package will help both to diminish that space for criminals and also to assist us in our ability to follow the money across those borders. For years, both consumers and businesses have run into difficulties with implementing previous legislation on this subject. Our aim has been to create, this time, a sensible, proportionate and effective way forward in the fight against money laundering. I have to say that the second Anti—Money Laundering Directive – with which I and others here were concerned – was interpreted ultimately and implemented in my own country, in the UK, in a way that made life almost intolerable for small investors and those who desired a normal, balanced relationship with their financial institutions.  This kind of undue burden must not be recreated with an even tougher new regime. The need to create fuller transparency, balanced with considering the wider impact upon privacy and the need to provide data protection, has also been a key element of our work. The terms ‘proportionality’ and ‘necessity’ are brought up time and time again in our work here in Parliament, never more relevantly than in our work on this package. Previous directives have had the effect of providing an excuse, sometimes, for institutions, including banks and building societies, to move their decision-making further away from their consumers and to introduce totally proscriptive and impractical ways of assessing customers. Businesses and financial services need to know what they are looking for and how to address the problem. There needs to be an effective reporting and supervisory system, but equally countries need to comply with, and not just sign up to, international principles and methods, as well as to ensure good cooperation with third countries. If businesses and our trading partners around the world are going to continue to invest in Europe, and if the single market is to grow and prosper, it is essential we have the right legislative tools and European cooperation in place in order to prevent and prosecute financial crime. Above all else, I hope we have delivered something which is consistent and workable here. For me the ability to effectively implement the package was at the forefront of my mind when I was dealing with the section that I was responsible for. You can have the best laws in the world, but if they are not well implemented, you gain nothing. I now believe, thanks to this package, we will be gaining a lot. I would like finally to thank all those involved as far as my work is concerned: my co-shadow Mr Simons, the shadow rapporteurs and the other co-rapporteurs.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her It is estimated that approximately USD 1 600 billion of money is laundered every year. This represents almost 3% of annual economic output. In the EU alone, one trillion euros is lost each year through tax fraud and tax avoidance – a sum higher than the EU's seven-year financial framework. We, as the European Union, as the European Parliament, must therefore take the lead in the fight against money laundering as well as in the fight against tax evaders. That is why it was of the utmost importance and urgency to revise the old, third anti-money laundering directive of 2005. We Socialists and Democrats have always supported constructively the Proposals of the European Commission in the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the accompanying regulation on the transmission of information on the payer in the event of money transfers and have worked towards the timely introduction of the new EU anti-money laundering legislation. Both legislative texts take a risk-based approach at European level, introducing increased due diligence for high-risk areas. This risk-based approach is also reflected in the scope of the Directive. In the future, casinos and gambling providers will also be included. In our opinion, however, the key point in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is transparency and thus the identification of the beneficial owners and the true beneficiaries behind nested, often opaque corporate structures and letterbox companies. That is why, in our view, it is a great success in the fight against money laundering that the European Parliament, under pressure from us Social Democrats and other central public business registers, has been able to impose detailed information on the beneficial owners of companies, trusts, foundations and holdings. Transparency is the best weapon against criminal activity in secret. However, the introduction of these registers was not self-sufficient, as they go well beyond the Commission's original proposal. The Member States in the Council have also long resisted this. However, the European Parliament was ultimately able to prevail with this central demand. These registers are freely accessible to all obliged entities, such as lawyers, notaries, banks and tax authorities, as well as to anyone who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, such as journalists. So far so good. However, we Socialists and Democrats would have liked an EU-wide link between these national registers not to be put on the back burner and only in four years' time, but to be launched immediately. Transparency and the flow of information must not stop at national borders. In addition, we Social Democrats would also like to see the standard of central registers of beneficial owners, which has now been established, applied to third countries as well. Such a transparency offensive would expose obscure practices, and the fight against money laundering, tax evasion, and tax havens could be conducted even more effectively. At the insistence of the European Parliament, however, the final legislative text provides for a list of EU third countries that have shortcomings in the fight against money laundering compared to the EU. Obliged entities must exercise increased due diligence when dealing with states on this list. Contrary to the Council's ambitions, we, as a Parliament, are involved in the drawing up of this list through delegated acts, which is updated every three months. We would have liked us to move on at some points. However, it should be noted that by establishing a central public register, we have been able to achieve our priority. This, coupled with other achievements, is certainly a success of the directive.

The European Union's fourth anti-money laundering package is therefore extremely important. It will lead to more transparency in an increasingly complex financial system that, without this package, would provide many opportunities for fraud. Agreements reached on a central register of beneficiaries of a company, on the inclusion of tax offences in the scope of the package, on stricter controls on financial transfers, on the obligation of intermediary payment intermediaries to cooperate with competent authorities are important innovations in European legislation. They will make it possible to clarify the ownership of companies and to have more transparency in business relations, which will lead to a strengthening of the functioning of the European Union single market. At the same time, it will facilitate the fight against organised crime and terrorism, and in particular, the follow-up of their funding, which is relevant in the current terrorist threat situation over Europe and has been reaffirmed as a priority in the European Security Agenda presented at the end of April. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the fourth anti-money laundering package takes into account current and future threats to European security and provides adequate tools.

The biggest novelty is the creation of central registers with detailed information on the effective ownership of all corporate structures set up in the European Union, by which this Parliament was fought. I have to say, however, that in the aftermath of so many financial scandals, the European Union falls short of promises of transparency, as member states have blocked the parliamentary proposal to ensure a single system of public access to registration. Instead, it will be up to the Member States to decide on who and under what conditions journalists, researchers, NGOs and citizens will be able to access the data by creating 28 different access systems, which reduces the easing scope of the Directive. Furthermore, trusts are outside this scheme and public access to their last beneficiaries is not allowed.  The link between this legislation and the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion is clear. The creation of a public register can be a powerful tool in the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion by multinational companies. It is a concern for all citizens of Europe, especially those most affected by the economic and financial crime that the crisis has exposed in recent years. A public register, even without changing tax laws, would certainly help expose fictitious and opaque corporate schemes and structures used to avoid and evade taxes. I would like to call on the Member States to transpose the Directive, ensuring broad, effective and rapid public access, and to establish efficient cooperation mechanisms. We must also promote this pattern of registration in third countries, with a concerted diplomatic strategy in the ttip negotiation, the G20 and other for a, in order to put an end to tax havens once and for all.

The fact that a careful risk analysis is a background is, of course, a prerequisite for bringing about decent legislation. The second important question was about the real owner.

When we know how complex structures we can have in relation to casinos, for example, and money laundering, it was of the greatest use. Then I am particularly pleased that we also managed to solve some of the problems that we so easily encounter, that we are creating legislation that pulls everyone across a comb. This puts money laundering criminals on the same line as social enterprises in Finland, for example.

I think we must be able to say today that we have actually come a long way, so thank you very much for that.  It is also an extremely important issue that we are discussing. For example, with regard to developments in the south of the world, the United Nations has said that African countries alone are losing around USD 50 billion a year because of tax fraud and money laundering. In other words, that is almost twice as much money as it receives in development aid.  In the fight against illegal capital flight, transparency is the crucial weapon. It is important that the authorities and the public can uncover the shell companies and fraud funds that multinationals use to launder their money and to store their profits so that they do not, so to speak, to contribute to the community through tax. That is why we have also supported the introduction of a public register to enable the public to follow the trail of shell companies back to the real owner of the companies. However, frankly, we do not believe that only the authorities should have access to this information. Ordinary citizens and journalists and NGOs should also have this access. After all, it is thanks to their efforts that scandals such as Lux Leaks have come to light.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to obtain a full public register this time. This is because there have been strong forces both within the Commission and among individual governments in the Council that did not want this transparency.

But the Group of Socialists and Democrats is particularly pleased to see the establishment of a public and European register of these beneficial owners, although it is sorry that access to such information is no longer free or organised at European level.

This phenomenon affects the international financial system and the global economy. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said in its research report in 2011 that the annual value of revenue from this crime could reach up to 2.7% of global GDP and is estimated to increase every year. This is facilitated by the process of globalisation, the complexity of global markets and technological developments, as well as the free movement of capital and the diversity of financial instruments. This is also undoubtedly facilitated by the anonymity and confidentiality of the bank's customer data, which, in particular, facilitates the concealment of sources of income in online banking services. And these sources, in addition to organised crime, also fund global terrorism.  Carrying out terrorist attacks usually requires considerable financial and preparation and implementation.

The new European legislation introduces effective action by the police, tax offices and other bodies to eradicate this social evil.

I heard Members speaking also about criminal law and about data protection, so let me also tell you in a few words about these angles from which we can look at the problem of organised crime. I would like to tell you that we are taking a very comprehensive approach to combating crime in the criminal law sphere. We are now strengthening the functions of, and cooperation between, the Eurojust and Europol agencies, especially in relation to strengthening security in Europe. Members also spoke about third countries and the necessity to enlarge our activities there and to focus on third country nationals, so I would like to inform you that also under the security agenda we plan to enlarge the ECRIS register, which is the register of criminal offenders for third country nationals, which can also help us to have a better information flow regarding suspects and probable perpetrators. The second thing Members mentioned was data protection. I am very glad that I am responsible also for this new regulation. The data protection reform which we are now preparing – and hopefully finalising this year in the Council, followed by the trilogue in the next year – is a real revolution, because it replaces 28 national regimes by one strong pan-European regime for protection of personal data.  So speaking about data protection in relation to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive and related things in the new legislation, I can say that we pay very high attention to protecting fundamental rights and especially the right to privacy and the right to the protection of personal data. These two pieces of legislation are very compatible and they can work together very well when they are introduced in practice.  As for the package itself, I am happy that I heard here that Members find the package a practical, reasonable, necessary and proportionate set of rules for combating crime in the financial sphere. Besides that, it is to combat organised crime such as money laundering, tax evasion and other related crimes, but also – many times mentioned here – terrorism. It is not here only to save money and to prevent money from going into a black hole somewhere, but to use the money for much better purposes, which was said several times. It is not only about saving money, it is, I may say, about saving human lives, because financial transactions are usually, or very often, the first signs that a terrorist attack or some terrorist action is being prepared, so this has an essential role for strengthening security in Europe.

Colleagues, i would like to thank you for your excellent work. The Insolvency Regulation, which entered into force in 2002 in all Member States of the Union except Denmark, regulates the choice of law applicable to the proceedings of jurisdiction and the recognition of judgments. Since the regulation adopted so many years ago proved insufficient in the context of the economic crisis and in the face of the bankruptcy of many companies in the Union, during the last parliamentary term we started working on amending this regulation in the European Parliament. The report was drawn up by our colleague Klaus-Heiner Lehne and provided an excellent basis for subsequent negotiations with the Council already under way during this term of office.  The positions of the two institutions were close to each other – and most importantly, we had a common objective: to create a legal framework for cross-border insolvency proceedings that would, on the one hand, give the creditors a chance to be satisfied, but on the other hand, these honest entrepreneurs will allow for proper restructuring and thus will not allow companies to go bankrupt and jobs to be lost.  The main objective of the reform was to try to reduce the so-called bankruptcy tourism. The European Court of Justice has pointed out that there are no adequate safeguards against such conduct under the Insolvency Regulation. This is an interpretation of the term 'principal centre of business' – the so-called COMI, which is necessary for determining the jurisdiction of the court having jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings. A change of jurisdiction entails the need to bring your claims before a court in another country. This, in turn, leads to proceedings in a different language, as well as other procedural rules, which in turn lengthens the process, increases costs and reduces legal certainty. In the current situation, legal certainty in the european Union's economic activity seems to be extremely important to us. Therefore, in order to eliminate the possibility of forum shopping, Parliament has proposed to introduce into the DEFINITION OF COMI the following solutions: a transitional period of three months during which the debtor's company cannot open insolvency proceedings after a possible transfer of its registered office to another country. We have adopted a different deadline, namely six months, in the event of consumer bankruptcy. This difference is due to a very important fact. It is much easier for a natural person to move than a legal person. In the event of a consumer bankruptcy within that six-month period, it is the debtor's responsibility to command that his principal place of residence is where he declared it.  Secondly, we have proposed a new system of insolvency coordination for a group of companies, which will be an optional or non-coerceal instrument. Within 30 days of receiving the information on the request for the opening of coordination proceedings, the insolvency trustee of each company may decide to exercise the opt-out option and exit the coordination if he considers that this will be beneficial to the company he or she is representing. We will examine the effectiveness and effectiveness of this mechanism five years after the entry into force of the amendments to the regulation. Thirdly, an EU insolvency register is established, which I believe is very important, to monitor insolvency proceedings throughout the European Union. I am convinced that this register will prove to be very useful for both citizens and EU businesses. On this occasion, I would like to thank you very much for your excellent cooperation with the Council, especially the Italian Presidency, as well as my fellow shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr Cofferati. Thank you very much.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1845, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the vote tomorrow will conclude a two-year-long negotiation process on the recast of the Regulation on insolvency proceedings. I want to pay tribute to the rapporteur Mr Zwiefka and to the Committee on Legal Affairs for their most efficient work on what I see as only a first step in this area.  Honest entrepreneurs deserve help when running into difficulties. The improved tools on jurisdiction will increase legal certainty and put in place effective safeguards against abusive forum shopping. I know that this issue was particularly important for Parliament.  The establishment of a system of interconnected insolvency registers will increase the transparency of insolvency proceedings for creditors. This is a very tangible benefit of the reform and it will foster a cultural change in the business community across Europe.  The revised regulation covers also preventive insolvency proceedings, which aim at rescuing businesses, as well as a larger range of personal insolvency proceedings. It clarifies jurisdiction rules. Synthetic secondary proceedings avoid duplication of proceedings. The revision also provides the first legal framework for coordinating the proceedings of members of groups of companies.  Of course, our work is not finished with the adoption of the regulation. We will spare no efforts so that practitioners and citizens can properly apply the new instrument by the time it replaces the old regulation.  The Commission has also followed up on your goal, and last year adopted a recommendation on a new approach to business failure. The Commission is currently assessing the actions the Member States have taken in response to the recommendation.  It is obvious that we need modern and efficient insolvency rules that help rescue viable businesses and give entrepreneurs and consumers a second chance. Let me give you several illustrative figures. Today in Europe, half of all businesses do not survive the first five years of their existence. In the EU, 200 000 firms go bankrupt per year, that is 600 a day, resulting in 1.7 million direct job losses every year. Around a quarter of these bankruptcies concern businesses that work cross-border, and the latest crisis has led to a surge in non-performing loans in all Member States without exception.  Last month we held a conference in Riga to look at the way ahead. It was a useful first occasion to gather views and brainstorm about the next steps. The Capital Markets Union project, which the Commission adopted recently, also contains a clear reference to the need for modern insolvency regimes as a gateway to a flourishing business and investment climate.  We are interested in Members views when starting to map out the next steps. I understand that consumer insolvency is of particular concern to some of you. I would like to recall that the principles laid down in the Commission recommendation are also relevant in this regard. In particular in its recital 15, the Commission urges Member States to consider applying the principles of the recommendation also to consumers.  The Commission has carried out a specific study on over-indebtedness of European households and families. The findings are clear. People who lose their jobs and incomes have a higher probability of falling into the debt trap, as do people confronted with accidents of life no one can anticipate. Bad financial choices come down to two basic scenarios: a credit which is too short-term, or interest rates which are too high, often to be explained by inadequate financial advice by lenders.  In the framework of this study, the most frequently—named best practice reported by stakeholders relates to legislative steps to make insolvency proceedings more readily available. However, the situation is not homogeneous across the EU. For example, in a number of Member States consumers do not have access to personal insolvency proceedings, and in many others the discharge periods are much longer than the recommended three-year period provided for in the Commission recommendation.  As regards next steps, besides the evaluation of the recommendation and the already existing material, the Commission is carrying out a comprehensive comparative legal study in the 28 Member States regarding consumer insolvency procedures. It will be completed in mid-January 2016 and this will provide us with a good basis to discuss next steps.

It is no coincidence that two years ago the Commission tried to propose a comprehensive reform of the whole sector. The safeguards included in this first important step are fundamental, in particular, of course, the one that seeks to limit so-called forum shopping, not least because in too many cases companies and debtors suddenly moved their headquarters before insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings began.  This regulation introduces a legal framework that is finally certain and protective, as well as the ability of courts to assess whether the move is genuine or not, and this is a very important step.

It is therefore logical and perfectly normal to discuss the possibility of improving insolvency proceedings and unifying insolvency proceedings. Of course, we cannot miss the fact that member states' legal systems regulate this procedure differently, but a common framework can still be introduced. This would be useful for the common market as well as for increasing the level of competition and would have a beneficial effect. I agree with the thesis of some of my colleagues that it is right and necessary to think about the introduction of the status of \"bankruptcy of the family and the individual\". It cannot and is wrong for a man to be permanently and forever a slave to his creditors. This practice has long been denied in the Member States. Alas, the current practice shows otherwise.

This greed has taken many business projects and many life projects of individuals and families who, for the most part, were in good faith. Therefore, it is mandatory to offer them a second chance. Because it's a matter of justice. But it is also another tool at the service of the real economy and employment.  This review of insolvency proceedings and the Commission's recommendations set out very clear principles to be met by all Member States and should also apply to individual debtors. They are neither the inequality of legal weapons between creditor and debtor, nor the time limits for recourse, designed at the service of the powerful, nor the inhumane vetoes of the payment, which condemn individuals and families trapped in unfair mortgage proceedings.

In particular, I believe that we should increase the protection of employees who are most affected by the possible bankruptcy of their employer. Unfortunately, the risk of company bankruptcies is high nowadays, for example, in the Czech Republic, the number of insolvency proposals has increased from 5,300 to more than 35,000 per year in the last six years.

We have an extremely serious problem: evictions continue, many people are losing their homes because they are not given this second chance. I believe, of course, that we must move towards much greater protection at European Union level and also enforce those judgments in which it is noted that some countries, such as Spain, do not comply with the legislation in this area.

I am convinced from my own experience in the Czech Republic that this is a very good regulation and it is good that after ten years you are carrying out a revision that removes some problems, such as clarifying the jurisdiction of the insolvency court in order to avoid the aforementioned insolvency tourism, where the place where insolvency law is somewhere best for the debtor, not for the creditors, is chosen. It is also very good that you are currently extending the scope of this proposal and that in the future not only liquidation forms of bankruptcy, but also eliminated forms of bankruptcy, will fall within this regulation.

The fact that this recital is inward will hopefully make it possible, in the next revision of the regulations, to take even more far-reaching measures. Then, so to speak, I would not only like to praise your work, but also ask you to tackle the next hot iron, namely private insolvencies.

Something that is economically effective and absolutely socially just. Why is this framework of people's insolvency necessary? Firstly, because we have very different legislation within Europe in this area, from the insolvency commissions in France to the model of rehabilitation in Britain, which allow hundreds of thousands of people - 150 000 a year in Britain or 50,000 in France - to have a well-deserved second chance.  But unfortunately, in some countries we do not have this necessary legal door, this escape from a situation that has caused a social disaster. Spain is a paradigm in this. We have had 570,000 foreclosures during the economic crisis, hundreds of thousands of first home evictions; a social disaster, as I said, but also a moral collapse: the one we see on TV news when police drive old ladies out of their homes.

This is due to a positive relationship between the rapporteurs, for which Mr Zwiefka is to be thanked in the first place. There are a few aspects worth highlighting. The first, which I have just heard, is the one we agreed on extending the scope of the directive, that of hybrid procedures and restructuring. After all, what we need is to anticipate the risk of bankruptcies, which is often overlooked because the less contentious we have, the better for the citizens of Europe. The extension of the scope gives us an additional legal instrument in relation to the existing ones, which will greatly reduce the conflict. In the same way, it was important to identify the main focus: the phenomenon of finding the place where the procedure is activated is a negative phenomenon. The shopping of the forum must be reduced, where possible, even eliminated. I believe that the conditions are in place here to be able to do so. The procedures for coordinating insolvency for corporate groups, which Parliament has already indicated, are also a good step in the right direction. Finally, it remains the issue of workers or creditors. We have introduced a rule which is that of the provision of a preferential right: these are the weakest, who are often penalised by decisions by others who fall on them.

This is especially true for entrepreneurs. The fear of bankruptcy in the EU must be overcome. I welcome the extension of the scope of the Regulation and believe that focusing on national procedures that provide for restructuring of the company at a pre-insolvency stage and lead to the recovery of businesses, as well as giving entrepreneurs a second chance, are key to having a viable economy in the EU.

Mr President, the last debate we had in this Chamber on maternity leave was last July. Almost a year has passed and what has happened since then? You could say, \"not much.\" Finally if, however, a little: Frans Timmermans plans to withdraw the directive \"maternity leave\" and put it in REFIT; The Council is deaf to the community; and we, at Parliament level, when we are not obliged to do so, but we are committed to it, we are building bridges to the Council, unfortunately without any success. So, once again, I here publicly denounce the Passivity of the Council, but also the precedent that this represents: two institutions are speaking, but the Council does not deign to give its position, even if it is far from the other two. It's unacceptable. This is of course unacceptable on an inter-institutional level and it is disrespectful to the other two European institutions that we represent here this evening, but it is also unacceptable, above all, for the millions of mothers and children who are thus deprived of social justice. Where is the Triple A Commission announced by Mr Juncker? It is not by throwing the \"maternity leave\" directive into oblivion or in the trash that we will achieve this objective. In what Europe do we live - I ask the Council - when those who give life are penalised by the simple fact that they become mothers? What Kind of Europe do we live in if married is synonymous with poverty? The resolution that we will put to a vote tomorrow aims to make this Europe, through women but also mothers, a true Europe of triple A on the social level. Let's not wait any longer! Since 1992, the date of the first maternity leave directive, things have not progressed. 1992! Today is 2015! We were saying this morning that if Europe has to wait 20 years to pass laws, the situation will soon be difficult, especially when it comes to social laws. What we are saying to Parliament, the Council and the Commission is that these women can no longer wait. These women must be able to balance their private and professional lives. These women should not choose between motherhood and careers. These women must be able to take responsibility as women, as workers and as mothers. These women should no longer be the victims of wage or pension gaps in relation to men, they should no longer be the victims at all, simply because they are mothers, because they \"risk\" - and that is the word we hear today - to be mothers one day. Imagine! In Europe today, being a mother is a \"risk\"! A risk to the employer, to politicians and to society. What kind of society do we live in? We can no longer bear it and we clearly ask again in this resolution that all this disappears, that these women be protected, that these mothers have maternity leave, that they can be paid with dignity so as not to fall into poverty, that they can reconcile their private and professional lives, that they can, finally, be all they are. , that is, women, mothers and workers, and that they occupy their place in our society with dignity. Commissioner, I know that, on this subject, you are committed. I am counting on you so that this debate does not wait another ten years, so that we can give this opportunity to these European mothers. I am counting on you and it is on the Council, of course. But I must confess that, since it has been said, I have been tired of repeating to the Council what we are currently asking for. So let's do this duet with the Commission. Let us try to find the solution so that, as soon as possible, these women are respected.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1872, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Zanda Kalniņa-Lukaševica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to address the state of play as regards the Commission’s proposal to revise the Maternity Leave Directive. During the past few months, the Presidency has met with Parliament’s representatives on several occasions to discuss this subject. As you know, the Commission has expressed its intention to withdraw the proposal if there is no tangible progress on unblocking the negotiations by the summer. I shall be very honest with you: the proposal as it stands clearly does not enjoy support in the Council. The Council’s position does not leave any room for further manoeuvre. We must also be realistic about the fact that Parliament’s position on, and expectations from, the proposal are fundamentally different from the Council’s. We respect that stance. However, we must face the fact that the current state of affairs will not allow us to progress on the issue. Allow me to stress one thing: the Council’s position was not arrived at easily. It is the result of profound and complex reflection. Tremendous effort and good will was invested by the previous Presidencies. The Presidency cannot act on its own: it is bound by the will of the Member States, just as the Parliament is bound by the will of its Members. Despite the difficulties that have surrounded this issue, I believe that the Council and Parliament remain united in their commitment to advancing the well—being of Europe’s women – and of working mothers in particular. The Council has repeatedly stressed the importance of supporting women and men in the struggle to reconcile work, family and private life. Promoting women’s full participation in the labour market is not only a matter of equality but also an important factor contributing to overall economic growth. With that overall objective in mind, after seven years of efforts that have not brought us to an agreement, we would very much welcome a fresh start on this subject. A new initiative would provide a better basis for the Council and Parliament to work jointly towards improving the reconciliation of work and family life, for both women and men. This should, of course, include the protection of pregnant and breastfeeding women. I hope that Parliament will be able to share the Council’s view on the need to take a more comprehensive and forward-looking approach. Thank you for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1873, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) for their engagement and especially for their efforts in relation to the Commission’s proposal to revise the Maternity Leave Directive. In particular I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mrs Arena, and to the Chair of the FEMM Committee, Mrs García Pérez, and to their efforts to find a way out of the stalemate. The Commission is strongly committed to gender equality and the protection of pregnant women and new mothers. The Commission recognises the need for women and men to be able to balance working life so they can combine it with their family life. The Commission has stressed on many occasions its readiness to facilitate negotiations between Parliament and the Council. We have engaged in continuous efforts to break the deadlock. My services have worked closely with previous and current Presidencies and with this House to try to find a realistic solution acceptable to both sides. Thanks to Mrs Arena, we recently had the opportunity to explore new possibilities for compromise, particularly on the question of pay, which we know was difficult for Member States in times of economic crisis.  The Commission has facilitated informal talks between Parliament and the Council, requested a discussion in the Council and has advocated concrete discussions on the basis of the rapporteur’s proposals in order to move towards an agreement. We have insisted that the Presidency bring this back for discussion in the Council on the basis of the rapporteur’s proposals in order to unblock the negotiations and try to move towards an agreement.  When the file came back to the Council at political level recently, the Commission recalled Parliament’s position and readiness to engage. Unfortunately, a solid group of Member States remains opposed to any further negotiations on this file. Many of them agree that there is a strong case for action in this field, but they are not convinced that this proposal, preparations for which started almost 10 years ago, will solve the issues faced by working parents in 2015 and beyond. Overall, there is a majority in favour of a fresh start in the Council. I remain open to continued discussion with the co-legislators, but as things stand now the Commission sees no reason to depart from its intention, as announced in the work programme, to withdraw the proposal and replace it with a new initiative if no agreement can be found within six months. A fresh start now appears likely to be the best way forward. Society and the labour market have undergone significant changes in the recent period. The Commission is committed to improving the situation of working parents in the EU. I am therefore open to start looking into a new approach to tackle the challenges faced by them. We know that it is mainly women who are hit by what the economists call ‘the motherhood penalty’. They see their potential, and even their ability to participate in the labour market, fall when they become parents.  The gender pay gap, which is almost non-existent before child-bearing age, remains, still, at 16% and the gender pension gap stands at 39%. At the same time, we know that Europe faces a demographic time bomb that risks becoming a serious economic and social problem, as well as a fiscal problem for the EU, and as the economy starts to pick up, Europe needs to make best use of all our talents to compete in the global marketplace.  Women are more highly qualified than ever before, more highly qualified on average than men. We cannot afford to continue to neglect this talent pool at a time of shrinking populations and growing worldwide competition. Women and men have to be able to balance working life so that they can have the family they want. They need to have a choice.  Men should also be encouraged to live up to their family responsibilities. Many men would like to spend more time with their children but face difficult circumstances in the workplace. Creating conditions that allow a proper work-life balance will help families, businesses and our societies as a whole and will promote more gender equality at all levels.  The challenges for working parents start with the arrival of a new baby, but they do not end there. Parents also need a certain level of flexibility throughout the childhood and teenage years. There needs to be a decent level of childcare and care-services infrastructure in place to give people a meaningful choice, and we must not forget the challenges of caring for elderly or infirm dependants faced by today’s sandwich generation. But all this needs to be done in a smart way so that this does not suffer the same fate as the previous, or still current, proposal.  That is why I intend to look, together with my colleagues Vice-Presidents Timmermans and Dombrovskis, as well as with Commissioner Thyssen, more broadly at the EU regulatory and policy framework and how it can be improved, given the real needs of parents and businesses in our changing world, and to propose up-to-date solutions to meet these needs. The Commission will stay in close contact with Parliament in order to reflect together all aspects that should be taken into account.  We will also carry out a public consultation and will consult the social partners in accordance with their specific role in the field of social policy as laid down in the Treaty. We will consider the full range of possible actions, both legislative and non-legislative measures, in order to have the most effective impact.

Today, Member States must give women 14 weeks off, with 2 weeks mandatory. At the same time, the woman remains in her job and must receive a salary or remuneration at least equal to the sickness benefit. This is guaranteed by the 1992 Directive, which still applies today. In 2008, the Commission prepared a proposal for an amendment to this Directive. However, At first reading, Parliament adopted a position on which the European Council refuses to negotiate. The Directive on women's health and safety has made it a tool to promote a kind of European family policy in the interests of gender equality. The Council has been blocked and women have once again fallen victim to political ambitions. I am in favour of extending maternity leave to 18 weeks. Of which 6 weeks are mandatory, because the World Health Organisation is asking for it. I am in favour of a woman who is due to be at home for six weeks to receive a full salary for this period.

So while in Europe under-birth is a fact, while the countries of Europe are being overwhelmed by a number of illegal immigrants at the risk, in the near future, of becoming minorities in our countries, the Council does not approve the extension of maternity leave to 20 weeks, because there will be economic costs.

I have thought a lot about what you have said when you spoke about women's rights legislation. I ask: Is having children a woman's hobby? Is it a luxury that women dare to either have or not have? Is having children something that women need, or does society need it? How is it possible that women work so much time in their lives and not only during childcare, but throughout their lives work for free? And is it the job they need, or is it the job society needs?  I believe that we need to find a new paradigm for the new beginning that I have committed to come up with, that looking at this area only from the position of women's rights is just that. I think and feel it on myself when I promote and promote gender equality policy, that the arguments that speak of fair equality, about non-discrimination, about women's rights, those arguments seem to fall under the table, because they are just gender issues. And I think that is also something on which the Maternity Leave Directive is failing and on which it has been failing for several years. Because for so many years, the directive has not been implemented and approved. We all know that one of the reasons we are talking about this today in relation to withdrawal is precisely the length of the blockage. Why don't the arguments of fairness and non-discrimination drag, and rather, as it seems to me, pull economic arguments? That's a question perhaps rather philosophical, but I'm prepared to use those arguments. Someone here said it was a Marxist argument. I don't know, but for me, it's a cynical argument that we need women to give birth to taxpayers. But that's right! It's a cynical, unfair argument, but it pulls, it has its power when we work with that argument. But the other economic argument is this: women are too burdened, and by having this burden, they are already holding back the European economy, they cannot get involved so much, they cannot contribute to growth, they cannot get involved in work. That is why, in fact, the situation we are in today is a drag on the European economy. Let us please use all possible arguments, including these economic ones, but with a strong awareness that those arguments that emphasize fairness and equality are and should be stronger. Now to the directive itself. Of course, we have two options, and we still do, to push the directive that has been here since 2008, a directive that – and I dare to quote Mrs Aren now – \"solves at least something and before something new\". I agree with this, if we were to enforce this directive, at least we have something that will bring better protection for female mothers. And perhaps ultimately better social recognition, even if it is perhaps a little strong, to want this from the directive. In any case, as Commissioner, it might be easier for me to try to persuade a part of the Member States, even if there is a real large majority, to change their position. I was really trying to get this directive to the Council meeting and reverse the blocking, but not because it is easier for me, but because, in line with Mrs Aren and many others, I wanted to have 'at least something'. The other option is to come up with something new. I would like to say something about the directive before I start talking about something new that many say we don't know what it will be. I had the impact of the Maternity Leave Directive on growth and employment analysed immediately after coming to the Commission, and I found that the legislation thus built did not have the direct, strong impact. This, in turn, is rather a purely economic statement. Secondly, I must say that since 2008 a number of Member States have already adopted legislation that brings enhanced protection for women, and this, too, may have been one of the reasons why the Directive may have been blocked in the Council – but I do not want to speak for the Council and, frankly, I am glad that I do not have to speak for the Council here today. What's going to be the \"new\"? It's a very complex mathematics. I have ambition, and that is why we are planning to withdraw the directive, to bring something that is stronger, more ambitious in two things. We will try to address the reconciliation of private and working life throughout our lives, not just motherhood, and we want to draw men into family care and shared care. In other words, so that even men can afford the luxury, now take it a little with exaggeration, stay at home and join the care of family members. Meanwhile, women are affording themselves that luxury, and the result is an increasingly open-cutchirk in economic status and women's poverty in Europe. So it is a complex mathematics, when we talk about reconciling private and working life, we are not only intervening in the area of non-discrimination, but we are also intervening in labour and family law, we are also facing very diverse attitudes in the Member States, which are rooted in cultural traditions and the different positions of women in the Member States, which are really deeply rooted. I myself come from a country where the view that when a woman goes to work too early from a child, she's a bad mother, and that's judgmental. I think in some other countries it is quite the opposite. So we are also treating such complex diversity within Europe, and last but not least, we need to do a very good legal analysis of the competences that the European Commission has. Because, as has been said many times in plenary, these are shared competences where we do not wish to go beyond and violate the principle of subsidiarity.  So when did the question come up, when are we going to come up with the proposal? We are working on a new proposal by analysing the situation, drawing on fresh data and working on this with my colleague Marianne Thyssen, who is in charge of employment issues, and, of course, we will also be working with First Vice-President Timmermans and Vice-President Dombrovskis, because the issue is clearly also about work and social dialogue. So I do not want to log on to specific data here, but I can see realistically that in the second half of this year we could have an initial proposal that would go into evaluating the impact of legislation on the so-called impact assesment.  Thank you for the patience with which you have listened to this long exposé of mine, but I felt it necessary to comment further on this and I look forward to working with you. I feel a strong motivation here to deal with this matter, and I think we all understand that such new legislation is really intended to bring about social change, not just what we here consider important, and that is to improve conditions for European mothers. Because we need rules not just for mothers, but for Europe, for its growth.

For more than seven years, we have been trying to find support for this file, and the lack of support for the current legislative proposal by the Commission should not be interpreted as a lack of will to protect the rights of working parents.  Actually, as a representative of a Member State offering a generous system of paid parental leave where the parents can choose who will take care of the child – the mother or the father – and the rights to stay home are for 18 months, I can assure you of our strong commitment to the fundamental principle.  What is at the heart of the problem is a lack of support for the very concrete legislative proposal. So let us not overdramatise the situation. We welcome the Commissionʼs intention to come up with a better proposal that would be more realistic and more modern. I would like to use this opportunity to thank Ms Corazza Bildt and Ms Morin-Chartier for their comments and position in wanting to have a modern parental leave system and to avoid pointing fingers, which will not help to find a solution. Actually, the Council understands very well the importance of parental leave provisions for Europeʼs families, and maternity leave should not be seen in isolation. Other helpful measures can include, for example, accessible care services with flexible working hours, paternity leave and so on, as well as a more equal sharing of care responsibilities between women and men. Flexible working arrangements and a reconciliation-friendly culture are also relevant in our modern societies. There are plenty of ideas to be inspired by.  To make a child needs a woman and a man, so why do we speak only of maternity leave in the context of childbirth? I am worried by the rhetoric used in the context of this debate. Men must have an equal right to participate in the upbringing of children. So I would like to use this opportunity to invite Madam Commissioner, when working on the new proposal, to prepare a good modern one where both parents can share responsibility and can use the opportunity to take care of the child. I think that could be of real use in the European Union. The Council is a co-legislator whose opinion on the current proposal is clear. Hence, we have to make a choice: we can continue to disagree on the existing legislative proposal for another five years or we can try to find an agreement on the basis of a new proposal. The Council has made its choice. We are looking forward to having an agreement in the foreseeable future.

Furthermore, measures to protect women who give birth to a baby and return to work are of ultimate importance in the context of protection of the rights of families and working mothers. Discrimination of parents raising minor children and discrimination due to family-related obligations are widespread in Europe. The situation around the Directive is especially notorious provided we are taking seriously our commitments of gender mainstreaming and gender equality.

I am entirely committed to achieving this objective.  The Commission’s work programme for 2015 stands as testimony to our pledge to put equal opportunities for people with disabilities at the heart of the Union’s policies and legislation, in full observance of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This Commission has a clear agenda for creating jobs and growth for all, promoting fairness and creating a society where discrimination has no place and where no one is left behind.  European law offers protection against discrimination in employment on the grounds of disability, age, sexual orientation and religious belief. The Commission is keeping a careful eye on national developments, including in any new legislation or national case law. I am prepared to use all means at my disposal to ensure correct application of the law in all Member States. Moreover, the Commission hopes the Council will soon adopt our proposal for a horizontal Equal Treatment Directive, a proposal put forward in 2008, which extends this protection beyond the field of employment. Its adoption is a priority for the Commission and we will seek to convince national governments to give up their current resistance in the Council.  Europe still has a long way to go to achieve equal opportunities for persons with disabilities. Significant gaps persist, notably in employment and education. It is simply not acceptable that the employment rate for workers with a disability is 24% lower than that for others. Of course we should do more together – not only the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, but also the social partners and other stakeholders – to fight discrimination and make the labour market more open to the most vulnerable people in society. We must offer them appropriate ongoing support to remain economically active.  The European Social Fund invests in measures to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination. European law underpins this and requires employers to adapt workplaces and working arrangements to ensure they facilitate inclusion and diversity. Improving access to employment on the open labour market is certainly one way to enable full and equal participation, but empowering people with disabilities to enjoy their rights fully also means that persons with disabilities should not live in institutions.  The current regulatory framework for structural and investment funds has been reinforced, as you know, in order to promote the shift from institutional to community-based care. Member States are asked to demonstrate the existence of the administrative capacity for the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and a thematic ex-ante conditionality requires that national strategies for reducing poverty, aiming at active inclusion, include measures to support the shift to community-based services. Only those actions which help to establish the conditions for independent living, in line with the United Nations Convention, should be supported.  This exchange with you today is taking place at a particularly timely moment. Last summer, the European Union submitted a report to the United Nations on how we are implementing the United Nations Convention. It highlights several positive developments, such as the new requirement on Member States to prove their capacity to implement the Convention as a precondition for accessing European structural and investment funding. We are now engaged in a dialogue with the United Nations on our implementation of the Convention. In September, the United Nations will provide their assessment of the Union’s progress. The Commission will take this evaluation into account in our mid-term review of the European Disability Strategy, assessing whether it is fit for purpose and seeing what urgent issues remain to be tackled at European level.  Implementing the Convention is a shared task, shared by all European institutions. I welcome the European Parliament’s commitment and the proactive role it plays in promoting the rights of persons with disabilities. This commitment has been renewed recently by the decision to re-establish a Disability Intergroup and to create a Cross-Sectoral Task Force. Making the United Nations Convention a reality is also a task shared between the European Union and the Member States. We must work in tandem, reinforcing and complementing each other’s efforts in a coordinated way. The Commission will continue to promote exchange and dialogue with all those concerned by the implementation of this Convention, including Member States, European institutions and organisations of persons with disabilities.

Another important issue today is the supervision of the implementation of the United Nations Convention on Persons with Disabilities. The European Union, as a party to the Convention, faces an internal institutional problem. The European Parliament, an institution directly elected by our people, is not properly and formally involved in the preparation of reports and monitoring the implementation of the Convention. Yes, the Commission is designated as the main body designated to answer the list of questions of the Committee on Persons with Disabilities in accordance with Article 33 of the Convention.

However, in our institutional struggles, we cannot forget what we are fighting for.

We therefore trust that the Commission will invite all EU framework members to formally participate in the constructive dialogue with the CRPD Committee in Geneva in August. I would also like to thank colleagues who have joined forces across party lines to put the rights of people with disabilities higher on the agenda. Last week we organised a public hearing with the EU Human Rights Agency and the European Ombudsman, among others, and the message was very clear there. This UN Convention is an extremely important document for people with disabilities. It also imposes a legal obligation on signatories, including the EU. The hearing also showed the need for cooperation between all the levels involved. A coherent approach is therefore the only way to ensure that people with disabilities can also fully enjoy the freedom of movement of people, which is a fundamental right for all EU citizens. The introduction of, for example, a European accessibility regulation could represent a major step forward. After all, people with disabilities in Europe still experience too many obstacles when they want to use goods or services. A single European market is not yet a reality for them. People with disabilities, like you and I, must be able to participate in our society, and that is why the implementation of the UN Treaty is so crucial, so important.

In this context, I would agree with my colleague Adám Kósa, and strongly ask my own country, Ireland, to ratify this Convention. Yes, I know there are legal difficulties, but we have to get on with it. People with disabilities need to be able to assert their rights today – not next year or the year after. The resolution this evening expresses the views of Parliament, but because of time constraints I have the opportunity to mention only one or two issues. First of all, we are calling on the Commission to present an ambitious proposal for a European accessibility act, and I am pleased to hear what the Commissioner has to say about that. But we are also strongly calling on the Council to speed up its work on the Directive on the accessibility of public sector bodies’ websites for persons with disabilities, and also on the Commission to explain in full how, in both current and future legislation, we can ensure that persons with disabilities will be guaranteed equal access and equal opportunities.  Finally, I am asking for support for our amendment which urges Member States to work towards the adoption of the EU Anti-Discrimination Directive, because it seeks to protect persons with disabilities against discrimination in social protection, healthcare, rehabilitation, education and access to the supply of goods and services such as housing, transport and insurance.

There are many people who no longer have access to the health system, others have been excluded from the labour market. Unemployment among people with disabilities reaches even ninety per cent in Greece and, for the past year, institutions hosting children with severe disabilities are threatened with closure because there is no money to pay their staff. So what does the actual implementation of the UN Convention mean, five years after its adoption?  It means, among other things, that the Commission, the Council and every Member State that proposes austerity programmes cannot ignore their impact on disabled citizens. Disabled people do not need wishes and sympathy, but policies that make up for the freedom that nature or bad luck has deprived them of. If we offer people with disabilities even one centimetre of the support that the Institutions of the European Union provide to banks and policies, then we will have taken a step towards improving their quality of life. That is why we need a mechanism that records disabilities and monitors how the UN Convention is applied in each country, because if we do not put binding rules of compliance of each state and every European institution of the European Union into this convention, neither do we respect the disabled or ourselves.

However, as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to give voice to a problem that is little discussed: the situation of family caregivers, that is, those who care full-time for a family member who is not self-sufficient. Some European countries have legally framed this figure, thus giving it the right rights and duties. Unfortunately, however, there are other countries, including my own, Italy, where family caregivers are left completely alone in their daily family care activities.  I do not think it is acceptable that what appears to be a very wearisome job should not receive the necessary social security, health and insurance protections, especially if the model we want to strive for is that of caring for people with disabilities in the family rather than in institutions of shelter.

At the same time, I congratulate and thank my colleagues in the disability intergroup that this debate has been brought to this debate today. I believe that it is essential for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the European Union to enable the declaring of a disability by the persons concerned to be declared equally throughout Europe. Of course, we cannot imagine today that disability case law should be uniform in Europe, but we already have a good idea for many years that allows the Member States to recognise these rulings. It is the European Disability Charter, the European Disability Charter. It will enable those citizens of the European Union with disabilities to exercise their civil rights.

But no less important is to work cross-cuttingly on all European Union policies, and the unblocking of the anti-discrimination directive is essential for this. In this regard, my group has tabled an amendment which has been supported by all the groups in this House, with the exception of the People's Group, to which I ask that tomorrow vote in conscience and make it possible for us to move that message to the Commission so that this necessary anti-discrimination directive is definitively unlocked. On the other hand, we have also echoed a claim that the European Disability Forum has been making to us. It is a very striking claim and occurs in many Member States, and refers to the need to remove those restrictions made to article 12 of the Convention, in particular the right to vote and to be elected, with a very restrictive interpretation of legal capacity. I therefore hope that this Parliament will also support this initiative tomorrow, that we will transfer it to the Commission so that it can also be endorsed, and that we will achieve that necessary full citizenship of all persons with disabilities.

That is why I call on the European Commission to adapt to all its regulations, platforms and instruments to enshrine fairness in the treatment of these people. Special attention should be paid to education, and it is urgent to develop early intervention programmes in all Member States and provide them with decent human, material and financial resources, which can lead to effective skills development and minimisation of existing limitations, ensuring that all children with disabilities have an inclusive education, even before pre-school education, based on a curriculum appropriate to their learning skills. But at a time when we have the largest research and innovation programme, it is important that there is a strengthening in the dissemination of your opportunities and that we are involved in the areas of science and technology applied to disability. European people with disabilities can no longer have to resort to centres of excellence outside the European Union. The mere differentiation of conditions is now insufficient.

What is certain is that the poverty rate of people with disabilities is well above average, only one in two people is in employment and only one in three young people with disabilities goes to school. Just over a month ago, we discussed the introduction of employment quotas in Brussels. It is no secret: self-determined life and social participation can be made possible above all through integration into the labour market. In Germany, more than 111 000 companies employ disabled people, and this is a first success. These companies have understood that both sides can benefit from this.

With its ratification, the European Union has become an independent party to the first ever international treaty on human rights.  It is intended to ensure that people with disabilities are treated equally in the exercise of their rights and no longer as sick people, but rather as equals. To this end, it is urgently necessary to create appropriate structures and to remove barriers that still exist in order to raise awareness of the need for action. There must be room in our society for all people, and especially for the 80 million people living with a disability in the EU. It must be ensured that, like all other people, they also have access to and the right to education, training, adequate health care, employment, social protection, equality and participation and access to buildings, transport and information, as well as the right to live a self-determined life in society.

That is why the resolution on which we are going to vote tomorrow is also very important. Of course, the EU has a great deal left to do to ensure that people with disabilities can lead a life on the same terms as other people in the EU. The fact that the Council has not been able to develop a position on the discrimination directive presented by the Commission in 2008 effectively conceals protection against discrimination against people with disabilities and other persons in vulnerable situations.  I would like to make two points in relation to the implementation of the Convention in the European Union. The first is that we need to see people with disabilities as individuals from different backgrounds, culture, gender, belief and ethnicity. It is therefore extremely important that we pay attention to the fact that people with disabilities may also be subjected to other forms of discrimination. We must also see that people with disabilities have different needs in order to live an active and independent life in our society. It is not reasonable for a disability to restrict a person in things that others take for granted, such as where you choose to live, what education you want, where you want to work, what you want to do in your spare time, what goods and services you want to use. In this place, the EU can play an important role by developing guidelines.

First of all, I would like to join those colleagues who say here that it is very sad that three Member States of the European Union have still not ratified this Convention. I would therefore like to call on you, if there is anything that can be done on the diplomatic field by the Commission, for these three States to join the international convention, so that you can please do so.

I very much respect that. I used to be a member of the Czech government, I was in charge of citizens' access to public administration, to justice, and I know how difficult it is for people with disabilities to communicate with the authorities, to communicate with the judiciary.

We are rightly no longer talking about transport, tourism, employment, education, infrastructure and participation in public life without devoting specific measures to accessibility for disabled people.

That is why we are working on a European accessibility act. Some of you have insisted on continuing with this. I interpret that call as your support for the work we are doing. The crisis has indeed hit hard, especially among vulnerable groups. Some of you have also pointed this out. I would like to point out that we have only completed the European semester, that is, the Commission has proposed the country-specific recommendations, which the Council has yet to adopt. Through that semester, supported by our funds, we are incentling the Member States to modernise their social insurance systems. We want the European Union to be made up of inclusive and activating welfare states that enable people to participate in the labour market and in society. That is a line we have also taken in our proposal on the employment guidelines. You have rightly pointed out that all policy areas should be addressed to people with disabilities.

Persons with different abilities deserve the same treatment and opportunities as anyone else. In an age where it is more than evident that everyone can contribute to our societies in some way, we must truly recognize our duty to change our current policies. Ensuring basic rights are adhered to, and assisting persons with disabilities in the field of access to employment can ensure an independent living module to all those who seek it. This, combined with a move from institutionalisation to community—based care, a good educational basis for children with disabilities – both physical and intellectual – based on the concept of ‘different abilities’ rather than ‘disabilities’ can help us fight the social stigma that persons with a disability still face in this day and age.

We must send a strong call to Those Member States that have not yet transposed into their internal law the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

The EU and most Member States have signed the Convention, and many of the Member States have ratified it in their national laws. The Convention establishes an international monitoring system through the designation of governmental agencies responsible for implementation issues, and also provides that civil society will be integrated and participate in the follow-up process. As a result, the EU Disability Unit was set up, which produced a report on the implementation of the Convention, in relation to which the United Nations presented a \"list of issues\" to which the Commission must now respond. As one of the European Parliament's implementers for the implementation and follow-up to the Convention, I have considered a resolution that highlights the need for coordination between the various European institutions, the need to adopt the European Accessibility Law and Parliament's support for the Commission in drawing up the response, and in which Parliament also expresses some unease that the Commission has not relied more on him for the preparation of the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1959, "date": "2015-05-19.json", "name": "Adam Gierek (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "28379", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. – This Convention is an important step in levelling the playing field for people with disabilities. The document discusses the rights of persons with disabilities, the role of their advocates and the cooperation structures. Around 80 million people with disabilities live in eu countries and one in six Europeans has limited mobility. In line with the 2010 European Strategy on This Issue, Europe is to become a continent without barriers by 2020. Adopted in Poland in 1997 The Disability Charter identifies the most important areas where intensive action is needed to ensure that people with disabilities do not feel discriminated against. The so-called \"black book\" presents m.in. architectural, technical barriers in places of education and work and communication barriers. In recent months, The Polish Railways has regulated legal assistance for people with disabilities when boarding and getting off the train. However, the lack of financial security for carers of people with disabilities is worrying, most often for women who give up work to care for a disabled person. Unfortunately, the current low benefits for this purpose are unfortunately being tried even further. The positively assessed JUNIOR programme on the professional activation of graduates with disabilities enables them to take up traineeships and subsequent employment.

Its essence is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities and to promote respect for their inherent dignity. Despite the increasing number of educational and organisational activities carried out in many EU countries, there are still many barriers that prevent the implementation of basic efforts, such as the possibility of full participation in civic and social life. It is therefore necessary to introduce an obligation to remove all obstacles which hinder persons with disabilities from fully and effectively participating in society, on the basis of equality with others.

It should be one of our top priorities as Members of the European Parliament to ensure that the equal rights, dignity, equal treatment and full participation of persons with disabilities in society is a fact and not a mere wish.  As members of the Committee on Petitions, we receive plenty of cases dealing with discrimination on the grounds of disability in access to employment, self-employment, public services and education. According to the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, discrimination and barriers while exercising their rights are part of everyday life for persons with disabilities.  It is essential to underline that this is not a homogeneous group and therefore the policies and actions should reflect the various needs of women, children or people who need more intense support.
