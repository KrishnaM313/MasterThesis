Herr President! Es tut der European Kommission gut, anstelle of the Ratsvorsitzenden das Wort zu ergreifen. (Beifall) Wir haben, sehr geehrter Herr President, als Mitglied of the European Rates am vergangenen 23. September das unsere dazu getan, damit wir uns in Sachen Migration und Flunchtlinge von der Stelle bewegen konnten. Die European Kommission - das ist Ihnen in lebhafter Erinnerung geblieben - hatte dem Rat schon im Mai diesbez-glich Vorschl-ge unterbreitet. Der Rat hat etwas Zeit gebraucht, um sich auf diese Vorschlàge zu einigen. Wir hetten es als Kommission vorgezogen, wenn der Rat - vornehmlich der Innenminister - sich einvernehmlich auf eine solidarische Verteilung der Flàchtlinge in Europa hàtte einigen kunnen. Dies war angesichts widriger, vor allem innenpolitischer Zust-nde und Begebenheiten nicht meglich. Dann haben wir - und das ist ja auch keine Katastrophe - uns an den europeischen Vertrag, seine Sinngebung, seine eindeutigen Festlegungen erinnert. Wir haben - wie ich das auch hier im Hause versprochen hatte - die Gemeinschaftsmethode zum Einsatz gebracht und mit Mehrheit im Rat der Innenminister entschieden. Dies ist eigentlich, interinstitutionell betrachtet und von der Arbeitsweise her gesehen, ein gutes Zeichen gewesen. Ich ehrf-rchtigst den Ratsvorsitzenden. Donald, mechtest of the, oder darf ich weiter? Also ich erfreue mich einer massiven Z-rtlichkeitszuwendung des Europeischen Rates und bin dankbar dafar. Wir hetten eine einstimmige Entscheidungsfindung vorgezogen. Dies war nicht meglich, und deshalb die Gemeinschaftsmethode. Und das war - wie ich finde - richtig. Wir sollten jetzt nicht in diesen Sumpf der gegenseitigen Schuldzuweisungen eintauchen. Wir haben jetzt eine Entscheidung. Diese Entscheidung muss umgesetzt werden. Und wir tun das in go gebotenen Schnelligkeit. We acted, as a Commission, with a speed that no one thought we could. There was a European Council on 23 September. We have proposed to the institutions, and therefore to both branches of the budgetary authority, our proposals for 2015 and 2016, which we will do in the coming weeks. We have proposed a budgetary amount of $800 million to both branches of the budgetary authority.  I am pleased that the European Parliament, once again, has indicated that it will decide quickly in committee, on the 8th, I believe, and in plenary on the 15th.  The European Parliament is up to the common task of ours. He had already given the green light to the Commission's proposal to jointly distribute the number of refugees. This has, in fact, forced the European Council to do the same. Imagine for a moment that the European Council overturned Parliament's decision...  I am therefore grateful to you, Mr President, and to the members of this House for having acted with the speed that characterizes the work of this House. You will do the same on budgetary issues, since it is a question of increasing Frontex's resources, the means of Europol and the resources of the European Asylum Support Office. We will deploy up to 600 civil servants in the coming days and weeks to assist Greece in protecting external borders. By deploying such a large number of staff to Greece, we are actually doubling the number of civil servants who work at DG HOME, as they say, the Directorate General for Home Affairs and Justice. I would like to thank the Member States participating in this initiative and I would like to encourage those who have not yet done so to follow the example of the Austrians, the Germans and others. President Tusk, you, Mr President, and I have seen the President of the Turkish Republic, Mr Erdogan. Turkey is making an extraordinary effort as it is home to 2.2 million refugees, including from Iraq and Syria. It is clear that we need Turkey to protect our external borders. The Commission will do its utmost to help the significant efforts of the Turkish Republic.  We cannot only focus on our own internal affairs, we also have to deal with the problems that exist on the periphery of Europe. In fact, it is the same problem. The European Union and Turkey must work together and must develop, in harmony, the same policy of welcoming, protecting and monitoring the unfortunates who come to us.  I have submitted to the Turkish President, following an agreement with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Parliament, a memorandum on the cooperation that must be established between Turkey and the European Union on refugees. We will release this document this afternoon at 3 p.m. I can't do it now because we have agreed with our Turkish friends to do so at 3 p.m. this afternoon.  We pay particular attention to Greece. 66,000 Greek refugees and asylum seekers will have to be distributed in other EU countries. I have delegated to Athens the Director General responsible for structural reforms in Greece, Mr Verwey, who is negotiating on the spot the programmes to be implemented by Greece. I did the same for Turkey. From tomorrow morning, senior Commission officials will be in Ankara to negotiate the details of the arrangements with Turkey. In addition, I have asked the commissioners responsible - there are several of them, including Frans Timmermans, who does not yet know this - to go to Turkey to negotiate politically with the Turkish ministers the arrangements we are in the process of making with the Turkish authorities.  This common policy between Turkey and the European Union is not a matter that would concern exclusively civil servants and senior officials, although they are of extraordinary competence. I believe that, in the noble sense of the word, the negotiations between the European Union and Turkey must be politicised. Of course, these policies have a cost. I observe, not with concern but with interest, a debate that is currently taking place in Europe as to whether or not the associated costs should be exempted from the interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Stability and Growth Pact, to which we have added, by enriching it, a part of economic reading, allows us to respond to this situation, but I would not want us to leave in total irresponsibility. It will therefore be necessary to see, on the basis of an analysis that the Commission is undertaking, whether, on an ad hoc basis, certain countries can evade the unse nuanced application of the Stability and Growth Pact. But let's not do it lightly.  Today we are discussing the cost of the refugee policy. Tomorrow, if we are not careful, we could discuss something else. But the Commission, on this point, is open not to all adventures but to all suggestions. Mr President, I will answer all the questions you will ask me after listening with sustained attention to the President of the Council, whom I greet among us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Donald Tusk", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Council. – Mr President, the real test for any community comes at a time of crisis. Just as we check our banks using stress tests, today life itself is using a dramatic migration stress test to check our community. And that is what the last European Council was about. You know its results. Allow me then to share a more general thought with you, especially as, in 10 days’ time, the next European Council will be dealing with the same problem. Historical changes and threats on a large scale demand a sense of dignity and self-belief from every community, particularly now, when the whole world is focusing its attention on Europe and on its reaction to the wave of refugees. Europe is subject to increasingly scathing criticism, and our internal disagreements and mutual recriminations only help our opponents. Almost everyone in Europe has joined the chorus of critics, while very few defend its good name. In the United Nations, one could have the impression that Europe is the worst place in the world for refugees. Believe me, I felt isolated there when I defended Europe’s good reputation, trying to convince the audience that the truth about Europe is completely different. Hundreds of thousands of refugees go to Europe because they know that our community is still the most open and tolerant of all. It is still we who respect international standards and conventions, and it is Europe where people – all people – are safer than anywhere else. Let us not let Europe become a scapegoat as a result of our quarrelling and blaming each other without restraint. Otherwise, before long, theocracies will start to lecture us on what religious tolerance means; dictators will tell us what democracy means; and those responsible for this massive exodus will tell us how to treat refugees. In fact, they are already doing this. There are countries which admit virtually no refugees but which are most vocal when it comes to urging Europe to show more openness. That is why we have to take care of our good name –together. We keep talking about solidarity, about quotas and greater assistance for refugees on our soil, and for those who remain in camps in countries outside the EU. Let us remember, however, that solidarity requires mutual understanding and respect. Without solidarity among Member States, we will not be able to help others. It is our common obligation to assist refugees as well as to protect the EU’s external borders. Everyone must take up this obligation and at the same time, no one should be left alone with the burden. That is how I understand solidarity. We have to respect commonly agreed rules. When someone says that they have no intention of observing European law, for example the Dublin Regulation or quotas, they undermine the essence of solidarity and our community. Observing rules will always mean sacrificing part of our interests. I would like to dedicate these words to the Hungarians and the Italians, to the Slovaks and the Greeks. Let us have no illusions. Today, we have to count mainly on ourselves. The world around us does not intend to help Europe. Many of our neighbours have much bigger problems to tackle, and some look with satisfaction at our troubles. For us, refugees are specific people – individuals who expect our help. There are forces around us, however, for whom the wave of refugees is just dirty business or a political bargaining chip. We are slowly witnessing the birth of a new form of political pressure, and some even call it a kind of new hybrid war in which migratory waves have become a tool, a weapon against neighbours. This requires particular sensitivity and responsibility on our side.  Dear colleagues, you all know the notion of ethics of responsibility from the works of Weber – not Manfred but Max Weber. Today, the ethics of responsibility requires us to refrain from extremes. And by extremes I mean both, on the one hand, anti-immigration rhetoric and, on the other, inviting everyone who wishes to come, despite being unable to take them under our roof. We need to understand that today millions of potential refugees and migrants – not only from Syria but also from Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and other places – are dreaming about Europe. For all refugees, easy access to Europe and lack of external borders have become, alongside the Willkommen-Politik, a magnet attracting them to us. During my visits to the region, whoever I spoke to – presidents, or refugees in the camps, in Turkey, Jordan or Egypt – warned me of one thing: that a potential victory by Assad’s regime, which is more likely today because of Iran’s and Russia’s engagement in Syria, will result in the next migratory wave. Yesterday this message was confirmed by President Erdoğan. According to Turkish estimates, another three million potential refugees may come from Aleppo and its neighbourhood. Declaring solidarity is always greeted with applause, but calling for responsibility and common sense hardly ever. Practising solidarity is a lot harder than preaching it. I am speaking as a decades-long practitioner.  This is why I ask you all to show responsibility and common sense. The first commandment today is the restoration of control on the EU’s external borders as a sine qua non of an effective, humanitarian and safe migratory policy. Tomorrow, in the European Parliament, you will hear Angela Merkel and François Hollande. We all know how much depends on them. In this crisis situation they have both demonstrated beautiful moral gestures which we all highly appreciate. Tomorrow, they must pass an even harder exam, an exam in responsibility for the protection of the European Community, and its external borders. Otherwise, they, and all of us, will become responsible for the re-emergence of walls and barriers on our internal borders, here in Europe. We have to say it finally, loud and clear: Europe without its external borders equals Europe without Schengen. Europe without its external borders will become a breeding ground for fear in each and every one of us. And this will lead us, sooner rather than later, to a political catastrophe. What ordinary people expect from politicians is, first and foremost, effectiveness and determination. If the leaders of mainstream politics do not realise this, people will start to look for different kinds of leadership, radical and ruthless, because what people want from their leaders above all is a guarantee of order and security for their own community. Either we will face up to the challenge, or others will take our place. The queue of political machos is quite long, but there is still time to stop them. And that depends entirely on us.

This is the first time that the President-in-Office of the Council has come to the European Parliament for debate, even after an informal Council for reporting. I would like to express my thanks for this. People are unsettled by the migration issue – we all feel that. That is why I believe – also on my group, the PPE- and the Ppe-DE – that we must first of all tell people that we are also able to provide answers. Six months ago, three-quarters of a year ago, who would have thought that European ships – British ships, German ships – would be operating in the Mediterranean today and, together with Italy and Malta, were saving lives there? Who would have thought six months ago that we would be able to set up a distribution mechanism for 160 000 refugees in the European Union and decide to show solidarity? Who would have thought that we would now begin to implement a robust mandate in the Mediterranean in the autumn, so that we would not be dictated by the smuggling gangs on the agenda, but that the state would take responsibility again? And who would have thought that last week's European Council would be able to put significantly more money on the table to help the United Nations and organise aid on the ground? It is important that we also talk about successes, not just about the problems, in order to gain people's confidence in the ability of their representatives to act. The second thing I want to say today is that, of course, many construction sites are still open. On my group's part, I would like to say that we do not need new ideas now, but we need implementation, implementation and implementation. We have a great need for this. The Commission has presented a package that sets the right direction, and the European Parliament has clear political backing for the Commission's package, led by Jean-Claude Juncker: yes to the hotspots, yes to aid at the external borders! Please, don't talk now, but do it! Yes to repatriation: last year, two-thirds of all refugees in Europe were turned away. Yes to the repatriation of rejected applicants! Don't talk, but do! Yes to safe countries of origin. All candidate countries, as the Commission has presented, should be described as safe third countries. Don't talk, but do! That's why: implementation, implementation is now called for. I would like to say a word, particularly on Turkey, because yesterday the talks with President Erdogan took place: we support the classification of Turkey as a safe country of origin, we also support the joint border security activities that are being made and, of course, the financial efforts that we want to make. However, we must also say that we are constantly reminding Erdogan and the Turkish Republic of principles: if a country is a candidate country, then we expect the implementation of civil rights within the interior, then we also expect Turkey to deal properly with internal issues, especially in the Kurdish conflict. Europe must not look the other way on this issue simply because we now need Turkey as a partner. Great challenges mean that we have to give people guidance. One point of reference is that Europe is a continent of humanity. The right to asylum is in our Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is anchored there and is not available for disposition. We are proud of our core values. In this respect, Angela Merkel's statement that we, as a large continent, can do this also applies. Secondly, refugees are welcome, but they are also called upon. There is no right to choose a Member State in the European Union where to go. There is a duty to register, there is a duty to integrate into our social order. This too must be clearly signalled to the people who come to us. And the third is that the state must enforce the law. That is why, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am grateful to you for what you have said. Border security, securing the external borders, Europe controlling at the border, who comes to this continent and whoever is also rejected, must be carried out, including with technical measures. The state must enforce the law and must also be able to contingent and provide a framework for the environment. framework conditions, orientation, so that our citizens have confidence.

I want to be European as a champion of human rights, I do not want to turn this being into that of a bad and ugly bear just because I have to reject refugees. Let us do this by implementing the decisions taken quickly, Mr Tusk. The hotspots linked to relocation, the defence of the external borders, the link between security and reception, the policy that the European institutions are making towards Turkey, lebanon, all this convinces me, it must be done, it must be implemented.

Mr Tusk mentioned, at one point, one million in the coming months. If those numbers are at least partly correct, it is clear that what the Commission and the Council have prepared for us is far from satisfactory. It is a stop-gap: it is certainly not a solution. As usual we have had confused and confusing language, and the traditional share of bullying and invective against those who disagree. We have had disregard for laws that we ourselves established. Humanitarian arguments were mixed with political ones. Mr Timmermans, for example, went so far as to say that the reallocation scheme is good for our souls. Amazing – he really did say that! We have had elements of blackmail and typical euro-casuistry. The immigrants were invited and then disinvited. The Schengen procedures were abolished and then restored again. If this gigantic confusion is a reflection of the state the EU is in, then God help us! What we did not have, however, is the long-term objective. What is the final state of affairs that we want to attain? The Council talked about the cultural and social criteria that are to be taken into account in immigration policies. I think this makes sense. I am afraid, however, that Europeans have built such a powerful system of taboos and inhibitions around the immigration question that there is not much hope for a rational debate.

I am saying this is because, first of all, it has taken a very long time for an informal summit to be organised – because this crisis did not start a few days or a few weeks ago. Then, what was produced from this summit was a one-page statement. This is all that was produced from an informal summit of the European Council on the most important crisis Europe has faced in the last decade – a refugee crisis such as we have never seen before. One page: mainly repeating decisions about the 120 000 refugees that have already been taken by the Ministers for the Interior, and then also pledging EUR 1 billion in additional money. I ask myself how many people from Syria have to die and how many additional people from Syria have to flee to Europe before the European Council takes a comprehensive, global approach to this refugee crisis, as is proposed by the Commission? It is not that you have nothing to work with. A few hours before the European Council, the Commission decided on a global package: including a new European asylum system no longer based on the Dublin Regulation; including a new European migration package in which we create one system, a blue-card system, in Europe – not 28 systems; and including, perhaps most importantly, a European border and coastguard proposal – that, by the way, Mr Tusk, the Ministers of the Interior refused to put in their conclusions on 11 September 2015. They did not talk about it. So I am asking: what is needed? Why was it not possible for this European Council in its summit to decide on the package proposed by the Commission? Parliament has already backed this package. So what is happening? Why can the European Council not overcome these internal divisions? My proposal is very clear, namely that we – the Council and Parliament – should agree to a fast-track procedure for the Commission proposal: to adopt it as quickly as possible, as these procedures are there. Secondly, my proposal concerns the external borders of Europe. Regarding this conflict in Syria, is it not time that the European Union – you the European Council, you Mr Tusk and Ms Mogherini – took an initiative? For the moment we are being pushed out. The Russians are taking action. What they are mainly doing is bombing – bombing civilians and citizens in Syria and the last of the remaining Free Syrian Army fighters. I do not know if there are many of them, but at the moment they are being killed by Russian bombs.  We are the ones who are facing the consequences of this refugee crisis, not the Russians or the Americans. They are talking about Syria, while we, who will face all the consequences of it, are not taking any initiative at European level for the moment. We actually have three different opinions within the Council about this. So take the initiative: call a summit and have 28 bilateral meetings, giving Ms Mogherini a full mandate and also enforcing no-fly safe zones. The current situation is crazy. I hear people saying that it is not possible and that you need a mandate from the UN. No – apparently, to bomb Syrian citizens you do not need a mandate from the UN, but to protect Syrian citizens you need a mandate. Such an approach is completely crazy. Finally, we also need a new donor conference. There is not enough money in these refugee camps. So, Mr Tusk, I am counting on you. The 28 Heads of State are not going to solve these problems. They are not capable of doing so, as they each represent only a nation. You represent a continent. Assume your responsibility.

Mr President Tusk, I have listened very carefully to you and you are right. I believe that, as Europeans, we must remain proud of what we have built in Europe. You are right, even if the European Union is not perfect, if our rule of law is still under construction, if our democracies are sometimes faltering and need to be strengthened and if our prosperity is little shared. But if I had to choose, this is still where I would like to live, without any hesitation, and it is no coincidence that many refugees and asylum seekers apply to join the European Union. And you are right: to see theocracy give us lessons in religious tolerance, to see dictatorships give us lessons in democracy, to see countries that do not take a single refugee give us lessons in welcoming, it is daring to say the least. What I see Mr Tusk is that most of the countries you are referring to when you say this are allies of the European Union, and I would like to hear you tell those states everything you have just told us. However, when you saw Mr Erdogan yesterday, which we apparently need, when he puts the press and justice under his boot and restarts the war in his own country, these subjects were not addressed. I therefore call on you to be a little modest on these subjects, even if, you are right, we must be proud to be European.  You said that we must avoid extremes and, once again, I agree with you. Let me give you two figures: the European Union is 23.7% of the world's gross domestic product, we can say, in the big ladle, of the world's wealth. Well, the 160,000 refugees that you have agreed to distribute to Europe, at the commission's initiative, represent 0.2% of the world's refugees. If we are close to an extreme, it is certainly not the extreme of the wide open door and therefore, again, I think the European Union can do better. I would like to invite you to follow the Commission's recommendations. We have heard President Juncker, Vice-President Timmermans repeatedly in this forum, ask you, ask the Member States to put in place a permanent key to the distribution of refugees. I have heard the same people talk about setting up legal paths in Europe to put an end to the deadly business of smugglers. I have finally heard the same ones, and I fully agree with them, to make the case for a European asylum policy and, on this, considerable progress is still to be made.

Mr President, winter is approaching - as Mr Timmermans said the other day in this House - and when winter comes, many roads will be closed and there will be less immigration, there will be fewer refugees because they will not be able to cross the sea. They'll disappear from the news. And many countries will feel that because they no longer see them on television, there are no refugees. What a big mistake we can't fall into!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that Europe cannot take in all the misery of the world, but it is also true that Europe, the whole of Europe, must deal with the misery of the world. We cannot be neutral, immobile, reflexless, when injustices multiply and when serious events happen elsewhere on our planet. It is true that we have to fight the origins, the sources of the migration problem, and some do. I would like to pay tribute here to the Member States of the European Union which have not cut their development aid. There are few of them. I would like to pay tribute here to those who intend to correct up their development aid. I would like to criticise here the Member States of the European Union which have reduced their contribution to humanitarian aid. I would like to criticise those who have reduced their contribution to the UN-managed food fund. I would like to criticise here the Member States which have reduced their contribution to the functioning of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees.  If we are talking about the origins, we must also talk about those who have helped to increase the mass of problems that, in fact, drive the unfortunates of this world to come to Europe. To be honest, and I repeat this here, in fact, we should be proud that those who are unhappy are heading to Europe because Europe, in their eyes, is a better place to live than elsewhere. Why don't they go to Russia? Why don't they go to China? Why are they not going to the United States? Why don't they go to the Gulf countries? Should we now apologise for being in the eyes of the whole planet the place where it is better to live? We should be proud of that! But it is true that we have to deal with the massive influx of refugees and we are in the process of doing so. The right answer to the migration problem is not to build walls. Refugees, because they are unfortunate, will always find a way to reach European territory. Always. Therefore, building walls will not solve the problem. But those who build these walls should at least pay attention to the language that accompanies their architectural work. We must not forget that words speak to those who hear them.  Why do we say, without protests, that refugees are economic refugees? How do you know? There are those who flee their country because they are persecuted. So let's not mix the categories. Yes, there are economic refugees. Would you not be if you lived in the circumstances of theirs? Yes, it is true that they are not allowed to stay in Europe. But let's not talk about these unfortunates as if they were barbarian hordes, gangsters and organized gangs. That is not the case. They're all unfortunate. (Applause) I said that building walls was not a good answer. I would add: why do some people think they can build walls between the member countries of the European Union? Why is the construction of walls between Eu Member States no longer hindering? It is still implausible that in 2015 some governments will build walls within the European Union. What does that mean?  It's the end of Europe! If everyone did this, it would be the end of Europe. We must, without hindrance, openly criticize governments that resort to this kind of architectural genius. Some of you are critical of the European Union because it would not have been able to make decisions. I would like to remind you here, Mr President, that the European Council took place on 23 September and that Parliament will vote on 15 October on the budget that accompanies the decisions of the European Council. Never - and I know what I'm talking about - has never been a decision made as quickly as this time. The Council, the Commission and Parliament can be proud of this. If we were still so fast, Europe would be in a much better state. You criticise the Member States, yes, but you always say the European Union. That is not correct. Don't say Europe, Europe, Europe... Don't say the European Union, don't say Tusk or Juncker, say the Member States. Some Member States are not in a good place to make the decisions they should make. So do not criticise Europe but criticise the Member States which prevent us from taking action. (Applause)  And don't criticize my friend Tusk. I am still a witness to the progress of the European Council meetings. While some Member States are preventing the President of the European Council from moving forward as quickly as he would like, the President of the European Council, which does everything to get things done. Instead, criticise the Member States that prevent it.  In addition, we should always come back to an important subject. I feel very challenged by the fact that the religious factor or the philosophical factor finds in Europe an importance that does not belong to it. It should not be said that Christians are only admitted to its territory. It should not be said that we do not like to see believers of another obedience evolve on our territory. This is not Europe! Europe is the continent of tolerance. There should be no tolerance for intolerance. Intolerance must be combated; you have to say it every moment. Eber die Turkei will ich gern noch ein Wort sagen: Wer gibt einigen hier das Recht, zu sagen, wir h-tten mit Herrn Erdogan gestern ein Kaffeekr-nzchen abgehalten? Wir haben uns sehr bem-ht, mit der Turkei ein Einvernehmen in Sachen Flàchtlinge herzustellen. Das ist ultrawichtig, nicht nur for Griechenland, sondern for Gesamteuropa. Aber wir haben naturlich auch 'ber andere Fragen geredet. Denken Sie wirklich, dass wir mit Herrn Erdogan Hundchen gehalten h-tten? Naturlich haben wir - im 'brigen auch der President des Parlamentes - die Probleme angesprochen, die uns voneinander unterscheiden. Aber ich bin trotzdem der Auffassung, die Turkei geh-rt auf die Liste der sicheren Lunder. Diejenigen, die denken, dem sollte nicht so sein, sollen die Schlussfolgerungen aus ihren ziehen. Wenn die Turkei nicht auf die Liste der sicheren Lunder geh-rt, wie einige denken, dann muss hier der Antrag gestellt werden, die Beitrittsverhandlungen mit der Turkei abzubrechen. Solange wir aber auch auf die turkische Mithilfe angewiesen sind und solange die Turkei auch auf ein harmonisches gemeinsames Handeln mit der European Union angewiesen ist und solange die Beitrittsverhandlungen nicht gestoppt werden, solange geh-rt auch die Aber denken Sie nicht, dass wir mit Herrn Erdogan nur Freundlichkeiten ausgetauscht h-tten. Trotzdem bin ich der Turkei dankbar - das muss man hier doch einmal feststellen - dass sie 2.2 Millionen Flàchtlinge auf ihrem Territorium beherbergt. (Beifall) Wer sind wir denn, dass wir denken, dies wr keine groe Anstrengung? Wir haben uns darauf verst-ndigt, 160,000 Menschen in Europa solidarisch auf die Mitgliedstaaten zu verteilen. Die Turkei hat 2.2 Millionen Flàchtlinge aufgenommen, vom Libanon und von Jordann ganz zu schweigen, wo die prozentualen Zahlen noch wesentlich deftiger ausfallen. Also: Ein bisschen Bescheidenheit tete uns manchmal gut. Wir sind am Anfang eines langen Prozesses, und deshalb brauchen wir ein permanent System der Umverteilung in Europa, und deshalb brauchen wir auch eine Legalisierung der Einwanderung nach Europa. Ich komme aus einem kleinen Land - Luxemburg, fer die, die es nicht wissen sollten. Ich bin aufgewachsen mit jungen Italianern, mit vielen Portugiesen. Luxemburg geh-rt zu den reichsten Lundern der European Union. Ohne Portugiesen und ohne Italianer wre dieses kleine Land nicht das geworden, was es geworden ist.

We are here in Parliament to be criticised and I am not here to be applauded: it is our job. Of course we have to be tough if we want to be politicians, and I think that in this context everything must be clear. Thank you, Members, for the discussion. I think after this discussion we are fully aware that this issue is still dividing Europeans – at Member State level and also here in the European Parliament – and I can understand why. At the same time, I feel that today the chance for having a more common approach is much greater than it was a few weeks ago. I have no illusions and I have no doubts: nothing in this matter is easy, firstly because the scale of this issue is bigger than ever before, and that is why it is full of emotion – and not only in this House. First of all I would like to underline that the issue today, because of its scale, is absolutely unique. That is why nothing is easy. Today we are talking about almost 70 million displaced people in the world, and almost all of them are around us. In Africa and Eurasia, there are 70 million.  When it comes to Afghans, for example, we have almost three million Afghans on their way to other countries. They are today in Pakistan, in Iran, in Iraq and in Turkey. Some of them, three million, are already in Europe. We have to be aware that, maybe not for all of them, but for sure for the majority of them, Europe is or can be the final destination. We have about eight million internally displaced people in Syria. There are three million Syrians in Turkey, Jordan and Iraq. There are hundreds of thousands of potential refugees from Yemen. This is why nothing is easy in this case. This is why some of us in Europe are so nervous. This is why we feel something like fear, and I can understand why, because this is something new. For sure it is not a new problem but this scale, this new exodus, is something new, and some Member States have no experience with this kind of problem. That is why emotions are running so high. I cannot agree with the thesis that the majority of refugees are social migrants. First of all, it is impossible today to distinguish between refugees and migrants because, in fact, all of them are escaping war, poverty and hunger – at the same time – from Afghanistan, from Syria and from other countries. This is why the situation is really difficult for us, because we have to treat almost all of them as potential asylum seekers. The second reason why nothing is easy in this case is because this new conflict in Syria – the war in Syria – could very possibly transform into a global conflict as a result of the engagement of some global powers in Syria today. I have no doubt that the current situation is bad enough to provoke a new wave of refugees from Syria. As I mentioned in my first speech here, the current estimate is that about three million new Syrian refugees are on their way today from Aleppo and the neighbourhood of Aleppo. Thirdly, the situation is also difficult because we have no convenient partners around us. I have no doubt that we have to cooperate with other countries, for example Turkey. I can fully understand why some of us are very critical or sceptical when it comes to Turkey but, on the other hand, if we want to cope with this problem we have to consider Turkey as an absolutely key partner in this project. Do we want to lecture Turkey today or do we want Turkey on board to tackle the refugee problem?  I know this is a dramatic dilemma, but today we have to solve this dilemma and our opinion, the opinion of the European institutions, is that we have to try to cooperate with Turkey because we have no other option. As you know, we have more difficult partners around us than Turkey. Turkey is not easy, but it is definitely the best possible partner when it comes to our neighbourhood in the south and in the east.  It is obvious to me that we, and of course also the Member States, have to engage. That is why I am absolutely sure that our next European Council will be dedicated to this issue, and I hope that the discussion today here in Parliament will also be a real inspiration for some leaders and for some Member States – and I am sure that you know what I mean. Było jeszcze pytanie od eurodeputowanego z Polski, kolegi Olbrychta, co możemy zrobić wspólnie, a co osobno, jako państwa członkowskie, w tej sprawie. Jedna sprawa wydaje się dzisiaj oczywista: żadne państwo w Europie samodzielnie nie poradzi sobie z przyjęciem i utrzymaniem uchodźców, stąd kontrowersyjna, ale konieczna idea wzajemnej pomocy, relokacji. I równocześnie dzisiaj widać, że żadne państwo graniczne nie może sobie samo poradzić z takim napływem emigrantów, z jakim mamy do czynienia dzisiaj.  Jedna i druga sprawa wymaga solidarnego i moim zdaniem wspólnotowego podejścia, a nie wzajemnego oskarżania się. Dlatego najwyższy czas, aby pomyśleć o wspólnej odpowiedzialności europejskiej za ochronę granicy zewnętrznej. Dzisiaj widać wyraźnie, że ten ciężar – bo to jest dzisiaj wyjątkowy ciężar i wyjątkowa odpowiedzialność – przekracza możliwości któregokolwiek z państw członkowskich z osobna. To jest prawdziwa rewolucja w myśleniu, ale uważam, że powinniśmy tę rewolucję przeprowadzić, to znaczy Europa jako wspólnota powinna przejąć istotną część odpowiedzialności za ochronę granic zewnętrznych, w tym za organizację tak trudnych projektów jak hot spoty czy obozy dla uchodźców, wtedy, kiedy to konieczne wewnątrz Europy, ale także poprzez pomoc dla organizowania takich punktów na zewnątrz Europy.

However, this step forward is not a sufficient step. In order to find a solution, we have to acknowledge two things: that the size of the refugee wave in the EU has surprised everyone and; that there are very large differences between member states. As it is realistic that the refugee wave will not stop soon we must create a permanent system of refugee admissions solutions.  We must certainly do everything to address the refugee problem primarily in stabilising the situation in the countries where the migrants come from. We must also help all countries participating in this crisis: Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

However, it is a historic mistake that some countries, Hungary, opposed the deal. The Hungarian Government has questioned solidarity and cooperation at both our borders and at the negotiating table and has gone against basic humanitarian obligations. This has undermined Hungary reputation, but unfortunately in the long term it can also have a negative impact on society's openness and helpfulness through its constant search for enemies and negative propaganda. Fortunately, there Hungary other things: a significant part of society has moved, set an example, and many citizens and NGOs have provided a helping hand to refugees.  Similar examples and decisive action are needed in Europe. We need not only quotas, but also a new comprehensive refugee policy replacing the Dublin system, while protecting the Schengen acquis. Proper border protection and registration of refugees must be solved in such a way that Member States can fully fulfil their human rights and humanitarian obligations and ensure the free movement of European citizens.

It is to be pleased that the European Council has started to look at this problem holistically. The policy decisions taken concern not only the mechanism for relocating refugees, but also the increase in the tightness of the external borders or the increase in assistance in the regions where migrants come from.  International organisations point out that assistance in conflict areas or neighbouring countries is often cheaper and more effective than funding support for refugees arriving in Europe. However, I am afraid that the sum of eur 1 billion may not be sufficient.  The Council conclusions, on the other hand, lacked concrete decisions in relation to return policy. Europe cannot afford to welcome everyone willing to live on our continent – refugees must be separated from economic migrants and the latter should be sent back. It is estimated that of the approximately one million people who will come to Europe this year, more than half are economic migrants. This shows the scale of the next challenge facing the Member States.

Moreover, it has been shown that, although behind-closed-doors consultation may be more effective, its great disadvantage is that it can be used to abuse in external communications by prone, corrupt politicians. Orban is trying to make his domestic political audience believe , unfortunately not without success, that the leaders of the Member States negotiated on his proposals, and that, in the midst of the union's general inertia, measures to promote a solution were taken under his pressure.  I think it is important for the members of the EiT, and in particular President Tusk, to recognise the dangers of this in terms of influencing the Hungarian public and the european public as a whole, and to stand up to statements that discredit both refugees and the EU in the widest public.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the causes of the refugee flows affecting the European Union lie in the terrible conflicts in Syria and Iraq, as well as in the long-standing crises in Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa.  The decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government at their informal meeting on 23 September confirm the strong commitment of the European Union, whether on the internal or external and humanitarian side of this crisis. In very concrete terms, we are in the process of freeing up the resources necessary to refinance humanitarian organizations active on the ground, such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food Programme, to better meet the needs of refugees close to their places of origin in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. In Syria, we remain the main donor in the face of the endless war that this country is going through. We are committed to strengthening the main trust funds to launch concrete projects. This allows us to help refugees in critical areas, such as education or youth employment. I am thinking, of course, of the Madad fund, which was suffering from considerable underfunding, and the emergency fund for Africa. In both cases, it is the response to a common request from the European Parliament and the heads of state or government. At the internal level, the Council, aware of the scale of the crisis and the urgency of providing an effective and rapid response to the humanitarian situation of refugees, has made every effort to treat this issue as a matter of highest priority. For this reason, two extraordinary meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs Council were convened on 14 and 22 September 2015, in addition to the meetings already scheduled by the Presidency, in order to follow up on the guidelines given by the European Council at its meetings in April and June, the European migration agenda presented by the Commission in May and the additional package of measures that the Commission submitted on 9 September.  As Minister for Labour and Employment, as recently as yesterday, at the Ministers' Luncheon, I organised an exchange on the support that the European Union and the Commission can give to the States which currently host the largest number of refugees, to facilitate their integration, to facilitate their access to the labour market, to support language courses , the assessment of their professional qualifications, the schooling of children, etc.  Commissioner Thyssen has presented us with a number of thoughts on the use of funds, particularly from the European Social Fund, to intervene at this level. The Presidency intends to continue, also within the framework of the EPSCO Council, this reflection in order to effectively implement, in a coherent and united way, an approach in the countries that receive the largest numbers of refugees. All these efforts have enabled and must lead to important and significant results in the shortest possible time, including the adoption on 14 September of a Council decision establishing interim measures on international protection for Italy and Greece, which will allow the relocation of a first contingent of 40,000 refugees. At its meeting on 22 September the Council also adopted a second decision to relocate 120,000 people in need of international protection from Italy and Greece or any other Member State that needs it. I am pleased to note that the first hotspots are already operational and I understand that other hotspots will be operational soon. The roadmaps have been submitted by Italy and Greece, they have already been presented at the expert forum organised by the Commission in collaboration with EASO and at the meeting of the Strategic Committee on Immigration, Borders and Asylum on 5 October. At these meetings, the practicalities of implementing relocation mechanisms were discussed in detail. The Council welcomes the excellent cooperation with Parliament in reviewing these decisions and the responsiveness of Parliament. This demonstrates the common will to achieve concrete results in providing refugees with the protection and assistance to which they are entitled, and to the Member States, especially those most at risk, the assistance and assistance they ask for. We also support humanitarian aid to refugees who try to find refuge in the European Union when they cross the southern Mediterranean, especially from Libya. In this context, I would like to underline that we are counting on very concrete results with our partners at the Valletta Summit, whether on the root causes of migration, on refugee protection issues, on the fight against human traffickers or on cooperation on return and readmission. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, as Presidency, we are actively engaged in mobilising Member States and our key partners to achieve our goal of doubling the contribution from the Union budget and reaching an additional EUR 1 billion to support humanitarian organisations engaged in this crisis.  Recently, the Netherlands and Belgium announced additional contributions of 48.5 million and 30 million euros respectively. The United Kingdom has announced an additional 100 million pounds and France and Germany have each announced an additional 100 million euros.  These efforts, which put the European Union on the front line, must also be accompanied by the support of the entire international community. In this regard, we welcome the fact that, as Chair of the G7, Germany has just organised, on the margins of the Ministerial Week of the United Nations General Assembly, an extra event which has resulted in commitments of more than EUR 1.8 billion. As you know, the Commission has already put forward proposals for budgetary adjustment. For our part, as Presidency, we are determined to support this approach in the Council. Of course, we will need the active support of the European Parliament for the rapid implementation of the decisions taken and the necessary budgetary adjustments. I am sure we can count on you in that regard.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 78, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, today we are all put to the test. We are faced with what is arguably the biggest challenge to Europe in a generation. What is being put to the test is our capacity to handle a huge humanitarian crisis. What is being put to the test is our capacity to understand that there will be solutions only at a European level. What is being put to the test is the very fabric of our European Union. What is being put to the test is actually the fundamental values we share, and much that was said this morning testifies to this. I have to note that when people try to argue that those arriving in Europe today are, in the majority, people seeking a better future, not refugees – which is completely unfounded, there are no scientific data – and people say this in this House, I draw some hope from this because they do not want to be seen not to be doing something for real refugees. My hope is that once those in this House who currently reject everything we do understand that we are actually dealing with a majority of real refugees, they will see the fallacy of their ways and come to the conclusion that there are only European solutions here. There is no need to hide from that fact. I say this also:  (Interjection from the floor: ‘Go to the camps and talk to them’) It is being said here – because this is apparently the way people who disagree with you think they can make a point – it is being said behind me here ‘Go and talk to them in the camps’. Well, that is exactly what I did. That is exactly what I did, but apparently you only hear what you want to hear when you talk in the camps. I know that, in this day and age, fear is an important factor in European society. Many European citizens are afraid, and you know what fear has as a characteristic: when you are afraid you go and look for proof that your fear is justified and you are not open to proof that your fear is unjustified. Responsible politics in this situation is not to cater to fear, not to create stereotypes, not to put people in groups, but to come up with solutions to a problem instead of just increasing people’s fears in the hope that it will provide you with more votes at the next election. This is also the time when politicians across Europe will be challenged on whether their integrity still prevails or whether they go for the easy solution of catering to fears in the hope of then gaining political position. I hope we will all be responsible in this phase.  The European Council was responsible last week, by paving the way for decisions that can now be implemented. Let me briefly go through them. They decided last week to strengthen external borders and increase the financial and human resources for our agencies, Frontex, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and Europol, and to increase funding for the EU home affairs funding programmes, with EUR 100 million for emergency assistance to the most affected EU Member States. This is in addition to the EUR 73 million already exhausted. Much of this funding is going to address the immediate humanitarian needs – to help Member States provide the necessary shelter, health, welfare and other specific basic needs of new arrivals.  We speeded up the preparation of the Western Balkan conference next Thursday. We speeded up the roll-out of support teams in the hotspots in the most affected Member States, to identify, register and fingerprint migrants. This is essential to make sure we do indeed distinguish between those who have the right to asylum and those who do not.  It was also decided to uphold, apply and implement the existing Dublin rules and the Schengen acquis; to match the mobilised EU budget contributions with Member State contributions, including notably EUR 1 billion for the UNHCR, the World Food Programme and other agencies to respond to the urgent needs of displaced Syrian refugees in the region; to assist Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan in dealing with the refugee crisis through the help of the Trust Fund for Syria; to increase the funding of the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa; and to speed up preparations for the Valetta Summit on 11—12 November. These are important decisions. Let us implement them. The issue here is not that we do not know what to do; the issue is that, as in other areas, we lack self-confidence. We can handle this – I agree with Chancellor Merkel: ‘Wir schaffen das’ – I have no doubts. We need to address the issue of what I would call also in this area ‘moral hazard’. Member States need to be able to trust that other Member States will do their part.  This is the core issue here, that so-called frontline Member States will do their part in making sure that our external borders are better controlled and that people who arrive are immediately fingerprinted, and that those Member States who are not frontline states will do their part in showing their solidarity with the Member States who bear the brunt of the arrivals. There is an issue here of just doing what we agreed, and then the self-confidence in Europe will increase, and mutual trust will also increase – and that is what we need between Member States. As I said before, winter is coming. I spoke to the High Commissioner for Refugees, António Guterres, yesterday and he said clearly that we know how to, and we certainly can, winter-proof the refugee camps, the tents, the reception centres, but we cannot winter-proof masses of people on the move – and moving in an unpredictable and fast manner. You cannot winter-proof movements of people. In Geneva yesterday our interlocutors welcomed the latest EU steps to mobilise the budget for these purposes. To name but a few: EUR 200 million to the UNHCR World Food Programme and other aid agencies to respond to the urgent needs of displaced persons and refugees in the region; EUR 300 million in humanitarian aid next year and, as you know, we asked Member States to match this and the Heads of State or Government agreed to do that.  I am looking forward to taking stock of these promises at the next European Council and I hope people understand that EUR 1 billion of funding is not too much to ask for in humanitarian aid. In this respect, I am again very grateful to this Parliament, yet again leading by example and fast-tracking the adoption of the budgetary proposals we made last week. This Parliament as an institution has assumed its responsibility in an admirable way. The Trust Fund for Syria, aiming to reach EUR 1 billion, was also welcomed by those frontline states that will need to deal with the approaching winter. Humanitarian aid is our urgency of today. When it comes to humanitarian aid, it is not enough to find necessary funding. You need to put in place necessary help mechanisms, linking manpower and assets. And those challenges are high on the agenda of my colleagues Commissioners Avramopoulos, Stylianides and Hahn, and also Commissioner Andriukaitis, who is working on the health issues. The civil protection mechanism is ready to be activated. We need to do this quickly. We do not want to waste time. A quantum leap in reception capacities in Greece is probably the most urgent priority that we are tackling on a daily basis. President Juncker has put in place people to coordinate the national and European technical assistance resources being mobilised to help Greece. Without reception capacity nothing will work, and we all agree on that. Greece will have a separate programme with UNHCR on this. This needs to be finalised in the coming weeks. Greece needs to return to the Dublin system, and I have to say that I salute the Greek Government for committing to returning to the Dublin system. You will not hear me saying that all is ready for winter but this Commission has identified and proposed all the operational and budgetary measures that are needed internally within the EU and outside our borders. With regard to Turkey, the President has said more than enough: we will continue working on this, and you will also be informed this afternoon about exactly what we will be doing in the next couple of weeks. I think you will agree with me that, while working on the humanitarian situation and sharing the burden with the most affected countries, we should also not neglect the wider issue in relation to managing the situation and the root causes of the situation. The Valletta Summit will be important – however, I will limit myself to referring to what President Juncker has said about that. Refugees, on the run from war and persecution, willing to risk everything for even the chance of a decent life, will continue to flee. They simply have no other option. And we have no other option but to provide a safe haven for them, to protect them and to treat them properly, here in the European Union, as well as in other countries where they arrive. So it is time to rebuild our self-confidence and our mutual confidence in our ability to deal with this most pressing humanitarian issue effectively, and together  Wir schaffen das!", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 79, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Ελισσάβετ Βόζεμπεργκ", "mepid": "125065", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, our debate on the refugee issue, at this time, is directly linked to the previous debate. Quite rightly, you said that the European Union 'has the knife and the sword' to solve this problem. The solution must be found at European level, but the solution is, above all, political. I say this because President Tusk mentioned earlier about the solidarity of the Member States that must be shown and, rightly, about border protection, about the necessary respect for the rules of the European Union.

Sometimes they also need medical or paramedical help. That specific offer is lacking in the camps.  For example, children with disabilities cannot participate in an ordinary class. For example, deaf children need lessons in sign language, blind children need teaching materials in Braille, and so on. Some of the emergency funds allocated should therefore be used specifically to provide a basis of disability-specific support to those people. That is not happening at the moment, or far too little.

The EU is calling the crisis we have in Europe at the moment a refugee crisis, basically to pull on heartstrings and to suit its own political ends. Let me make it clear that the crisis we have in Europe at the moment is not a refugee crisis, it is an economic migrant crisis. (Applause from certain quarters) That is not just my appraisal. It is also that of Robert Fico, the Prime Minister of Slovakia, who has said that 95% of the people who are coming to our continent are not refugees: they are economic migrants. Indeed Eurostat, the EU’s own statistical collecting body, has reported that 85% of the people coming are not from war-torn Syria, but from Pakistan, Albania, Nigeria and the Gambia. So let us, at least, not insult everyone’s intelligence, and let us call this crisis what it is, however politically incorrect you might find that, Mr Timmermans. It is an economic migrant crisis, not a refugee crisis. Mr Timmermans, it is a case of people moving from poor countries to rich countries and in the meantime breaking international law – and you would think we would do something about that, would you not? But, amazingly, we are not doing something about it. Actually we are just encouraging it. Then, of course, there is the security aspect of this total farce. ISIS has already told us that it is going to flood our continent with their Islamist lunatics, so you would think we would be doing something to prevent that. But no, we are doing quite the opposite: we are putting the lives of our own citizens at risk – the lives of people like those here in the gallery. We are putting them at risk by not stopping the boats. The German authorities last week reported that one in three so-called ‘Syrians’ are arriving with fake passports. They are on sale on the Turkish black market for EUR 750. We do not know who these people are! One of the founding principles of the European Union, Mr Timmermans, is freedom of movement of people.

I want to thank this Parliament for its leadership in this issue and for its strong support for the Commission’s position. This is the way forward. If we do what we have now agreed, and we do it swiftly, we will come to terms with this issue and we will show the European population that we can handle this and that Europe is capable of handling this. My third point, in reaction to some of the remarks that were made, is that if you do not want to help refugees, if you do not want to do anything else but push them back at the borders, please say so and do not try to justify it by pretending that the people arriving in Europe are not refugees. That is a lie. (Applause) At least have the integrity to say that you just do not want to help people. Do not say that these people are not refugees. Eighty percent of the people arriving today in Greece can be classified as refugees. That is the reality today. (Heckling) Of course the refugee crisis comes with problems. Nobody denies these problems. These problems will have to be tackled. We have to improve our external border control. We have to be much faster at fingerprinting and swiftly identifying people when they arrive to make sure the people who have the right to asylum are selected. Those who do not have the right to asylum should be returned to where they came from. We need to do all this swiftly and we will be implementing this in the next couple of weeks. Just shouting from the sidelines, saying that it is all bad and people should simply disappear from our radar screens, is not going to provide any solution to this problem.  (Applause) My final remark is this: a number of comments were made about the situation in Hungary. I would like to announce to you that this morning the Commission sent an administrative letter to the Hungarian authorities demanding clarification on a number of issues pertaining to the way they have handled asylum and immigration policies and border control.

Methamphetamine is now probably the most dangerous drug that has destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and families around the world. The Czech Republic is currently the largest illegal producer of meth in Europe, despite the fact that the National Drug Control Centre achieves very good results. However, the problem, which is often perceived as purely Czech, also needs to be looked at through Pan-European optics. A persistent trend in the production of methamphetamine is the extraction of pseudoephedrine from over-the-market medicines, which are sold without any restrictions in some European countries. As the popularity of methamphetamine has increased in recent years, coupled with the increasing production capacity of brewhouses, the amount of toxic waste that ends uncontrollably in water and the wild and poses a significant threat to the environment, animals and human life and health is also increasing.

The European Parliament has proposed, as part of the Cohesion Policy, the implementation of specific measures for Greece, in order to enable funds to be released quickly. Three exceptional measures are proposed: making available to Greece 5% of immediate payments of funds still blocked, increasing EU funding to 100% for the 2007-2013 financing period (instead of co-financing) and improving the increased pre-financing rate of EUR 1 billion for the 2015 and 2016 projects.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today we are talking about a sad story.  This is a very sad story because, as legislators we thought in recent years that we had made a real and active contribution to reducing emissions in the automotive sector, we thought that we had achieved important objectives so that European citizens could live in a cleaner environment, in fact we are faced with something profoundly different, because we have not been able to guarantee citizens better air to breathe. We now have the certainty that our legislative desire was just an illusion, an illusion based on fraud that we were unable to avoid or detect.  It is therefore clear that we now know that the limits on nitrogen monoxide emissions have been deliberately exceeded for many years by one of the largest and most powerful car manufacturers. As chairman of the ENVI Committee, I am therefore concerned, like my fellow Members who will speak after me, and I would like to ask the European Commission whether there have been other pollutants involved, such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide or others, or whether we are just talking about nitrogen monoxide, given the great link between these pollutants.  Is it also true, as we have read in some press articles, that emissions were more than forty times higher than the permitted limits? We want to know the truth, and i therefore call on the European Commission to proceed with the necessary investigations and, above all, to keep the European Parliament constantly informed of the results of the investigations. We would like to thank the Commission for being prepared to come to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, to report immediately after the scandal has been identified, but we would also like to know whether it is true, as stated by many car manufacturers besides Volkswagen, that they have not manipulated car emissions tests. However, we therefore call on the Commission to put them to an independent ballot as well, because what is at stake is very important, since it concerns the health of European citizens.  Mr President, what has happened is also a sad story for another reason. I am referring here to the role of the type-approval authorities. How is it that these authorities have not discovered the existence of illegal mechanisms in such a long period of time? How are these tests carried out and with what tools and equipment? As we all know, who discovered this fraud was an American university, but should we also ask the Member States, which are responsible for the controls, who is responsible for these technical bodies, how is it possible that these cars have passed the type-approval tests? What, then, is the exact role for the European Commission in this area and what does Commissioner Bieńkowska think of the possible establishment of a type-approval or surveillance authority which will, of course, be able to monitor the control and verification operations carried out in the individual Member States?  I am also thinking of the local authorities and cities which are currently failing to meet the required air quality standards and against which infringement proceedings have already been announced by the European Commission, at least now they know what was going on. There was someone who did not respect the rules and they were held, perhaps wrongly, unjustly responsible.  Mr President, Commissioner Bieńkowska, we have therefore discovered in recent days that today's nitrogen monoxide emissions from certain diesel vehicles measured on the road may in fact differ and differ from what is calculated in the laboratory, and that is why the Commission is developing new ways of measuring these emissions, the so-called real drive emission, based on the use of the car under normal driving conditions. With regard to this new test methodology from 2017, I would like to ask whether the Commission can clarify whether it will be based on compliance factors or a sample test.  In conclusion, I hope that this scandal will help to find out to the full what is happening in this area and whether we are dealing with an isolated case or illegal behaviour common to several companies. I wonder, however, why the European Union always has to wait for scandal or tragedy to act. It has happened in the past in the food sector, with BSE to have meat traceability. What has happened is that there has been a need to have thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean in order to react with a European policy and an agenda on migration. Now we are faced with a scandal, did it take this scandal to realise that the system had to change and had to be set up differently?", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2235, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Vicky Ford", "mepid": "96949", "text": "   author. – Madam President, for the vast majority of consumers buying a car is the single biggest purchase they make in their lives after they have bought a home. This Volkswagen scandal is not just about money. It is about health as well.  Cheating the standards brings a massive and fundamental breach of trust. For the market to work properly there must be trust – trust that a service or a good is what the supplier claims it is, trust that it complies with the relevant laws or regulations, trust that your competitors are acting honestly, and trust that official bodies have done their jobs properly. This principle has to apply all across the single market – all across all 28 Member States – and each of these standards must be applied in every country, because once we lose the trust of consumers it cannot easily be restored.  Currently Volkswagen customers face chaos. They do not know if the car that they own is going to be recalled or upgraded or what they will be paid. Consumers who are looking to buy a new car from another company are also very uncertain. They want to know whether or not it is just Volkswagen who has used defeat devices or if there are other companies involved. They want to know why officials did not act sooner. Who knew what? They want to know why this was discovered in the US before the EU. Consumers want answers to all those questions and I agree with them.  We need drivers to use diesel cars and to have confidence that when they purchase one they have made the correct choice. We cannot let the actions of one company tarnish an entire sector. So we need a full investigation, an investigation that people can have trust in, across the entire single market.  I know that it is not possible to regulate away fraud, but proper oversight can minimise it. National regulators are required by law to enforce legislation. If our Member States agree laws, they must implement them because the strength of any approval across the EU, including type approval, is only as strong as the weakest link. Every single national regulator must work to the same high standard. Otherwise, there is a race to the regulatory bottom, and turning a blind eye in one Member State means that those goods can be sent across all 28. So our Member States must work together in a coordinated fashion. We know that the emission tests are already being updated. We have known for many years that the emissions test and fuel efficiency claims do not represent real-world experience. That is why the Commission is already due to announce new testing processes by the end of this year. Indeed, early last month, before this broke out, Commission officials came into my committee to discuss what they were doing, but without any details. The Commission needs to make these announcements soon, because manufacturers need to know what they have to deliver, and they have to deliver in line with the new tests any new cars that are approved after the end of next year. The Commission must also keep Parliament involved. Parliament has a role to scrutinise delegated acts, and 500 million people expect us to do our job properly. I get a bit fed up with secondary legislation being written in the Commission but then arriving in Parliament very much last-minute with some comment saying not to worry as it is just detail. People expect us to do our job, to scrutinise both the primary and the secondary legislation, and we must get the details right. We have to have time to understand it and we have to have time to listen to both consumers and manufacturers, and to expert advice too if necessary. In Parliament we talk a lot about better lawmaking. The Commission is, I believe, trying to deliver better lawmaking. We need to make that happen too and we cannot let this happen again.

We expect a full investigation and the full accountability of those who are responsible.  This has happened while we are negotiating TTIP, which is a very sensitive issue in our relations with the USA, but the case shows that we should not be afraid that TTIP will lower our environmental standards. America shares our standards and perhaps is even more advanced in scrutinising them.  The Industry Committee stressed two years ago that testing must be improved and harmonised, together with tackling misleading information on fuel consumption and environmental performance, which is very important. The issue has not yet been resolved, so the Commission and Member States must also investigate whether the case concerns just one manufacturer or whether we might be facing a much broader problem.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The Committee on Transport and Transport is also affected by this scandal, because we know that climate change will not be stopped without a change in mobility. Transport is responsible for 24% of emissions and road transport in this sector for 72%. That is bad enough. But since 1990 we have achieved a reduction of 32% in industry. Emissions from transport have increased by 28%. In other words, transport is eating up all that has been achieved with billions of our taxpayers' money in other sectors. Therefore, without changing mobility, we will not stop climate change. But we must stop it so that our children and their children have a chance to live on this planet. That is another reason why, in the 2011 White Paper, we decided by a large majority here in Parliament that by 2030 50% of conventional transport should be reduced in urban transport and that by 2050 there should be no conventional drive at all in cities. We then decided that this would be achieved through greater efficiency, new engines, new propulsion materials and new design methods. We have decided that, but not that this will happen through fraud and criminal activity. We must condemn this in the strongest possible terms. This was not a technological deficit. It was a financial deficit. That's why Volkswagen decided, No, we'd rather cheat than be honest – then the car would have become a bit more expensive. The technical revision was there. Unfortunately, it has not been applied. And that has to change! We also voted and agreed on the European Union's transport targets for 2030 and 2050, the Commission's ambitious targets, but we, as the Committee on Transport, did not go far enough. That is why we have said that we cannot take the second and third steps without the first, and we have decided that CO2 emissions must also be reduced by 20% in the transport sector by 2020, based on 1990. We decided on this by a large majority. And now we have a revision of the White Paper with the rapporteur, Wim van de Camp. And he has documented there once again, and we have also decided by a large majority, that the test cycles must be revised and correspond to reality. We do not benefit from the best values in the laboratory, which have nothing to do with reality and the road. That is what we have to take into measure. That is, of course, also the Commission's question. First of all, it also needs to analyse why – since 2008 has been manipulated – why it has not been noticed earlier. You need to analyse what mistakes the Commission may have made. What mistakes have the Member States made? What are the mistakes of the state authorities? This too, all of this must be investigated. And, of course, we want absolute clarification, both in the car industry and elsewhere, because that should not be repeated. That is why we need proposals, and we expect them from the Commission after you have revised all this. What is your proposal for the future, so that such a disaster with criminal activity does not happen again? Because that was fraud on the customer. He thinks my car consumes four litres, but in reality it is six litres. This is also a fraud on the part of the taxpayer, because in many countries the tax on cars is based on CO2 emissions, which we have always advocated. But you can't reverse that. And it is, of course, enormous damage to the environment that we cannot afford. We, also as a committee, of course condemn these criminal activities that have taken place here, and we are afraid that it will also happen in other sectors. Nor do we want to continue to guarantee the use of the loopholes. Many so-called legal loopholes have also been used to reduce emissions. The TRAN Committee wants complete clarification and that such a thing will not happen again in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2238, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, I am grateful for the opportunity to have this point on the agenda and to explain to you the actions of the Commission over the past 10 days, because we face a very difficult case of fraud.  Let me speak frankly: this is fraud committed by one company and this fraud has put at stake public trust in European cars, and has seriously put at stake the credibility of our legal system and its efficiency in protecting consumers and the environment, which is the backbone of the European Union’s actions and regulations. I believe we will be able to overcome it. I thank the European Parliament for giving me this opportunity to share information and also – at the very beginning – I want to say that I am ready to continue providing you with every piece of information about my future actions to ensure that such a fraud will not happen again. The Commission and Member States agreed, at the Competitiveness Council on Thursday 1 October 2015, just last week, to act quickly and to act collectively. This means three things. Firstly, investigating and establishing the facts and enforcing the existing rules – which is what all of you are calling for. Secondly, accelerating the adoption of the regulatory framework formations. And thirdly, changing the approval and surveillance systems so that this cannot happen again. I will speak about each of these in turn and I want you to know that the Commission will play a full role in sorting this out.  Let me begin with the first point: establishing the facts and enforcing the existing rules. This is the point from where we have to start. We must start by establishing the facts.  You ask me how the Commission will investigate any potential wrongdoing. The Commission does not have the power to carry out our own investigation in the automotive sector. We rely on the authorities of the Member States. These institutions are professional. Let us not jeopardise what we have built together so far: a widespread feeling of mutual suspicion is not helping coherent and effective European action. In fact, investigations have already been launched in several Member States and the Commission has encouraged all the others, every Member State and every manufacturer, to do the same – I have sent a letter to all of the Member States. The Commission is providing a platform for the exchange of information between Member States, in the sense that we have already convened several meetings of government and type-approval authorities. We have also discussed this matter in detail, as I mentioned before, at the Competitiveness Council on 1 October 2015. The national authorities are together exchanging information with the Commission about this case and the Commission is also organising a meeting with the national type-approval authorities that will be held on 15 October 2015.  We need, as soon as possible, to have clarification on the extent of the fraud. For instance, the following questions: how many vehicle models are involved; how many vehicles in total; and under which conditions have vehicle sales been banned? And once we have the facts, we must act. As I have stressed several times, we have zero tolerance for fraud. We must send a very clear message today on the enforcement of existing rules, and those rules must be strictly adhered to. Here again, national authorities have a very crucial role to play. We need to be clear about what we will do and when we will do it; what actions will be taken to remedy this situation and when they will be carried out.  We need to restore consumer confidence as quickly as possible – I think this is where the real damage that has been done – and we need to apply the rules even if that means sanctions. We owe this to Europe’s citizens. I have asked Member States to work together on this because I think uncoordinated national action will make things even worse. We will only succeed if we act together. On the second point, regarding accelerating the change in the regulatory framework for emissions, the question was whether we noticed that something was wrong. We noticed that the system of testing emissions in laboratories is not the right one, and the Commission proposed draft regulations on real-driving emission (RDE) testing a few years ago. The first package was voted on in May, but I think we have to accelerate matters. The new legislation will improve the test procedure for directly assessing the regulated emissions of light-duty vehicles under real driving conditions. The new testing procedure will eliminate the possibility of using defeat devices and it will ensure that the regulatory emissions limits are actually met. The second package of the RDE procedure, setting out the exact timing and level of what are called conformity factors, is planned to be voted on this year. We will do it. On the third point, improving the approval and surveillance system so this cannot happen again, where should we act at EU level? Let me list those areas where action is urgently needed and where full support is essential – including the full support of the European Parliament. The existing approval system for motor vehicles in the EU lies with pre-market testing and the approval of vehicles. This is a system that is used almost all over the world, and it has been studied and evaluated in detail for several years. So far, I want to stress ‘so far’, the conclusion of our studies has been that this system has been effective in ensuring safe and environmentally friendly cars on our roads.  It has also ensured that the internal market is fully harmonised and that every time a Member State authority approves a vehicle type it can be bought and registered in 28 Member States. This has obvious advantages for both citizens and industry. Our study’s conclusion also indicated that we can improve the system – and this has to be stressed – especially as regards governance and market surveillance. We have therefore been working on a new Commission proposal for the last years on the EU type-approval system for motor vehicles.  However, in light of the Volkswagen problem, and drawing conclusions from what has occurred, we will analyse our proposal again and will suggest further changes that will prevent similar events from happening. I hope to present the proposal to the College of Commissioners as soon as possible. It will then be presented to you and to the Council, and we expect that our common work will be quick. We expect that the resulting work will contribute to more effective market surveillance, to implementing robust ex-post checks and to improving safeguard measures and recall procedures. Let me say it again: European consumers must be reassured that non-confirmed products are not circulated on the EU market. And finally, I have a message to us all. We need to ask ourselves what lesson we can draw from this fraud and this behaviour. We have to remind companies that they should respect the letter and the spirit of the law, because socially and environmentally responsible companies have been one of Europe’s biggest assets. I hope that we can work together for this to continue to be the truth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2239, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Françoise Grossetête", "mepid": "2025", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, the revelation of the Volkswagen scandal made by the American authorities sounded for everyone, like a thunderbolt in a blue sky. There are still many questions to be solved, but we can already learn from them and, above all, seek the truth. First, fraud, it is of course unacceptable, it must be punished. Volkswagen wanted to cheat, Volkswagen lost. Such is taken who thought to take. It is a real betrayal of consumers because their health is at stake, their environment is at stake, towards the public authorities and all those who, like me, defend a responsible, innovative and job-creating European industry. This is a shameful act that could cast shame on our entire automotive sector and threatens to permanently undermine the credibility of European industry in the world and, among others, across the Atlantic, in the context of the TTIP negotiations. That being said, we must absolutely prevent this scandal of diesel engine fraud from being an oil stain. It would not be the right solution to predict the imminent end of diesel, when many of our low-income citizens are driving diesel vehicles and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are using diesel commercial vehicles. We know that in Europe we have a real technological advance on clean diesel. It would therefore be a mistake today to condemn the diesel industry and the car industry that uses diesel. Of course, Commissioner, you have made a number of proposals to us, we are of course waiting for the probate tests to be carried out as soon as possible in the context of real-life driving situations. I also wonder about the realism of our environmental legislation. Aren't we sometimes too ambitious? Certainly, when it comes to air quality and health, ambition is necessary, but also pragmatism.

Madam Commissioner, the mere fact that it was the EPA in the US and not our national approval authorities in the EU that discovered the defeat devices is really embarrassing, and I do not share your confidence in our national authorities.

Madam Commissioner, therefore we would like to ask you to establish an independent EU type-approval authority. There is also a very inconvenient truth. Even the cars that passed testing in a proper way – or let us presume in a proper way – are polluting much more than they should.

It is true that Volkswagen has manipulated the emission values. But it is wrong, as has been said several times today, that this has something to do with the normal difference between testing and road traffic operations. It is true that we are dealing here with the biggest industrial scandal in German post-war history. It is wrong to put it as typical of the German automotive industry. Because Volkswagen – and I attach great importance to this – is a special case. If the state itself is involved in a company, if trade union officials and politicians have a majority on the supervisory board, if that majority then appoints autocrats to the top, if then politicians also interfere daily in the business of Volkswagen, then a culture of cunning, of looking away, of displacing, of fear and finally of the plotting of customs arises. I would remind you that business union leaders and works councils were bought at company expense with ludicrous privileges and brothel visits. Even without this scandal, Volkswagen was hardly competitive due to excessive personnel costs and long overdue restructuring. And now Volkswagen is a restructuring case.

We still do not know whether this is just the tip of the iceberg, but all signs point in that direction.  Obviously the companies involved are the first to blame. They deliberately manipulated the tests. They should not be rewarded for these illegal actions by again watering down the European standards or allowing further delay in their enforcement. So firstly, I expect the Commission to now stop stalling the process and to have a new real-driving emissions (RDE) test up and running within six months.  I also expect the Commission to change the surveillance system. The current national approach apparently is not working. Therefore, a European independent oversight body must be established with the means to test cars itself.  But there is another very important political question that has to be answered. Were the Commission and certain Member State authorities aware of the cheating? The 2007 regulation explicitly prohibits the use of defeat devices, so their existence has been known for more than a decade. Several reports, including a report from the Commission’s own research body, the JRC, reported unexplainable differences between real emissions on the road and the laboratory test results. Why then did the Commission never initiate any investigations into this matter?  I ask the Commission here today: was the Commission aware of the practices by the car industry?

The falsified results in emissions tests have been reported to be up to 40 times the legal maximum. Volkswagen is by far the biggest car manufacturer in the EU market, with a market share of around 25%, but it is not the only one.

As environmental, consumer and health policymakers in this House, over the nearly ten years we have made the car regulations for clean air or climate protection or fuel efficiency, we have become accustomed to the fact that the representatives of the car industry always see all our rules as an attack on their corporate strategies. What I did not expect, despite all the negative experiences with lobbyists from all car companies – and that was the only surprise in recent weeks – was that a company as large and as strong as VW, if it cannot prevent an ambitious test cycle, systematically deceives authorities with criminal energy for years. For me, this is still something i can't believe. I have become accustomed to this old thinking that environmental policy is seen as an imposition. But I cannot understand this willingness to cheat and to crime. What led to this? I would also like to take a direct critical look at the Commission, but also my German Federal Government. I do not know of any other area of regulation in which the Federal Government has so systematically tried to protect the interests of German corporations, at least against regulation from Brussels. Over and over again, the auto chancellor – we not only have a climate chancellor in Germany, we also have an auto chancellor – has finally advocated that we have lower limit values, that we still have not had the test cycle that we have discussed for a long time. And I believe that this kind of aggressive protection also creates a hubris in companies, as it is, that we can be as criminal as VW has now admitted. What is to be done now? I think the Commission should admit that all this has not come out of the blue as it is portrayed. The Federal Government, like the European Commission, has been repeatedly reminded that the test cycle is not working. And this applies not only to the diesel Euronorms, but also to fuel efficiency targets or to climate protection targets. So: don't be naive, go to the verification of the facts! I think that what you have said today is a far cry from what is necessary. We are putting jobs in Europe at risk through weak action and weak targets.

The damage to the procedure will be done by many. The damage will be on the one hand and primarily with the consumers. The damage also lies with the environment, as we have heard many times today.

It was wrong to do so, and it should rightly face appropriate and proportionate penalties, but we must understand the regulatory environment in which this scandal has emerged. The truth is that legislators were consumed by climate hysteria and carbon phobia and as a result we pushed car owners and the auto industry towards diesel, which was seen as a lower emissions fuel. In fact its CO2 emissions are only marginally below those of petrol, and, in any case, CO2 is not a pollutant. It is a natural non-toxic gas which is essential to life on earth. But as we are now realising, diesel’s other emissions – SOx and NOx and particulates – are highly toxic, and our dash for diesel has done more harm than good.  Volkswagen was trying to follow the pressure by moving to diesel power but found that it was unable at the same time to meet emissions targets, so it decided to cheat. It was wrong to do so, but so were we as legislators wrong to impose conflicting and contradictory demands on the industry. I see a parallel here with our ill-judged rush to promote biofuels before we understood the issue of energy inputs to agriculture and the impact of indirect land-use change. By mandating 10% biofuels and then rowing back later, we sent confused signals to industry and caused great damage to investors.

Another point that we need to address is that we must finally stop laboratory tests and let proper tests take place, which are also really meaningful.

It is not a question of demonising diesel, nor is it about demonising car production as such. This is a very serious case of economic crime and deliberate fraud, which in this case affects 11 million motorists worldwide, eight million of whom are in the EU. And it is indeed the case that the NOX values have been exceeded by up to forty times. In this case, I can only say that Mr Eickhout has already said that we have 80 milligrams per kilometre, which are allowed, in the United States only 31 milligrams, and that has just been exceeded several times. That's something that can't be done at all. That is why we need to do something. The question now is, what should be done? First of all, we must ensure that there is a truly complete and transparent investigation and that we find out who is really responsible for this. That is where we are now; you just have to see that.  The second is the tests. It is actually the case – as we know, we have known for a long time – that the laboratory tests that we have at the moment to certify the types do not really reflect the values that we really have in serious driving behaviour. That is why we in Parliament have been calling for these tests, which take place under real driving conditions, for some time. Then you need a mobile trailer that measures this. Anything is possible. We need this as soon as possible. I agree with all my colleagues on this. But one thing that really scares me is the story that we now have with this scam. It was really already 2014 that students, as part of their university studies, found that there is a discrepancy between what is written on it and what comes out. That is what you could say. As a result, VW has even ordered a recall of 500,000 cars in the United States. So, I have to say, I didn't notice anything here at the time, and that's something that can scare you, that we didn't know. Then the same cars were tested again later, and then you really realized how big the manipulation is.

Today there was a company meeting in Wolfsburg, at which the new VW boss said: \"More needs to be saved\", and the works council chief immediately added \"no jobs are affected yet\" – yet. Dieselgate is in fact a super-GAU for the consumer, for the industrial location europe and for VW itself, which may even be a case of reorganisation. The new VW management has promised clarification, transparency, information and damages. At the same time, confidence in the brand must be restored, and this fraud and ethical misconduct must be punished. That is one side of the coin. The other side of the coin is a technical side, as has been mentioned several times today. For years and decades, attempts have been made to bring European clean diesel technology to the market in the USA, small and medium-sized efficient diesel engines with good technology. Time and again, it has been possible to reduce nitrogen levels for passenger cars in the USA, whereas they have always been held up for trucks. Previous speakers have said: why now? Why in the US? That should be questioned. The fact is that clean diesel technology is a clean technology, a European technology that achieves peak values in both the minimisation of pollutants and the reduction of CO2. Every second car registered in Western Europe is diesel. Diesel is a technology of the future, as is e-mobility. And as far as exhaust gas tests are concerned, differences between laboratory results and values from practical tests, i.e. driving tests, are technically conditioned and a result of more than 20 years old measurement methods that are no longer state of the art.

It turns out that we're generally deceived. One, possibly, several car manufacturers' firms have deliberately cheated on technology to supposedly meet the standards – but don't actually meet.

Diesel cars marketed in the United States emitted 5 to 35 times more nitrogen dioxide than the rate allowed by U.S. standards.  The issue is addressed only from an ideological and environmental point of view, whereas it is primarily a technical issue. I would like to recall a basic law of thermodynamics: any combustion causes emissions, everything is only proportional to the different gases emitted, but pollution remains. A technical precision: to make more efficient engines, you have to increase the rate of combustion in the cylinders. As a result, the vehicle uses less fuel per kilometre, releases less oil that is badly burned and gains acceleration.  Volkswagen diesel engines no longer produce carbon monoxide, which is beneficial for health and the environment, but a lot of nitrogen oxides, which is more critical, of course. This gets to the heart of the problem, because carbon monoxide turned nitrogen dioxide into simple nitrogen, which is a perfectly harmless gas. The father of modern chemistry, Lavoisier, said 250 years ago: \"Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed\".  What are Volkswagen's wrongs? The fault of its engineers was to produce powerful engines producing low carbon dioxide and a lot of nitrogen dioxide, when they claimed otherwise.  From a legal point of view, it is a big scandal, but from an environmental point of view, what they have done is neutral. U.S. standards are impossible to meet for small cars and have not been set to protect the environment but to undermine the irresistible rise of the European Volkswagen Group, which in July 2015 became the world's leading manufacturer.  In short, Volkswagengate is an outstalring of the economic war waged by the United States and a sector of European industry. The analysis must therefore be technical, even chemical and strategic.

One of the world's largest engine factories is located in Hungary. Audi produces engines here, including some two million tricky units that the Volkswagen group recently unveiled. The factory did not have sufficient capacity, so Audi was committed to expanding and looking at a Natura 2000 site as a site. Given that Audi accounts for nearly 10% of Hungarian GDP, it has not encountered much regulatory resistance. One civilian environmentalist questioned the legality of the investment. He was initially tried out of court by Audi, then trickily brought to justice and sent to prison. Since then, the innocent Audi has been found to have produced millions of cheating engines, the Natura 2000 site has been destroyed, compensatory measures have failed, the court has sentenced Ferenc Bag to three years in prison, and Audi and Volkswagen remain the proud owners of the European environmental management standard ISO 14001.

Unlike the Commissioner, I do not think that this scandal is limited to one firm, nor is it a scandal about diesel engines. This is a scandal about the credibility and the reputation of European regulation. For many years, we have accepted the manipulation of the measurement of official consumption – the consumption that is used for the purposes of regulation, for tax authorities and for consumers. We have also known about it from other sources, for example from the Mind the Gap report that was published in 2013. As a consequence, we were running a higher health risk and we forced consumers to accept higher running costs for their cars. So what should we do about it? First of all, I believe that we should consider introducing a new standard created by the United Nations – called the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Testing Procedure (WLTP) – maybe sooner than the end of 2017, at least as an alternative measure of consumption. At the same time, we must be quite sure that there will be no manipulation of the test and that the cars that are used are the same as those being driven by consumers. Generally speaking, we should improve regulations and the enforcement of regulations and ensure the consistency of policy. If we opt for regulation – and I do not think we should do this as often as we have done in the past – we should insist on it being complied with and not undermine or question the regulation, except in the case of cheating. Lastly, let me mention consistency. If we believe that diesel engines can be more dangerous to health, I am still puzzled as to why we are supporting diesel cars with the low cost of diesel.

I think it was very useful and valuable for both sides. I can assure you that I share emotion about the credibility of European industry, about cheating on consumers, about preventing jobs and about the credibility of our environmental ambitions. I really feel the sense of urgency here. We have to act very quickly. There is one point that has to be clarified; I will refer to the others later on. The Commission did not receive any information before the official information disclosed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and no information was received by us from the EPA nor from any Member States. On the contrary, we contacted the EPA after they revealed their statement. The Commission took initiatives to resolve this crisis. In the past 20 years we have made great progress in reducing polluting emissions in the EU. In the last years, for the first time in 2010-2011, the Commission has concluded that the test cycles that we developed in the 1990s, in the beginning of the whole process, are not adequate anymore and that they are not able to reflect the emissions produced in real driving conditions.  Let me just touch upon the Joint Research Centre (JRC) analysis that we conducted then. All Joint Research Centre studies were made available on the internet. The Joint Research Centre studies did not check for defeat devices. It was not part of the studies. The JRC only indicated that defeat devices could be one of the reasons for big differences between emissions in the laboratory and those on the roads. Nothing more, and only this.  We have therefore made efforts to develop new test cycles that can indeed reflect real driving conditions. Work has progressed. It took a lot of time because they are very detailed technical issues but the work is almost complete, and it has to be completed in the fastest possible time. But let us not under-evaluate it when we are facing the current difficult and serious situation. We have to approve and implement new rules as quickly as possible and we need your support on this. At this moment we are analysing or finalising the analysis on how to improve the internal market in the framework of internal market strategy and in the case of the automotive sector we will propose soon a change of the rules on the approval of market surveillance. We will probably want to establish a new European instrument, on an institutional and European level, to check whether EU type-approval systems are implemented properly at the national level.  However, also for the internal market, let us not question what has worked well. What we need now are cool heads and strong action, and I am really counting on you here. I want to make sure that I will do everything in my capacity, firstly to restore the confidence of the consumers in the automotive industry in Europe, and secondly to ensure adequate compensation for the citizens who have been affected by this fraud.

The second is that this Europe is transparent, super partes and third in relation to the interests at stake.

It is therefore a good thing that criminal investigations have also been launched as soon as possible in order to establish responsibilities, and it seems appropriate in any case to review the entire emissions testing system.

Does this mean the end of diesel? I do not think the technical possibilities of reducing the amount of NOx and particulate matter through the specificity of injection and catalytic elimination, as well as the reduction of aromatic hydrocarbons from gases emitted by diesel engines are large. What to do? - New diesel cars should be tested not only during approval but also during the warranty period for Euro-6 compliance both at the test bench, i.e. 400 mg/kWh and while driving, i.e. 0,08 g/km; - non-compliance with Euro-6 standards during the warranty period should be compensated to users; - The Fix Clause should be extended to all EU countries in order to activate the innovation potential of SMEs to fight poisonous emissions, especially in central and eastern European countries, where millions of poisonous cars are registered.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2347, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Maria Grapini (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124785", "text": "  in writing. – The crisis created by the Volkswagen case in Europe has long-term effects and many of them have already been mentioned.

For this reason, emission limits for nitrogen oxides (NO), particulate matter emissions (PN/PM), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (CH) have been defined for cars, parcels and lorries through Euro standards. In addition, the maximum emission value for greenhouse gas carbon dioxide has been set since 2012. It has long been known that there are major differences between official laboratory measurements and actual values measured in traffic. For example, nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel cars have been seven times higher in traffic than in official laboratory measurements.

The situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate. The number of internally displaced civilians has increased. In several areas – notably in a number of Benghazi neighbourhoods – we are facing a serious humanitarian crisis. Health and educational services have been disrupted: many hospitals and schools are now barely functioning. Oil production is at its lowest, cash reserves are fast being depleted and the government is cutting subsidies. The Libyan dinar has tragically devalued. As a result, there have been shortages of basic goods such as flour, and the price of bread and other staples has climbed.  The security situation has also deteriorated. The ceasefires established locally are welcome but are not enough. There is little law or order. In many cities crime takes place with impunity. This has also facilitated the continued trafficking of migrants by criminal gangs. Libya’s southern border is essentially open. Too many lives are put at risk at sea in unsafe boats.  More and more Libyans themselves are trying to move abroad. Both Tunisia and Egypt have been very welcoming and supportive but many Libyan families there, having used up most of their savings, find it impossible to make ends meet. The majority of Libyans are sick of the conflict. The war has only benefited terrorist groups like Daesh. They represent a threat that cannot be ignored. They prosper thanks to the war and the divisions of Libyan society. When they do not manage to ally with local militias, they struggle to keep control on the ground. Last summer they lost Derna but they managed to put down a rebellion in Sirte, a key city on the motorway connecting Tripoli and Benghazi, and the terrorist threat extends not just to Libya but to neighbouring countries. This is yet another reason to push for a national unity government – a government that can put the greatest number of militias under the authority of the state institutions.  There has been progress in the political process. The UN special envoy, Bernardino León, with our full and active support, is doing all he can to bring together the government of the National Assembly in Tobruk and the rival GNC in Tripoli. Last week, in New York at the UN General Assembly, the international community showed its unanimous support for Leon’s efforts, in front of representatives of both factions and of civil society. We urged both sides to sign the negotiated agreements.  In New York we witnessed something new and encouraging, finally. The whole international community, including all Libya’s neighbours, shared the same views on the way forward. This is in part a result of the active lobbying by the European Union and its Member States. The European Union has played an important role in getting the process this far. We have worked day and night – literally – to support the perspective of a government of national accord. Now the international community is united on this: it is the Libyans who have to take responsibility now and form a government to put an end to their country’s collapse.  We know very well that even if a government of national accord were formed, change in Libya would not happen overnight. It might take time for the situation to improve, even if we get all the main parties to sign this agreement. But it would create an opportunity for improvement. It will not be a conclusion, but a starting point.  Let me set out what the European Union’s strategic objectives are and the action we are currently taking – and preparing to take – to achieve them. We want security, stability, accountable government and the rule of law in Libya. The people there deserve to live in peace and have their human rights respected. We want the Libyan economy to flourish once again, and also their commerce with the European Union, and we want the traffickers who prey on the desperate to be finally brought to book.  Our initial efforts to help Libya establish control of its borders and build stronger institutions can only start once we have a deal and we have a new government to work with. But we stand ready, as we pledged to all parties in New York last week, to launch a support package worth EUR 100 million as soon as a political agreement is reached.  This would include a range of measures funded from the European Union’s Programme Budget for Libya as well as the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP). This money will help rebuild Libya’s institutions. It will encourage dialogue between the country’s different groups, support local governance, civil society and of course the media. It will help allow people to get their lives back to normal, helping with the delivery of basic services, including health. We will assist the ministries most concerned with helping to manage migration. We will support SMEs and employment opportunities to give a chance to Libya’s youth and put the country back on track. This will be in addition to the humanitarian aid we are already providing for the most urgent needs of the most vulnerable people. We are undertaking planning work to help provide a secure environment for a government of national accord and the European Union is assisting the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) with a planning cell based in Tunis. We are also working with the UN on longer term planning to assist the new government in other sectors and we intend to play a prominent role in all the joint working groups. Working groups from both the international community and the Libyan Government are being set up right now. But now it is up to the Libyan parties to make a move: the decisive one. No—one can take this decision in their place. I know how much this House has always been supportive of a political agreement. I am sure it will continue to play a key role to help the parties reach a stable solution. It is now high time that parties show leadership, take on their responsibilities and sign the agreement. It is time for Libya to get back on its feet.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time since 2011, Libya has a roadmap for a full transition.

The various parties must now take responsibility, not only for Libyans but also to put an end to a situation that makes the country a hotbed of threat to regional and international security. International pressure must be maintained from all sides. As you said, Commissioner, the time is no longer for the negotiation of terms but for responsibility, to get to work in a government of national unity.

Let us not let go of our support for the Malian transition, whose future is also linked to the situation in Libya, particularly in the fight against terrorism and trafficking.

Finally, I insist that the European Union and the United Nations continue to focus their efforts and support the various initiatives to bring the peace process to the local level, including women and minorities. Even more so in Libya than elsewhere, the construction of peace and a state is based on local power.

On the situation in Libya, we must once more repeat ourselves. We have said it many times in this House, deadline after deadline: no more time can be lost. But unfortunately every single time the end of the tunnel seems to be reachable the final agreement on the unity government does not see the light. This is not a joke. This cannot be a matter of personal interests: it is about the fate of an entire country, the fate of an entire people, and practically the fate of an entire region.  The future and the stability of the entire region are somehow connected to how things will evolve in Libya. Daesh does not lose time, it does not wait, it grows and spreads where it finds fertile soil and from there it tries to destabilise the region. The EU and the whole international community cannot afford a failed state in Libya, but more importantly those who really care about Libya and about the Libyans cannot afford once again a failure of the peace plan.  Libya is today in the hands of the Libyan people and their leaders. Violence and the aggravating humanitarian crisis must come to an end. As the High Representative has said so many times, the EU stands ready – and the Commissioner has just mentioned how Europe can help any national unity government in Libya.  In this regard, it is important to find an agreement that brings all sides together, but let us be realistic: no agreement can be perfect for all sides. Everybody must give something up. This is about compromises. Once again there is on the table a peace plan brokered by the UN Special Representative, and there is now a new deadline. This must be the very last one. Should that not be the case, the Libyan people will be the ones who will have to pay the price if the agreement fails.

Today we are talking about Libya, but let us say frankly, countries such as Libya, Somalia, Yemen and others are unfortunately now without their own statehood. There are no more governments in these countries with which we can seriously talk, and that is the cause of the problems in these countries. On Libya, the context is much more complex due to clashes between factions, ethnic groups and popular traditions, which have been responsible for a long and bloody civil conflict. In such a situation, it is not easy to find reliable interlocutors. The Parliament of Tripoli is in fact hostage to a large number of oltranzist and turkish-type members of parliament, military leaders claim their legitimacy to power and the Government of Tobruk is in fact run by Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, we are now dealing not with a dictator, but with more dictators.  In this serious situation, the UN has played its part with Bernardino León, who has perseveredly initiated a series of important meetings aimed at repairing the political fabric torn apart by a fratricidal war. Europe must now give even stronger support to the UN initiative by seeking to achieve the objective of forming a government. The delicate agreements reached at the end of September to be lasting must be monitored day by day. That is why we must work as a Europe to ensure that León's work continues if possible.

There is an urgent need for a government of national unity to finally get to work.  The threat of Daesh is spreading more than ever in Libya. There are now 5,000 Islamic State fighters in the country, including controlling the coastal city of Sirte. The attacks on the port of Sadra and on Benghazi show, unfortunately, the dynamism of the terrorist organization in Libya.  On the strength of this observation, I believe that the return of a State capable of controlling its borders, of defending its territory is an absolute necessity.

There are many important efforts made in recent months with the various parties involved to facilitate the path to a political solution in the country. I would like to highlight the role of the United Nations and the special representative in this task. Since 20 September there has already been a proposal for agreement on the table, which is a sufficient basis for consensus. The situation on the ground calls for an urgent solution and no further details are appropriate. It is time for responsibility; it doesn't make much sense to continue to review a proposal that already contains, as I said, basic elements for the parties' consensus. I don't think any further delays are appropriate. The Skhirat process must be successfully completed, finalized. The turn of the Libyans has therefore come: they must take the reins of their own future, declare a ceasefire and appoint a government of national unity. It will have the important task of tacking fundamentalist radical terrorism and combating the many illicit traffickings that flow through the country and the entire region. Libya is a very important Mediterranean country, with a prominent geographical location and immediate neighbour of the European Union. What happens there affects many of us. The consequences of the power vacuum in the country are also evident in the trafficking of people whose aim is to cross the Mediterranean. I hope that Operation Sophia, which is just beginning tomorrow, will help to stop the mafias from acting so cruelly. The situation in Libya also has a clear impact on the already complex problem of the Sahel.

It is a good time for the European Union to re-entrust its international leadership in efforts to abolish capital punishment and for a universal moratorium on executions. Where are we? Well, there's good news—few—and a lot of bad news. I'm going to start the hard way. Fifty-eight countries in the world still maintain the death penalty in their legal system. Twenty-two of them carried out executions in 2014. Some states apply the death penalty to an alarmingly high number of people. The information, by the way, is very difficult to add, because there are countries that do not provide data on their executions. This is the case for China and Vietnam, very important countries, practically partners of the European Union. They hide information that we should strongly demand, because, moreover, the lack of data on China destroys any statistics we need to make a real assessment of the application of the death penalty in the world. So, this is my first conclusion: the European Union must require the countries with which it maintains important relations certain data on the number of executions that occur under its civil and military laws. Executions in countries with data decreased in 2014 by 20% compared to 2013. In some specific countries, however, executions have not only not declined, but have increased in the same period of time. The dishonor for executions is headed by Iran, with 289 executions announced in 2014, and Saudi Arabia, with 130 executions that same year. By the way, our most precious ally, the United States of America, is way up in the death penalty implementation table—35 executions in 2014. Of the 607 people executed in 2014, 70% were in only three countries: Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia. In 2014, the United States of America, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Pakistan executed people with mental, physical and intellectual disabilities. The second part of my speech I want to dedicate to what we call the 'global death row', that is, those who have been sentenced and who have not yet been executed: the condemned who wait. Nearly 30% more people were sentenced to death in 2014 than in 2013. Thus, the global death row not only does not diminish, but increases. And we also think that the actual data is far superior to those we know. Egypt, with 509; Nigeria, with 659; Pakistan, with 231, and Bangladesh, with 142, top the conviction rankings in 2014. Egypt and Nigeria record a huge increase in the number of these convictions. Our ally, the United States of America, is back high in the sentence table, with 72 death sentences in 2014. Worldwide, more than 19,000 people were sentenced to death by the end of 2014, and of them 8,500 in Pakistan alone, a country that, as you know, has lifted the moratorium to which it had committed. This afternoon's debate was driven by political groups in this Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights. We want to know what measures the European Union has put in place to advance the abolition of the death penalty and, in particular, in its bilateral relations with the countries that maintain it, especially those in which convictions are being increased. Personally, I would also like to know to what extent we are prepared to push from the institutions of the European Union. Are we even willing to sacrifice our negotiation of agreements with some countries to demand moratorium and abolition? Are we ready? Some countries are very different from us and it will be very difficult to reach agreements with them, but some are very similar. Some share our vision: for example, the United States of America. I believe that we are entitled to add — and we can afford it — to the difficulty of the TCE negotiation the moratorium and abolition of the death penalty. You see, it's about saving lives. It is about the European Union helping to save lives, fulfilling its commitment to saving lives.

No state should have a right to decide on the life and death of its citizens. We all believe that, and I am quoting, ‘a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation’. These are the words pronounced by Pope Francis in front of the US Congress recently. Since 1983, the ‘no’ to capital punishment is part of the acquis communautaire, it is part of who we are. It is, then, an honour to address this plenary debate only days away from 10 October, the 13th World and Europe Day against the death penalty. The end of the death penalty is something that is worth fighting for. Let us not forget our own history. Still in the 1970s executions took place in Western Europe and I remember that in one of the big countries a Socialist president abolished the death penalty in 1982. Behind the Iron Curtain executions took place till the late 1980s but today the European Union is 100% free from capital punishment. Things can change. We can and must be a force for this change. So we have to be clear on one thing: never be afraid to raise the issue of abolition as part of our external action. It must be a cornerstone of our own European foreign policy. Ten years ago only 59 countries had fully abolished the death penalty. Now there are 101 of us. Ten years ago, 41 countries carried out executions. In 2014 the number went down to 22, a lot less, although still too many. Many countries have ended capital punishments in practice. Others have taken steps to narrow the scope of the death penalty. Today 140 countries are abolitionist in law or in practice. However, the grim side of the statistics is that still in 2015 thousands of people were executed or sentenced to death and thousands of people are on death row worldwide. And the number of death sentences went up between 2013 and 2014, a scary statistic. You mentioned it in your presentation. The abolition of the death penalty worldwide requires all our best energies, all our political commitment. The use of the death penalty for drug offences is a very emblematic and cruel aspect of death penalty use. The international human rights law is clear: drug crimes do not constitute most serious crimes for which capital punishment may be prescribed. Unfortunately, many Asian countries still retain the death penalty for those crimes, including as a mandatory form of punishment. In Iran at least 75% out of this year’s 660 executions have been related to drug crimes. On a smaller but still significant scale, the same happens in Saudi Arabia and other countries. But this is not the only worrying trend. The death penalty is still applied for crimes which again fall outside the category of most serious ones. This includes economic crimes, apostasy, adultery or even sexual relationships between consenting adults. Furthermore, despite explicit international law provisions, some countries sentence and even execute minors and mentally disabled persons. We also cannot ignore the fact that many death sentences are the products of unfair trials, often without appeals, guarantee or clemency procedures. Some countries resort to the cruellest of execution methods such as public beheadings or crucifixions, and many refuse to notify the families of death row inmates prior to executions. Let there be no doubt the EU is a leading actor in the abolitionist cause. Abolition is embodied in strong, rigorous and effective EU guidelines on the matter. The fight against the death penalty features as a top priority in the new action plan on human rights and democracy which we adopted last July. Throughout 2015 the EU has used all diplomatic tools to advance the cause of worldwide abolition. We condemn the continuing extensive use of the death penalty in parts of the world some of which are at our doorstep. Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, Belarus, Egypt, Japan, Singapore, China, Vietnam and the United States of America were a particular focus of attention. More than 30 statements were issued and demarches were carried out in many other countries, based on the minimum standards defined by international law and the EU guidelines on that penalty. We have been the most vocal advocate of abolition worldwide. Still, I know some of you believe the EU has not always been as loud as it should be. Let me be frank: condemnation is important but it is often not enough. Ultimately, I believe there is no alternative to engagement with those who do not share our views and values. This is the most effective contribution we can give to the cause of abolition. For this reason, we are intensifying our dialogue with the most fervent retentionist countries at all levels. We are constantly stepping up efforts, especially in countries where there is a spike in executions or the reintroduction of capital punishment, sometimes after decades of moratorium. Our individual human rights country strategies have identified the abolition of the death penalty as a top priority in all retentionist countries. Our political or dedicated human rights dialogues constantly feature the issue on their agendas, even when we meet with like-minded countries such as the United States or Japan. Let me assure you that the question of the death penalty is raised with all interlocutors concerned, beyond any strategic considerations. We are talking to our counterparts in Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and also other countries, and we make it clear that the death penalty is not a remedy to terrorism or criminality, or a question of justice for the victim’s family. We will keep on this double track: challenge and engage. Bilateral relations are not the only forum for raising this kind of issue. We are also exploring our regional connections. For example, we are conscious that Africa represents the biggest concentration of countries which are abolitionist in practice, and it could potentially become the next death-free continent after Europe. This is why the EU actively supported the recent steps taken by the African Union towards the adoption of an additional protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the abolition of the death penalty. We are currently planning a regional campaign on the Asian continent with the aim of animating the public debate on the question of the right to life and human dignity. On an even bigger stage, the EU has worked extensively on the United Nations General Assembly resolution on a moratorium on executions. I am proud to say that, thanks to the EU’s extensive lobbying and support, the moratorium was adopted in December 2014 with an unprecedented number of 117 votes in favour and a record number of 95 co-sponsors. The EU can be a beacon for abolitionists worldwide but we need to build partnerships on a global scale to succeed, and our success on the moratorium tells us something; we are not alone in this fight. Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity to express my gratitude for the European Parliament’s constant and fervent dedication to the abolitionist cause. This is reflected in numerous resolutions and dedicated debates but also in missions in third countries where honourable Members do not shy away from raising the issue of executions, even with the most difficult interlocutors. We can count on a global network of partners advancing human dignity, and the global moratorium on the death penalty is at the core of our foreign policy. This is about the foundations and the fundamental values of Europe, and we will keep engaging with our partners on this issue for a world where no state can dispose of the life of its citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2415, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I would like to inform you, ladies and gentlemen, that Members of the European Parliament cannot use the 'blue card' procedure against representatives of the Council, but they can, of course, be against other members of Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2416, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Lars Adaktusson", "mepid": "124990", "text": "  On the other: Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr According to Amnesty International, most executions are taking place today in Communist China.

As with Islamic State, executions are carried out through beheadings and crucifixions. To take note of the stories and images of these executions is a study of evil and barbarism. At the same time, the issue of the death penalty cannot be simplified to be about the procedures alone. The fundamental issue for any rule of law must be human dignity. Based on the Judeo-Christian ethic on which our civilisation is based, criminals should be punished, atone for their actions and then given another chance. Society condemns the crime, but not the criminal. The death penalty does not make this distinction. The death penalty violates the fundamental principle of the right to life. As the European Parliament today celebrates the thirteenth World Day against the Death Penalty, it is important to highlight the values on which the European Union is based and our duty to always place human dignity at the forefront on the basis of those values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2417, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Pier Antonio Panzeri", "mepid": "28365", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the death penalty is the cruellest, most inhuman and degrading punishment, it violates the right to life and, whatever form it takes, it remains a violent punishment that cannot have a place in today's criminal justice system.  In many countries, governments justify the use of the death penalty by arguing that it is a deterrent to violent crime, makes society safer, reduces drug-related crime, is enforceable because it is supported by most public opinion and provides the best cost-effective cost-effective solution to violent crime. Many argue that the abolition of the death penalty causes a higher crime rate, but studies in Canada, for example, refute this theory. In 2003, 27 years after the abolition of the death penalty in Canada, the murder rate had fallen by 44%.  Far from making society safer, the death penalty has proved to have a brutalising effect on society, being the extreme sanction that a state can impose on a person, serves only to approve the use of force and to persist in the cycle of violence. Once criminals are aware that they have committed a capital crime they no longer have any interest in reducing their potential, on pain of not committing new murders or crimes. If, for example, armed robbery involves the death penalty, the robber has nothing to lose in killing any witnesses during the escape attempt.  At the same time, it should be remembered that the use of the death penalty for drug-related offences is a violation of international law. Countries that put people to death for drug-related crimes include Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, China, Iran, Malaysia and Singapore, and there is no clear evidence that the use of the death penalty for such crimes acts as a more effective deterrent than long-term detention.  I believe that politics must assert its leadership by putting human rights first, opposing the death penalty and explaining to its voters why these actions cannot be taken by a state. Research by Amnesty International reports that public support for the death penalty is mainly based on a desire to be free from crime. And here, too, surveys conducted in the United States, for example, show that support for the death penalty fell from 65 % to 48 % when life imprisonment was proposed as an option.  Finally, society cannot accept violence and the sacrifice of human rights as a cost-cutting measure. The decision to take away a human life should not be based on economic reasons. Using the death penalty to reduce the prison population is a vain argument. The United States, for example, has a prison population of two and a half million people, of which 3 000 have been sentenced to death, if they were all convicted and killed it would not change anything compared to the prison population.

The European Union is defined by its values and democratic principles. We must be a key player in ending the death penalty around the world, because we cannot tolerate barbarism. And on the eve of World Day Against the Death Penalty, it is up to us to set an example for all those countries that sentenced nearly 2,500 people to death in 2014.  We must also be exemplary with ourselves. Under no circumstances should any Member State consider reintroducing the death penalty in Europe: it would violate the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union. It's a monumental task and we can't carry it out alone. That is why we need the United States to complete the path to total abolition in all its states and to deal commonly with us to make this practice disappear completely. According to Amnesty International, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia are on the podium in executions. In China, the figures remain state secret. Saudi Arabia makes extensive use of public executions: Ali Mohamed al-Nimr, who was arrested at the age of 17 for demonstrating and asking for democracy for his country, is sentenced to beheaded to death. But let me tell you about Iran. In the first half of this year, rohani's so-called \"moderate\" government has executed nearly seven hundred people: three people a day.

Countries that had decided on a moratorium resumed executions, such as Pakistan and Indonesia. Worse, Senegal, which had abolished the death penalty, is now trying to restore it, which would be a first and therefore a dramatic breach. Others, who are among those who practice the most capital punishment, see the number of executions increase, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia. The fight against drugs, but also against terrorism, serves as a pretext for the increase in executions after summary trials, as we have seen in Egypt. Countries that were thought to be immune to this have reinstated the death penalty in this area, as Tunisia has just done, where a moratorium has been in place since 1991.  Our countries are not immune to going backwards, as the statements of Viktor Orban last May showed. Too many people are surfing on unhealthy populism.

Unfortunately, in some countries, there has been a drastic increase in executions, and unfortunately seven states resumed or partially ended long-standing moratoria in 2014.

So far, no scientific arguments have been put forward to support the fact that the death penalty has any deterrent effect on people who commit capital crimes. There has been no deterrent effect. There has also been no increase in the number of these capital crimes, if the death penalty has been abolished, I think it is very important that it be heard here.  I would like the European Union not to give up on its efforts – from the moratorium to the complete abolition of the death penalty. However, where it fails, that is, if there are still states that will carry out the death penalty, I think it would be necessary to insist on some minimum standards. Firstly, the death penalty can only be imposed for a deliberate and violent crime, never retroactively, always only to persons who are over eighteen years of age, never to pregnant women, mothers of newborns and mentally ill persons. Of course, it must be based on compelling evidence. The convicted person should also have the right to appeal or request a change of sentence at any time after it has been granted. At the same time, I would like to draw attention to the fact that Slovak Prime Minister Fico wrote the book The Death Penalty in 1998.

We also draw attention to the complicity of certain Member States in the execution of capital punishments in third countries through financial support to combat drug trafficking, which is unacceptable.  That is why we want the European Union to work closely to ensuring that funds to combat drug trafficking in certain countries are only provided if the country abolishes the death penalty — as a matter of principle, but also because these policies disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in drug chains.

The proposed revision of the European Small Claims Procedure aims to raise the amount of claims from EUR 2 000 to EUR 5 000 and aims primarily at simplifying the procedures for resolving cross-border disputes in civil and commercial matters, reducing the duration of legal proceedings from an average of more than 2 years to 5 months and reducing costs by 40%. The increase in the quota threshold in the disputed proceedings will further increase the potential number of individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises able to benefit from this new simplified way of pursuing their claims.  I am pleased, as chief negotiator for the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Ities, that, after one and a half years of debates with the Council in the final of the Latvian Presidency, a solution has been negotiated which will now be put to the vote of the European Parliament in its fourth since the start of work on the Presidency document. I am convinced that the new cross-border redress procedure will help citizens to assert their rights effectively, quickly and cheaply.  In fact, the case concerns billions of euros across the European Union, consisting of small amounts that have not yet been profitable to claim, as court and legal costs have often exceeded them. The result was the flourishing of companies notorious and with impunity deceiving customers. The new simplified procedure also provides for administrative cases to be dealt with without the need to hire a lawyer and without the need to go to another country, as possible hearings will take place, for example, by videoconference, teleconference or other distance communication; gives you the opportunity to pay court fees by bank transfer or card (and not as has often been the case in the court window); it does not require all documents to be translated into another language – now the originals are enough, and only a brief description of the case will have to be translated. The costs of a cross-border investigation cannot be higher than the legal costs in a similar case in their own country and cannot be disproportional to the amount of the claim.  In the original proposal, which I negotiated with the Council, there was an idea to extend the procedure to certain aspects of labour law, which would seem natural in an era of universal labour mobility in the European Union. Unfortunately, the resistance in the Council was insurmountable, but the compromise reached nevertheless includes a revision clause, both in terms of the possibility of raising the threshold for claims and further extending the scope of the procedure to include issues relating to remuneration. I think that with the implementation of this new simplified procedure (which will take place at the latest 16 months after the entry into force of the Regulation), it will eventually be profitable to go to court in cross-border disputes, and with it, I hope, there will be an end to massive and unpunished customer deception. Finally, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, the JURI secretariat, the Representatives of the Council and the European Commission, my advisers and assistants for very good cooperation. The shadow rapporteur Daniel Boudin, the European Commission's Michael Shotter and Jacek Garstka, the Latvian Presidency's Justice Minister Dzintars Rasnačs, as well as Ilze Lepiksone, Vita Sliede and Barbara Mekel, contributed in particular to the compromise.

The European small claims procedure offers a uniform procedure to enforce rights in a cheaper and faster way. The current system has been operational for five years. We have assessed it and identified its shortcomings. Now is the time for improvement. I would like to thank Ms Geringer de Oedenberg, the rapporteur, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation on this dossier.

We proposed extending its application to claims of up to EUR 10 000, paying close attention in particular to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. The final compromise sets the limit at EUR 5 000. Currently it is only EUR 2 000, so this is a significant improvement.  I know that some of you would have welcomed it if employees’ claims could have been included in the scope of the regulation. We agreed that we would come back to this issue in the future after having analysed the practical needs in this respect. The overarching priority for the Commission in these negotiations has been to improve effective access to justice for more EU citizens. The level of court fees plays a key role in this regard. Citizens must not be discouraged from effectively enforcing their rights. The prohibition of disproportionate court fees, which is included in the compromise text, is a step forward.

A European justice needs a single European legal area, and effective justice needs simplified procedures. Citizens of the European Union will be beneficiaries of a simplified procedure for the resolution of cross-border disputes of up to EUR 5 000. National barriers will no longer be an obstacle in judicial matters for individuals and in particular SMEs. Electronic means of communication and distance payment will become effective tools, within the reach of stakeholders, and the definition of cross-border cases has been expanded as well as important clarifications. Stamp duty will have to be set in a reasonable amount and proportionate to the value of the application, so as not to become prohibitive for citizens. Good faith in the execution of civil and commercial contracts will be even more vigorously protected and the legal certainty of the commercial circuit will be guaranteed. It is therefore important to ensure a level playing field for both the creditor and the debtor throughout the European Union, as well as a consequence of membership in the same legal area. However, Member States are required to implement this Regulation and this procedure will become a reality at national level. I regret that it has not been possible to extend the scope of this regulation in the field of labour law, so that European citizens who have performed an activity under an individual employment contract have the opportunity to use this simplified instrument for the recovery of wage rights from bad employers.

According to this instrument, the Commission must submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee a detailed report reviewing the functioning of the European procedure, which necessite the review of the existing Regulation. The aim of this review was to make the existing instrument more attractive and useful to European citizens, who increasingly enter into financial relationships of a cross-border nature, thanks to the functioning of the European free market.

The Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a European small claims procedure is intended to simplify and speed up small claims in cross-border cases, as well as to reduce their procedural costs, always with the specific aim of helping consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises to take action by ensuring access to justice more quickly and easily. This objective cannot be lost in the tangle of Brussels bureaucracy which leaves, more often, citizens and small businesses lost in procedural complexity. I also recall that this work of simplifying and bringing citizens and businesses closer to justice is part of a broader work related to the ALDE's initiative to better legislate. The European small claims procedure can only be successful if it comes to the attention of consumers, businesses, courts and advisory associations.

The amendment to the Regulation is intended to eliminate some of the problems encountered by the proceedings since the beginning of their existence, namely since 2009, in particular: firstly, the setting of a limit on court fees, the amount of which often discouraged consumers from using those proceedings, secondly, it limited SMEs to a limit of EUR 2 000 for a change, since only a small percentage of their cross-border claims fit within that limit.

Moreover, it does not always give justice the respect it deserves. As proof of this, I take as evidence its current plan to double the number of judges of the Court of Justice which it is trying to force through in violation of Article 257 of the FUE Treaty and Article 63 of our regulation and in defiance of our parliamentary procedure. The truth it seeks to conceal is that this doubling does not correspond to any necessity, as the judges of the Court themselves have confessed.

The changes introduced will lead, among other things, to two important effects. Firstly, the procedure will become more common and well-known, secondly, more attractive to citizens and small business in the European Union. The most important solutions are, firstly, raising the upper limit of claims to EUR 5 000 and, secondly, obliging the courts to use modern communication technologies. Those amendments will therefore increase the attractiveness of the solution, while reducing the costs of its application also by the parties to the proceedings. This will therefore reduce, inter alia, the costs of travelling and attending the hearing of the parties. As a result, this instrument has the opportunity to become more accessible and more widely used in Europe. For this reason, it should become a tool that will have a positive impact on closing the loophole – the gap in access to justice in cross-border cases. At present, many businesses and citizens do not pay to assert their rights mainly because the value of the claim is too high.  The most important thing now should be to promote this procedure. We are creating a very interesting instrument, which unfortunately few people know about. This can also increase the willingness of small businesses to do business in other countries as well.

I think that the small claims procedure is an example of legislation that is not at first glance attractive to the general public, but which can be very valid for this public and can thus contribute to a more positive perception of the European Union and EU legislation as a result. Citizens rightly expect legislation that reflects the current reality, whether it is simplifying and speeding up proceedings with electronic means of communication or a tool to achieve justice even in cases with a cross-border element. I believe that the proposed compromise on the amount of the limit on claims is necessary, since in some Member States, at least for individuals, the amount of EUR 10 000 cannot be identified with a small claim, however only the terminology. This reality also needs to be reflected in the legislation. Moreover, the proposal already foresees the possibility of adjusting the threshold of EUR 5 000 in the future.

In situations where a consumer buys goods online from another EU country and realizes by delivery that they have been deprived or cheated, the consumer usually calculates that due to a smaller amount it is not worth entering into an expensive process with the trader. Of course, next time they will not shop online which has negative consequences on the European economy.  This mechanism has been poorly used by SMEs so far, so I welcome the decision to increase the value of the lawsuit, as it is estimated that around 50% of their claims will be resolved through this system.  In conclusion, in addition to commending the simplification and cost reduction of the process, I must highlight my concerns with the European Commission's research – as many as 82% of consumers do not know that they can use this instrument in situations where they have small claims, when they cannot be charged or when seeking, for example, compensation for a vehicle that has been damaged outside their country.

In a word, this directive is part of the air protection package. It thus fills the legislative gap that we have between the Ecodesign Directive, the Ecodesign Directive, which sets standards for combustion plants smaller than 1MW, and the Industrial Emissions Directive, which applies to plants larger than 50MW. Emission limits have been set at an ambitious level that guarantees a gradual improvement in air quality, but also the preservation of the protection of functioning combustion plants and investments. This protection is primarily covered by small facilities up to 5MW, the operators of which are mainly small and medium-sized enterprises or municipal companies, or are an important element of, inter alia, equipment such as schools, hospitals, universities and those that have already been modernized or built to a high standard, which, however, would require significant additional expenditure to meet the standards imposed by the new directive, for example those imposed by the new Directive. , which use biomass – this is particularly the case in the Nordic countries.  Special protection has been granted to heating plants which supply heat to dwellings in residential areas, thereby allowing the costs of their operation to be maintained and thus for not increasing the cost of supplying heat to final customers. This is important not only for social but also environmental reasons, which I want to stress. It promotes a policy of exchanging individual heating sources, in particular in single-family houses, which is particularly important for certain regions in Central and Eastern Europe and can significantly improve air quality.  I wanted to stress that the final text of the directive is an example of a good reconciling of the challenges that come from the need to protect the environment, economic reality and social needs. We have set ambitious targets, but can be achieved without imposing excessive costs on both operators and end-users. On 23rd June an agreement was reached between Parliament, the Council and the European Commission during the informal trilogy. The agreement was also approved by COREPER on 30th June with only one state voting against and voted in the Committee on the Environment on 15th July by an overwhelming majority of 59 votes in favour, with 6 against. I acknowledge, however, that the negotiations with the Council were very complicated and that all the provisions of the directive were subject to detailed arrangements in turn.

The directive to reduce pollution from medium combustion installations is a key component of the Commission’s Clean Air Policy Package presented in December 2013. It is an important deliverable for the 7th Environmental Action Programme, which would help to reduce significantly the potential risks to human health, a programme that I am very familiar with, which was adopted during the Irish Presidency in 2013. Air pollution degrades our environment and it remains the number one environmental cause of death in the EU. It causes 400 000 premature deaths and more than 100 000 lost working days in the EU each year. The Medium Combustion Plants Directive will close an unacceptable gap in our legislation and will thus make an important contribution to reaching the future reduction targets as proposed in the amendment to the National Emission Ceilings Directive that is still on the table for the co-legislators. On behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Vella, let me thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Grzyb, and his colleagues from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) for their commitment and hard work on this proposal.  Thanks to the work of the Parliament negotiating team, it has been possible to maintain the environmental integrity of the proposed directive, whilst addressing justified cases where Member States needed flexibility for implementation. The flexibility provisions that cover district heating and the use of biomass as a fuel, which are two major issues for Parliament, will ensure that climate and air quality policies are consistent and their synergies are maximised. Parliament also made clear that certain further issues are important, such as energy efficiency and carbon monoxide emissions. The Commission will address these under the agreed review clauses.  Allow me also to point out that the Medium Combustion Plants Directive is a good example of better regulation. It has been designed to be affordable for SMEs and it provides long-term certainty for all economic operators concerned, while minimising the administrative burden for both industry and Member States.  Finally, I would like to underline that, beyond being environmentally efficient, this directive promotes advanced EU technology. It will encourage continued innovation and help EU industry gain shares of the rapidly growing global market in pollution control technology.

I would also like to thank the Commissioner and the Presidency for the cooperative spirit they have shown throughout the process of the proposal. The proposal, as the rapporteur has pointed out, concerns medium combustion plants, 150 000 plants in Europe with a nominal thermal power of between 1 and 50 megawatts, and is designed to make a significant contribution to reducing pollution by setting limit values for existing and new plants and also by establishing a registration system that can enable emissions reduction obligations to be fulfilled in the Member States.  The aim, of course, is to preserve air quality and therefore the health of citizens from possible factors in the increase in air pollution. The text represents a compromise between the different positions, but in general an agreement has been reached which has partly amended the Commission's proposal, improving the chances of realistically implementing the directive, enabling it to achieve the objective of improving atmospheric quality in the European Union, without imposing excessive burdens on companies.  Among the most important points are the obligation for Member States to assess the need to apply stricter emission limit values in areas that do not comply with EU air quality standards and the inclusion of a review clause to enable progress in energy efficiency of combustion plants to be monitored in 2020. These efforts are part of the wider framework of preparation for COP21 in Paris, to confirm the European Union as the main player in the fight against climate change, and we hope that an ambitious agreement will be reached thanks also to the commitment of all the parties involved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2489, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Massimo Paolucci", "mepid": "124849", "text": "  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after so many words we are following up a few things.

We are talking about sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter. An important step forward to combat air pollution more effectively.

That is not all we in the Group of socialists and democrats would have liked. Certainly a step forward, a sensible agreement that defends our health and that of the planet, without harming European businesses. We make clear choices, I would remind you of some of them, we extend the scope of monitoring to carbon monoxide as well, we have reached a reasonable compromise on emission limit values on implementation times, the obligation for Member States to assess the need for stricter measures for areas that are above air quality limits, reduction of derogations and then a compromise on the somewhat longer implementation times for installations that are part of biomass-powered heating networks.

It is good that the final shape of the Directive on reducing emissions of certain substances into the air from medium combustion plants takes into account the wide range of concerns expressed by different environments.  My particular attention was paid to the role of district heating, which is very popular in many European Union countries, including Poland. In Poland, such installations are mainly based on coal, or raw material, which we have in abundance. Installations in Poland have undergone the modernisation required by national law in recent years, so too quickly imposing an obligation on them to further modernise would lead to a drastic increase in costs and, as a result, perhaps, an increase in the use of individual heating systems, which would lead to an increase in emissions, because these systems are more difficult to control. From an environmental and health policy point of view, this would therefore be counterproductive. The possibility for States to exclude such installations from the need for stricter limits by 2030 is therefore a manifestation of common sense.  I am also pleased that my amendment, which states that emissions should be measured under stable conditions under a representative, even load, is in the final form of the agreement. The scandal over Volkswagen's falsification of emission measurements in a country that is a promoter of emission reductions shows the importance, on the one hand, of realisticly imposing mandatory emission reductions and, on the other hand, of careful monitoring of compliance with those limits.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2491, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Jan Huitema", "mepid": "58789", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. First of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteur of the ALDE Group, the rapporteur and the other shadow rapporteurs for the excellent cooperation. I really think we have achieved this result together. As far as I am concerned, this piece of legislation is the circle and emissions from medium-sized combustion plants are also regulated, as was previously the case with the large combustion plants. The aim is to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen and particulate matter, which have a major impact on air quality, but also on public health. After good cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament, a solid package is now on the table that is workable and guarantees a level playing field throughout Europe.  My commitment and that of our group was to reduce exceptions to the emission limit values as much as possible if there was no clear reason for doing so. It worked. However, some of the exceptions, in our view, are justified. As co-legislators, I believe that we should take into account the practice, especially if the European Union is to encourage the use of biomass. The requirements for biomass combustion plants, for example, have therefore been adapted. We have also avoided overlap with other regulations, which means that dual legislation with, for example, the Industrial Emissions Directive is no longer present.  There are other loopholes also closed. For example, an installation intended for emergencies can really only be used during an emergency and cannot operate under normal conditions. We have managed to reduce red tape and bureaucracy. Rules must be able to be applied unambiguously by a uniform licensing system. Finally, it is good that Member States want to learn from each other. In some Member States, business is already much further. It is up to other Member States to show that ambition as well. Mr President, I welcome this outcome of the negotiations.

We have been discussing source emissions quite a lot today. We were discussing cars this afternoon and now we are doing medium combustion plans. Let us be fair to each other: it is always pretty difficult to get to legislation. Every time we discuss air quality people say that what is most important is to have policies aimed at attacking the source but, as soon as we do that with a policy, there is a lot of demand for the extension of deadlines, a lot of loopholes, all kinds of exemptions, etcetera. That has been the case here too. In that sense, it is a pity that the Council is not here because the Council was the leader in creating loopholes in this legislation. I am very happy that Parliament managed to delete a lot of these loopholes, but it was something of an exercise in damage control. So we will support this because it is an improvement. It will address 20% of the emissions under the national emissions ceiling. But, whenever we deal with these source policies, let us be vigilant.

It is therefore important for the European Commission to assess within a reasonable period of time whether the emission limit values should be changed on the basis of the new technologies.

The total external cost of the impact of air pollution on health varies from €330 billion to €940 billion. Direct economic damage includes 15 billion euros from lost working days, 4 billion euros in healthcare costs, a 3 billion euro loss on crop yields and 1 billion euros in damage to buildings. The latest report by the European Environment Agency on the air quality of the European Union shows that the average air quality in the European Union has been improving since 2003 to date. However, the problem of pollution in Central Europe and some other parts of Europe remains pronounced.  I must say here that Croatia has for more than a decade had its own national legislation prescribed conditions for small and medium-sized fireboxes, as evidenced by the exceptional general air quality measured at the stations of our state network.

Many of you have mentioned that the increased use of biomass as a fuel, if not accompanied by adequate pollution abatement, leads to a significant degradation of air quality, and the Medium Combustion Plants Directive will enable the environmentally-sound use of biomass as a fuel. It gives the necessary time for upgrading recent biomass plants that do not adequately reduce emissions of particulate matter. Some of you mentioned and sought clarification as to how this particular directive would be imposed on the medium combustion plants. The rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, and the legislation generally, avoid as far as possible, or minimise, the burden for SMEs as part of a key objective, and the proposal was designed with exactly this objective in mind. The emission limits ensure the most favourable cost-benefit ratio, and mitigation measures have been incorporated to help SMEs, such as the phased implementation for existing plants, exemptions for plants operating a limited number of hours, and reduced monitoring requirements for small plants.  To my friend Mr Omarjee, let me say that the situation in La Réunion, or indeed in the outermost regions, is not being ignored. The legislation does contain proposals which are applicable in the outermost regions, but Member States must take appropriate action to address the air quality situation in those regions while taking account of their specific circumstances. You cannot have the same criteria in those particular areas and islands in the same way as you would have on the mainland, and I know that you would accept that as a legitimate point of view.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in March 2014, the European Commission presented the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to caseins and caseinated products intended for human consumption and repealing Council Directive 83/417/EEC, on the basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Tomorrow's vote is basically a vote on a technical dossier which, however, has consequences for citizens and consumers, so I have worked on this proposal very carefully, together with my fellow shadow rapporteurs, whom I thank for the excellent cooperation that has enabled us to reach the final agreement with the Council very quickly.  In general, we welcomed the Commission's proposal and felt it appropriate to amend certain aspects of it. In particular, the Commission's proposal provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to certain lactoproteins intended for human consumption. Since the entry into force of the directive, however, a number of changes have taken place, in particular the development of a broad regulatory framework in the food sector and the adoption of international codex alimentarius legislation on casein-based food products.  The production of caseins and dairy products from milk was subject to a subsidy scheme within the Union until 2006. The scheme therefore ceased and was subsequently definitively repealed by the 2013 political agreement on the reform of the single common organisation of the market in agricultural products. On 24 February 2015, the ENVI Committee adopted six amendments to the Commission's proposal and we have worked to lay the foundations for providing food business operators with equal treatment on the world market, given the adaptation of the requirements for the composition of caseins and food casein defined in the annexes to that of the Codex Alimentarius standard.  Specifically, the proposal is aimed at aligning the powers conferred on the Commission with the distinction between delegated acts and implementing acts introduced by the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union, updating the provisions applicable to caseins and caseinates, taking into account eu legislation adopted in the meantime, in particular that applicable to foodstuffs, and adapting the requirements for the composition of caseins to the international standard.  Following the agreement reached with the Council, the final text provides for the maximum moisture content of food casein to be set at 12% compared with the 10% previously envisaged, and the maximum fat content of food acid casein milk at 2% compared with 2.25 previously. In this way, we will enable us to adapt rapidly in the future to international standards and technical progress.  Although the products covered by the proposal are not directly intended for sale to the final consumer, but for sale between food preparation companies, it is important, however, that food business operators have the necessary data for the labelling of finished products, in particular with regard to allergens. Consequently, the proposal includes provisions on the labelling of caseins and caseinated products intended for human consumption, so that their presence is indicated in a visible, legible and indelible manner. If the required information provided for does not appear on packaging, containers or labels, the products concerned may not be marketed or used for the preparation of foodstuffs. It is clear that this will enable final consumers to make informed choices, particularly in the presence of food allergies and intolerances, and all this confirms once again our action to protect European consumers and their health.

The objectives that were pursued by the Commission when the proposal was tabled in 2014 have been fully understood and supported by the co—legislators throughout the legislative process. Those objectives continue to be at the heart of the text in the debate today, which is putting the EU dairy sector on a level playing field with world—market competitors in an area where innovation helps add value to milk production in the form of high—tech ingredients that serve customers both in the Union and indeed outside it. Today’s text aligns the EU rules to the international standards adopted under the Codex Alimentarius for edible casein and caseinates. Differences that existed in the past are no longer justified today, as no public subsidy is now paid to casein production in the Union following the CAP reform that you agreed to in 2013. In conclusion, let me take the opportunity again to thank Parliament for the excellent technical cooperation that has characterised this dossier throughout the various steps of the adoption procedure. We hope that both arms of the legislator will now quickly vote on a final text so that there will no longer be any obstacle for our dairy industry in benefiting from a level playing field on the world market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2527, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Marijana Petir", "mepid": "124749", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, caseins and caseinates are substances obtained by technological procedures from milk. The widespread use of these substances in industry, in particular food, represents valuable products in the milk sector production chain, which are then intended as raw materials for further use in other industries.  The proposed directive aligns European practice with standards applied globally according to Codex Alimentarius recommendations and standards. Thus, European caseins and caseinates will be of the same characteristics as in other countries of the world, which is significant for industrial production in terms of the safety of sources and the stability of the supply of raw materials. We know that the different characteristics of raw materials affect the technological processes of production and ultimately the quality of the final product. The industry that uses them prefers those raw materials that have similar characteristics because they do not require process adjustment depending on the supplier of raw materials, and therefore new costs that are then ultimately paid by consumers. Given the elimination of previous differences in moisture content and maximum milk fat content in edible cases, I expect this change to make these European products more competitive on the global market.  This will also help europe's crisis-hit dairy sector. Namely, in the milk sector, the alarming situation arose from the abolition of quotas and the Russian embargo, and I must say that in Croatia milk production in the first 4 months of this year fell by 5% and 1200 small milk producers failed. Therefore, I also use this opportunity to call on the Commission to carry out a review of the milk package, introduce a crisis programme, as the dairy sector is the most sensitive sector in agriculture and deserves special attention, and the intervention measures so far are only a drop in the sea and unfortunately have not yielded the desired results.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2528, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Susanne Melior", "mepid": "124838", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which The directive on kaseins and caseinates, which is under discussion here today, is , as has already been said – a very technical matter. The attention, especially around this time of day, is also correspondingly low. I think the importance is underestimated because we all like to eat quark and cheese. Caseine and its water-soluble form, the caseinates, are an important prerequisite for their production. But you can do more. They are also used for milk whites in coffee or even as a clarifying agent for rosé wines. Edible caseins and caseinates – and this is the only issue at stake here – are milk proteins and are therefore also subject to labelling as allergens, regulated by EU Regulation No 1169/2011. This fact has been taken into account in the new directive, as has the Codex Alimentarius, which has already been mentioned, which deals with the water content and lactic acid content of caders. In addition, the trialogue increased implementation in the Member States from 9 to 12 months. I would like to thank the chairman of the ENVI Committee, Mr La Via, for its speedy consultation and cooperative cooperation, and I commend Parliament for approving the directive so that we in the European Union can all continue to enjoy good cheese and quark.

This information will now be mandatory and foodstuffs containing casein and caseinates can only be marketed under the appropriate labels on packaging and containers.

As you know, in Italy – I come from Italy – we have a law prohibiting this. The European Commission now wants to lift this ban with all its strength. In Italy, we assume that cheese is to be produced from milk. If the same Commission, which proposed a report to the House a few weeks ago so that the Member States can ban the import of genetically modified organisms on their territory, and said at the time that this is not relevant to the internal market, now claims that the ban on the addition of milk powder and carines in cheese should be relevant to the internal market, then I no longer understand the world. That is why, Commissioner, may I ask you to really look at this thing again. The European Union as a whole is not in a state where we can afford such things. If you look at the debates on this in Italy, I think it is a good thing if we should put an end to this as soon as possible and allow the Italians to produce cheese from milk and not from milk powder or from kaders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2533, "date": "2015-10-06.json", "name": "Nicola Caputo (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124851", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first of all I would like to say that I appreciate the efforts that the Commission is making on food safety.

However, while it is true that these changes simplify the exchange of information between food companies, it is also true that this measure will also, and above all, affect the information on the label that final consumers will be able to obtain. Labelling requirements for caseins and caseinates will enable consumers to make informed and informed choices, particularly in the presence of food allergies or intolerances.

This proposal is not about a new bureaucratic regulation that bullies or somehow complicates the lives of European citizens or companies operating in Europe. On the contrary, it is a regulation that will strengthen the internal market and unify rules that are either inconsistent or obsolete, since they date back to the early 1980s. While I am reticent to extend the scope of the European Union and to over-bureaucraticise, I strongly support this regulation because it will bring uniform and clear rules to the entire food industry in the European Union. It has been said here several times, I think the industry welcomes this. I myself have spoken to some representatives of the food industry about this proposal for a directive in my country, in the Czech Republic, and they have seen these clear rules as a good impetus to be able to see clearly what they are making decisions on. I think it is very good that we are based here on an expert opinion, on the technical standards developed by the international organisation Codex Alimentarius. It is good that we are accepting of what casein food sour, casein food sweet should look like, and that this, as I said, will increase the certainty of manufacturers. In addition, it is also very good that there will be a clear obligation of information for individual producers in relation to those who use casein in their products.

As regards the milk and milk products market, taking advantage of Commissioner Hogan's presence in the context of the recently presented study on origin labelling, it seems to me that the only defensible position is that the original labelling concerns the place where the milk is collected and not the place where it is processed. I know the context is much more complex and includes other variables, but here I don't have time for more.

One of the Italian issues that was raised by a number of speakers from Italy concerned a matter that goes back in regulatory form to 1974 – so a little bit before my time – but has nevertheless raised its head because of an objection and a complaint brought before the Commission by an Italian company, which is the subject of investigation at the moment.

In relation to the question raised by my good friend Mr Serrão Santos on the Azores, the labelling issues are a matter for my colleague, Commissioner Andriukaitis, but I am aware of the reports which came down against mandatory labelling. I am sure that you are aware of them as well. Voluntary labelling is available for Member States if they wish to proceed on that basis, but it is a rather contentious matter because you have to respect the fact that we are in an internal market, with a common agricultural policy, where the free movement of goods and services are actually appropriate vis-à-vis consumers. But I understand where you are coming from: from the position of the Azores where the high-quality products that you have there – which get the recognition of 26% of the consumer market in dairy products in mainland Portugal – represent quite a significant industry. I am sure that, from the point of view of your producers in the Azores and from that perspective of high-quality products, you would be very pleased to have labelling.

Every year, people who have been diagnosed with food allergies arrive, a significant proportion of which are allergies to cow's milk proteins. Most often they are produced by casein, which accounts for 80% of cow's milk proteins. That is why it is so important to properly label foods produced with dairy products.  The consumer has the right to proper and complete information about the product, both in terms of its characteristics, composition, quality and origin. Dairy products, as they cause numerous allergies and intolerances, must be labelled. The lack of such information is extremely dangerous for allergic people, because the reception of casein by people allergic to it not only results in numerous ailments on the part of the digestive system, but contributes to the degradation of the immune system of allergy sufferers, which causes serious and often incurable diseases of the bone, skin and even cancer.
