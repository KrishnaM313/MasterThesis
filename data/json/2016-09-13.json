Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be here on behalf of President Juncker, who will be addressing you tomorrow, to give you my opinion on the outcome of the G20 summit, which took place on 4 and 5 September in Hangzhou, China. The European Union was represented as always by President Juncker and the President of the Council, Donald Tusk, whom I had the pleasure of accompanying, given the highly economic agenda of the summit and the fact that the Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs is still accompanying the President of the Commission to the G20 summit. This was an opportunity for China to show, first of all, a very great sense of organization, there was no doubt about it, but also of a global responsibility that it now assumes as a key player in the world economy. For the G20 as a whole, it was an opportunity to demonstrate, after years of crisis, that we can make more aggressive policy decisions to ensure long-term sustainable growth and restore confidence. I think that, in a context of questions, that challenge was important, and it was met. We have presented a series of issues on which the European Union is at the forefront. I am thinking of everything that goes in the direction of a global growth strategy, with the idea of pursuing structural reforms, but also of positioning itself as an example in the field of taxation, the fight against tax evasion and being a promoter of international trade and an advocate for investment.  These themes were the priorities for key world leaders. Our strategy has been to show that our European triangle - investment, structural reforms, responsible public finances - is working, but we must continue on this path to ensure sustainable and positive change in the long term. You could accuse me of complacency for that. No, there is no reason to be complacent, it was said and repeated during most of the interventions during our two days in Hangzhou as a call to act urgently to provide tangible results for our citizens who are waiting for them. Our major economies are very closely linked, and slow global growth faces, as we know, multiple obstacles. The risk of a vicious circle was well identified: low productivity growth, inequality also increasing, all of which provoked a populist response - we do not have the privilege - which in turn slows down reforms and, therefore, further slows growth and so on. The G20 has therefore decided to use all policy tools - monetary tools, fiscal tools or structural tools - to stimulate growth and focus on efforts to implement reforms. Cooperation has also been launched on innovation and the digital economy to increase productivity and long-term growth. In addition, the leaders meeting at the G20 delivered a strong message: after a period of long crisis, we must think about the future; the benefits of growth, globalization and innovation must be appreciated by all, not just by a privileged group of people.  For the first time, and I have been attending these summits for a number of years now, a concept has burst into the public debate, and that is a good thing. This is the concept of inclusion, a fundamental principle that should be observed with a greater emphasis on skills, social protection, but also on the definition of trade and other fiscal policies that must take into account this parameter of inclusive growth. The priorities of this Commission, like those of the G20, are, as you know, already geared towards social justice. Trade was also on the agenda. International trade is an engine for jobs, growth and development. That is why we are concerned about the sluggish growth of world trade and that is also why we continue to vigorously defend free trade against the protectionist temptations that are emerging. But the Commission has also made a great deal of emphasis on the fact that free trade must be fair in order to have the support of our peoples and this Parliament. To be in favour of free trade is not to be in favour of free trade under any conditions, whatever the terms, without reservation or regulation. The G20 plays a key role in supporting a multilateral trading system that is strong and rules-based. We have put a lot of emphasis on this in our discussions at the G20 and the President of the Commission has personally engaged in a fight which, I believe, Know this, this Parliament is committed to this matter: the defence of the interests of the European steel industry and workers affected by a context of global overcapacity and, let us say also, of Chinese overcapacity.  This is an important issue on which an important step has been taken, in Hangzhou, with the G20 agreement, to form a global forum on steel capacity with the support of the OECD and of course the approval of the Chinese Presidency. Fair international taxation is another essential condition for restoring our citizens' confidence in the global economy and also for enabling the government to provide the investments and services that are so necessary for our economies. All companies, I keep saying here, in my capacity as Commissioner for Taxation, have to pay their fair share of taxes in the countries where they make their profits. You know that the European Union is at the forefront of these efforts and that it has already adopted several very ambitious proposals last year. We were encouraged to see all the G20 countries once again firmly and strongly committed not only to implementing past agreements, but also to go further in the wake of the Panama Papers affair, which continues, it is true, to weigh on people's minds. The G20 has therefore agreed to put in place a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for the next summit in 2017 and to consider defensive measures in the event of non-compliance. This international list of the G20 is complementary to the list that the European Union itself is about to launch and which must also be operational in 2017, with the problems which are complementary and which I believe fit well. In the fight against terrorist financing, the G20 will continue to lead the WORK of the FATF. Leaders called for a swift and resolute implementation of its new strategy against terrorist financing and for strengthening coordination with those who do not participate in the task force, particularly vulnerable countries. The Hangzhou meeting also provided an event to discuss financial regulation reform, which, I recall, was a flagship initiative of the G20. The focus is now on the coherent implementation of agreed reforms, such as the Basel III framework and its completion by the end of 2016. The Chinese presidency has also strengthened discussions on the international financial architecture. We know that there is an ongoing risk to the global economy. The unanimous agreement to maintain a strong IMF with sufficient resources is a significant result. Last year in Antalya, we called on the G20 to recognize the refugee crisis for what it is: a global challenge that requires a global response. With the help of this Parliament, the European Union has put in place a comprehensive set of measures to manage this crisis, but we can only meet this challenge if the international community as a whole makes coordinated efforts. We have kept a clear message to our G20 partners that we want the level of solidarity between nations necessary to solve this problem, which is still missing, to now emerge. The answer elicits resolute but also cautious optimism. G20 members said they were ready to share the burden of the refugee crisis, specifically calling for increased financial assistance and resettlement of refugees. G20 cooperation to support development and food security, especially in Africa, is also important in terms of controlling migration flows. The summit was also an opportunity for the G20 to reaffirm its commitment to the Paris Agreement. The pace of ratifications is good and it is now very likely that the threshold for the agreement to enter into force - I am talking about COP 21 - will be reached this year. The main message from the European Union to the G20 members in this regard is that they must now act just as quickly to implement this agreement. Of course, as you can imagine, many leaders at the summit wanted to hear the response of the Europeans to the UK referendum. President Juncker wanted to reassure them that we were ready to face it once the British government has communicated its intentions. You know that the Commission has appointed its negotiator, my compatriot, predecessor to the post of French Commissioner, Michel Barnier. We want to build a new partnership with Britain that works for everyone. A formula always comes to mind, and it is also shared with the British government: Britain, it is its choice, will no longer be, after this negotiation, a member country of the Union European Union, but it will remain a very decisive European nation for a whole range of policies that we have to pursue together. At the same time, the President stressed that there were many things that the European Union of 27 could achieve together. This is our objective for the future and it is in this spirit that the President will address the House here tomorrow for his State of the Union address, speaking both of the Europe of 28, which is ours, of the Europe of 27, which is our future, and of the Europe of the 19, that of the euro zone, which is the beating heart of Europe. But I do not want to anticipate what he will tell you, I think it will be an important moment for the Commission, for Parliament, for the European Union, before the meeting of the leaders of the 27, to be held in Bratislava on 16 September. Those are the few things I wanted to present to you. I would not like to be any longer, I can go back to that G20 meeting later, which I believe was, again, organised in an impressive way by China, very well led by the Chinese President, with many results, which are entirely in line with what the European Union could expect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Françoise Grossetête", "mepid": "2025", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, it is regrettable that the Council is absent to talk about this latest G20 summit, which was rich in policy statements but which has not convinced on the facts. It is to be welcomed, as the Commissioner has explained to us, that Europe has managed to impose its economic agenda. The roadmap adopted at the summit intersects many of the priorities that are proposed by our Group of the European People's Party and which have guided our work for months, i.e. justice, fiscal fairness, to combat inequality, the promotion of trade in the context of regulated globalisation and a growth strategy based on investment recovery and structural reforms. It could also be said that there is a small victory on the issue of steel overproduction at the global level, since it has finally been put on the table and it is not insignificant that this subject has been discussed in China, countries whose subsidies fuel unbearable dumping, which overwhelms the European steel industry. Despite these advances, I regret that many other crucial topics have been addressed only half-word, if at all. Among them, the refugee crisis. You have talked about it, Mr Moscovici, but if we have to be optimistic, I think it is still very limited. Climate change: of course, there was an announcement on the ratification of the Paris Agreement by the United States and China. Nevertheless, we are waiting for the facts. There is also the war in Syria. I will also mention another topic, mentioned in a few lines in the final communiqué. This is the fight against antibiotic resistance: no concrete commitment has been made, even though this is one of the greatest public health scourges of our century. Faced with issues that call for a major response, little is finally retained from this summit. Even the stated will to fight populism, if it is positive, fails to reassure us entirely. Promises only engage those who believe them, they say. Let us hope, however, that these promises made to this G20 also engage those who made them, otherwise this summit will have served only one thing: to demonstrate once again the power of China, which is for better and for worse, as a key international player.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Ivan Korčok", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I am grateful for the invitation to discuss the outcome of the G20 Summit which took place last week in China and where the European Union was represented by President Tusk and President Juncker.  G20 leaders discussed various topics of global importance and, crucially, issues on which the G20 should provide leadership. I will focus on issues which I find are of particular relevance from the point of view of the Council, including migration, the global economy, trade, taxation and climate.  Let me start with an issue which is very high on our agenda, namely the management of migration. I consider the G20’s recognition of the current crisis as an issue of global concern to be a very positive signal. The EU has stated in international forums on various occasions that migration requires efficient and coordinated action and it calls for all stakeholders to take responsibility in a spirit of partnership and burden sharing. The EU and its Member States are fully assuming their responsibilities, but expect other partners, namely our G20 partners, also to do their part.  The communiqué by G20 leaders is a step in the right direction, as it calls for scaled-up support to refugees and host communities. The EU will certainly use the opportunity of the forthcoming New York summit on refugees and migration, which you will discuss with High Representative Mogherini later today, to take the G20 conclusions forward and pursue  more equitable sharing of responsibility for what is clearly a global challenge. My second point is the global economy. G20 leaders in China pointed to the progressing global economic recovery, while recognising that growth was still weaker than desirable and that downside risks remained. Challenges originating from geopolitical developments were also mentioned. Accordingly, leaders declared their determination to use all policy tools –monetary, fiscal and structural – individually and collectively to achieve the intended growth. Importantly, there was the recognition that growth needs to be inclusive in order to ensure that it serves the needs of everyone and benefits all countries and people so that no one is left behind. This is recognised in the Hangzhou Action Plan, which summarises the main commitments by G20 members. The G20 summit also made a strong case for international trade as a driver of global economic recovery. To this end, G20 leaders committed to strengthening an open world economy by working towards trade and investment facilitation and liberalisation. The establishment of the G20 Trade and Investment Working Group is an important step in this regard. The G20 reaffirmed its commitment to the multilateral trading system, with the WTO at its core, and to advancing the post—Nairobi work in the WTO, including the outstanding issues of the Doha Development Round, with a view to achieving positive outcomes at the next WTO Ministerial Conference in 2017.  I also welcome the G20 commitment to ratifying the Trade Facilitation Agreement by the end of this year and its call for other WTO members to do the same. The EU, for its part, has already ratified. However, we need to recognise that anti-globalisation sentiment and opposition to trade are increasing. The G20 therefore emphasised the need to communicate the benefits of trade and open markets more effectively and to ensure that the benefits of trade are spread more widely. It also recognised the structural problems caused by excess capacity in some industries, most notably in the steel sector, and agreed that this required a collective response. G20 leaders therefore agreed to establish a global forum on steel access capacity, which should report to the relevant G20 Ministers in 2017.  Let me mention two more issues. Taxation is another priority that the EU shares with the G20. I particularly welcome the establishment of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework for the implementation of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative (BEPS) as well as its first meeting in Kyoto. The EU has pioneered BEPS implementation with the recent adoption of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD), but timely, consistent and widespread implementation of the BEPS package at global level remains critical in order to establish an international level playing field and avoid further loopholes.  I am also satisfied with the endorsement of the proposal for objective criteria to identify non-cooperative jurisdictions with respect to tax transparency and with the objective to prepare, by July 2017, a list of jurisdictions that have not yet sufficiently progressed towards a satisfactory level of implementation, as well as to consider defensive measures against them.  Following the adoption of conclusions on taxation last May, the Council has already started to determine, on the basis of a first screening by the Commission, non-cooperative third country jurisdictions with which dialogues should begin during the course of next year. The objective is to establish an EU list of such jurisdictions and explore defensive measures at EU level, in the tax as well as in the non-tax area, to be endorsed by the Council by the end of this year.  Finally, the G20 Summit reaffirmed the commitment of its members to sustainable development and strong and effective action to tackle climate change. The G20 leaders are committed to countries’ ratifying and implementing in a timely fashion all aspects of the Paris climate agreement, including financial assistance for developing countries. In particular, the G20 supported efforts to enable the Paris Agreement to enter into force by the end of 2016.

Reglobalisation, because we have a duty, as the European Union, first of all, to create a new globalisation that assesses the impact of global phenomena, trade agreements, the digital revolution, migratory flows and introduces appropriate corrective measures so as not to leave anyone on the sidelines. Sharing, because we need rules and trust between partners. The establishment of a forum to control excess capacity, starting with steel, is a first positive sign. Finally, inclusion, so that everyone is part of it and do their part. Significantly for the first time this summit recognises the importance of including women as growth drivers.

Although you can read between the lines that people have some doubts about that. At the same time, people are asking for more public investment, and when I read the weekend newspapers, it says: \"Finally, the policy of savings has failed. It's time to try something different.\" That was also the line of the six southern European countries that had coffee with Mr. Tsipras in Athens on Friday. With all due respect, the truth has its rights. Global debt has not fallen since 2008. On the contrary, debts have increased in businesses, banks, households and, certainly, governments. The total debt in the world is currently EUR 200 trillion. That's more than three times the overall global economy. Please don't let us tell the blisters.

I do not want to reiterate what has been said, and I think there are a number of important points. The reconfirmed commitment to growth, innovation, facilitation of investment and liberalisation of free trade is, of course, highly relevant. I also appreciate that China committed itself to free trade and to fight protectionism, and of course the decision to set up a global monitoring entity for the over-production of steel is highly relevant, especially nowadays for Europe. In this respect it would be interesting to know from the Commissioner what will precede the work at multilateral level, how we are going to perceive it and whether the Commission has already considered the technicalities. I would like a bit more information on two points. On refugees, to which the Minister devoted some time, I think that the recognition of the problem might not be entirely sufficient. Secondly, we know that Putin met Obama on the sidelines of the summit and that a deal has been brokered on a ceasefire but I wonder why we do not have anything in the conclusions from the G20 summit. I think that, both on the refugee crisis and on this, this does not send the best signal. However, my main point is the following: while there is a recommitment to free trade, I wonder how credible the EU is in reconfirming this with its international partners if, at the same time, while on the one hand we are talking multilateral liberalisation, bilateral agreements and so on, we have, on the other, voices in Germany, France and elsewhere in Europe saying that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – an important free trade agreement – is basically dead. We know what the Commission had to say but I wonder how the Council, and how the Presidency, will react on the issue, because this is definitely a hit to the credibility of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Δημήτριος Παπαδημούλης", "mepid": "28586", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr Moscovici, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in China we saw interesting declarations at the end of the G20 meeting. But citizens are asking for tangible works, not words. Measurable result and not just a meaningless rhetoric. For example, on the issue of tax evasion: the Commission's decision on the taxation of Apple on widespread tax evasion in Ireland was correct. We need projects. You rightly pointed out, Mr Moscovici, that global cooperation on refugees is needed. But can Europe set an example on this issue when European cooperation itself is not being implemented, and do we have Member States that refuse to accept and implement decisions on proportional distribution of refugees? When fewer than 400 experts have been sent to my country, Greece, which is taking on a huge burden to help with the process of taking in refugees?  Moreover, in terms of investment and tax evasion: tax evasion in the European Union alone is 7 times higher than the European budget for 2016, amounting to EUR 1 trillion a year.

I am very grateful to the representative of the Council for coming too late, because this has given us the opportunity to take note at the outset in full beauty, as Commissioner Moscovici excels at the bingo. Mr Moscovici has said that it has been successfully agreed that sustainable growth will be guaranteed in the long term. He said that Europe is at the forefront of growth. He said that the Commission was quite right and successful in prioritising the social. Mr Moscovici, you are absolutely right to say that you cannot think that you are complacent. You are not complacent, you report from a parallel universe! You said that the results of the Hangzhou Summit would fully meet the EU's expectations. That is the most pathetic thing to say, because business as usual is good enough for the EU. Apart from some small advances, such as the Steel Forum for Overcapacity, which has already been pointed out, or the fact that cooperation on the subject of green finance has not been buried, this meeting in Hangzhou has brought little substance. What has brought us, however, is the recognition that Europe is only playing second violin in such a global event. In the run-up to this summit, much has been said that if China does not recognise the UNCLOS Arbitration Panel's decision, China would be treated as an international pariah. There has been a lot of talk about Russia being cornered because of the role it unfortunately plays in Ukraine and Crimea, for example. The fact is that this was not mentioned at all at the summit. China and Russia were at the centre of the action, while the EU was on the second bench. And I think we need to start to stop complacent that business as usual would be good enough for us if we want to change that. The EU has failed to ratify the climate agreement. The Americans and the Chinese have made a big act out of it in Hangzhou.

However, positions useful for moving towards true and more shared progress have emerged and in some cases have established themselves.  I would like to highlight the few positive factors, rather than the problematic ones, which are there, especially in terms of omissions. I believe that a reality such as the European Union must demonstrate its ability to design and implement itself in order to be credible in the world and therefore to influence it. Firstly, there is support for the fight against climate change. Now, after the ratification of the Paris Agreement by the world's major polluters – I am thinking of the United States and China – the European Union must ensure that not only do all Member States do this quickly, but also influence so that the third countries involved do the same.  From this point of view, we must also consider the green finance initiative and the proposal to channel a significant proportion of the funds currently directed at fossil fuels towards clean energy solutions. In this respect, we expect the Commission to give concrete form to the circular economy project. The declaration to build an open and resilient financial system based on international cooperation in the field of taxation and financial transparency is also something that must not be dropped, but it must be put into concrete form very quickly.

Now that the UK will soon unshackle itself from the EU, it will be able to reach out to its Commonwealth partners, which it could not do before, because of EU restrictions. Africa kept in poverty by aid from this place will instead be able to trade freely again with the UK. India and Australia, representing major markets, have already shown their interest in a free trade deal. China, another huge market, is equally ready to look into a free trade deal with my country. If even a tiny country such as Switzerland has a trade deal with China, then surely the UK can have one as well. And it will. All the while the EU has no trade deal with major markets around the world. You exclude Russia because of your stupid sanctions. I hope my country reopens trade negotiations with Russia and we will continue to have a good relationship with it.  The EU dictates the trade policies of European countries and, unsurprisingly, with meagre results, unless you believe that the few deals that it has managed to negotiate with countries such as Morocco, Papua New Guinea and Algeria are game changers. Of course you do have your secret TTIP negotiations – and how is that going, by the way? Your friend Obama tries to push through TTIP, and that mostly serves the interests of multinationals. It does not serve the people. TTIP will end up in the bin, as the French and German Ministers have already publicly announced that it is dead in the water.

I would like to point out this with just four examples: the gin has been talking about tax equality and tax fairness in the G20 for years. We are not making any progress at all in the European Union, and if we did not have at least one Competition Commissioner who is now trying to pull the emergency brake, because the Member States are still not stopping this unfair tax competition, then we would not be a single step forward in Europe either. That is why, in my view, what Commissioner Vestager is doing is at least a small good sign on the horizon.  The second is innovation: we are talking about strengthening innovation. But if you look at what we are doing in Europe in practice: we are talking about strengthening innovation to finance the Juncker Plan, then we are taking money out of broadband expansion in Europe and thus depending on the areas for which it is particularly important to receive European funding so as not to be left behind by the future – namely our rural regions – and development.  The third, structural reforms: many, many explanations, too. It is a pity that a number of structural reforms that were made ten or fifteen years ago have been withdrawn in my country, but when I look at other states – France and Italy – at least my impression from the outside is that there are no structural reforms going on there at all, but that there is a de facto stalemate.  And on trade, we are talking about trade facilitation agreements, we are talking about improving trade, and then, in principle, at the same time as the G20 talks in China, we see how our Member States can really damage the good trade agreement between the European Union and Canada by having it declared a mixed agreement by the European Commission and not making any progress at all. to continue to negotiate this agreement, but quite the contrary; it is being deceived by the Commission.

The S&amp;D Group certainly welcomes the decisions in key sectors such as fair taxation, the refugee crisis and terrorism, and also the commitments to solve the problem of over- production, especially in the steel sector. But, as we know, it is one thing taking a decision and a totally different one putting it into practice. We are very happy about the stance taken by the Commission against Apple in Ireland because, for the S&amp;D Group, fair taxation is a key element in a wealthy and competitive economy. It is evident, however, that, alongside the measures to be taken at EU level, we need to act globally in order to make sure that the rules are binding for all. This is where Europe should assume its own responsibility as an important actor in the international community. One key message, deriving from the G20 summit and more generally from the global economic situation, is that we need more growth, and that we cannot expect only developing countries to be the ones leading the process. The EU needs to do more in order to re-launch growth in the economy and to create more jobs, with more flexibility and more investment. The G20 was also an occasion for the US and China to ratify jointly – and I would underline the symbolic importance of that ‘jointly’ – the Paris Agreement on climate change. This is an area in which Europe had always taken the lead but, at least this time, the United States and China got there first. They are the two biggest world polluters, so maybe this is equally a sign of world change. Europe should draw its own lessons because no EU Member State has ratified the Paris Agreement, and this is once again the difference between nice speeches and the action which is so necessary for European citizens and for the survival of the European project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς (", "mepid": "125069", "text": "  ECR). Madam President, the main conclusion from the G20 summit is that world leaders have avoided addressing the need for a fair distribution of the wealth generated and for combating poverty and unemployment affecting the planet. The fight against global poverty is becoming imperative, not only for reasons of moral order, but also because hitting poverty will greatly boost active demand. In addition, tax dumping, tax evasion and tax avoidance of multinationals, as well as global debt, which has skyrocketed, must be tackled. The G20 referred the measures to the calends on the refugee crisis and on tackling the problems of the European steel industry. For refugees, all the G20 did was simply express wishful meals, but without making specific commitments and shouldering the corresponding burden. Finally, instead of taking measures to protect the European steel industry and its workers, they simply decided to create a tax, and the issue of measures against China, which is causing the problem in the global steel industry, was simply referred to the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Jasenko Selimovic (ALDE).", "mepid": "134243", "text": "   Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for The G20 summit had a very ambitious headline: Towards an innovative, vital, interconnected and inclusive world economy.

Madam President, the summit of the leaders of the 20 developed countries took place in the wake of three important events: 'Brexit', the Russia-US approach and the failed coup d'état in Turkey. Russia, the US, Australia and China have expressed their intention for economic and trade cooperation with Britain. As the European Union, we must be careful, and I am mainly addressing the negotiating team: if the Union is to take a vengeful stance in the negotiations – and I am thinking mainly of Germany – then it will send a negative signal to the other countries of the Union and, above all, to the rest of the world. The US and Russia are working together to fight terrorism, while Putin and British Prime Minister May have agreed to develop bilateral trade and strategic relations. It is therefore time to abolish the sanctions regime in Russia, which only creates problems in the economically weakened countries of the Union. Finally, as far as Turkey is concerned, it must now be subject to severe sanctions, especially in the face of Erdogan's threats to release flows of illegal immigrants and refugees. The President of the European Council, Mr Tusk, said that Europe has no other opportunities to welcome new waves of migrants.

Another point is the issue of refugees. We have been hit harder than others by the refugee crisis, and when it comes to this issue, we must work with other partners to determine the root causes of the crisis, and the root causes are also political causes. We must not forget that refugees come from regimes that are not democratic and are far from the rule of law, and cooperation must therefore be committed to this.

He stressed that one of America's top priorities is the transatlantic partnership with the European Union.

I think it is an important fight, because public investment is a guarantee of quality jobs and social progress for all, but it is also an indispensable support for the real economy.  It is also sometimes a remedy for the flight or even the cowardly desertion of the private sector.

I urge the British Government to listen, to take action, and to ensure that Britain can maintain what it has in accessing 500 million consumers in 27 different countries with one single set of rules, ensuring certainty for business and the highest standards for consumers.

By all accounts, this year’s G20 summit was dominated by a new and overriding awareness. The rising anger of people at the ravages that present-day neoliberal globalisation has caused in their lives.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, your debate reflects both your interest in the G20 conclusions and also a number of frustrations, which I can understand, both on the conduct of the meeting itself and on its conclusions. What we all need to be aware of here - I say to those who would have liked to hear about this or that subject - is the nature of the G20. The G20 was created in the context of the economic and financial crisis of 2008-2013 to focus on economic and financial issues. Of course, geopolitical, strategic issues , such as Syria, were present. Of course, there was a whole discussion about Turkey's role, in the presence of President Erdogan, but the main objective was to take stock of the economic policy followed by the major countries on a global scale and to reach a number of directions. I say directions because the G20 is also not a place where highly operational conclusions can be adopted. There are some, I have quoted those that deal with the issue of overcapacity, but the G20, on the one hand, sets out signals that are quite important to the global economy and, on the other hand, gives a number of institutions - the FATF, the OECD - the missions that must be pursued. As this understanding of your frustrations is expressed, I also believe that the quality of this particular G20 meeting should not be underestimated. We could have hoped for more and something else, as always, and besides you hope for more and something else with your differences of sensitivity, which is quite natural. I believe that there is an opportunity in this G20 to seize in global cooperation and we must require our G20 partners to use this cooperation to promote even solid and comprehensive growth that can deliver tangible benefits for our fellow citizens, and then free and fair trade relations, once again for the benefit of all. , and more inclusive societies. The European Union brings to the debate valuable experience, that of the most advanced integration, the most successful on a continental scale in a large internal market, which makes us, the Europeans, the leading economic power in the world, and then also of a political model, a social model, a cultural model. We shared this experience in Hangzhou, both through the role of the President of the Council, that of the President of the Commission, but also with the European countries which are present in numbers and strength, because they are great economies. I think we have achieved results that reinforce a number of our priorities, which converge with them, and I have talked, for example, about the fight against tax evasion and tax evasion. This is a subject on which, for years, the G20 has been the place where a strategy implemented through the OECD with the BEPS initiative is being implemented, and which is converging with our own priorities and the action that, on behalf of the Commission, I am trying to push for a tax system that is both more transparent and more effective. We will have the opportunity to have many appointments on this subject in the coming months. It is true that you have both mentioned the situation in Britain and Brexit. I do not want to go back to what I am saying in the introduction, but perhaps one point, however, which concerns the negotiation of free trade agreements. On this point, President Juncker's conclusion and the reaction of our partners have been extremely clear. As we speak, the negotiation of Britain's exit has not begun. We are waiting for this to happen as soon as possible, understanding that we have to take some time to prepare, to set priorities, but not too long if we want the uncertainty not to spread and end up penalizing investment and economic activity. Then the negotiation will begin. All the while - and Parliament heard yesterday from Mr King, who is the Commissioner to represent Great Britain - Great Britain is a member of the European Union, so it is up to the European Union to negotiate free trade agreements and it is up to the Commission to do so on behalf of the European Union. So let us not have a functioning here that would be curious temporally, with bilateral negotiations, when the negotiation between Great Britain and the European Union has not begun and the European Union itself has its initiative. I was talking about Europe. Let us not forget a very important factor, which is that, in December, Germany will take the G20 presidency. This is of course an opportunity for us, the European Union, to work with a country of the Union, a major partner of the world community which knows, which shares, by definition, the priorities of the European Union. I expect a great deal from the work of Mr Schauble, as German Minister of Economy and Finance during this Presidency, at the level of the Ministers of Economy and Finance who are preparing the G20, and also from the German Presidency afterwards at the summit that will conclude it. The Commission will work closely with the German Presidency to prepare for the next G20 summit in Hamburg on 7-8 July 2017. We hope that some of the priority areas on which an agreement has been reached this time can make further progress and, quickly, we will work to ensure that there are strong priorities that are affirmed. There is no time to waste and, once again, I wanted to present these G20 conclusions as objectively as possible, aware of the limitations inherent in the exercise, but also of the undeniable quality of this meeting, and in its form and substance.

They confirm your huge interest in the agenda that was a subject of discussion at the G20 meeting in in China. Many issues were raised: economic growth, migration, free trade, tax evasion, steel, China, the Paris agreement and many others. I tried to present how we viewed the discussion on those issues in my initial statement. I share the views expressed by Commissioner Moscovici when he spoke on behalf of the Commission. All these items are extremely important. I dare say that we, as a union, have a clearly defined interest in those areas, but I think that the G20 Summit in China has reminded us once again that this is maybe the time for us to pull together, as a union, to work on those items in order to have an even better position when we try to protect the interests of the Union and its citizens on the global stage. We are committed as a Presidency to working intensively with you, Parliament, and the Commission on all the points mentioned so that, as I said, we can make progress and strengthen our position on the global stage.  Finally, two issues were raised which are part of our Presidency’s responsibility. Mr Telička asked about our further steps as the Presidency when it comes to TTIP. I can say that this will be very high on the agenda for the upcoming Foreign Affairs Trade Council, which will take place on 23 September in Bratislava. I believe this is the place where we Member States, together with the Commission, should assess where we stand in negotiations with the United States. This may be, I dare say, the last moment for us to consolidate our position together and look where progress is still possible in the remaining time of the Obama Administration. But we are aware that our mandate says very clearly where our offensive interests lie, and we as a Presidency will do our utmost to ensure that those interests are protected. On the Paris agreement, which was also mentioned several times, I can assure you that we as a Presidency are currently trying to agree on a clear timetable that will allow the ratification of the Paris agreement on behalf of the European Union so as to ensure the participation of the EU at the upcoming COP 22 Marrakesh meeting on global climate change.  Finally, I should have said at the beginning – but I came late and I apologise for that – that we as a Presidency are trying to control the agenda. I found out this morning that I was not able to control the traffic in Strasbourg, but it was a very nice walk.

In particular, the responses that emerged from the G20 summit with regard to these last two priorities deserve positive attention. Finally, there is an awareness that we must tackle together the effects of the migration crisis that has hit Europe, in order to respond to the needs of refugee protection and the root causes of a crisis that has resulted in the death of thousands of human lives. In addition, as G20 leaders have promised, a collective response will be needed to combat the oversupply of some countries in the steel sector, China over all.

One of the negative consequences for Croatia is the impossibility of successful steelworks operations in Split and Sisak, where hundreds of jobs were irreversibly destroyed as a result of price movements on the world market, as well as other problems.

The first question I think we should ask ourselves is why this scandal was not discovered in the European Union; why in the European Union we were not able to uncover fraud of such magnitude. Clearly, the answer is not easy but there are many factors, which I would like to discuss here today, which explain this. First of all, obviously, a lack of Europe. A lack of Europe due, above all, to insufficient integration. I have no doubt that if we had been a true United States of Europe, this scandal could not have happened. But I am sure, without a doubt, that if it had been the United States of Europe, our consumers, the millions of Europeans who use a car every day, would have been more protected. But I have no doubt that if we had a single judicial system, consumers in the European Union would certainly be more protected. There is another factor that also explains why we have come to this situation. Undoubtedly, Commissioner Verheugen's vague legislation also explains why we have not been able to uncover this scandal and - more importantly - why this scandal has been able to occur. In addition, I believe that we have to make self-criticism, because Commissioner Verheugen precisely negotiated in this house, with some of our colleagues, legislation which, as time has shown, has been insufficient. Commissioner Tajani arrived and tried to put the bell on the cat to try to push for legislation that would be ambitious in reducing NOx emissions. We were all aware of the discrepancies. This same house approved a report showing that we were aware of the discrepancies between tests under real driving conditions and laboratory tests. The question is, did we do enough then? I think it's time to look to the future. What the European citizens of this Committee of Inquiry certainly expect is that we know the truth and, more importantly, that we make proposals to push for measures to prevent fraud like this from taking place again. And I have no doubt that all my colleagues will agree that we are going to try to get to this point. Crises are opportunities and this is undoubtedly the crisis that the automotive sector needed to adapt to a reality of the twentieth century much more demanding with emissions, much more demanding in the search for new mobility formulas. And we have to be aware that the income of twelve million families is at stake. We need to be rigorous enough, not only to guarantee the incomes of these families, but above all, to give them a better future. There is no point in acknowledging that we should have known about this fraud; what we have to do now is discover the truth and, above all, and most importantly, look to the future.

This interim report is primarily procedural and there was a reason for it, because we only just started with our work. There is, however, one strong political point in it and that is that we call upon the Commission to better and more swiftly cooperate with the work of our committee of inquiry. That was the case when we adopted this interim report in committee. I must say that since then the Commission has considerably improved its cooperation, and I hope that we can continue that way of working.  So far, our committee of inquiry has collected a lot of, well, let us say, technical evidence. We spoke with car manufacturers, producers of emission control technologies, software experts, academics, NGOs. Most of the technical part we have done so far, and we have just begun with the political part of our inquiry. We have had hearings with a whole bunch of Commissioners starting with former Commissioners Dimas, Potočnik, Verheugen and Tajani, and yesterday evening with the current Commissioners Bieńkowska and Vella.  Very crucial also will be our focus on the Member States; I am very much looking forward to the hearings with national ministers in the coming weeks, and I sincerely call upon those ministers who have not yet confirmed their attendance to do so. European democracy also means that national ministers are accountable for their position in Europe. We will also hear the American EPA and the national type approval authorities.  What have we found so far? Well, first of all, we of course discovered that this is much more than just the Volkswagen case. We have seen that other car manufacturers are shutting down their emission abatement technology when the temperature goes below 17°C, or after 22 minutes. That comes close to the 20-minute test cycle, so we have seen that the problem is much bigger than just Volkswagen and that is something that we have to explore further on. Also we still have a lot of questions concerning the role of Member States. We do see that there has been quite a weak implementation and enforcement of European legislation and that is something that we sincerely have to discuss very closely with the national ministers. Another question that we are still digging into is why did it take so long to develop this new real driving emission test? In 2010 the Commission work document said that it would take roughly two years for the technical exercise to develop this test; we all know that it took many many more years and that is something that we have to dig into as well.  Finally, it is one year since the scandal broke and since then we have done a lot, but there are still millions and millions of diesel cars on the European roads that do not comply with current legislation. That is something that we have discussed yesterday with Commissioner Bieńkowska and I am very happy with her strong approach now. We are awaiting, within weeks, some infringement procedures, but it is certainly something that we are still going to focus upon. Also the recall of vehicles, that is still primarily based on a voluntary approach.  I am very much looking forward to the coming months. We will conclude our report in March next year and I hope that we can draw not only conclusions about what happened in the past, but also some conclusions, some lessons for the future, because that might be the most important part of our inquiry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 53, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this is an important debate and I am glad to be here. Firstly, I would like to thank both the rapporteurs for their work. It has been almost a year since the Volkswagen emissions scandal broke, and more than six months have passed since the Committee of Inquiry on Emission Measurements in the Automotive Sector started its work. This was, for both of us, a period of very intense work, both for Parliament and for the Commission. I can assure you that I did my best to act in full cooperation and transparency, and I am committed to continue to do so: to fully cooperate with Parliament in the months to come and until the end of the work of the inquiry committee.  I have done whatever I could to answer all of your questions. I know that you are not fully satisfied, but we tried to do our best and we will continue to do so. I am convinced that this is the best way to uncover all the facts, and to help conclude on the best way forward: for the Commission in its role as a legislator, for the Member States in their efforts to enforce the law, and for the industry to be credible, modern and environmentally conscious. We are ready to help as much as we can, but, of course, we expect, and I also expect, Member States to be equally transparent and cooperative. The Commission has invited Member States to investigate the presence of defeat devices in the vehicles circulating on their territories and to report back to us. Until now, four Member States – the UK, Germany, France and Italy – have prepared such reports. These reports have been made available to the Commission and to the general public at the same time. The Commission recently, by the end of July, transmitted to the European Parliament a first overview on the national investigation. But unfortunately we do not have the complete picture yet. The data submitted by Member States is incomplete and there are still many outstanding questions for which additional technical information is still needed. We, and myself personally, are disappointed with where things stand for now. We need this technical information to be able to make an independent judgement on what has happened. I have insisted with Member States that they should transmit this information to the Commission, and I will continue doing so, while of course continuing to monitor how the national investigations progress. Let me also add one word on defeat devices. They have been prohibited in the EU for more than 18 years now. The legal provisions on defeat devices are clear. Manufacturers, and every type approval authority, never questioned these rules or how they should be implemented. If they do not honour these rules, there must be consequences because this is a law.  I am ready to help in ensuring a coherent interpretation of the rules across the Single Market. For that reason I offered, with my services, to provide practical guidance to the national authorities on how to handle emissions control systems at type approval. We are confident that this will ensure a coherent approach across all EU territory. We all know that enforcement for now is the key problem to be urgently solved. We face the current situation because of lenient enforcement and weak market surveillance. We have proposed to change this and to enforce the current system. A new supervisory system with Commission oversight and mutual control between Member States, together with EU penalties, is crucial for overcoming the problems we are facing today. It will also be key to restore the confidence of our citizens which was very seriously harmed.  The Commission tabled its proposal in January 2016 and it is now up to the European Parliament and the Council to decide. No position has been reached yet in the Council. We would like the work on the draft report of Mr Dalton and the Internal Market Committee to proceed as quickly as possible, but also to adopt the proposal as soon as possible. The reluctance – I would even say the resistance to necessary changes – is discouraging, not to say disappointing. To succeed, we need your support to keep the level of ambition of this proposal. I particularly hope that the work of the EMIS Committee can demonstrate how important the proposed changes to our type approval system are. I therefore call on all of you to deal with the past, but as always I would say to pave the way for the future. Otherwise, a year of very intensive work will not be satisfactory in bringing tangible change. We will continue to fully cooperate with you in the months to come, and of course I would like to say that the Commission welcomes your interim report. I wish both of us success in the forthcoming weeks and months.

We have heard a variety of witnesses for almost half a year. They come from the scientific and research community, from non-governmental organisations, from the car industry, to suppliers, etc., as well as from the European Commission. What then in this half-year – what have we learned? The first is the question: how did we get to where we are at all? What we have listened to is that in Europe we are, for ideological reasons, I am not saying that, for wrong reasons, we set the main objective of reducing CO2 emissions. The result was to encourage, deliberately stimulate the development of the diesel industry and the interest of buyers in the purchase of diesel engines, but ignored or revised the fact that, although diesel has low CO2 emissions, he has high levels of nitrogen dioxide, oxides, various, nokši called, which are directly harmful to human health. Chasing one goal, it was reviewed that he had a side effect, a negative effect on human health. Second. The adoption of the last regulation on car emission standards, in Euro 5 and 6 in 2007, did not resolve the already known difficulties with road emissions that they are much higher than laboratory.

So, we need to learn from ideology, however, it is necessary to consider all the side effects that might be.

We were shocked because of the behaviour of one of the largest and most epic, iconic European companies, trying to increase their own profits at the expense of planet and people. But we were equally shocked because it was not our European institutions or our many type approval authorities or market surveillance bodies that discovered this fraud, but it had been discovered in the States. So rightly we decided to install a Committee of Inquiry committee in the European Parliament – it is the first Committee of Inquiry for more than 10 years – looking at the maladministration, but also making sure that we get the truth above the waterline. This EMIS committee should also rebuild the trust in the European legislation but also in our European products. We are halfway now, and we discovered that it is not only Volkswagen, but many other companies that overstretched loopholes – the legal loopholes – by switching off emission control under a broad range of operational conditions, with the result that after 10 years we have now more emissions and our legal system is being violated. An average diesel car today emits 4 to 5 times more.  Of course, the future of RDE will solve part of the problem but, Madam Commissioner, we were very happy with your statements yesterday. We have to take into account that we also have to readjust the situation as it is today. Cars with illegal defeat strategies are entering our markets daily, letting them emit too much, and that will cause extra pollution for the years to come. In the next month we will focus on the Member States, and that will equally be very important.

Even former Industry Commissioner Günter Verheugen – one of the predecessors of the Commissioner sitting here today – has had to admit, when I have asked, that the European directives were far too vague. We must also now realise that the American exhaust directives are much more demanding than the European ones and, as has already been discussed, it was the Americans who exposed this scandal, not the Europeans. We are only drawing the logical conclusion from this: we call on the Commission to include in the negotiations on TTIP the harmonisation of the emission directives for motor vehicles and to recognise the higher standards of the other partner. This has great advantages. Firstly, it improves the protection of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic from harmful emissions. Secondly, the costs of developing and producing different exhaust systems are drastically reduced. Thirdly, the benefits of a free trade agreement could thus be demonstrated in an impressive way.

The Commission's negotiating mandate formulates clear questions – to investigate alleged failures by the Commission and the Member States. Measures should have been taken to supervise the use of so-called defeat devices, i.e. defeat defeat devices, and in fact they were not. Emissions measurements corresponding to car traffic should have been introduced – and if it hadn't been for the US revelations, we wouldn't have this either. During the hearing before the Committee of Inquiry, experts said it was a long-known problem. Diesel cars did not meet real-world emission limits and could even use various means to do so. On the other hand, the European Commission denies that it erst or has been delayed and is said to have been unaware of possible fraudulent conduct. Lots of questions, lots of unexplained questions. Without a clear answer to these questions, we will not be able to restore the confidence of European consumers, and I personally consider this to be one of the main objectives of our efforts. I would therefore like to call on the rapporteur to make the resulting document, which comes from the work of the Committee of Inquiry, absolutely clear and user-friendly in its communications.

We should learn from the conclusions of the investigation and translate it into further forthcoming legislation in this area, such as vehicle type-approval and emission measurement rules.

An industry for which further procrastination may be a drag on further development.

On the contrary, after many hours of hearings and study of internal documents, it is now clear that there are serious political responsibilities. Both the 2010 estimates and the Study of the Commission's Joint Research Centre in 2013 confirmed that measurements could be altered. And yet, no action was taken. The Commission was aware of the possibility of fraud, but did nothing on the grounds that it was not aware of specific cases. Although the Member States were informed, they also did not do any checks. Moreover, while it was known that emission measurements are much higher in real-world conditions than those recorded in laboratories, no checks were requested only in real road conditions. There have therefore been significant omissions by both the Commission and the Member States in the application of Union law and in the imposition of sanctions.

In April - May 2014, US authorities get detailed data showing discrepancies. They did not know anything about defeat devices. What did the US authorities do in that moment? They called in VW and asked them a very simple question: Please can you explain the discrepancy between the test in the lab and your very high emissions on the road? One meeting, a second meeting, a third and fourth meeting, a fifth meeting: VW lied and lied and lied. Fifteen months later in September 2015 US authorities say ‘It’s game over’ and VW has to admit massive fraud. Then VW tried to carry out recall campaigns in the US. They proposed one recall campaign, a second one, a third one. The US authorities had one very simple question: please show us that your NOx emissions are fulfilling the law after the recall. VW was not able to show that, not one single recall campaign was admitted, therefore action 3 came: compensation of consumers and huge fines for not having respected the law.  So Obama and his administration were merely doing their job. You have an industry which commits fraud, and they get caught. What have we done in Europe? We had the same information as the US, years earlier. We had it in winter 2009-2010. The Commission and Member States did not once ask a manufacturer the same question that the US did: Please explain to us the discrepancy between on-road and the lab. Why still no infringement procedures? So the Commission is part of this omertá . Second thing: it is very interesting that the same VW recall campaign which was refused by the American authorities has now been admitted and waved through by KBA; so VW is cheating against consumers, this time with the official logo of the German Government. You come here today with no single action on recall. Why do you not act on recall? You could act on recall. And the third issue is compensation. No compensation, so recapitulation: the Juncker Commission comes here and says ‘restore confidence’. No infringement procedures, despite the facts that you know.

The report is deliberately incomplete and omissionary: the surveys of the 15 cars initially mentioned in the report follow different procedures depending on whether they are fca group cars or not; Fiat cars are even tested in Fiat laboratories in Turin, while other cars are tested in other CNR laboratories. The traces of some Fiat and Jeep models are completely lost, which literally disappear from the graphs and tables of the document – coincidentally they are precisely the models for which there are the strongest suspicions that mount illegal devices, in one case devices that seem to turn off after twenty-two minutes, exactly two minutes after the end of the homologation test cycle and , in the other, a model that in the hot test demonstrated emissions of nitrogen oxides three times the norm.

For many years now, there have been more than just rumours, mrs Bie-kowska, that we have not only a VW scandal, but perhaps also scandals at other car manufacturers.

If we take legislation seriously in the European Union, if we regulate these matters at European level, then we must claim to have the appropriate quality assurance systems in place. Instead, we now rely on the findings of American agencies. And perhaps the different economic interests of the United States and Europe also play a role here. Not only should we allow ourselves to be dareed by the carts of the Americans, but we should develop our own independent findings. That must be the European Union's ambition.

We should continue on the path of objective work. Of course, the appeal is always there to exploit such an issue politically. There are always colleagues who claim that the Commission, and in particular individual Commissioners, knew about the cheating software. Alone, the proof has not yet been provided.

It has been stated on numerous occasions that there has been a lack of knowledge and a lack of credible evidence as to the effects of diesel on public health. But, of course, part of the reason why that evidence was not forthcoming is the myriad of levels of responsibility that exist under the current frameworks, ensuring that nobody can take full responsibility for what has happened.

The Commissioner is absolutely correct when she says that we must use what we find out in this committee of inquiry to make sure that forthcoming legislation does not have the same mistakes, and does not contain the same loopholes and opportunities for ambiguous interpretation of what must be very clear rules.

According to data from this year's European Environment Agency, more than 70,000 people die prematurely in the European Union as a result of high levels of nitric oxide in the atmosphere. We also know that road traffic and in particular diesel engines are the predominant sources of these gases in urban areas. In the face of the difficulties of the municipalities in halting the problem of air quality, which we are witnessing in European policy? We are witnessing a European Commission which, at the very least, can be described as omitted, inoperative and dysfunctional. This appears in the eyes of the European citizen as a hostage to a so-like and illusory industrial competitiveness that is sought dishonestly and cheating by some major operators in the automotive industry. Undoubtedly, industrial competitiveness is an objective for which we must be hit. But is it undoubtedly this way that we will achieve it?  Let us instead invest in technological innovation, try to respond to the needs of citizens with a better quality of life in cities, invest in more sustainable and more efficient urban transport, invest in renewables and cleaner and cheaper electricity mobility, and look at what others, our competitors, are doing at the moment. It is shameful that we have not been able to detect and act on fuel emissions fraud and that others have done so for us. Let us also look at how the Americans have taken responsibility and taken steps to ensure the protection of the legitimate interests of consumers. It is important that the committee of inquiry is able to re-embody the truth about this whole process.

Illegal defeat devices are clearly, as they say, illegal. This must be punished, and this is also provided for in the legislation. One must also have doubts as to whether Volkswagen can be pilloried here alone. If I look, for example, at what the Italian company Fiat is producing in such a headline at the moment, it must be made clear once again that the authorities should be scrutinising this very, very strongly.  Secondly, with the RDE measurements that are about to come, illegal defeat devices are pointless. Unrealistic laboratory measurements that have nothing to do with reality will be a thing of the past. This is where the European level has delivered. We have taken the right path here, and Commissioner Tajani has played a corresponding role in this.  Thirdly, defeat devices due to component protection: only many experts knew that this was possible, but rather not to the general population. I think that the committee has also shown that the manufacturers have partly crossed the arc. However, as an engineer, I would also like to make it quite clear that we need these defeat options, which are legal, within a very narrow framework, because it must be possible to protect the technology at extremely high or low temperatures or under other conditions.

What will happen in the future is hard to tell because technology is evolving so quickly. We were late in introducing better laboratory testing. We are now on track.

Of course we have to take note so that in the future, which is the most important thing, these things will not happen again. We're talking about our health.

So one thing, for example – I will summarize it in my words: VW could obviously only achieve the 80 milligrams of NOX registered in California in the USA with diesel cars with fraudulent software. Fraud is, of course, a criminal offence and to be condemned. In Europe, the limit value is much higher and, above all, it is quite obvious – known to everyone or to anyone who wanted to know – a high tolerance factor. That is, 600 milligrams came out instead of 180 milligrams, more than three times as much.  That is why it seems that the legal situation for car owners in Europe is different from that in the United States. We must learn from this that it is important that we naturally try to reduce emissions, that is, as far as greenhouse gas CO2 is concerned now, but also, for example, to ensure clean air and fewer pollutants. We must have the framework conditions that allow industry to produce realistic things and which enable consumers to have confidence in, so to speak, healthy vehicles.

That is why it is necessary that, in the case of type approval, type approval, we pay particular attention to ensuring that the exhaust gas cleaning systems in accordance with Euronorm 6 are also technically installed. And it is precisely here that it is necessary to comply with 80 milligrams per kilometre of NOx here in Germany under laboratory conditions, and it is necessary to react to the American market as well. But it has 70 milligrams per mile; that's 44 milligrams per kilometer. This can only be done by using such AdBlue or Blue Motion technology, aqueous urea, so to speak, in an exhaust gas purification system that binds these nitrosen gases, this NOx, and converts them into molecular nitrogen, which is completely harmless to humans and water. This is the issue we will deal with at type approval, so that such things can no longer happen. Market surveillance must be carried out, and this market surveillance must also test the newly registered vehicles on a random basis, even in the case of real driving emissions. It is clear, of course, that it makes a huge difference in terms of exhaust emissions, whether you are using fuel at 130 kilometres per hour or 170 kilometres per hour or 200 kilometres per hour. This must be compensated with new technologies. Only in this way will we actually achieve this objective. It is stipulated that by 2017 or 2019, I believe 168 milligrams of NOx may be emitted under real driving emission conditions and by 2021 only 129 milligrams. That must be our aim.

There is no doubt for me that we have a common objective: that we have to uncover fully the defeat devices scandal, that we have to draw the best appropriate conclusions from it, and that we have to move forward. Our guiding principles, for all of us, must be truth and transparency. Again, let me underline that I will do all that is necessary, and use the Commission’s mandate and power as a regulator and as a guardian of the Treaty, to restore confidence in the law and trust in the industry. However, let me be honest about it: I do not really want to play the blame game that we are seeing now. I am the last person to do this but I have to be very vocal and say loudly that I cannot, with 100% confidence, blame other car manufacturers, because I do not have the full evidence. I am sending several letters to the Member States, and I will continue to push them, as I am doing now, but I do not have any legal power in this respect. Some of you mentioned EU recalls, and I would very much like to go ahead with EU recalls, but I do not have any legal basis right now on which to do so. I agree it is very odd that in some Member States we are seeing mandatory recalls, in some voluntary recalls, and in some nothing. This is not appropriate and it should not go on like this. However, I believe the Member States have really started to understand that we have to break with some past practices: that they have to be transparent, and give us all the relevant information, the technical and other information, that we need; and that it is their commitment to establishing real market surveillance that will be key to future success. I need the commitment from the Member States – as, of course, I need it from you – so that we will be able to put in place a modern, efficient coherent framework for approving cars, and I want to be very clear about it. I am not doing this against the industry, quite the contrary. I am the Commissioner responsible for industry and I will do all that it takes for the car industry to flourish, to be competitive and to be respected. However, in the interests of the industry today – and I hope that the industry also starts to understand it – I need to be tough, we need to be tough, and we need to be demanding on the industrial side. I want to use this current crisis – and I hope this is a common goal – to put better legislation in place, to have more efficient market surveillance and structures and to move industry into a really new dimension of performance, mobility and automation. I am certain that, with your support and engagement, together, and definitely not blaming each other because that leads us nowhere, we will be able to achieve those objectives.

Why did I believe that it was so encouraging? Because I noticed a very broadly shared common understanding of the problem that did not necessarily already reach commonly shared conclusions, but will be the challenge for my dear colleague, Pablo Zalba, and myself to get Parliament behind shared conclusions in the end. But I do believe that we are on the right track. We should not forget that we are only half-way through our investigation. There is still a lot to be investigated and a lot of evidence to be found. I would like to highlight two elements. I think it was Seb Dance who very eloquently talked about the myriad of responsibilities. He said – and many others did as well – that there seems to be nobody really responsible in the end – not the Commission, not a Member State, not national authorities, etc. That might be the core of the problem that we are facing here. I am sure that, when we dig much deeper into that, we can also draw conclusions for the future, not only reflecting the car industry, but other policy fields as well.  Finally, I think it was my colleague Ivo Belet who said that, if we look at responsibilities, a lot has to do with the inability of the Member States to take their responsibility. I believe that it is a very important thing that came today. Many talked about naming and shaming, whether to do so or not. I believe that in politics in a well-functioning democracy political accountability is crucial, and that might mean naming and shaming if that is necessary. I am not afraid of it and I am not looking for it, but it is part of a strong democracy. That is what we are still building together in Europe, so let us continue with that.

The situation that has arisen should be used to prepare new strategies and development plans for the period ahead, with particular emphasis on new innovative technologies. After all, it has now become clear that the car industry is facing major and profound changes. This is a very complex process in which account must be taken of the fact that, at the moment, in the automotive industry, technologies based on conventional fuels and new alternative solutions will continue to move on parallel lines for many years to come.

The Committee of Inquiry is currently collecting and analysing information concerning the use of defeat mechanisms in the measurement of emissions by individual carmakers. This should continue during the autumn of this year. In particular, the follow-up report and the resulting recommendations will be important. Their observance should help to ensure that similar situations do not occur on such a large scale in the future. The functioning of the automotive industry is a significant factor in economic growth and employment. The emissions case has shown the importance of greening the whole sector. There is also a need to focus on limiting the use of heavy metals and other pollutants in individual components and components in cars. Member States have already committed themselves to this in 2003. Nevertheless, to this day, there are a number of exceptions.

Firstly, Article 286 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the Council, after consulting the European Parliament, is to adopt a list of members for the European Court of Auditors drawn up in accordance with the proposals made by the Member States. Of course, this means strictly formally that Parliament should only have a consultative role, but that does not mean that the Council should also respect and respect the will of the European Parliament. I therefore think, as has happened in some previous cases, that this time and in the future the Council sees and takes seriously the Position of the European Parliament in these candidacies, otherwise I do not know why we are implementing this whole procedure if, in the end, the Council has a decisive say. And I think for good cooperation in the future, that's important information. Secondly, the fact that, on today's list of candidates for new members of the European Court of Auditors, there are once again only male candidates on today's list of candidates for new members of the European Court of Auditors. And Parliament has long pointed out the importance of gender balance. Parliament's report on the role of the European Court of Auditors in the future states that Parliament will take the issue of gender balance among the Members of the Court of Auditors very seriously. And for information only: at present, only four members of the European Court of Justice represent only four members out of a total of 28 members. And if the pace continues as it seems, the picture will be even more defeatless. I think, however, in comparison, I would add that it is this Parliament that made it clear to the then candidate Juncker that the number of Commissioners in the current Commission should not be lower than the number of Commissioners of the previous College.

A significant part of the European population lives in cross-border areas and, in turn, these cross-border regions are mostly depressed regions, often suffering from the problems inherent in the interiority and remoteness of large centres.  We regret, however, all the propaganda around the successive Interreg programmes, as if it were possible to do something tangible with just a few crumbs. It is perhaps not by chance that there is no minimally objective balance on the impact of 25 years of territorial cooperation. There is no visible impact on the socio-economic development of these regions, much less on cross-border permeability, whether on trade or on infrastructure sharing.  But the criticism we make extends to cohesion policy at the global level, which is, of course, extended to territorial cooperation. This cohesion policy which has led to a substantial cut in the current multiannual framework is unfortunately increasingly a mirage and is increasingly on the backof the European Union's neoliberal agendas. Cohesion policy is today conditioned not on the needs of local regions and development strategies, but rather on the neoliberal agenda of the European Union.  The most serious policy, cohesion policy, in the implementation, tends to become an element of asymmetries, when we see funds to support innovation centralised in the richest countries in the North, and funds to support long-term unemployment are drained to the South with the aim of alleviating the consequences of liberalisation policies imposed by the European Union. We need to put an end to this situation by breaking with this model and strering for a new Europe of peace and cooperation.

The Committee of Inquiry is currently collecting and analysing information concerning the use of defeat mechanisms in the measurement of emissions by individual carmakers. This should continue during the autumn of this year. In particular, the follow-up report and the resulting recommendations will be important. Their observance should help to ensure that similar situations do not occur on such a large scale in the future. The functioning of the automotive industry is a significant factor in economic growth and employment. The emissions case has shown the importance of greening the whole sector. There is also a need to focus on limiting the use of heavy metals and other pollutants in individual components and components in cars. Member States have already committed themselves to this in 2003. Nevertheless, to this day, there are a number of exceptions.

The Committee of Inquiry on Emission Measurements in the automotive sector, together with the EC, is carrying out an important task. It is more than obvious that we have poor market control over what is happening in the automotive sector in the EU. The scandal that has been uncovered in VW is not isolated, and we find this after defeat devices in the European Union have been officially banned for 18 years.  Diesel vehicles with inadequate defeat devices are still driving on our roads, thus polluting our atmosphere. Reducing CO2 emissions is an important task for all, and it is therefore necessary to react more decisively to such scandals, including by detecting and properly sanctioning those responsible. The European Regulation is too vague in this area, as, despite the legal prohibition on the use of defeat devices, it leaves too many possibilities for interpretation as to the use of these devices, and it is therefore necessary to regulate this as soon as possible. It is also important that the Member States cooperate in this investigation, in addition to the European Commission and the European Parliament.

Both the 2010 estimates and the study of the Commission's Joint Research Centre in 2013 confirmed that measurements could be altered and no action was taken. The Commission was aware of the possibility of fraud but did nothing on the grounds that it was not aware of specific cases. And the Member States, although informed, also did not do any checks.

After a very short pasage (in 1966) by Barclays, he held various political positions throughout his career: Secretary of The Prime Minister's Office, member of the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives, Minister of Finance and Trade and member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. At the same time, he was Director of Research and Strategy at HSBC Malta.  Leo Brincat is a controversial figure. While his role is to fight corruption, he openly supported Maltese Minister Konrad Mizzi (Labour Party), whose name appeared in the Panama Papers case.

One of the most important reasons why these prices are to be compulsorily monitored in the long term is the comparability of the data collected. Gas and electricity supply are currently typical network sectors. Fortunately, the parameters of both electricity and gas are unified in the EU countries (voltage and frequency stability for AC, quality parameters for natural gas). However, the price for the final consumer has at least two components, the price per quantity (normal cubic meters for gas, kWh) and the price per supply. In particular, for the various 'supply prices', we see the need to define which charges will be part of the price of energy under transport and network usage respectively, and which are the amount of energy consumed. This is mainly about excise duties and variously structured network connection charges. The Regulation is intended to harmonise the methodology for the reporting of prices in order to eliminate any identified ambiguities. This is how we can get reliable statistical information. Reference periods, frequency of data transmission and possibility of granting exemptions are defined. The report is quite clear, I hope that the practical application of this regulation will not find fundamental ambiguities.

In this context, I consider it extremely important that, in order to achieve the objectives of the Energy Union strategy, a fundamental transformation of the European Union's (EU) electricity system should take place, enabling network operators, producers and consumers, both in households and in industry, to make full use of new technologies. I am pleased that the EU entered 2015 with a commitment – in addition to combating the causes of climate change – to provide its citizens and businesses with a secure and affordable energy supply. I think that the adoption of the global climate agreement in Paris in December (adopted by 195 countries) has sent a clear signal to investors, businesses and policy makers that the global clean energy transition is an irreversible process, with a necessary departure from the use of polluting fossil fuels.

The measures taken should focus primarily on ensuring better conditions of access to the labour market for women: creating the conditions for returning to work after the birth of a child and preventing gender discrimination when applying for posts. Furthermore, we should facilitate access to parental leave among fathers. An important problem is the current pay gap in the same positions, which means that it is mothers who take leave to look after their children. We must also not forget single mothers who often work above the norm to ensure decent conditions for their children. Conditions must be created in which they will have the opportunity to reconcile work and the obligation to raise a child. To this end, we must strive to improve care services and make them more accessible.

Let me start by saying that the Presidency, and indeed all of us, agree that the protection of the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights in our Union are of crucial importance. Today’s debate relates to the follow-up to the dialogue established between the Polish authorities and the Commission concerning, in particular, the position of the constitutional tribunal and the governance of public media. As the Presidency said here in January, both the independence of tribunals and freedom and pluralism of media are indispensable elements in ensuring the rule of law in a democratic society. The commitment to protecting and promoting human rights is a constant challenge, requiring unwavering attention and effort across the full range of policy areas. This is not the time to be complacent about the protection of fundamental rights. As we all know, the European Union is currently facing multiple interrelated crises. Those challenges test our core values in different ways, including in respect of fundamental rights, be it in the area of migration or internal security. It should be our joint commitment – Member States and the EU institutions together – to ensure that these principles consistently remain a central part of our action. Fundamental rights need to be upheld and defended as our best guarantee for sustainable, open and free societies. In June, the Council stressed the importance of applying the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a part of the wider set of applicable fundamental rights sources in the national context. Also, this year’s rule of law dialogue in the Council focuses on fundamental values in the context of the integration of third-country nationals. The rule of law and the separation of powers are at the heart of the European Union and also of the wider European continent. Our strongest partner, equally engaged in the promotion, protection and development of human rights and the rule of law, is the Council of Europe. In this context, I would like to mention three elements. Firstly, the annual report of the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe on the state of democracy, human rights and the rule of law has just been published, and I am of the view that being committed to the rule of law and fundamental rights also means being open to discussing problems and accepting constructive criticism. It is in that light that the report of the Council of Europe’s Secretary-General is an important contribution. Secondly, the same applies to the report by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, published in June 2016 following his visit to Poland and taking into account the comments of the Polish authorities. Last, but not least, the Council of Europe’s guidance, in the form of the opinions of the Venice Commission in this area, is also of great value, and its views should be taken seriously by all Member States. The Council is aware of the situation and of the fact that the Polish authorities are in constant contact with both the Venice Commission and the European Commission. Together they are working on finding a solution to the issues raised. Vice-President Timmermans will update us on the ongoing process and on his contacts with the Polish authorities following the recommendation issued by the Commission on 27 July 2016, and I look forward to hearing from him. The issues at stake go to the heart of our commitment to this Union. We therefore trust that all sides act responsibly and constructively to reach a swift solution that leaves no doubt about our core values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3114, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Honourable Members for putting the recent developments in Poland on the agenda of the plenary today. The last time we discussed the issue of the rule of law in plenary was in January. Today I would like to talk about what has happened since and what action the Commission has taken. As you know, the dispute concerning the composition and functioning of the Constitutional Tribunal led the Commission in January to open a dialogue with the Polish Government under the rule of law framework. We decided to do so because the rule of law is one of the fundamental values on which our Union is founded, as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty. Respect for the rule of law is also a prerequisite for upholding the full spectrum of EU law, including the proper functioning of the internal market, and for mutual trust throughout the Union. I would like to thank Parliament for the strong support for this position which is expressed in the resolution adopted in April. Very similar concerns were expressed in an opinion of the Council of Europe Venice Commission last March, an opinion, I might add, that it issued at the explicit request of the Polish Government. Since then extensive exchanges at various levels have taken place between the Commission and the Polish Government. In order to set out the Commission’s concerns in writing and to focus the ongoing dialogue with the Polish authorities towards finding a solution in June, the Commission adopted an opinion. Following the opinion in July the Polish Parliament adopted a new law on the Constitutional Tribunal. Despite certain improvements, major concerns remained as regards the composition of the Constitutional Tribunal, the publication of judgments and the effectiveness of constitutional review by the Tribunal. For this reason, on 27 July, the Commission adopted a rule of law recommendation setting out its remaining concerns and recommending how these could be addressed.  The recommendation identifies three main issues: firstly, the composition of the Constitutional Tribunal, as the three judges lawfully elected in October by the previous legislator have still not been able to take up their function; secondly, the publication of all judgments of the Tribunal, which should be automatic and should not depend on any decision of the executive or legislature; and, thirdly, the effectiveness of the functioning of the Tribunal, which should not be undermined by the new law on the Constitutional Tribunal or by any other legislative reform. A functioning constitutional review procedure is also essential for ensuring full respect for the Constitution by other important laws in a wide range of areas which have been adopted by the Polish Parliament. The Commission asked the Polish authorities to address the remaining concerns within three months from the adoption of the resolution. Since our recommendation there have been a number of further developments, which I would like to mention. In particular, on 11 August, the Constitutional Tribunal rendered a judgment holding that a number of provisions of the new law on the Constitutional Tribunal are unconstitutional. However, the Polish Government refuses to recognise the validity of the judgment and to publish it in the Official Journal. Moreover, while the Polish Government has published a number of other judgments rendered by the Tribunal, it still refuses to publish the judgment of 9 March annulling the Constitutional Tribunal Act adopted last December. Therefore I must conclude that, at this stage, the dispute concerning the composition of the Constitutional Tribunal, and respect for its judgments, remains unresolved. That said, the Commission stands ready to continue the constructive dialogue with the Polish authorities in order to find solutions to the issues raised.  To conclude, I would like to thank Parliament for its continuous efforts to uphold the rule of law in the EU and for supporting the Commission’s actions concerning the situation in Poland. I would like to echo what was said by the representative of the Council. Upholding the rule of law is our joint responsibility, one that we all share – the Commission, Member States in the Council, and this House.

I doubt if they will know the truth from the Polish public media. This is not a debate about Poland, it is not even more a debate against Poland, it is a debate about the abuses of the current power, which pose serious threats to democracy, to the rule of law and ultimately turn against their own society.  (The President interrupted the speaker) Therefore, from the outset, Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent Today, it is important for Poles to know what this debate is about and what the European Parliament resolution will be about tomorrow. I doubted whether they would know the truth from the Polish public media. Well, this is not a debate about Poland or even more so against Poland, it is a debate about the abuses of the current power, which pose serious threats to democracy and civil liberties and thus ultimately turn against their own society.  Poland, understood as a collective work of Poles of the last quarter of a century, is a cause for pride. We have come a long way, from long-standing prejudices to a strong position in the European Union, a strong, dynamic economy and universal respect. Here, too, we have had a great time here, when Jerzy Buzek was the first president of the European Parliament to be elected president of the European Parliament, when 28 governments are represented here by Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, the man from Gdansk, where Solidarity was born.  However, it is not a cause for pride if Poland opens up a list of countries monitoring threats to democracy and the rule of law. It is no reason to be proud if Poland extends the list of European problems and is the addressee of a resolution such as in April this year, when the European Parliament expressed concern about developments in Honduras, Nigeria, Pakistan and Poland. What is wrong cannot be shielded by the mandate obtained in the elections, because poles did not vote for the paralysis of the Constitutional Court, which guarantees compliance with the law, did not vote for purge in the public media.  I would add that no selective publication of the judgments of the Constitutional Court improves this case, and the attempt to prosecute the head, the President of the Court, is completely out of the norms of our world. Poles did not vote in the parliamentary elections for purge in the public media, huge, 190 journalists turned into a tube of government propaganda. Poles did not vote to destroy the civil service and colonize the entire public space according to the principle of \"mediocre, but faithful\". Poles certainly did not vote for unauthorised interference with privacy and such changes in the law that could lead to abuse of the coercive apparatus, and this is in the hands of ministers who have carried out such abuses in the past. All this is perfectly visible to the democratic world. You can't hide or lie about it.  Today's debate, tomorrow's resolution, are testimonies of concern from real friends Polish. The concern is proportional to the hope that Poland has raised as an anchor of Europeanity in the east. The democratic world reprimanded Poland when bad things happened in the Polish state. Today he admonishes poland as a member of his family. It is admonished in the name of the principles and values inscribed in the Polish Constitution and in the Treaties, but importantly, these principles did not come out of nowhere. They don't come from dogma. They have arisen on a long path of trial and error, where a free society has found systemic principles that insure freedom and enable the organisation of an economy that is sustainable and promises to improve the quality of life. Those who violate these principles at the same time violate the security and future of their homeland.  Today I am speaking on behalf of the largest faction, the Christian Democrats, but I am also the voice of millions of Poles who feel good about a Europe without borders. They are at home, they know and remember the curse of geopolitics or centuries-old Polish loneliness, so they value very much the value of community for our security and our development opportunities. They can distinguish between the patriotism that builds and the nationalism that is ruining and causing many disasters on our continent. They do not want the price for the sins of the rulers to fall on the whole of Poland, so that the achievements of the generation that built the Polish brand are wasted. It is impossible to buy the permission of Poles to make Poland a problem for itself and for Europe through a simple spread of money.  John Paul II, our Pope, spoke to his compatriots in Rome in 2003 that Europe needs Polish, Poland needs Europe. I would add, wisely and Polish in a europe of solidarity. Then and only then will this be the last critical debate and critical resolution on Polish issues in the European Parliament.

I am now turning to the authors of the resolution – unfortunately I have the impression of theatre of absurdity. The European Union is going through the biggest crisis in its history – some say it is fatal – we have Brexit, we have the possibility of other Brexits, immigration, the euro, an increasingly less democratic way of making decisions – and you are organising a debate about Poland. And for what reason? I think that because your political comrades have lost monopoly power in Poland, and it is difficult for you to accept that. When they ruled Poland indivisible and did all sorts of horrible things, it didn't bother you, you were even delighted. You complimented it, suddenly it changed.  But going back to the resolution – the authors write there about a few laws and a few problems, but – I regret it – they have no particular knowledge of it. But they have gigantic prejudices. How do I treat, for example, the allegation that the Minister for the Environment has fundamentally changed the composition of the body, which is in fact an advisory body. Why do you write about it at all? What, the Minister cannot change his advisory composition? Is he supposed to ask you for permission? After all, it's absurd. How should I treat the fact that the authors do not like the fight against the printer's bark beetle, which destroys the Białowieża Forest. After all, most of you have no idea where the Białowieża Forest is, what is the Forest. You don't know anything about it. You don't know what a printer bark beetle is. Where does such a strong view of the fight against the printer bark beetle suddenly come from? Folks, this is not a matter for a majority vote, it is a matter for expertise that is still fraught with the risk of error. Don't pretend you know something about it because you don't know anything. Or how do I deal with comments about amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, where, for example, it is stated that the principle of the presumption of innocence is being infringed. This is crap – there is nothing like that. You don't point to a place where it rains because you can't point to something that's not there. You really need bad will to write such an absurd document. Or the media – the media is, of course, a matter of endless problem that we have been facing in Poland for twenty years. But so with our hand on our hearts, if we compare this media offer that we have now in Poland, this media offer in terms of worldview and politics has never in recent history Polish been wider. No more voices could be heard. Certainly, these voices were not heard when our predecessors ruled for eight years and when they chased down all the defiant journalists. I will say more – I think that this media offer, which is in Poland today, is much wider than what we see in many countries of the European Union, including Germany, Belgium or France. Why do you mind?  Well, I have an answer as to why this bothers you and where all these nonsense in this resolution come from. Because it directs you to a deep prejudice to the Polish Government and to everything that this government represents. The truth is that you are organically incapable of accepting that there may be governments and parties that differ from you and that these views are right. Pluralism in the European Union is such pluralism as in the case of the Ford Model T, where all colors could be, provided it was black. In the European Union, all views are good, provided that these are views in line with the orthodoxy of the European Union. If someone is different from that, you can say anything about it and write anything, if someone agrees with it, can do anything and find absolution here.  And two more words, Mr President, if you will, about the Commission and the European Commission, which is breaking the rules of the Treaties. The rule of law procedure that has been initiated against us is in fact a procedure of non-rule of law, because it is a violation of the Treaties. We asked, my colleagues, to ask the European Commission, on the basis of what studies and legal analyses, proceedings had been initiated against the Polish Government. And the Commission sent us a text which, I apologise for these words, was a complete asemantic gibberish and contained no content. Unfortunately , I serve this text, I serve this text, please. I don't think so. I pointed out to President Timmermans, during the last debate here, that he is using a blatantly false reconstruction of the facts concerning what has happened to the Constitutional Court in Poland, but Mr Timmermans, as is customary, does not respond substantively, but resorted to the wonderful rhetoric that I admire and am full of appreciation – the Lord says beautifully – only that it is unfortunately devoid of substance. The Lord does not respond with arguments. Recently published studies, commissioned by the Polish, by a group of fifteen law professors, on the Court of Justice constitutional law and this whole crisis, which is a serious crisis – I do not deny it. But unlike you, you here, I do not see an easy solution to this crisis. Here, however, goodwill is needed on all sides, and there is no goodwill. This report has been sent to the Council of Europe and has been sent to the European Commission, i.e. the last few hours. I will be very happy if, on behalf of the European Commission, President Timmermans answers all these arguments – but really arguments – because if you want to show off your cicero swashes here, I know you can. But I would like you to really and for you, on behalf of the Commission, to say that these arguments are wrong, that they are right, that it is completely different. I am very much looking forward to such an answer. Finally, I wanted to say something else about the Commission. I say this with regret, because it is not such a thing that easily passes through the mouth, but it must be said. Ladies and see, in the case of Polish, the European Commission usurps three functions: prosecutor, judge and executor – that is, it is doing something that is actually contrary to the legal, political European tradition. Such an accumulation of three functions in one hand is characteristic of European enlightened despotism, and it is, I would say, less and less European, less and less enlightened. But whatever you say wrong about Poland, the standards that are in place in Poland today are much better, much clearer, giving people much more pluralism, not only than what we have heard here today – you just have to put a little effort into getting to know them, you really need to be interested – but also than in many other European countries, including those standards that the European Union has recently wanted to impose.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3118, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Sophia in ’t Veld", "mepid": "28266", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I would like to say this to our colleague Mr Legutko: I think that eight minutes of filibustering, caricature and ridicule will probably get you a lot of airtime on Polish television, but you are not actually doing anything for the interests of the Polish people. I would like to underline the fact that this debate today is not about Poland, and we have had similar debates about situations in other countries, as you know full well. What this is about, and I will quote the Council Presidency – pay attention because I rarely ever quote the Council Presidency – who said that ‘the issues at stake go to the heart of our commitment to the Union’. That, Mr Legutko, is what we are talking about today. The situation that we are going through might be described as the growing pains of a community of values that is developing. We readily accept that the Commission intervenes in matters of tax evasion, state aid, or disrespect for environmental standards. But then we say – and Mr Timmermans always says – we have to be big on big things. This is big. This goes right to the heart of what the European Union is all about: about the rule of law, about fundamental rights, and about democracy. In this sense, I would give full support to the initiative of Commissioner Timmermans. However, I would like to make one remark because I think that the current situation shows the limits and weaknesses of the toolkit that we have to protect and promote democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights. I am glad that, in this House, we are jointly working on a mechanism that will monitor and evaluate all the Member States because I think that we should move beyond the situation in which there are accusations of countries being singled out, or of interventions being politically motivated. Personally, Mr Legutko, you have accused some people here of being politically motivated. You know, we are not in government, so we have absolutely no issue here and no interest. But I think it is very important that the European Union provides itself with a toolkit that will allow us to promote, protect and uphold democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights.

She made no distinction between the party, the government, the nation and the people. Questions and comments on the new legislation, which restricts judges and silences journalists, were seen by her as a criticism of the citizens of Poland.  This immediately touches on the following misunderstanding: European values, European fundamental rights relate to the individual, sovereignty over one's own body, sovereignty over one's own thoughts, such as the woman's right to have her own body. I would like to say to the current Polish Government: 'You seem to have a different definition of law and sovereignty: the law and sovereignty of the group, of the people.

It will not be tolerated that Christian teaching in Poland has a greater social impact than in most countries of Europe. They do not accept it and protest against the fact that they want to sanction public blasphemy. It seems that today in the European Union only the religious sensitivity of Muslims must be taken into account. Poland is constantly referred to as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as if they did not know that the United Kingdom and Poland had been exempted from its mandatory application in Lisbon. This Parliament has twice dealt with the so-called situation in Hungary, now the situation in Poland. As we have heard from a Communist congresswoman, she rebukes them.

First of all, let me be very clear. If any information pertaining to this issue is brought to our attention, we will carefully study it and reflect on it and take a position on it. We do not disregard any information. If it is academic information, give it to us and we will analyse it and give our point of view.  Secondly, let me reflect for a moment on the nature of the rule of law: why is it so important? It is because we have learned through history, through a very painful history in Europe, that in order to have a democratic pluriform society functioning and the rights of everyone respected, we need the virtuous tripod of democracy, rule of law and full respect for human rights. You cannot give in to the temptation to use one against the other: all three are equally important. And, as an essential part of this, the independence of the judiciary is of extreme importance for respect for individual rights and also for the functioning of our form of market economy. This is nothing to do with politics. Politics can lead the electorate to make a different choice, and then governments make different programmes go in a different direction, but they need to stay within the remit of the rule of law, which is full respect for the position of the judiciary in our Member States.  So, then, this brings me to a number of very precise questions that Mr Legutko clearly does not want to go into. If you accept my premise that the independence of the judiciary is an essential part of respect for the rule of law, how is it that in Poland, the executive can choose whether it wants to publish the rulings of the highest court in the land according to whether it likes the rulings or not?  (Applause) That is not in line with the principle of the independence of the judiciary. Mr Legutko said, just for you, Mr President, that what I am saying is not true, but let me remind him that several rulings of the Constitutional Tribunal have still not been published by the Polish Government. That is a fact, Mr Legutko. Secondly, let me also add that if a parliament decides lawfully to elect members of a court, then the fact that such a lawful election has been followed by other elections does not entitle you to use the new composition of the parliament to undo a legal decision by the previous parliament. So these are the issues we are discussing in a constructive way with the Polish Government. Let me end on one thing which is also a bit personal, I have to say. My professional life, from the very start as a student, was focused on bringing an end to the divide in Europe and bringing down Communist dictatorship in half of Europe. The Polish people have achieved that. It is one of the biggest victories in European history, and I will not be accused of acting against the Polish people. This is a dispute between a tribunal and a government, nothing more and nothing less. But let us remind ourselves of the beauty of the victory of democracy and the rule of law against oppression and Communism, and let us not forget that this is the true, true achievement of our common European dream.

I believe that in our cooperation last week, this Parliament contributed enormously to forging and reinforcing our common European position. Together, we send a clear, united, and quite unequivocal message to our Turkish friends, that the European Union is committed to engaging in an intense, open, frank, and constructive dialogue on all issues and to continuing to work together on all strands of our cooperation – from foreign policy to regional crises, from energy to trade, from visa liberalisation to the upgrade of the Customs Union, from migration to counterterrorism. We need especially to work together, openly and frankly, on all issues in these very difficult times. It is a difficult moment for Turkey and we have all seen this. We saw this at  first hand just a few days ago. On Friday we were together with Commissioner Hahn in Ankara. The attempted coup of 15 July risks sending the country back in time to a very dark era of its history. It would have been a dramatic blow to Turkey’s democracy and destabilised the whole region even further, a region that definitely does not need to be destabilised still more. This is why we intervened and I intervened personally in support of Turkey’s democratically elected institutions as soon as I got the news. It was well before midnight, and let me share something with you on a personal note: I personally tweeted. We were in Mongolia with the two Presidents, so it was night-time, and I personally tweeted ‘In defence of the democratically elected institutions’, long before the outcome of the coup or even the dynamics were clear. It was something that we had been thinking about a lot, but we did it without hesitation, well before midnight, and we did it first, before other international partners or actors reacted publicly, because, for us, for the European Union, it is always absolutely clear that there is no space in our world, and in particular there is no space in our region, for any attempt at a military takeover of power.  This is an absolute truth for the European Union that cannot be questioned at any time. Even more so in our region and even more so in a candidate country. So, for us, it was an absolute priority immediately to state clearly that the defence of the democratic legitimate institutions, starting with the parliament that was attacked in those hours, is a priority.  Last week in Ankara we had the high-level political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey. This is an exercise that we do quite often, the last one was in January, and it allows us to cover all the different issues and strengths of our cooperation. This time, however, was an opportunity for us to first of all pass on the message again and to honour the victims of the attempted coup, the people – more than 200 – who died during that dramatic night. Commissioner Hahn and I also had the chance to express our great respect for the Turkish people, first of all, to all the institutions, starting with the parliament, and to all the political parties, which we met, majority and opposition alike, and to applaud them for the way in which they came together that night and the following days to stand up for their democracy. So at this very difficult and delicate juncture we also have made it clear that Turkey must recommit strongly to those principles and values that are at the core of the democracy that the Turkish people protected and defended on the night of 15 July: the rule of law, freedoms, pluralism, including the rights that are at the core of any democracy, not least the guarantee that everybody has the right to a fair trial. Following the entry into force of the state of emergency, a large number of judges and prosecutors have been suspended or dismissed. Warrants have been issued for the arrest of many journalists, and several media outlets have been shut down by decree. It is of the utmost importance that all those who bear responsibility for the attempted coup should be held accountable. But any alleged wrongdoing or crime should be subject to due process, and the right of every individual to a fair trial needs to be respected. All detainees should have access to lawyers and family members, and detention conditions need to be constantly scrutinised. Independent monitoring of trials is essential to ensure due process. All these elements were central to our conversations in Ankara during those days and we very much encouraged cooperation from the Turkish authorities on these issues with the Council of Europe. We ourselves, including me personally, are in contact with our friends and colleagues in the Council of Europe in order to work on these points hand in hand.  Our dialogue, our common work in many fields, can support Turkey at a very difficult moment, and ensure that the choice of the Turkish people in favour of democracy and the rule of law is fully honoured. We both need to reaffirm our partnership, and as partners we need to be open, frank, constructive, respectful and clear to each other. We are doing that and have been doing it in these days of dialogue and the days before; and I am sure that we will continue in this way. I believe that our dialogue can support Turkey at this difficult moment and even help it move forward.  In Ankara we all agreed first of all on one thing: that we have to talk more to each other and a little bit less about each other without communicating directly. Let me mention two issues in particular, on which our dialogue is particularly crucial, two difficult issues. One is the Kurdish issue. It was once again at the core of our meetings in Ankara, both with the government and with opposition parties. I have repeated very clearly – we have repeated very clearly – that the European Union deems the PKK a terrorist organisation and so do all the Member States of the Union. We believe that all violence and terrorist attacks have to end and arms should be laid down. At the same time, we believe that a credible political process should start. Just now we are seeing new clashes in the south-east and the east of the country. As you know, I also had occasion to say yesterday that the suspension of 28 elected mayors and the appointment of trustees is an issue of particular concern. We expect and we are confident that the population of these municipalities will be in a position soon to elect new mayors according to Turkey’s own laws. This is extremely important for precisely those principles of the rule of law and democracy that we discussed with the Turkish authorities a few days ago. The second issue, but linked in a way to the first, as you know very well, is Syria. I know that the number of issues that we could discuss here would be large, and Commissioner Hahn certainly can and will tackle some of them in his concluding remarks, but let me take a few minutes to say that on Syria we agreed during our talks in Ankara on some points that we have not discussed as openly and constructively in recent months.  First of all, we agreed that there is no military solution to the war. This is not a minor issue. It is a relevant issue, especially at a time when a new glimpse of hope, which for the moment is only a glimpse of hope, is opening up with the announcement of a renewed cessation of hostilities on Saturday. We also  agreed that only a political process and a political transition can bring peace and democracy to the country. We agreed on the basic principles that should guide the future of Syria. The territorial integrity of the country, which is not irrelevant at all, far from it. The unity of the country, the inclusion of all parts of Syrian society, the protection of all minorities in an inclusive and non-sectarian state. So despite all the difficulties, we have common ground on which we can work.  I have mentioned Syria. I have mentioned the glimpse of hope that is hopefully opening up. That would at last offer scope for some joint work that we, together with our Turkish friends, could do on, for instance, the delivery of humanitarian aid. And on the facilitation of the political process. We need both elements to start, and you are well aware that these two fields, humanitarian aid and the political process, are the ones in which the European Union can and will play a key role. We are ready. It is the military field which is, shall we say, a little too busy at the moment to enable the political and humanitarian work that is needed, and urgent, to be pursued. So I really hope that all actors on the ground will now open up the space for the political and humanitarian work to start. So despite all the difficulties, both Turkey and the European Union realise that there are many interests that we have in common, many things that our people have in common, and many things that our people share. There is another special issue that I would like to mention which is absolutely key for us, the entire European Union, and on which we have found a clear political will in Ankara to move forward in the direction that we want to see.  We have seen that both the European Union and Turkey, at this moment, are willing to facilitate, to help, to support, to finally reach a solution to  conclude the settlement talks on Cyprus, to bring peace at last to the island, and to send a powerful message of reconciliation to the entire region and, in a way, to the European continent. This is one of the issues which, far from being minor, are central to our discussions with Turkey. I have just mentioned a few of the issues that we have on the table with Turkey. You might have seen that I did not refer to the ones which I am sure will be at the centre of our thoughts: management of the refugee flows, our support to the refugees in Turkey, the visa liberalisation issue, other things that are on hold in the accession negotiation process. These are key elements in our relations with Turkey, but that is not the only point, and we have to keep in mind that Turkey is a candidate country. It is also a key partner in a region with which we share at least some common interests. For all these reasons and many others, our relations cannot be limited to one single issue. To that extent, the accession negotiations provide an excellent framework for a broad dialogue on the entire spectrum of our cooperation. Still, if we really want our dialogue to benefit both of us, our conversation cannot be limited to governments.  If we look at the opinion polls, European and Turkish societies are growing further apart, and that is something which really worries me personally. It is not only the institutions, it is the people. European Union citizens on the one hand and Turkish citizens on the other are seemingly going in opposite directions.  I believe that this Parliament can help us. I believe that Parliament somehow has a special responsibility to keep our ties healthy and alive, frank and open, and constructive and real, through constant dialogue with all Turkish parties, with the Turkish Parliament as such and with Turkish civil society. For us, it was key to meet all the political parties while we were visiting Ankara and to listen to their views on our relations, their views on their country, their views on the political direction of the country, and their views on our joint work. We need to work on our societies. We need to work on our politics, and we need to work on that together. I think that here Parliament is essential. In the long term that is the only thing which will pay off, and I believe that both for the Turkish people and for European citizens it is an exercise worth doing. It is not an exercise in realpolitik, but it is about our own history and the values that we have within the European Union. Dealing as we are with a country that is not only a neighbour, but also a candidate country, it is also about trying to make these difficult times an opportunity to strengthen democracy and the rule of law instead of straying far away.

For all the criticism we have from time to time about Erdogan's policies, I think it is important that it is an elected parliament, an elected government that is in office, with which we have to negotiate – also critically – and not military coup plotters. We should make that clear. At the same time, we see that a degree of uncertainty is spreading in Turkey due to the Brotherhood infiltration of the entire state by the Gülen movement, which – certainly through its own fault – is also failing to control the Kurdish problem. We demand that peace talks with the Kurds finally resume and that the HDP be included, but we must say that we also understand that a government that simultaneously has PKK and ISIS acts of terrorism against the civilian population in its own country is in a difficult situation after this military coup and before that. And for that, I believe, we should give Turkey support and understanding.  However, we must ensure that, under the law of emergency, things are handled fairly and in accordance with the rule of law, and here monitoring by the Council of Europe is of great importance. We need Syria for the peace process. We see that again these days. We need Turkey for the peace process in Syria, as we need Iran and Saudi Arabia for it, and we should not destroy that. This is an important country on this issue, as we know. And we need this country in the fight to solve the refugee problems. We need Turkey to end the war, and at the same time it is important that the people who have been there for four years receive support from us, as has now been agreed, through direct aid that the Commission provides to cities and municipalities – for schools and medical care. I do not think we should destroy that. And if the traffickers are no longer involved, if there are no more people dying in the Mediterranean, and fewer people are coming, we should see this in a positive light. We have common economic interests.  Turkey's membership is separate from this. This has its own criteria, and Turkey does not currently meet these criteria, particularly in the area of diversity of opinion and many other issues. But that is another problem.

It is a lot that the Turkish population has to deal with: more than three million refugees, terrorist attacks on an almost daily basis and, on top of that, a bloody coup attempt on 15 July 2016. That night left a deep impression in Turkish citizens’ minds. The Government said that the temporary state of emergency would not influence people’s daily lives, but so far more than 100 000 people have been directly affected either by losing their jobs or by ending up in a prison cell. It is understandable that, in the aftermath of the coup, a number of measures had to be taken, but the current situation also leaves us very concerned. It is difficult to understand what the link is between respected journalists like Asli Erdogan and the coup plotters. It is difficult to understand what the link is between thousands of teachers and the coup plotters, and it is also difficult to understand how appointing trustees to municipalities and dismissing directly elected mayors is related to the events of 15 July. Turkey can be proud that its citizens massively went out on the streets to defend their democracy that night. It can also be proud that all political forces joined hands in rejecting any illegal overthrow of the democratic institutions. Turkish democracy does have the chance to come out of this situation strengthened: by embracing media plurality, which played a crucial role that night in informing the people; by working together with all political forces on much-needed constitutional reform; and, as a last point, by proving that the rule of law is the guiding principle in bringing the perpetrators to justice. On a final note, I would like to also highlight, on our part, the fact that cooperation with all the EU institutions on Turkey is of great importance and it is important that we keep sending the same messages.

This right cannot equate, however, with enabling President Erdogan and the AK party to have carte blanche to detain, arrest and remove from office all political opponents at will, under the pretence of fighting terror. Neither can it justify disproportionate military force against the Kurdish civilian population in the south east. As we now see tens of thousands removed from their posts in the army, the judiciary, the civil service, academia and private media outlets, with little due process, such an approach – solely on the basis that they are old Gülenists and terrorists – is very difficult to justify. Commissioner Hahn has even hinted that there is evidence of pre-prepared lists being used in preparing purges following the coup attempt. As we now watch with renewed hope – if not total confidence – in the emerging ceasefire in Syria, I am minded to comment on the recent efforts by Turkey to support the Free Syrian Army in liberating parts of the Turkish-Syrian border areas from ISIS/Daesh. For much of the five-year conflict in Syria, Turkey’s priorities have sadly often be more focused on hindering the efforts of the YPG—PKK alliance rather than those of ISIS, so I hope that this recent development represents an awakening to the supreme threat that ISIS’ jihadism poses to Turkey and the West and a new willingness to collaborate more fully with the US – and now Russian – coordinated coalition to defeat this evil scourge and the threats it poses to the European Union and the western world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3137, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Alexander Graf Lambsdorff", "mepid": "28242", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take a iendled with the ALDE Group.

There is no doubt that he should be condemned. In this context, I would like to stress, for once, the opposition in Turkey and its role. It is remarkable that Kemal Kuldaroslu and his CHP were present at the rallies. It was not easy to see that in the past we had a trusting cooperation between the government and the opposition. So in this respect, this is an important step in the right direction.  Mrs Mogherini, you have described our dialogue in many words: intense, open, honest and so on, and also respectful. I think it is a question of honesty and respect that one thing is being admitted, which is that the accession process has failed. You have identified areas in which we can cooperate. They are all the subject of the accession process, but we are not getting off the mark. You mentioned the fight against terrorism, you mentioned the customs union, the modernisation of the customs union, the refugee issue; we could also talk about cultural and scientific exchanges, we can talk about tourism, about environmental policy. I think it is time to treat each other with respect and replace this failed accession process with a fundamental treaty, with a new positive agenda that is much broader and much more practical than this process, which has ultimately led to bitterness on both sides and to a decline in our relations. We have been negotiating for eleven years; relations have not improved during this period, but have deteriorated. Let me mention one final point, which is important to me and which also has to do with respect: we can expect the Turkish side to expect the internal political conflicts that are to be fought there and which must be fought there, to be fought there as well. I do not want to have situations like the one in Cologne, where AKP supporters and Gülenists are clashing, as we see in many German cities, but also in the Netherlands and other countries.

I understand that what is happening in Turkey today is really a very complicated matter and I understand mrs Mogherini's difficulty as well. But while the European Union and its representatives behave as representing a soft power, a leafy European Union, it is natural to choose with Turkey in a way that makes it easier. It makes it easier for President Erdogan to continue his anti-democratic attitude towards his citizens rather than showing him the right way. It has already been said that 100,000 people have left their jobs; some 3,000 judges have been expelled from their jobs, as have more than 2,000 academics and more than 130 journalists. We cannot, while we are discussing Poland, rightly, in a very strong way criticising what is happening in the country, do the exact opposite when it comes to a country that is in the process of negotiating accession.

However – and you have already made this very clear, and I would like to emphasise this for us – this persecution of the rule of law must be appropriate.

In this acute situation, it is precisely the people of Turkey, who have always referred to us and the European process, who expect us to stand up for the rule of law.

Instead of dealing with the real issues of the Schengen zone and Ms Merkel’s insane open doors policy, the EU is choosing to believe that a coup was attempted, when in reality it was set up by the Turkish Government to crack down on internal dissent. I am only glad that we in the UK are getting out of the EU while we can, because this policy is madness. The cowardly, self-delusionary posturing of the EU towards Turkey is an utter disaster, and the accession process must end soon. It is an offence against both human rights and democracy.

Mr President, 15 July was a difficult day for the Turkish Republic with hundreds of innocent victims. The attempt to break up democracy, and indeed with arms, is absolutely reprehensible to all, I hope, the democratic citizens, of all the Members of the European Parliament. But what happened the next day does not honour democracy, it shows a lack of democracy in Turkey. The Turkish authorities have carried out an incredible series of prosecutions and dismissals on military, judicial, civil servants, journalists and the media. An endless list of arrests, as if she'd been ready for a long time. But Turkey-European Union relations are also deteriorating and distrustful. For Turkey, the refugee agreement is equal to the abolition of visas for Turkish citizens. The fulfilment of the prerequisites, the European principles and values, the Republic is in second place. Either the visa waiver will go ahead, or there is no agreement on the refugee issue. Europe's response must be unanimous, firm and lasting. Europe respects friends and partners.

Mr President, I would like to thank the On behalf of the High Representative, I would also like to express my thanks for this debate. It has shown that it is very important to remain in dialogue with Turkey. I think it is also important that we understand that this country is still in shock collectively. This country has seen several military coups in the recent past; this time it was a failed one – thank God – which also signals a certain development. I believe that we in Europe, too, have been in shock, and perhaps we are still in shock, that something like this is still possible in our immediate neighbourhood in the 21st century and that a candidate country of the European Union can find themselves in such a situation.  All of us who have had the opportunity to be there recently after the coup, I believe, to note, that the Turks themselves – let alone us here in Europe – have not really properly assessed the extent of the infiltration of the state and essential parts of the state by the Gülen movement. It is clear that this must lead to consequences in the process of dealing with this, but – and you have said this in almost all of your statements – this must, especially for a country that is a candidate country, be based on the highest principles of the rule of law, to which we have committed ourselves and which are also part of our self-image. It may also be a challenge here and there in Turkey for us to apply this standard, but we are applying this standard, because Turkey is a candidate country, and that is to be accepted by Turkey.  I believe that it is also important, despite all the criticism of the government that can be had, to state that Turkey is a country with 80 million inhabitants, is ultimately also very heterogeneous and does not consist of President Erdogan, and that therefore, so to speak, any reflection cannot relate exclusively to the fact that he is now President there, but that we must keep an eye on the overall development of the country.  As far as our current task is concerned – and this was also made clear in our joint mission on Friday last week – we must ensure that this country is stabilised again in the interests of us Europeans. Because if a country of 80 million inhabitants in our immediate neighbourhood becomes unstable, then much can happen here, which also has a direct impact on Europe. In other words, to restore the rule of law, to restore economic stability – look at the economic figures: they have all fallen, tourism has fallen dramatically, and I believe that Turkish Airlines has written a deficit for the first time in its history. These are factors that must also be taken into account, and it is therefore also important that we help Turkey to deal with the refugee problem in the country itself.  It has already been said that we are, so to speak, at the beginning of getting into cruising speed with this help, cruising speed, because we also have an obligation to use the money in such a way that you, as representatives of European taxpayers, have a guarantee, so to speak, that the money will be used correctly, precisely for school attendance, for health care, nutrition, but also for language training for adults and the provision of micro-credits, but also to support particularly affected communities and cities in the infrastructure sector, which, like Kilis, have seen a 50 per cent increase in the population.  But when we talk about stabilisation, it is also a question of political stabilisation, and that includes resolving the issue of the Kurdish conflict at political level and not at military level, and that includes a strong political commitment by Turkey, above all in Syria, because there too we need a political solution.  However, I am also saying – and this has been mentioned by some of you – stabilisation also means that we are addressing the tensions that we see in some European countries within the European Union between members of the Turkish minority and the rest of society, or tensions between different groups of the Turkish minority of a country, that we are dealing with it and that we are also making our contributions, that things do not escalate here. It is not just the European Union that is called upon to do this; the representatives of today's Turkey are also called upon to make their contribution.  We are all called upon to disarm here; language can sometimes be more offensive than weapons, and it can often be a very be a deadly weapon. We must be aware of this. It is precisely at this stage that megaphone politics or megaphone diplomacy may not be the right approach. I believe that the High Representative said in the press conference that we must talk to the representatives, so to speak, robustly, but not about them in public, and we can expect the same from the Turkish representatives. Then we can take an important step towards stabilising the situation; the rest must then be left to the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3185, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Similarly, human rights must not be judged in the light of Turkey's important ally in the coalition fighting Islamic State. A few months ago, even after the EU-Turkey summit, I insisted that accelerating Turkey's accession negotiations was incomprehensible and should not apply to the Turks, thus undersaking the credibility of the entire enlargement process.

Mr President, first of all, thank you for organising this debate at this crucial moment in the history of the Gabonese Republic. Gabon may seem like a small country, but its potential is immense. These are not just important natural resources, with a significantly higher per capita income than most African countries. The people of Gabon have faith in democracy. The elections were peaceful and the turnout was high. The people of Gabon are confident that through the democratic process, the country will more effectively exploit its own potential. It is therefore important not to limit ourselves to the current crisis, to put an end to all forms of violence and to restore the confidence of the Gabonese population in the country's institutions. That is the aim of the European Union. This is also the objective of the election observation mission in its daily work. Let me thank the Chief Observer, Ms. Mariya Gabriel, and all the members of the mission, who have done an excellent job, who are doing a great job. You know that the mission and some of its members have been the target of personal attacks. The Gabonese authorities are responsible for the safety of the members of the election observation mission, and these personal and regular attacks cannot be tolerated. We reiterate this message to the Gabonese authorities in Libreville as well as in Brussels, every day, even at present. The impartiality of the mission was questioned. Let me also be very clear on this point. We are not taking sides in the political life of the Gabonese Republic, but we are working for democracy, transparency and the search for a peaceful solution to the crisis.  The international election observation mission complied with the methodology and memorandums of understanding signed with the Gabonese authorities. The Gabonese authorities themselves have invited the mission to observe the entire electoral process, and this is exactly what the mission is planning to do. It will work alongside Gabonese institutions until the final results are announced after the appeal phase. I will therefore focus on three steps which I think are crucial to getting out of the current crisis. First, it is essential that the electoral process be completed in a transparent manner. We continue to advocate for the publication of polling station results by polling station to ensure the quality of the results. This recommendation was also made by the African Regional Organization, the Economic Community of Central African States, as well as by the African Union. Only legal means, not acts of violence, can put an end to this litigation. We are ready to support the appeals process to the Constitutional Court and hope that the Court will act transparently and independently, in accordance with its mandate. In this regard, we call on the Constitutional Court to grant full access to the European mission of these procedures. These are part of the electoral process that Gabonese have pledged to make transparent and accessible to our observers. Second, all parties must refrain from violence and ensure the protection of the population. Both the government and the opposition have a responsibility in this regard. Attacks on Parliament or the official media have nothing to do with Gabon's legitimate aspiration to strengthen its democracy. The role played by the security forces is particularly critical. We expect the army, the police and the intelligence services to act in full compliance with the rule of law and with full respect for human rights. There is an urgent need to restore and maintain the public communication system, including social media, and it is important that the issue of those detained be dealt with promptly and fairly. Thirdly, Gabon's international partners, starting with other African countries, can play an important role in helping to ease the tension, as we recently said in a joint statement with Commissioner Mimica. We work closely with the United Nations, the United States and France. We actively support the mission of high-level heads of state, which is currently being set up by the African Union and the United Nations. The availability of Chad's President Idriss Déby, President-in-Office of the African Union, is an encouraging sign of Africa's determination to facilitate a solution to the crisis. I am also encouraged by the presence in Libreville of the African Union in the Commissioner Smail Chergui. I can only hope that the mission will have the opportunity to get there as soon as possible. I would particularly like to commend the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. He is currently leading mediation efforts at the local level and needs our continued support. The citizens and institutions of Gabon have a primary responsibility to put an end to the violence and achieve a peaceful solution to the post-election crisis. However, the international community must be on their side to facilitate and accompany the process. I am convinced that the African Union should be the leader. Regional integration can be a powerful instrument for peace and security in Africa. At the same time, the European Union, all of us, are ready to support Gabon by all our means.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3194, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Mariya Gabriel", "mepid": "96848", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Madam High Representative, thank you for your clear and relevant messages. This is the first electoral observation mission deployed in Gabon. It is therefore a clear signal of our support for the Gabonese people for democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and I am honoured to be able to lead this mission. I would like to begin by expressing several thanks. First of all, I would like to thank all the observers of the European Union and in particular my team, some of which is still deployed in Gabon. They do a remarkable job. Secondly, I would like to thank the Gabonese citizens for the warm welcome they have given to our observers, for their patience and for the calm that was preserved on polling day. I would also like to thank the Gabonese authorities, who have invited the European Union to observe the elections, signed the Memorandum of Understanding and has so far guaranteed the safety of our observers. During this mission, we were able to meet all stakeholders, the authorities, the various political parties, all the presidential candidates and civil society. We have also worked closely with other observation missions and representatives of the international community on the ground. Today, it is crucial to finalize the work of the mission without wasting time and energy for unacceptable accusations, false allegations or lies. This brings me to my second part. A real dialogue and a true partnership are also an opportunity to tell us things as they are.  In respect of the framework of the mission, I would like to draw attention to a few facts, because the possibility of expressing oneself on facts identified by our observers is also one of the strengths of the Union's electoral observation mission. The main facts at this stage are that, contrary to what was provided for in the Memorandum of Understanding, the mission had unequal access to the consolidation of results according to local electoral commissions. The results have not been publicly announced in the province of Haut-Ogooué, contrary to the statutory provisions. In the same province, there was an anomaly in the turnout and in comparison with an analysis of the number of non-voters and blank and null ballots. There was no publication of the polling station results by polling station, in accordance with international best practices. Today, as we have since the beginning of the process, we call for non-violence and calm. We continue to be guided by the need for transparency at all stages of the electoral process. We call on all actors to stick to legal and peaceful remedies. This now includes observing the handling of appeals filed with the Constitutional Court. This is a key phase in the electoral process and we are waiting for our legal expert to have access to the work of the Court to be guaranteed, as is the safety of the team members who are still there. International experts' access to the Court is also welcome. Finally, I would like to express the full support of the mission to Mr Chergui, Commissioner of the African Union, Professor Bathily, Special Representative of the United Nations, and Mr Abdallah, of the International Organization of the Francophonie, and to thank them for their efforts. I will end by saying this: all actors have a responsibility to contribute to the calming of the situation. Restoring Gabonese confidence in the integrity of the electoral process requires transparency. Today, by respecting the law, as an election observation mission, our gaze is turned to the Constitutional Court, from which we expect it to continue to be the embodiment of this justice without which no rule of law can avail itself of it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3195, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Jo Leinen", "mepid": "4262", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

The importance of the European Union's election observation missions was demonstrated in the presidential election in Gabon. This is a small country, but this presidential election is also a symptom and also a signal for democracy and democratic development in West Africa, if not for the whole of Africa. I would like to thank Mariya Gabriel, the team and, of course, our parliamentary delegation, for the work that has been done. The people of Gabon have welcomed the EU mission very favourably and positively. Wherever we went, we were even greeted with joy, with clapping that the EU is there and watching this election. And, of course, the public was interested in our conclusions, in what we saw. Now it can be said that Election Day itself is not so critical, but the weeks before the election and the days after the election. In Gabon, it has once again been shown that there are no fair conditions for such elections between a candidate who comes from government and an opposition candidate. The public media was completely unevenly distributed in terms of coverage of the president and the opposition candidate. And there is not much to say about the financing of election campaigns. State money is also used time and again for the election campaign. On Election Day, we have very often noticed that the electoral register is not in order and that it was not clear who is entitled to vote. It was really ironic that you could vote with the health insurance card, but not with the provisional identity card, even though no new identity cards have been issued since 2013. The counting of votes is very worrying, I agree. This lack of transparency in the centralisation of elections speaks volumes, and what has taken place in the province of Ogooué is as implausible as anything. So, High Representative, Mrs Mogherini, Gabon needs the EU, and you said it: together with the African Union, we must hope that this will be peaceful, that the process will end and that we will help the country to take the next step towards democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3196, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Marek Jurek", "mepid": "124892", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by In Gabon, we have witnessed how much this young democracy – because this is a country that has barely twenty years of democratic rule – wants to exercise its full civil rights. The people of Gabon cannot under any circumstances be denied involvement, takeover of elections, a sense of responsibility for what they mean. Democracy, on the other hand, is, of course, the decision of the majority, but a fair debate must precede those decisions. Two things are needed in Gabon today: firstly, social peace, which has been repeatedly called for here, and secondly, the development of civil society. There we met not only two main candidates, but also people who talked with such a takeover about the need for this development, such as Dr. Bruno Ben Moubamba. We should help them. I would particularly like to thank Maria Gabriel for her work, for her presence, because i am sure that the many weeks of work of her and her team have helped to carry out this election and help to establish their fair result.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3197, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Pavel Telička", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I am happy to share the appreciation of the work of the monitoring mission, although I am the first one speaking here today that was not a part of it. But I think that we have managed to monitor the work of the mission and I think that I can only praise the work. The Bongo family has been in power from 1967. This is not something specific to Gabon, it is something that we have seen throughout Africa in recent decades. The very fact that we have these illegitimate leaders, whether it is Gabon or any other country, logically in a country where there is a certain civil society this creates civil unrest. That is where the roots lie. You have outlined the points Madam President, I was approaching the more or less the same ones, but from a different angle. The first point that I would like to highlight is that if the mission came to the conclusion that there were obvious abnormalities then we have to insist that the electoral commission publishes the results. The second issue is that this has to be recalculated, and I do appreciate the support that you are also giving to the efforts vis-à-vis the court, and I very much hope that the findings will be objective, transparent and independent. The third point – and the key point – I would like to underline is, and maybe I am just an observer getting it wrong, but it seems to me while the African Union does play a role, we see that the mediators’ mission has been postponed, and honestly I would have expected the African Union to be much more vocal and much more engaged.  Bearing in mind and coming back to what I said at the very beginning, this is not just a problem for Gabon but something that we see more or less every year or every couple of years copy. There is a significant role to play for the African Union and it is also a task for us to ‘motivate’ the African Union. I would also like to wish Members good luck in all their efforts and to thank them for their points and for addressing the issue.

What I mean is that the count, the new count of ballots cannot simply be referred to the Constitutional Court, which is already proven to be biased and malicious. It has to be an international organization, and the European Union has the power to ask that it be the United Nations or the OAU that ensures that.

Mr President, Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the political situation in Gabon is very worrying, with each candidate remaining camped on his or her positions at the risk of the situation escalating into a civil war. Violence must be prevented at all costs. Here in Brussels, I had received Mr Jean Ping, who was already afraid of this situation at the time. I had taken the initiative to send an official letter to Ali Bongo, so that there would be an observation mission sent by the European Union. I am delighted that it was our colleague Mariya Gabriel, with her experience in this area in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who led her.  But between the lack of electoral lists displayed in front of polling stations, failures in indelible ink control, the authentication of ballots and the use of ballot seals without identification numbers, there is much to complain about the holding of elections. We must therefore support the work of this observation mission and its demands for transparency and, more specifically, the need to publish the polling station results by polling station, as you have indicated. Jean Ping's referral to the Constitutional Court for a recount of votes could be a door to the exit from the crisis, but it also risks inflaming the situation since his judgment will be the last possible remedy. And since Gabon's political life is a family affair, it is feared that the judgment rendered will be challenged for the simple reason that the President of the Constitutional Council is none other than the former companion of Ali Bongo's father. And that's a problem. Today, we must at all costs avoid the reproduction of the Ivorian precedent, where the international community had granted itself the right to intervene. It is in Gabon and the Gabonese that their destiny belongs. We need to give them our support in that regard. Above all, I hope that all the Member States of the European Union and the African Union, as you have pointed out, are mobilising, and it should not be France that interferes in Gabonese political life, because France-Africa has lasted long enough.

This reception, in my opinion, was the reception of those who received an election observation mission for the first time and expected the election observation mission to be sure that there was no fraud, because rather than talking about restoring confidence – because there was no confidence there, indeed everyone told us that there had certainly been fraud in previous elections – our presence received such high media attention precisely because the Gabonese wanted to , indeed they want from us, because the mission is still ongoing, the certainty and the control of regularity.  Unfortunately, the next day, as soon as the results were published, this kind of hope turned into a disappointment. So we are still in time, through our mission, but also through dialogue with the African Union, to try to restore this confidence that we really have noticed from the Gabonese and turn it into something concrete, because otherwise I think it is very difficult for the People of Gabonese to be able to find a solution peacefully on this outcome of the elections.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3201, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Louis Aliot", "mepid": "30190", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group.

I am also quite surprised, Mrs Mogherini, that the same outbursts and violence that took place yesterday in Congo did not provoke the same reactions on the part of the European Union and on the part of France and other countries. No one here can dispute the cheating of this presidential election. Each side sought to impose itself through fraud at the expense of the sovereign will of the Gabonese people. These breaches of the basic rules of democracy illustrate the need for new impetus in Gabon as in all of Central Africa, but this momentum is not to choose the candidate in place of the Gabonese or to attempt to destabilize the country in favour of unspeakable foreign or merchant interests. Beware of the risk of civil war! The Rwandan precedent must lead us to great caution. The future of Gabon belongs to the Gabonese and to them alone. In Both Gabon and Congo, the release of political prisoners is a prerequisite, and respect for the opposition is a guarantee.

As it happens, in 2010, I was the head of the election observation mission when Mr. Gbagbo refused to leave power and it is in fact the same idea: he was trending towards Soviet results in his region of origin and wanted, at the time, to cancel the results in the departments where Alassane Ouattara had won. The problem is precisely the challenge to the election results. Instead of calming the mood, instead of calming the political atmosphere, elections lead to political crises. I think the only duty we have is to continue the work of the team led by our colleague Mariya Gabriel and to demand what we do all over the world, the publication of polling station results by polling station, so that citizens, first of all, can verify what has been done with their vote and then , independent observers, including our observers of the Union's mission, can have an overview of the results and can synthesize them.

The extraordinary momentum that accompanied the elections in this country represented a sign of immense hope for the Gabonese people, who by going to the polls, demanded democratic institutions, demanded free political debates and also invoked the alternation of power. These elections were a missed opportunity for Gabon's ruling class to prove to the entire African continent and to the entire international community that it is able to hold a transparent election and show the utmost responsibility throughout the electoral process. In a democracy, it is necessary to guarantee opposition parties the opportunity to develop and propose their own political project in the greatest, purest tradition of political adversity. However, a few weeks after this vote, we express our great disappointment at the lack of transparency in the management of the electoral process, which has particularly targeted the methods of party financing and the election campaign, as well as the control of all vital information, such as the electoral list and the list of voting centres. In addition, there is excessive media coverage for the outgoing president and the lack of confidence of opposition candidates and part of civil society in the bodies responsible for the administration of elections. We vehemently denounce the loss of life and all forms of violence that followed the publication of the provisional results, and are still ongoing. I therefore ask that this violence cease. Incidents that reflect a lack of transparency in the management of the electoral process, as well as the violent repression of protesters by the security forces, all contribute greatly to the loss of the confidence of voters and stakeholders.

Sometimes we focus on our own limits or divisions – and, for sure, we have both limits and divisions – but when we look at the work the European Union does from the outside, with the eyes of the citizens of Gabon who were welcoming our mission, we recognise how relevant our work is, how important our values are, how powerful our instruments are, and how much expectation as well as how much change we can bring to peoples’ and countries’ lives. Maybe it is also useful to remind ourselves about this when we debate our own internal affairs back home. I would like to sum up, so it is not really a reply, it is more a sharing, I think – thanking very much first of all Mariya Gabriel for her work, all the colleagues here who expressed common views on the situation, and also the European Parliament as a whole for its important role. I have to admit that sometimes we forget how important our EU missions are on the ground. This is really a key part of our common work that I appreciate very much. On the situation, I have seen that our analysis coincides. These coming days, I agree, are crucial, especially in relation to the process ongoing at the Constitutional Court. We will look at what is happening and follow and monitor the situation in these critical hours and days extremely carefully, and I know that you will do the same. I believe that this will have an impact: it will be important for the people of Gabon to know that this House is following developments with such attention and that we are committed to continuing to follow this in a very careful way. We all share a common interests in finding a rapid, peaceful and just solution to this post-electoral crisis, as all of you mentioned, and we will ensure continued full support for our mission still on the ground. Thank you also for reminding us that we still have staff on the ground who need to continue their work in proper conditions, and we need to guarantee that – not only but especially – on the ground. So we will keep monitoring the situation in every dimension and I am sure you will do so too.

Let me express once again our full appreciation for Parliament’s role in this respect, your leadership and capacity to lead a difficult mission. Also, a last point: some of you mentioned the role that is, or should be, there for the African Union. I have said, and I will reiterate, that there is plenty of scope for the African Union to play a leading role in Africa. It is not an easy one but it is an important one, and our role there is to support the African Union in this respect, and also to support the African Union and the African Union countries in the difficult task of upholding the principles that they have set for themselves.

I know that you are always surprised to have a ‘thank you for this debate’, but I really think that it is important that we have issues on the agenda regularly and I have always noticed that the European Parliament has kept a constant focus on migration. I am sure you will remember this very well: just two years ago, migration was very low on our common European agenda, both here in Europe and globally, and this year it will be one of, or maybe the, central issue of the UN General Assembly.  So let me say, maybe it’s stating the obvious today, but looking backwards, it was not obvious at that time. There is a new global awareness and an understanding that migration can only be dealt with as a global issue. It is not an issue for one country or another, it is a global issue that needs a global response. And this is happening, this new global awareness, also because there is a new European awareness. We came a bit late, but we got there. So for sure this is linked to the magnitude of the phenomenon that touched the European continent, but I would say that finally we woke up to the ‘new normal’ of global migratory trends and in the last months I believe we have shaped an adequate external policy to manage this complex phenomenon on a global level.  So our approach is feeding into the global approach in the last months in quite a significant way. Our work in the European Union, especially on our external site, is becoming in these months, in these weeks, a point of reference for the global community. And again if I look back and think that when I took office less than two years ago migration was not even an issue or a topic for the Foreign Affairs Council, we have come quite a long way. Today, we have some – some – elements of our policy that are points of reference for the global response, to the need to manage together the migratory flows. Operation Sophia has been repeatedly endorsed by the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The same concept of migration compacts or migration partnerships that we have started last June is reflected in and will be central to our discussions next week in New York in the General Assembly ministerial week.  The declaration for refugees and migrants that we will adopt in New York is consistent with many of the actions we are currently putting in place – currently and finally I would say, putting in place. The declaration sets out an immediate comprehensive refugee response framework, which should lead to a global compact for refugees. This parallel of global compacts with our compacts, our partnerships, I believe are the result of European thinking that was somehow contaminated by, and contaminated itself, the global thinking in quite a relevant way. In parallel it outlines the process towards a truly global management of migrations with a future compact for safe, regular and orderly migration.  So the logic is to look beyond the current ‘refugee crisis’ as we have called it in the last year, realising that this is not only something that is happening here and now in our region, but is, as I said, the new normal of global trends. We have to look beyond this crisis approach. We even need to look beyond the other refugee crises happening in other parts of the world, with countries such as Ethiopia or Kenya hosting huge numbers of displaced people.  Migration will stay with us, and this is I know something that some of you in this room, and some of our citizens, do not like to hear, but this is a simple reality of today’s world. In a world of 7 billion people with rising inequalities, with dramatically diverse demographic trends, migration is the new normal; and if properly managed, let me remind you of something that is also some of you might not like to hear, and some of our citizens might not like to hear, but if properly managed it can bring about great opportunities for those who leave, for those who stay and for those who welcome.  And we need to face also with a certain realism our own European demographic trends and realise that we need and we will continue to need migration. So it is not something we need to stop, it is something we need to manage, and manage properly in an orderly way, in a way that is respectful of human rights and can become mutually beneficial.  So this is not simply about how we manage our frontiers. This is something that touches on many different other aspects, much more in-depth. We need investments, first of all, and both on refugees and on the wider issue of migration our Union is finally investing new resources in innovative ways – and I will come to that in a moment.  But I want to be very clear. I started with things I am proud of, the things that we are bringing to the global stage, our concept of partnerships, of compacts, or investment. In our response to the refugee crisis and the migratory phenomenon there is also a lot I am really not proud of, and I will be also clear about that. I am not proud of the hate campaign we have seen around Europe, I am not proud of the walls. I am not proud of discriminations based on race or religion. And we have to be clear also on that if we want to be credible on the global scene. I believe many were caught by surprise when the refugee crisis arrived in Europe to such an extent. I understand that many are scared. But we have also shown that we can manage both the emergency and the long-term challenge. So to go back to the things I’m proud of, because I believe that in these times we need a bit to focus also on what we’re good at: I’m proud of the unity we have shown in creating and running together Operation Sophia. I’m proud of the lives we’ve saved. I’m proud that we’ve mobilised incredible resources, especially to build schools and hospitals but especially on education for refugees. I’m proud that we’re finding innovative tools, from debit cards to the migration compacts, to help millions of refugees in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. And the same goes for our long-term approach. This is something I’m finally proud of. The world is changing fast and we couldn’t just stick to the old way of doing things. So we’ve started to change the way of doing our things. I know that most of the debate around this has been focused, in our Member States in particular, on the issue of returns and readmissions, and that is indeed part of our policies. But readmission, obviously, is important to move towards a better system for human mobility, to make it sustainable, providing better channels for legal migration, and discouraging or preventing dangerous travels through the desert or at sea.  I remember we had a very heated exchange here in this Chamber a couple of months ago about this, and I always recall that I witnessed myself first-hand the great work we do in countries like Ethiopia for the reintegration of women who were reduced to slavery after they fled their home country. So this is something we always have to keep in mind, and something I’m proud of. But as I said, readmissions are only one part of our approach, and I would say maybe not the fundamental one. Because if anyone believes that we can solve the issue of migration by sending everyone back, that person needs a reality check and would be proven to be wrong. We need to work hard within the countries of origin and to look beyond the short term.  As I said, readmissions and returns are an important part of our policy, but it is only one part. We need to look at the causes of the huge migratory movements we’re facing in the world, and we need to tackle them where they are. This is the reason why we are investing in a new approach based on partnership.  As I see our African friends are now truly willing to engage with us and to take responsibility, with a new true commitment to a common shared approach to manage migration properly and together, we’re opening somehow a new chapter, I think, based on partnership. And this is not happening without a reason. There is this global awareness shaping up between those who understand that migration is there to stay and has to be managed together. And this is the new global context we are living in. This new global context also requires from our side creativity, respect and the ability to bring about new instruments.  Public resources alone will never be sufficient, in an era of harder financial constraints even more so, but our funds can help mobilise private investors and international institutions towards shared strategic goals, and this is the core idea behind our new External Investment Plan which we have just established today. European firms are already employing hundreds of thousands of people, in Africa but also in our neighbouring countries, generating wealth both in those continents, in those countries, and here at home. But to expand business or to move into a new country, often a very difficult one, they need security and protection from risks, be it financial, legal or due to instability. So we can provide them with a guarantee, and this is what the new investment plan will do. We are getting to establish new tools for dealing with an unprecedented challenge, we are changing our mind-sets, and this is quite difficult to do but finally I believe we might get there. We’re building new partnerships beyond the traditional fault lines, beyond a donor-recipient mentality, beyond the traditional divide between public and private, and even beyond the North and South divide, because we are together in this, so that’s why the partnership approach is so crucial. Ultimately we are calling for a global partnership to deal with migration, and the UN summit will be an important step in this direction. This can be the beginning of a new path, also for the UN approach to migration and refugees. But for the first time in history, 193 countries will gather together and commit to a common approach to migration. And this is already a major achievement, determined also, I would say mainly through the contribution of the European Union.  Now we will need to ensure that intentions are turned into actions, and that our European Union process feeds into a global engagement to shape up the world’s migration system. We do count also on Parliament to make this a reality, and to continue engaging with us on the follow-up to the UN summit in New York. It is an opportunity, it is an opportunity that Europeans cannot miss, and Europe can and must lead the process, also following up the UN summit in New York towards a global partnership on migration.  But let me stress here again, we can play this key role on the international, global level on creating this new global compact for migration, first if we are consistent internally, second if we are united in this approach. And here comes also the role of Parliament. I believe that no matter if you come from the right or the left, from Portugal or Finland, or from the far East or the far West of the European Union, we all share an interest to make migration managed, properly managed and sustainable, and to invest in our neighbours’ development, and when I say neighbours I include the whole continent of Africa which is our neighbour. So I really count on your support. But more than that, let me say, I count on your work. And I especially look forward to reading your report to move towards a system for human mobility that is fit for the 21st century.

Madam President, Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, let me get directly to the bottom of the matter, beyond the very importance of convening this summit.  I would like to highlight some of the points that the European Union should stress at the summit. First, international aid needs to be strengthened for host communities. This summit commitment will have to be implemented as soon as possible and at a sufficient level in the current Syrian refugee crisis.  Secondly, I am pleased that refugee women are given an important place not only as vulnerable people, but also as those who bring about change and the future. Encouraging women's empowerment means investing in the reconstruction and stabilization of the country of origin. Secondly, I find it encouraging that border management and the dismantling of criminal migrant trafficking networks are taken seriously. We need a clear mechanism for cooperation between countries of origin, transit and destination. Information and analysis of roads, border control and prospects for migrants are three key elements in promoting safe, fluid and regular immigration. Fourth note: the summit document needs to be strengthened on the root causes and anticipation of movements. I am thinking in particular of conflict prevention and the effects of climate change on people's movements. Finally, the draft document recognises existing regional initiatives such as the Rabat and Khartoum processes and the Valletta Action Plan. The EU must ensure that these initiatives are effectively fully taken into account at the global level and a clear timetable for implementation will be welcome.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3210, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Elena Valenciano", "mepid": "4334", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, thank you very much, Madam High Representative. As stated in the declaration, which will be adopted in New York, migration phenomena are not new, have existed throughout history and, by the way, have been an essential element in human progress. It is true that today the world is living in an extraordinary moment and that is why we have to respond with extraordinary actions, such as this United Nations Summit, which must be a historic event for us to live up to current circumstances and needs and, perhaps, up to the response that was given more than six decades ago , when the international community was able to sign the Convention on the Status of Refugees, to create UNHCR, to create the International Organization for Migration. But I want to stress the need for this to be addressed from a human perspective. It seems a lie to remember, but it is. Human rights protection at the heart of their action, regardless of personal status: migrants, refugees are human beings, that is what they are. And the European Union, as the High Representative said, must play a leading role. Perhaps we would be more visible if we set a better example with our practices, if we complied with the given word, and with our own standards. But we also know where the real problem is and we know of the efforts of the Commission and the High Representative. The real problem of this Union, which is being broken, is the insolidary action of many governments of the Member States, uncoordinated, short-sighted and often unfair. We have to figure this out inside. The appointment in New York on September 19, and the Day After Summit with President Obama must mark a before and after. They must be the beginning of a global response to a phenomenon that is global, that of human mobility — that is what we are talking about, human mobility — which, for the good of all, we must order, respect and manage in solidarity to be all more worthy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3211, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, last year over a million people arrived on the shores of Europe from Africa, the Middle East and beyond, an unprecedented figure that has focused the debate. This can lead some to view this as an isolated and regional phenomenon rather than a global issue, but we only have to look at Jordan and Lebanon to realise that mass movements are occurring across the globe.  It is a mistake, however, to believe that the patterns, motivations and effects are always the same. As has always been the case throughout human history, military conflicts of course make individuals flee for safety just as horrible regimes encourage those to escape persecution.  But seeking better employment and economic prospects is also no less of a natural motivation to move elsewhere. However, as poverty levels decrease across the world, the financial means for more and more people in the developing world to do this increases. In my view, the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees is no longer adequate or fit for purposes. In my opinion, we need to accommodate this emerging phenomenon, particularly in a world of mass communications and accentuated wealth disparity, by looking at the Convention again.

Migration is a global issue and therefore I am very happy that the United Nations has now decided to call for the summit next week. I am personally happy to lead the LIBE delegation there. I look forward to working closely with the Commission and European players in ensuring its success.  Europe has a proud history of granting asylum and defending the fundamental rights of migrants. During these last years, however, we have seen how rising tides of xenophobia and populism have also had a detrimental effect on the European debate. We have unfortunately seen how principles of asylum law, such as the respect of non-refoulement, the right to family reunification and the right to apply for asylum have come under pressure in the European Union as well. During the summit I hope that we can once again unite around the principles of humanity and tolerance that were the basis for the creation of the Geneva Convention and other international standards for the protection of refugees.

Madam President, this UN summit is indeed a summit of hope. For months, the United Nations and its various bodies have been warning about the situation of migrants, and the least that can be said is that the richest states in the world are not up to the task. The number of refugees, even more displaced, is at an all-time high. Among them, an unbearable number of children. Fifty million, according to Unicef, have fled war, internal conflicts, misery, climate change and, more broadly, environmental, because the hand of man is often behind many natural disasters. Member States are responding with ever-increasing demands for border controls and hunting of so-called economic migrants at a time when the border between refugees and migrants is becoming increasingly difficult to establish and legal migration to the European Union is decreasing. Last year, one million people, including more than a third of them children, crossed the Mediterranean, 0.2% of the European population compared to 20% in Lebanon, for example. Madam High Representative, even the relocation mechanism does not work, less than 5,000 people welcomed in one year, for 160,000 announced. At this rate, it will take more than 30 years to reach the two-year target, which is far from meeting the needs, and there will be more deaths in the Mediterranean by the end of the year than last year. I do not have time to talk about the consequences of the mobilizations of all the Union's external policies, the economic partnership agreements, the European Development Fund used for the outsourcing of border management, including with the worst dictatorships, especially in the Horn of Africa. An example: 50 Sudanese recently returned from Italy directly to Sudan. The United Nations calls for responsibility and solidarity. The European Union must ensure that its Member States take action that is truly in line with global needs, particularly in Africa where, as I recall, 85% of migration is intra-African.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3216, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Bodil Valero", "mepid": "124993", "text": "  Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to take Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for I had hoped that we would have had both a debate and a resolution today or during the week, so that we could also give our input to the UN meeting here from Parliament. But a debate is better than nothing at all. When the large influx of refugees from war-syria began to arrive in Europe, we stood with our pants down. There was no preparedness, and it also turned out that some countries showed no solidarity whatsoever with the refugees or with other Member States. With poorly prepared ad hoc measures, we tried to solve urgent problems. That is why the UN meeting is so important. We must resolve this issue jointly.  After all, some 60 million people in the world are fleeing, not only from war, but also from poverty, political repression, climate change. If we do not seriously address the root causes, they will only become more and more.  Those fleeing poverty are no less valuable than those fleeing war, but they have no legal protection. These are the people that the Member States now want to send back home quickly. To continued poverty, to continued oppression, to continued drought.

We have heard many political leaders, even in this Chamber, say that immigrants will solve the problem of the ageing of the peoples of Europe, that they will contribute to our economic development. You will of course also remember the graphic events with the slogans in Germany 'welcome refugees'. The results of the recent elections in some European countries show us that people have a different view than you would like them to have. So, afraid of losing your seats and privileges, you are now starting to treat the situation as it really is. Based on ideological obsessions, you are trying to provide a propaganda rather than a humanitarian solution, while in practice the huge and illegal turnout of desperate people from every corner of the world continues. Firstly, as far as refugees are concerned, this designation should be given to those provided for but should apply only in the host country. Do not become countries, such as Greece and Italy, warehouses of human souls. As a host country it cannot be other than the first country in which refugees enter. All countries must contribute financially to the costs required to ensure them a human living as long as they remain there, and exert political pressure to end the situation that forced them to become refugees. Every refugee's dream is to return home. Economic migrants can only come after expressions of interest, and illegal immigrants should immediately be deported back to their countries.

I believe that the key is to work with the countries where migrants primarily come from. It will be necessary to have targeted investments in these countries, to help people in countries so that they have no reason to make big migration waves. It will be very difficult to find a concrete form, especially when we look at, for example, this morning's negotiations, there has been a debate about the Trust Fund for Africa, where money is simply lacking.

Refugees and migrants are suffering at europe's doorsteps and on European soil horrendous human rights violations, especially women and unaccompanied minors. Thousands give their lives to networks of traffickers and other organised crime, which our governments thrive by refusing to open legal and safe avenues for those who need asylum or work. This is what this is about not only the credibility, but really the very security of Europe.  The relocation process decided by the European Council marks a step, only 3 000 of 160 000 people have been resettled.

There is no concrete agreement, only wishes and good intentions; the adoption of the two Global Compacts is also postponed until 2018, but people fleeing cannot wait two years, as can developing countries, which are making the greatest efforts.  Only 27 states have regular resettlement programs around the world. Of course, we too would be more credible in calling for a global sharing of efforts if, in the meantime, we were to sets a good example within ourselves. A year ago, European governments committed themselves to resettlement and the 160 000 relocations, and made a few thousand of them, while Canada, for example, resettled 25 000 Syrians in four months, showing that the European union is not a problem of numbers or means, but only and exclusively of political will.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3234, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Νίκος Ανδρουλάκης (", "mepid": "125110", "text": "  S&amp;D). Madam President, according to UN figures, there are 65 million displaced persons and refugees worldwide and 244 million migrants. The unstable geopolitical and economic environment, the consequences of climate change and the demographic explosion in african countries lead us to conclude that these figures will increase further in the coming years. That is why it is important for the UN conference to prepare for an era of very high human mobility. But I hope that we do not stick to words and move on to actions in relation to what we as Europe have done. A typical example is the relocation programme, which is growing: only 3677 refugees out of 6400 have gone from Greece to other countries. Three Member States have not taken a single refugee and two Member States have not even declared availability.

Those who will defend safe and smooth refugee flows are the same people who build walls and publicly beg refugees not to come to Europe. After all, just the day before yesterday, the President of the European Council made it clear to us that the practical capacity of the Europe of twenty-seven states and five hundred million citizens to host new waves of refugees, not to mention irregular economic migrants, is close to the limit.

We cannot allow the politics of fear to paralyse us and allow this humanitarian crisis and suffering go on. Policies focused on deterrents and building walls are doomed to fail. Europe must redouble its efforts in addressing the sources of the refugee crisis and not just the symptoms. This means providing more support to developing countries to get refugees access to employment and education opportunities. However, maintaining aid is not enough. One in five people in Lebanon are refugees. By comparison, there is one refugee for every 530 people in the UK. We must step up the responsibility sharing, not responsibility shifting.

First, as some of you mentioned, migration or human mobility is part of the history of mankind. To tell the truth mankind itself is the result of human mobility, and maybe we should keep that a bit in mind. Coming from some countries this might be easier to remember, for others maybe a little bit difficult, but all of us, all of us, are the result of human mobility: truth number one. Second truth, others are doing more than the European Union is doing, you were saying this perfectly well. This is not a European phenomenon, and even less a European crisis. If you look at the movements of people inside Africa, inside Asia, they are much bigger than the movements of people towards Europe from these two continents, not only combined but also taken alone. And wherever you go in Africa or in Asia, every single country, or almost every single country, is itself at the same time a country of origin, a country of destination and a country of transit. So we have to get a little bit out, in our public debate, of this Eurocentric approach that we are at the centre of the flows of the whole world, and realise that indeed there are many other countries in the world, most of the time countries that are living in conditions that are much more difficult than ours from an economic point of view, from a climate point of view, from a conflict point of view, that are doing much more than we are doing. And indeed that we can lead by example, if we are able to provide some good examples – and let me tell you in some fields we are not. I mentioned things which I am not particularly proud of, but we are in some other fields capable of leading by example.  And let me tell you, on a personal note, I had the occasion of briefing the UN Security Council twice, this year and last year, on the EU policies on migration and I have noticed a radical change in the attitude of our global partners to our response, or our policies on both refugee and migration, which means that probably – let me put it this way a bit bluntly – last year we woke up. We woke up in what was for many a surprise, not for me personally, not for many in this room, but for many of us was a sudden wake-up. And this year we managed to elaborate or to react to this shock and put in place policies – finally.  I often told you, I told you at the beginning of our debate today, to me it was a shock when I came in, moving from my time being an Italian minister to the position of High Representative, that migration was not on the table of the Foreign Affairs Council. It was a purely internal matter, as if we had to tackle this issue only from an internal point of view, but where are these people coming from? So we come from there. Two years ago, this was not an issue, if not an issue of interior ministers only, so in two years I think we have come a long way. Third truth: there are things where we can lead by example. There are solutions we can find only if we do it together, as Europeans and globally. And what we can try to do is to manage this complex phenomenon in all these different aspects. I will come to the different aspects in a moment, but let me stress one point that I think Mr Panzeri mentioned. I refer to this as the need to manage a complex phenomenon. I will never, never personally call this a problem or a burden, because it is people. It is people with names, stories, even when we do not see the photos, it is people. So the language we use is important, the respect we pay to persons is important, especially to children, and the point on non-accompanied children is one that we will for sure bring up in New York. We have to keep that in mind also when the photos are not on the front line, on the front page of the newspapers, and let me tell you with sadness and shock, I never understand the fact that those that claim our Christian identity the most are also those who are the first to forget the word and the message of Pope Francis on migration and refugees. This is a mystery to me. So we can do things to manage this phenomenon together, as Europeans and globally. It is different aspects of things we need to do. On the refugees, it is the urgency of supporting globally, first on resettlement programmes, something good, something we need to do more, something we need to encourage our partners to do more, and also financial support, which is what we are doing the most. We need, on migration, to work on the implementation of the SDGs, on Agenda 2030, on investments in countries of origin and transit. I am glad to hear also from the right side of the Chamber tonight that indeed there is support also from that side to increase our budget for development policies. This is news to me, welcome news, and I think that will need to be tested with coherent and consistent voting, but this is good news if we realise that investing long-term in the economic and social development of countries from where people are coming, is indeed a major step forward in our own policies.  Then, we also need to work very much on dismantling the smugglers and the people traffickers. This is what we are trying to do at sea. This is also what we are trying to do with our partners in some countries, in full respect of human rights, and in coordination with the IOM and with UNHCR. This goes together with opening regular channels for migration. The more we open regular channels for migration, the more we manage to discourage the irregular channels, thus preventing the loss of lives at sea and on land, especially in the desert.  And here let me mention we have to work with partners more and more. I mentioned the UNHCR and the IOM. The summit in New York will be essential in this respect, the role of civil society and NGOs is crucial, as is the role of local authorities also here in Europe, in so many cases they are doing much more the national governments, let me tell you. So we need a partnership approach, also internally probably, to put together different strengths, and I will close by saying that indeed the role of the European Parliament’s delegation in New York at the summit will be important. We will meet there and I hope that we will manage to pass on together this message, knowing that it is a political fight, and that we have taken some steps forward in the last two years, in the last year in particular, and that I think we will need to continue working together using this window of opportunity.  I would not call the UN summit that is coming ahead an exercise that has its limits. Let’s go, let’s go and bring our inputs, let’s go and test our own policies. Let’s go and meet our partners, let’s go and try to build these global partnerships and with a sense of the limits, but also with a sense of hope that this phenomenon can be managed. I thank you very much and I am continuously counting on the European Parliament’s support and work in this respect.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 2011 – just five years ago, many people greeted with naïve enthusiasm the so-called 'Arab spring' which were turned into 'Islamic winters' at an early stage. Despair has taken the place of the dream, fear has replaced optimism, violence has occupied those squares where it used to manifest itself peacefully.  What was then the leading country in the democratic aspirations of the Arab world, today, in a North Africa and a Middle East torn apart by civil wars and terrorism, pressed by the return of strong men and by a continuing economic, political and social instability, becomes the last hope, the only torch in the darkness: that hope is called Tunisia.  Unfortunately, its recent achievements constitute an extremely fragile architecture that needs protection first and for all from us Europeans, its immediate neighbours. To this end, together with my fellow shadow rapporteurs – whom I warmly thank for the important contributions proposed and for the extremely constructive spirit that has animated every stage of our work – I have tackled the pillars of the definitive consolidation of a partnership and cooperation that we want to be solid, lasting and fruitful for both sides, on an equal footing and on an equal footing.  Economic development and security are inseparable. The terrorist threat feeds precisely on many young people who, disappointed by the lack of immediate responses to the high expectations raised by the jasmine revolution, end up being easy prey for recruiters of terrorist organisations, fuelling Tunisia's sad record of the number of foreign fighters. Libya is there, one step away, as is the entire Sahel region and its perennial pre-international state, where jihadist armed gangs easily violate borders.  On the other hand, the difficult economic and financial situation in the country, with public debt now reaching 62% of GDP, with a further 15% drop in tourism, presents us with the need for timely action. Without real social inclusion, without an energetic fight against unemployment, we will perhaps win a few battles but we will lose the revolution.  That is why in the report we call for a decisive increase in the funds from the European Neighbourhood Instrument and for the coordination of aid from other donors. I welcome the recent statements by the High Representative, who has repeatedly expressed his willingness to do so as early as next year. However, we must have the courage to tackle with sincerity the issue of the sustainability of Tunisia's debt, which is the odious result of the years of dictatorship. It is necessary to aim for conversion into investment projects, in particular by exploiting the country's enormous potential in the field of renewables and by redeciting regional disparities, which are particularly evident in the south and west of the country.  The sense of responsibility and commitment certainly do not disre end to the Tunisians, who continue to act, despite some physiological turbulence, with rare commonality of purpose. The Carthage Agreement has led to the creation of a new executive of national unity, which is also open to civil society. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed has before him the enormous challenge of making the reforms necessary, on the one hand, for the socio-economic recovery of the country, in particular on the basis of public administration and an effective anti-corruption plan, and, on the other, for the defence of public order and security, which is as effective as it is in accordance with constitutional principles and the rule of law – a difficult balance.  In front of the Union and all of us Europeans, however, there is no less important duty to live up to the expectations we have raised and nurtured. In addition to economic aid, we must encourage circular mobility, visa facilitation, especially for artists, students and professors, as well as all forms of partnership in the field of culture.  Tunisia's stability is our stability. Tunisia's prosperity is our prosperity. To achieve them, encouragement – however sincere – is no longer enough, unless it is followed by actions that live up to the words of the poet Abu l-Qasim al-Shabbi, who has always been a symbol of the struggle against the authoritarianism of the Arab world, words that have finally become part of the national anthem: \"If one day the people wish to live, then fate will listen to his prayer\".  As Europeans, as defenders of democracy, as friends of Tunisia, we have a moral duty to be part of the destiny of the Tunisian people and to listen to their prayers with fraternal solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3246, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   VP/AR. – Signor Presidente, onorevoli deputati, ringrazio l'on. Castaldo e tutti i colleghi che hanno lavorato a questa relazione che mostra una panoramica davvero completa su un paese fondamentale per l'Europa e per la nostra regione.  La Tunisie n'est pas seulement au centre géographique de la Méditerranée. Comme on l'a dit, elle est un symbole, premièrement d'espoir, d'espoir d'unité, de démocratie pour toute la région, avec beaucoup de problèmes qu'il ne faut pas cacher, mais qu'il faut essayer de régler ensemble. C'est un exemple, c'est un symbole d'espoir et de démocratie, premièrement parce que sa classe politique a préféré la négociation à l'affrontement. Le prix Nobel a reconnu la société civile tunisienne comme un acteur clé de la réconciliation nationale et le principe même de réconciliation nationale est en soi un élément d'espoir et aussi un symbole d'unité pour toute la région. L'histoire récente du pays est le démenti le plus évident à la prétendue incompatibilité entre islam et démocratie. Pour toutes ces raisons, le succès de la démocratie en Tunisie répond aux intérêts des citoyens européens, de la même manière qu'il répond aux intérêts des citoyens tunisiens et de toute la région Aujourd'hui, cinq années après la révolution, le pays traverse une phase décisive. Le projet de résolution met en lumière quelques-uns des principaux défis que la Tunisie doit encore relever, y compris la menace terroriste, la radicalisation d'une partie très importante de sa jeunesse, une situation économique difficile et un processus de réformes difficile.  The report also proposes a long and good list of possible actions in support of Tunisia asking to go ‘beyond conventional measures’. So I must say that this approach is exactly the same that we have taken in our global strategy, calling for a full use of all of all our foreign policy instruments in a combined and coherent way. The report spans from security sector reform to development cooperation. It calls for greater engagement with local actors and with regional organisations, with the private sector as well as with civil society. It focuses on trade, but also on climate change and the fight against desertification, and it endorses the work that Operation Sophia is doing in the Mediterranean, while calling for greater engagement of EU agencies in Tunisia.  So if you look at this list, it is clear that no national government – no-one of us alone – has the tools or the resources to implement such an ambitious plan alone. The plan is good. We need the European Union to make it. So only together, as a true European Union, can we aim this high. In fact the last year has already marked a very significant step in increasing cooperation between the European Union and Tunisia. In the wake of recent terrorist attacks we have invested EUR 23 million to support Tunisia’s security sector reform. In particular we focused on securing Tunisia’s borders and in strengthening its intelligence services’ capacity to prevent and fight against terrorism.  At the beginning of 2016 Tunisia became the first Arab country to participate fully in our Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, offering new opportunities for Tunisian researchers and academics. I could not exaggerate the importance of this – of people-to-people contacts – especially for our young people, in our relationship. The negotiations for the readmission and visa facilitation agreements, which will begin in exactly one month, also have the potential to strengthen the legal channels for mobility between Tunisia and Europe, as you just mentioned.  Less than a year ago we launched negotiations towards a Deep and Comprehensive Trade Agreement which could attract huge investments to Tunisia and help restart growth. Another round will take place this autumn. Since the revolution we have doubled our financial assistance to Tunisia and we hope to increase the total envelope by almost a third in 2017. So the trend is very clear. Our partnership is growing stronger by the day. This trend will be confirmed in the joint communication we are presenting together – myself and Commissioner Hahn. The text is under preparation and will soon be adopted, but I can anticipate that its priority lines will be very much in line with your report and the draft resolution. The communication will be a key instrument for us to engage our institutions – European institutions and Member States – in the support to the Tunisian transition. It will offer a mix of announced financial cooperation and non—financial measures, responding directly to the main axis of the Tunisian five-year development plan.  For this reason we will focus on good governance and the reform of public administration, on security as well as on tackling inequalities and unemployment, particularly among young graduates, because we know very well that is the place where the biggest problem lies. To do so we will keep engaging with Tunisian institutions to support reforms. Let me just mention the urgent adoption of the Code of Investment and the long-awaited five-year development plan. But we will also look at civil society, the private sector, mayors and local authorities, and especially – let me stress this once again – at Tunisian youth, starting from the Tunisian girls who played such a huge role in the revolution at that time and who are now seeing their dreams fading away. I believe that, thanks to our work, and to your work, with Tunisia this Parliament has directly witnessed the impact of our policy in the country. Tunisia’s Foreign Minister has recently defined the European Union as ‘the first sponsor of democracy and human rights in the country’. So indeed our engagement there is making a difference in very concrete terms. It is one of those places where we – and only we – can make such a big difference. To all Tunisians the European Union means something good, and if we manage to do something good for the Tunisians we are also going to do something good for the Europeans. I believe that Europe really needs to rediscover this huge potential, this huge transformational power, we have in some parts of our neighbourhood. And our region does indeed need a stronger Europe as a champion of peace and democracy, starting from Tunisia.  Come ha giustamente detto: la stabilità della Tunisia è la nostra stabilità.

I am particularly pleased today that the High Representative and Commissioner Hahn are here, stressing the importance of this issue and helping to enrich our debate.  Tunisia is an example of valuable aid for the Maghreb countries and can play a key role in the Euro-Mediterranean area. That is why we have strongly emphasised in the text the country's strategic role and our support for the completion of reforms and the implementation of the Constitution. The report that we are going to adopt offers important food for thought: we condemn acts of terrorism and express strong solidarity with a country that has repeatedly been the victim of attacks that risk weakening the democratic process and which have a strong impact on the internal economy of the area. The terrorists' goal is to conquer the country and throw it into fear. The issue of safety is a priority and, unfortunately, a very difficult situation persists.  We must not forget the migration issues. The reality on our doorstep is dramatic and it is clear that we cannot respond to this emergency on our own. I believe that the European Union should address all the countries bordering the Mediterranean and that Tunisia can play a decisive role.  We also want to identify shared interests in the priority areas of intervention. The centrality of the country and the considerable progress made by Tunisia must be valued and fully supported. It is becoming necessary and urgent to invest in tunisia: every euro spent on Tunisia is also a euro spent on the stability and security of our Europe.

It has focus and presents clear ideas. Our relationship with Tunisia remains pivotal in terms of providing stable government, economic growth and a more pluralistic society. Economic development will be the bedrock of Tunisia’s stability, security and transformation into a successful democracy.  So let us encourage growth within the SME sector, and internal reforms to reduce bureaucracy and stimulate growth. Carefully managed macroeconomic assistance can help, but it must be coupled with tangible microeconomic benefits. In other words, one can build bridges and airports, but training teachers and addressing issues like water shortage is how to really win over the Tunisian man in the street.  It is also essential that we share best security and defence practices in order to help defeat extremists, but let us not forget that without stability in Libya, peace in Tunisia will be difficult to achieve. I support the efforts of the Tunisian Government to modernise and liberalise their economy to meet new domestic, regional and global demands.

As Mrs Mogherini said, I am very concerned about the large numbers of Tunisian young people who join Daesh and other terrorist groups.

Terrorism is a shared problem that we must tackle together. But did you know, ladies and gentlemen, that Europol is not even capable of cooperating with Tunisia in this area? Tunisia is not on the list of countries with which Europol can cooperate. I continue to think this is an incredibly missed opportunity.

Tunisia is worth it, the Tunisian people deserve it. Yes, Tunisia has a special place. In 2011 many peoples looked at what was happening there. Tunisia has raised many hopes and the success of its democratic transition is more than ever an essential issue, far beyond the Maghreb. Much progress has been made, notably through the mobilization capacity of its civil society. We have seen that, particularly with the Constitution. Much remains to be done and concerns remain, particularly about young graduates and regional gaps. But also on the issue of human rights, including women's rights, on the issue of marriage, the issue of inheritance rights, LGBT rights, freedom of expression, torture, police violence, transitional justice, but also the death penalty. We owe real solidarity to the Tunisian people, we cannot be content with aid conditioned on structural reforms, geared towards European interests, which aggravate the Tunisian debt. The Assembly of People's Representatives is before a bill signed by almost all political groups in Tunisia, requesting an audit of the Tunisian debt.

There was a Tunisian Spring. And it is true, because Tunisia is the only country in the area where there has been a popular revolution against a dictator and where fragile structures of democracy have been created, which may or may not be stabilized. Much more must be involved, not only financially but politically. You should look a lot further south and help eliminate those black spots that are lasoing the Tunisian process. Some of my colleagues have already said this: restrictions on freedom of expression, legislation against LGTBI groups, exception laws. And for that, our trade agreements with Tunisia must prioritize mutual benefit and take into account that we have a great ally there: civil society. They must also help that country on issues as basic to its economy as the development of renewable energy and the fight against desertification.

Tunisia has made remarkable progress over the past five years, with the restoration of freedoms, the holding of free elections and the adoption of a new constitution. Now the country is in the most delicate phase of the transition, because it seems to me that the essential challenge is a socio-economic challenge: getting the Tunisian economy back on track, reviving growth and jobs, is the way to avoid the explosion of this time bomb that is the unemployment experienced and the disenchantment felt by a majority of young Tunisians. It is obvious that Tunisia is in a geopolitical situation that does not help it at all, including the major impact of the Libyan crisis. The European Union has a vital role to play in helping Tunisia, first of all at the economic level. Initiatives such as support for the Tunisian olive oil sector are of paramount importance. It seems to me that this is in line with the new Union's neighbourhood policy. Our instruments need to be responsive and flexible so that we can use them when we need them most. I welcome the presence of Commissioner Hahn, who has worked for this new neighbourhood policy. We must also support Tunisia on a security level, not only through a strengthened partnership, but also by contributing to the resolution of the Libyan crisis. I am pleased to mention the fact that we are paying particular attention here in Parliament to relations with Tunisia, in particular by setting up the Joint Parliamentary Committee which will meet for the second time next week in Tunis.

This is not the only reason for the current social and economic situation, but it has certainly contributed to it. I am glad that this Parliament played an active role in the case of olive oil under macro-financial assistance.

I acknowledge, Mr Castaldo, the merit of having stressed in your report that a worrying number of young Tunisians are captured by the Islamic State or Dáesh. Numerous factors contribute to young people being attracted to the false promises of extremists, and one of them could be that a third of Tunisia's total working-age population does not now have jobs. In this context, the protests of young people in Tunisia are an alarm that Europe has to listen to.

On both sides, everyone must do their job in a mutual investment that is up to the challenge.  I will emphasize three things. First, young people. Their participation in the upcoming local elections is crucial, as is their inclusion in the labour market. To do this, we know, the education system must be able to meet the needs of the labour market, particularly in high-potential sectors such as agriculture or renewable energy.  Secondly, regional integration must be part of the security objectives of EU-Tunisia relations, on the one hand, in relation to the situation in Libya and radicalisation, and from an economic point of view, on the other hand, it is clear that greater cooperation and integration between Tunisia and its neighbours would be beneficial. The EU's approach must also take this dimension more into account.

There are more than 500 kilometres of porous common borders with Libya, so it is obvious that this is a security issue that we Europeans need to develop in close partnership with Tunisia.

The process has now been strengthened, following the formation of a new government of national unity, despite regional instability, in particular that generated by the civil war in Libya and repeated terrorist attacks. These hinder, yes, the transition in Tunisia, and to this we must add the economic difficulties and high youth unemployment, also the result of the weakness of tourism, as has been said. The Union must maintain close political cooperation by helping Tunisia to consolidate its democratic transition, as the report calls for tomorrow will vote on. It must also deepen our mobility partnership, advance the now ongoing trade and services negotiations, promote economic reforms and maintain our support for security sector reform.

Tunisia has demonstrated with a small miracle that compatibility between Islam and democracy that many have found impossible in the past is completely possible, objective and tangible.

This is the way forward: we must not confine ourselves to declarations, but must make concrete commitments, specific plans on the individual issues addressed.  Today, terrorism unfortunately remains the number one item on the agenda. On 29 August, three soldiers also died on the border with Algeria, in an area where borders are losing their meaning, where the mobility of certain groups really does call into question those states that want to close down and do not want to cooperate from a regional point of view. Algeria-Tunisia cooperation has been a pillar in this respect and we hope to be able to extend it to the entire Maghreb as soon as Libya is stabilised.

Madam President, it is said all the time, Europe is in crisis and we know that one of the reasons for this crisis is that we have a single market, freedom of services, capital, people who can circulate, but we have completely different social systems and we know that social dumping is taking place. For a long time, it was not possible to define what social dumping was and we have now come to an agreement that there is a set of illegal and abusive practices that has led to a profound challenge to the dignity of workers. Dignity when you are housed in an abject way, when you are not paid for the work you have done, when you work all day or all week and you do not respect the rest times. But it is also a financial and budgetary problem, because social dumping is taking resources away from our social protection systems and making them poorer by the day. Finally, it is an economic problem, because it tends to weaken labour incomes, as we know, and obviously to push for a deflationary trend. I would add that this is a huge political problem and that European citizens, considering that Europe does not protect them but, on the contrary, weakens them by accepting these practices of social dumping, are increasingly sceptical or even turn against Europe by deciding that we must vote for parties that now want to destroy it, that many States today are beginning to say that the internal market must be called into question and the existing directives must be called into question and that existing directives must be called into question , sometimes even unilaterally.  How do I respond? Of course, this report is only a stone, but a stone that still appears necessary and important. First of all by applying existing legislation. In order to do this, we must increase the means of control, we must ensure that there is cooperation at European level to enable labour inspectors to work together, to have the means to translate. It is important to establish genuine cross-border cooperation that will enable us to fight against the companies that are drifting today. Existing legislation must also be improved, and this is why, in particular, a number of measures are needed, for example to combat these famous mailbox companies that do not exist, or exist at some point to disappear immediately afterwards. These companies have to have a real business to be able to employ people today, to detach them, for example, in another country. We need a transport agency for the road and that is very important, because how can we fight social dumping in the road sector today if there are no instruments at European level to do so? A blacklist is needed so that companies that have seriously wronged, which have seriously contravened European and national legislation, cannot today claim contracts that would be very dangerous to award them. Finally, we must register, for example, declarations of secondment in a European register, if only that, so that we can know exactly who is detached and when. Finally, we must work on social convergence. Indeed, there are specific measures to be taken, for example at European level, on the condition of women, who are often the first victims of fraudulent detachment or even abuse. We also need to work on the issue of wages and, if we know that a minimum single wage is impossible today in Europe and not even desirable, a national minimum wage of around 60% of the average wage would obviously be a very important step forward. I want to finish by telling you one thing. These discussions lasted thirty hours. They have helped to overcome the divisions, to bring together the forces of progress to work together, but also the political divisions within this House. They have also transcended the geographical divides between the North, the South, the East and the West. We must now ensure that the European Parliament supports this proposal to combat social dumping.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3275, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Marianne Thyssen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Balas, whose recommendations are in line with the ambition of this Commission. We vowed to put people at the heart of our policymaking and we have already taken action to defend our social values and strengthen fairness in our common market. For me this is very clear: there is no place for unfair working conditions and social dumping in the European Union. While it is true that there is no legally recognised and universally shared definition of social dumping, I agree with you that it is crucial to ensure a level playing field and fair competition across the European Union. I welcome, Mr Balas, your call to Member States to increase efficiency and secure appropriate staffing levels and resources for their control bodies. I take note of your call to the Commission and the Member States to ensure more effective implementation of the existing legislation. I am glad that you welcome the newly established European Platform on undeclared work. This will contribute to turning undeclared work into declared work and ensure social protection for millions of Europeans who are losing out through various kinds of risky job arrangements. This platform will soon formally adopt its working programme and then the first activities to exchange information and best practices, engage in joint cross—border action and develop knowledge and capacity can start. In March this year we presented the proposal for the targeted revision of the 1996 Posting of Workers Directive, with the aim of ensuring fair wage conditions for posted workers and a level playing field between posting and local companies. As you know, 14 national parliaments from 11 Member States raised concerns in relation to compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, triggering the so—called yellow card procedure. We analysed the concerns voiced by the national parliaments and concluded that no subsidiarity issue subsists with this proposal. Therefore, we decided to maintain the proposal unchanged. I am now looking forward to discussing my proposal and possible amendments with you and to working with this Parliament and with the Council in order to come to an agreement as soon as possible. I also welcome the emphasis in the report on upward social convergence. This is one of the main objectives of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which is now the subject of a broad consultation. It should be seen as a reference framework expressing essential principles, common to participating Member States, for the conduct of employment and social policy and it should serve to screen the performance of participating Member States and to drive the process of reforms at national level in the light of 21st century realities. Its underlying vision is one of fairness on the European labour market and social protection systems. Last but not least, we take note of the report’s position on illicit employment practices in the transport sector, particularly bogus self-employment and its significant consequences for the social protection of workers. Bogus self—employment in all sectors leads to unclear legal situations, barriers to access to social protection, risks such as those of precariousness and two—tier segmented labour markets, and potentially also a risk in terms of safety. Combating unfair working and business conditions in road transport is at the core of the so-called road initiatives which the Commission is preparing for 2017 and the same concerns are reflected in the Aviation Strategy for Europe, adopted by the Commission in December 2015, which emphasises the need to the reinforce the social agenda and create high-quality jobs in aviation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3276, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Jens Nilsson", "mepid": "111024", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.

We can do more at European level.  That is why we say that we want the rapid introduction of smart tachographs that can make controls more efficient using GPS technology. We also want to create an electronic and integrated operator register. We want there to be access to all relevant national registers. If a vehicle is checked on the road in a country, the person controlling the vehicle shall be able to connect immediately to the relevant driving licence register, to obtain information on the operator and the vehicle's inspection record to see the technical status. We must have transparency in those systems.  We also want a common road authority to facilitate the monitoring and control and coordination of The Member States.

Women are particularly often affected here – in the care sector, in households, etc. So many companies do not adhere to non-binding and voluntary guidelines. That's why we need this blacklist – a blacklist for the black sheep in the industry, those who behave wrongly and break the law. This makes it all the better for companies that pay their people fairly, register properly, and accommodate appropriately. Why not give encouragement to those good companies that play by the rules and then protect the black sheep accordingly? It cannot be. The question, of course, goes to all the political groups, especially those who are reluctant to blacklist and to fight the ambitious fight against letterbox companies.

What we need, however, is not competition for the cheapest wages and for the worst working conditions. This report is finally putting its finger in the wound.

Given the effects of the economic and financial crisis and the difficult situation on the labour market in some Member States, it is used for political struggle by anti-European and populist communities.  Increasingly, the term 'social dumping' has been used in European Parliament documents, which, in my opinion, is unacceptable because there is no legally binding definition of social dumping. In the European Parliament, however, we are committed to preparing clear and transparent laws. By not following these principles, we have led to a situation where populists and nationalists manipulate this phrase in all possible ways, deceiving our societies. Thanks to the negotiations and the goodwill of many political groups, we have succeeded in developing a definition of social dumping, and I believe that this is one of the greatest achievements and the most important elements of the report.  In the European Parliament, we agree that the violation and abuse of the law must be combated in order to reduce labour costs and not respect workers' rights. I hope that the problem thus defined will cease to be a breeding ground for populists and Eurosceptics and will reduce attacks and accusations against, among other things, foreign workers and companies for taking jobs and unfair competition.  When we talk about social dumping, we should first of all focus our attention on actual practices related to breaking the law, such as false self-employment, the activities of mailbox companies or undeclared work. Such practices need to be combated and the report we will be voting on tomorrow contains a number of recommendations in this regard. From the outset, as the EPP, we have pointed to priority actions, such as better enforcement of national and European law, strengthening cooperation between Member States, improving the exchange of information, for example on the social status of workers, and the efficient identification and closement of loopholes.  Finally, I would like to address the issues relating to the posting of workers. Very often, companies delegating workers are unfairly accused of social dumping.

However, social dumping has not yet been precisely defined. So how do you counteract something, repair and perfect something that is not yet precisely defined?

He did not have an easy task, we did not always agree, but I would very much like this report to be the beginning of a new communication on this subject. I think that if we want to solve the real problems of the labour market, then we should stop juggling political and ideological terms, such as social dumping, and populist slogans, which, unfortunately, have already been said here and today. I am very dissatisfied with the overall tone of the report, which seeks to hide behind this term the defence of the protectionist efforts of certain national labour markets and refers to all inequalities and differences in the European Union and even the posting of workers as a manifestation of social dumping. This alibist label overlaps the true nature of the problems facing the working environment in the EU. My position certainly does not mean that I advocate unfair competition or unfair business conditions. Just the opposite. Illegal activity must be systematically combated. I therefore propose, for example, that we ensure sufficient resources to strengthen the work of labour inspectorates, which must detect workers on the ground without proper contracts and basic social standards. But let us also look at the real situation on the labour market through the eyes of business owners, who are real job creators. What do they really need? Are these more and more regulations that will bind their hands even more? Or simple and effective solutions that can be easily applied in practice? I think deep down, you all know the answer.  We must take the path of better exchange of information between Member States, adapting the rules of social systems, adapting tax rules and other stimulus instruments. We should communicate more openly and factually, look at the factual arguments. We should ensure that individual labour markets are not fragmented. This is the only conceivable way that, from the very heterogeneous conditions of Europe's different labour markets, we can at some point in the future achieve that truly pan-European labour market with which we could all be satisfied.

Freedom of movement seemed to work okay when only a few countries were in the club and all were at similar stages of economic development, but following the various rounds of enlargement, particularly with the arrival of the A8 and A2 countries, all that changed. Suddenly countries with wage levels only a fifth of those that pertained in the more established members were part of the club. Without major restriction of the right of free movement, the outcome was inevitable: vast migration from poorer countries to richer ones and the undercutting of wages and conditions. Yet the Commission permitted only short-term transitional controls, and the UK did not even take advantage of those. Rather than tailor controls to the long-term closing of the living-standards gap, the ideology of European integration took precedence and immigration soared. The result in the UK has been beneficial to big corporations – an endless supply of cheap and compliant labour – but terrible for pre-existing working-class communities, with pay and conditions undermined and competition for public resources, such as social housing and school places, greatly intensified. This was not the only factor behind the Brexit victory in our referendum in June, but it was a major one. To sum up, as an ardent Brexiteer, I must offer you my heartfelt thanks as a Union for your bureaucratic inflexibility and your political incompetence.

This is a difficult but not insurmountable task and the proof is the compromise found on the definition of social dumping.

Rather than hiding behind protectionist policies, and therefore taking unilateral decisions on social matters, I would suggest that the Member States should do more in cooperation, in strengthening controls to prevent the use of abusive practices, such as false work, which is seriously damaging to small and medium-sized enterprises in agriculture, in the agri-food sector and also in the construction sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3319, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Csaba Sógor (PPE).", "mepid": "39724", "text": "   – Madam President, back in the 2000s, Central and Eastern European countries joined a European Union based on an open market economy with free competition, and on a single market with four freedoms, opening up their economies to fierce competition from companies that had far more capital and far more technological advantage than theirs.

However, the course of industrial relations in European countries shows that no effective action has been taken while social dumping continues to exist by reinforcing discrimination and unequal treatment among workers.

Dear Commissioner, colleagues. I agree with many of the provisions contained in this report. However, I note that we must not overdo it, especially with regard to transport companies. Cases of exploitation of workers are repeated on a regular basis. It is clear that it is very difficult to prevent these violations, all the more so because workers who are subject to crises, deprivation or other reasons often agree with all the conditions of the employer. These people rarely report irregularities to the responsible authorities because they would lose their jobs. What is further complicated by the fact that some companies are registered in one country and actually operate in another country. We need to protect workers, but on the other hand we cannot create a procedure that prevents business competition. For example, we cannot force a Lithuanian transport company to pay the driver of a vehicle a huge German salary just because he loads and unloads goods in this country, even though that driver already receives a higher than average Lithuanian salary.

Member States are responsible for enforcing labour law, rules for the posting of workers, rules on free movement and on health and safety at work, and – yes, Mr Balas – national labour inspectorates need sufficient resources to do that. We have already put in place several instruments that offer national authorities more and better tools to make sure that free movement is fair and well managed and that abuse is prevented. We have the Platform against undeclared work, we have the Enforcement Directive on free movement of workers that makes mobile workers more aware of their rights and establishes national bodies to enforce those rights. We have the Enforcement Directive on posting of workers that introduces measures to prevent and penalise any abuses or circumventions of European rules on posting. With the upcoming social pillar – and this is important because, indeed, social dumping is not only about mobile work – and with the targeted revision of the Posting of Workers Directive, with the amendments of the social security coordination regulation that are under preparation, with the roads initiatives, we want to make our acquis stronger and adapt it to the new challenges on the labour market.

He set out the real alternative if we do nothing, that is, it is simple, the end of the European Union, the end of the internal market, the end of directives, the re-establishment of national borders, the end of free movement. He's clear and he's counting on us to fail. He thinks we will fail, because he thinks we are too divided today to answer him.

It has been a long day for all of us but I believe that those who have actually stayed here – and I see Madam Commissioner joining us – and had the courage and stamina to stay here into the late evening are the true friends of the budget. I have the honour of presenting to you the Council’s position on the draft budget of the European Union for the year 2017, which was adopted yesterday by the Council.  I would like to begin by stating clearly that the main thrust of the Council’s position is the prioritisation of expenditure. This means that we wish to finance adequately investments to spur growth and jobs, for example through the European Fund for Strategic Investments, and to provide sufficient funding to tackle the still ongoing migration crisis and the related external policies. At the same time, it is the Council’s express wish to create sufficient margins to enable us to cope with unforeseen situations that we will surely have to face into 2017. In our view, the annual budget is an expression of our solidarity, the solidarity which goes internally amongst the Member States, and the citizens as well as externally towards third countries, which is a common goal that we all share. Therefore, the EU budget should concentrate on the main objectives of the EU and on benefiting our citizens.  Let me now explain to you how the Council looked at priorities and the guiding principles. These priorities, which were reflected in the thinking by the Member States and the Council, translate into concrete guiding principles that were applied when adopting the Council’s position on the draft budget for 2017. First, tackling the refugee crisis is a key priority, and hence so is the financing for migration and related external policies. Therefore, heading 3 – Security and citizenship, which funds policies on tackling the migration and refugee crisis, benefits from a significant increase of 4.9% in commitments and 24.4% in payment appropriations compared to 2016. The Council has accepted in full all appropriations destined for the programmes and agencies dealing with the crisis, including the use of the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 530 million and the contingency margin for an amount of EUR 1.14 billion. In total, the Council has agreed an amount of EUR 3 billion, which goes mainly to the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, to the Internal Security Fund, to emergency assistance and to the related agencies such as Frontex, EASO and Europol.  In heading 4 – Global Europe, the Council undertook a thorough analysis in order to identify space for creating the necessary margin since the Commission’s proposal for 2017 has completely exhausted the margin for commitments. The overall increase in commitments remains at 1.74%, compared to 2016. Programmes and instruments related to the migration crisis and the facility for refugees in Turkey were not affected by reductions. So you can see that the Council stands fully behind the European Agenda on Migration, as was agreed between us in 2015.  Second, a priority and concern for all of us is the creation of jobs and growth. Subheading 1A – Competitiveness for growth and jobs, therefore increases overall by almost 9% in both commitments and payment appropriations compared to 2016. The Council protects and supports the budget for instruments that spur growth and thereby create jobs, namely such instruments as EFSI, COSME, Erasmus+ and others. Subheading 1A, however, has also contributed to the general savings effort concerning some budget lines where the Council considers, following a detailed technical analysis, that the Commission has overestimated the real needs. Concerning Subheading 1B – Economic, social and territorial cohesion, which is another core policy of the European Union for the creation of growth and jobs, the Council proposes limited reductions of payment appropriations on new programmes of EUR 199 million. However, the Council has not reduced appropriations dedicated to the previous programming period, 2007—2013, and to the treatment of the backlog of unpaid bills. That deadlock should be fully resolved by the end of this year in accordance with the payment plan.  Before concluding, let me briefly address the issue of Heading 5 –Administration. As you all know – and I think Parliament has been part of this deal – 2017 is the last year for institutions to achieve the goal of reducing their statutory staff by 5%. Frankly, the Council and the Member States are very concerned to note that not all institutions will achieve that goal. Therefore the Council has made it very clear in a statement that it expects that all efforts will be deployed to avoid any additional delays in implementing this jointly-agreed reduction target.  In conclusion, as you can see, in an effort to find the right balance between, on the one hand, a sustainable budget in times of budgetary constraints throughout Europe and, on the other hand, financing essential political priorities, the Council has identified areas where savings are reasonable and necessary. In those areas that cannot be qualified as top political priorities in the current circumstances, reductions in the proposal of the Commission have been made in a careful fashion in order not to harm programmes that perform well and are coming up to speed. In doing so we have followed the Council’s budget guidelines for 2017.  Let me express my hope and confidence that we will find a common path to securing a reasonable and sustainable budget that will bring maximum benefits for all our fellow citizens. Above all, I hope that our debate on this important but technical matter will pave the way to a successful compromise based on mutual respect and understanding and shared goals and concerns.

On the discussion of the Council reading on the Commission’s proposal, I want to start from where we are clearly in alignment. There is a commonality of purpose which is to make sure that our budget for 2017 is aligned with our two top priorities: investment in jobs and growth and dealing with migration, refugees and security. We are clearly more in alignment on one of these priorities – migration, refugees and security – on which the Commission proposal has been fully endorsed in the reading of Council. However, there are some discrepancies in views and I want to concentrate on the logic behind what the Commission has proposed and to defend our proposal. Regarding investment in jobs and growth, we have dedicated nearly half – 47.4% – of the budget to that, which includes an increase vis-à-vis 2016 of 7%. We have done that consciously, taking into account the status of our economies and we have looked very carefully into each and every budget line. For that reason, we were quite underwhelmed by the reading of the Council on Heading 1A, where, on competitiveness, jobs and growth, there are proposed cuts of EUR 400 million. This means 52% of the cuts that Council is proposing falling on an area that I do not think any one of us can disagree is important for Europe. I would point to some of these cuts, for example in research, at a time when we need to stimulate innovation and make sure that European researchers are coming close to the real economy. We were surprised to see that there are proposed cuts for some large—scale projects for which there is very high demand, like transport and energy, Galileo and Copernicus. Some of these cuts are just very bad use of the knife, in terms of the consequences of the costs we would then incur. If, in Galileo, you build the satellite but you do not shoot it up, you have to store it and pay for its storage. Similarly, I would express a bit of concern that there is some mechanical cutting when it comes to some of the Heading 3 small programmes like health, SMEs and dialogue with citizens, or cuts in global Europe – EUR 62 million in cuts – when we know that, if anything, we have to do more to address the root causes of poverty, and thus of wars, refugees and migration. I would say, from the bottom of my heart, that I have sympathy for the Council in terms of keeping us on the straight and narrow when it comes to administrative cost. We are very mindful that every day we have to look into what we spent on administration, with an eye to economising: and we do that. I can tell you that – line by line – we are cutting every budget line that is not driven upwards by natural forces. But to demand from us that we go beyond the 5% staff cut, by introducing an additional reduction, I do not find very wise because we are committed to the 5% cut: we are executing the 5% cut while undertaking more responsibilities, and we motivate our staff by telling them we are cutting as much as we have promised – no less, but also no more. On payment appropriations, there is a very important point for the Council to take into account, namely that in 2016, unfortunately, some of the new programmes are underperforming and therefore the absorption rate in payments is lower than projected. This on its own is a problem, but it also creates a problem for 2017, when we anticipate that some of these non-materialising payments could come knocking on the door. Therefore we would argue very strongly for the Council to revisit this position. We are not proposing a proportionate increase in 2017 equal to the underspending in 2016. We are sticking to where we are, but it would be unwise to attempt a further reduction. Finally, I want once again to make a clear statement on our commitment to monitor implementation. We are grateful to Parliament and to the Council for your engagement with us to make sure that we constantly improve our capacity to project what is necessary and to correct our course so we can use money in the wisest possible manner. We are keen to continue to work with Council, and of course with Parliament, so that the 2017 budget becomes a reality on time.

Madam President, Vice-President Georgieva, Minister Hudik, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work she has said. The EU must deliver, I hear, when the EU crisis is being discussed these days. We have to be great at the tasks and their solutions. However, we must then also be able to finance the solution to these tasks, and in doing so the Council is in a contradictory situation. It is true that there are the common priorities that we have already heard: the management of the migration crisis, for example with the foreign policy resources in category 4, more resources for growth and employment – for that there is category 1A. But these are precisely the categories in which the Council intervenes most.  The Council is cutting the Commission's proposal on horizon 2020 research policy and in transport policy – and thus on two programmes that have already been deprived of money when it came to the guarantee amount for the European Fund for Strategic Investments in order to get the guarantee payment together. There are cuts proposed by the Council in social cooperation, that is, money for the European trade unions, or micro-credits, a tried and tested social policy instrument. A Social Democrat like me can only see this as a provocation.  In category 1B, the Council is massively cutting cross-border cooperation, a programme with clear European added value. The nation states do not have any support instruments that help people living on the borders of the Member States, for example, to raise economic potential across borders with their neighbours.  In category 4, what the Council is proposing means, as a result, that we are falling below the level of the 2016 budget. I am not aware of any foreign policy crisis that would have been resolved in recent months, so I do not see any political reason why we would have to invest less here, even though important instruments in development cooperation have already had to hand over a lot of money to the Facility for Refugees in Turkey. Not only here: the Council is weakening crisis management instruments with its budget proposal, which the EU urgently needs and which the Council itself is calling for. The question then arises: why?  The only explanation I find is that it is a ritual. It is about swiping for the sake of swiping. And this becomes clear when you consider that it was the net contributors— states that pushed through this deletion. But if the cuts in payments and commitments amount to around 0.8 per cent of the budget are moving, then the argument, Minister, that margins for unforeseen things is at stake cannot really be taken seriously. But it certainly does not mean significant savings for net contributors. It's a ritual. It is the opposite of the demand that the EU should contribute to solving the major problems, and I would ask you to put an end to this ritual.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3336, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Indrek Tarand", "mepid": "97136", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, my thanks to the Slovak Presidency, which communicated its decisions. As usual, our Treaties and Rules of Procedure guide us with tremendous force through the unknown seas of the Bermuda Triangle, where both co-legislators and honest brokers can get lost. The end of the story seems to be that no one will be happy but there is no one to be blamed, or actually the name of the game is normally to blame another institution. However, this year we are trying to chart a different course together with my dear colleague and main rapporteur, Mr Geier. We will not blame anybody but ourselves, and that is taking a whole lot of responsibility, perhaps even a bit too much. About administrative costs, I must admit, under the circumstances prescribed by the Treaties and numerous rules and practices, it is quite a stressful situation to be responsible for something you cannot actually really change or can change only cosmetically. Whatever direction you try to take, there are obstacles called ‘interinstitutional agreement’, ‘Staff Regulations’, ‘establishment plan’ etc., but the ultimate barrier is the so-called ‘gentlemen’s agreement’. I have been wondering who exactly those gentlemen were because it would be lovely to meet them and discuss whether their agreement is still up to date, but those thoughts are a matter for another discussion.  A few comments now on the Council position on other sections. As I pointed out at the first trilogue, I am thoroughly unable to find common sense or reason in the Council’s wish to cut the appropriations for the European Court of Justice and also for the Data Protection Supervisor. Please allow me to illustrate it briefly. As far as I understand, the evidence shows that the European Court of Justice did ask for an increase of 12 judges to cope with its growing workload, yet it was given 28 by the Council, most likely because the Council was unable to tame the atavist instincts of the Member States, hence each State was given an additional judge regardless of whether this was necessary. In so doing, the Council pushed up so-called organisational costs in the budget but now, with its other hand, it wants to reduce the substantial side of the Court’s budget, thereby hampering its ability to deal with its principal tasks. That is why as a rapporteur I intend to restore the original estimated lines promptly. Data protection is a hotly debated topic. Indeed, it is full of controversy and paradoxes. We all have two hands here, and quite frequently we use one of them to vote for more data protection and against American and other possible surveillance of our data. Having done that, quite a number of us voluntarily put an activity tracker on the other hand, sending, via our apps and internet use, all sorts of data to the American private companies, such as how many steps do we make per day or what we had for lunch, or perhaps even what our heartbeat is while having sex. We can only hope that those companies deal carefully with our data. So once we have decided to have a small agency to supervise European data protection, it is really unwise to cut the financial resources it has to do that.  To conclude, I would like to thank the partners in the budgetary process. The process has enabled me to meet extremely professional officials, wonderful and creative colleagues in various institutions whose experience and goodwill and devotion to Europe has brought us here.

Firstly, the speech of the President of the Commission on the State of the Union and in the wake of the presentation of the draft revision mid-term of the multi-year financial framework 2014-2020. Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a dream. Dream that the 2017 budget will no longer be just an annual slice of the financial framework. Our budgetary hemiplegia prevents us from deliberating on revenue. As for our field of work, spending, 1% of European GDP, is distributed at a rate of 80% to the benefit of the Member States. Only 20% remains for supranational actions, that is, the essence of the European budget. But a third of this 20% is already pre-empted to finance the institutions - the Commission, Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the agencies. How in these conditions, how to respond to crisis situations and prepare for the future? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, less than 14% of our budget is allocated to Horizon 2020 research programmes, for Erasmus, for the infrastructure interconnection programme in Europe, to control our external borders, to welcome refugees with dignity, to fight terrorism, to fight unemployment, especially that of young people, to regulate agricultural production, to fight tax havens and fraud of all kinds. , fulfilling our humanitarian obligations in war-torn regions, drying up sources of economic migration through an ambitious development assistance policy, particularly in Africa. Mirror of the past, the financial framework is anachronistic, deprived of significant flexibility. That's the zero degree of politics. The situation is so miserable that the Commission is multiplying the budgetary satellites - EFSI, trust funds, budgetary facility for Turkey - real galaxies escaping parliamentary control. Our budget gives a show of impotence, an illegible budget, an incomprehensible budget by the citizens, an illustration of the European Union's inability to talk to Europeans. Dream that the mid-term revision of the multi-year financial framework will take our budget out of the simulacrum where it has slipped over the years. Let us be vigilant about the appropriations made available to Member States and the cohesion funds which are inherently sanctified. Payment forecasts are revised downwards as commitments are slow to be decided. What for? Probably because the new cohesion programs and regulations have become so complex that they put off public investors and local actors. That is to say the urgency of a drastic revision of our financial regulation. Perhaps also because, however important, European aid covers only part of the expenditure, forcing operators to take on debt as if Europe were becoming a contributor to public spending and debt. In conclusion, at this stage of the budgetary procedure, we remain confident. We look forward to designing and voting budgets that give the Union the means to show its power, budgets that speak to Europeans, budgets that demonstrate to public opinion the effectiveness of the added value of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3338, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Vazil Hudák", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all those who spoke during this discussion. I think the discussion showed that we may have some different views but in general we are united by the fact that we want to have a workable budget, a good budget for European citizens. One of the issues or challenges we have is that we have too many priorities and too little money, and the question is how to use the money in the best possible way. I remember long and painful discussions at the national level in my country, in my government, where we had to go through very painful decisions on where to cut, where to take away and how to adjust the budget. Unfortunately there are also similar situations at the European level. I can assure the Members, and Mr Geier, that the cuts which were made by the Council were not ritual, were not easy, were not technical, and followed many discussions among the Member States and a lot of deliberation.  I would also like to put those numbers which came out of the Council into some perspective by comparing both the proposal from the Commission and numbers from 2016. This comparison shows that in the proposal from the Council we are actually talking about increasing commitments by 0.9% in comparison to 2016. There is a drop in payments of 7%, which we believe is justified because of the low absorption of the EU funds in some of the categories.  So again the change is not major and it reflects the views of the Member States, including the situation in their own countries. If I may, just very briefly, address some of the important points which were made during the discussion. The Council fully agrees that the priority of competitiveness, of jobs, of economic growth, is a key issue for Europe. Europe can survive in the global economy only as a competitive economy. The cuts made to sub-heading 1A were focused on areas in which some investments may be postponed because 2017 may be too soon for them. We also made sure that the Council has not proposed any reductions to the programmes that are best placed to achieve the political goal of economic growth, such as EFSI, core parts of the Horizon 2020, COSME, Erasmus+ etc. So we tried to preserve those core elements of the budget which we believe are the main drivers of economic growth. In response to the points made by Mr Tarand on the European Court of Justice, this is an issue where we also looked very carefully at the budget. We took into account the increase in the budget of the European Court of Justice in 2016 and which helped with the process of reform. That increase was EUR 21 million. We believe that the further increase requested by the European Court of Justice for next year is not fully justified. The Council is ready to support the reforms but not at the level requested.  I think the points made by Mr Arthuis are very important. They go into the very substance of the budget, its composition, and looking into the future, how we adjust the structure of budget, both in terms of revenues but also expenditure, to the needs of modern Europe. This is something that we certainly have to discuss as part of the MFF mid-term review, that we have to discuss as part of the post 2020 discussions and of the European Commission. I think Kristalina is going to present some of the ideas tomorrow, and we look forward to that. It is the common job of all the institutions to gradually adjust the budget in a way which would look into the future for 2017, and we want to keep the main focus of these discussions on the 2017 budget. We believe that we are proposing a budget which is balanced and which also reflects the situations in the Member States. Lastly, I would like to express my huge appreciation for the discussion today, even at this late hour. As we have seen, views may differ but the goal is a common one, which is to adopt the best budget for Europe and its citizens. We will now eagerly await the position of the European Parliament on the budget for 2017, and we also look forward to the process of seeking to reconcile those differences together. As in past years, we will count on the Commission, and in particular on Vice-President Georgieva, acting as a honest broker in this in this process, and I would also like to wish Mr Arthuis, the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, as well as Mr Geier and Mr Tarand as rapporteurs the best of luck for their work over the coming months within Parliament. I am also looking forward to our cooperation. I wish to assure you that the Slovak Presidency will do its best to make sure the 2017 budget is achieved and is a good budget.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3339, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Bogdan Andrzej Zdrojewski (PPE)", "mepid": "124893", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. – I did not find the cuts proposed by the Council in the draft EU budget for 2017 particularly surprising. This is a practice that we have been experiencing systematically for a long time in the framework of budgetary planning in the EU. On the other hand, I was concerned about the significant cuts under Heading 3, totaling almost EUR 24.3 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 21.6 million in payment appropriations. While acknowledging that, compared to this year's budget, both commitments and payments in this heading remain at a higher ceiling, I would point out, however, that this heading has been particularly affected by cuts motivated by new needs related to the challenges that the Union has faced recently. I would also point out that, while many of these cuts may seem small, given the existence of relatively small budgets, small but emblematic and successful programmes, e.g. cooperation in the fields of culture, education, youth and sport, these cuts can jeopardise their effective implementation and thus deliver the expected results.

Before coming to the details of this Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Southern African Development Community States, allow me to share a story with you. The SADC EPA may sound extremely technical but it provides real opportunities for our European partner countries. During the signing ceremony that took place in Kasane, the singer Sesame Samantha Marumo performed a poem that inspired everyone in the room. The poem spoke about the hope of the people in the South African region that the Agreement will offer opportunities that are badly needed. Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, I think this shows that our partners in Africa know about the potential of the EPA. They look forward to the day that the Agreement enters into force and it is high time for that to happen.  Let us look back for a moment. Everything started very early, already at the end of the 1990s when the ACP countries and the European Union came to a common understanding that our trade relations needed a fresh start. As most of you know, the Cotonou Agreement called for changes in longstanding non-reciprocal trade preferences that had governed the economic and political relationship between the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of States, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other, for the last four decades. It was only on 15 July 2014, after ten years of negotiating, that the European Union and SADC – the SADC EPA Group, more precisely comprising Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland – finally concluded the Agreement. The SADC EPA will foster a smooth and gradual integration of the African partner countries into the world economy. Through trade and investment it contributes to sustainable development and poverty reduction. Let us remember one thing: Africa is the growth continent. African countries are climbing up the ‘doing business’ rankings. New businesses are emerging and African countries are becoming less dependent on commodities. Africa offers something energising. The EPA will only be one instrument to tap into this energy, but it will prove pivotal in re-anchoring the trade bonds between Africa and the European Union.  Let me be very clear about one thing. I do not understand the last minute sudden opposition coming from some Members in this House. Those who are now being lobbied intensely by the citrus fruit lobby should know what the opposition means to the people in the South African States, but also for those European businesses seeking much needed potential for growth. Moreover, they should also know that the arguments brought forward are actually unsubstantiated and that their fears are not borne out by the facts. Imports of citrus fruit have previously not been liberalised during the European Union’s harvesting season and, ladies and gentlemen, this will remain so under this SADC EPA. Let us remember one thing: the EU will benefit as we obtain better access to the Southern African Customs Union markets for a number of products, but what is particularly important is that many geographical indications from the EU will be protected in South Africa under this EPA. There are things that come to mind like Parma ham, Parmiggiano Reggiano, Aceto Balsamico di Modena, things from the very countries where now all of a sudden we have this surprising opposition to what is a really good agreement.  The Agreement does not only help to liberalise trade and foster development but has a number of features which are beneficial for the countries concerned. First, the EPA contains a large number of safeguards, meaning that all EPA countries can activate these and raise import duties if imports from the EU threaten to disrupt the domestic industry. Moreover, should the EU apply a multilateral safeguard on the WTO rules, the EU offers its EPA partners a renewable five-year exemption from its application. Secondly, the rules of origin have been written in such a way that exports of textiles under preferential rates will become much easier. Moreover, the SADC EPA helps to diversify the economies of our partner countries. Thirdly, due to the asymmetric liberalisation, the SADC EPA States do not have to fully reciprocate the market opening. Instead, they can protect sensitive products from liberalisation. To be more precise, it foresees the exclusion of sensitive products, long liberalisation periods, flexible rules of origin and special safeguards and measures for agriculture food security and infant industry protection. This EPA also contains some of the strongest language on rights and sustainable development available in EU agreements. In SADC the first chapter is devoted to sustainable development, which underlines the importance of this aspect to the parties. Let me thank all of you for the remarks and ideas that we have exchanged during our discussions. We already, as the European Parliament, voted a resolution on the SADC EU interim EPA in March 2009 and our wish list really finds itself in almost all the points in the agreement that we now have. I strongly believe that this EPA has the potential to bring fundamental positive change and contribute to sustainable economic growth and deepened intra-regional trade integration. I hope for your support and thank all the shadows and the Commission for the excellent work. As Chairman Lange is not here to speak on behalf of the Committee, I am taking his role as the author of the oral question on this particular EPA. I would like to thank my colleague, Joachim Schuster, and the S&amp;D Group, who have played a major role in bringing this up. The question is how we monitor the implementation of this agreement. How do we involve civil society more clearly? Article 4 of the Agreement stipulates that the parties agree to continuously monitor the operation and the impact of this agreement. The Agreement also sets out a review of the Agreement to take place every five years. However, we believe that it is crucial to put flesh on the bones of these provisions and that the practical tools for this monitoring need to be strengthened. We believe that the absence of a joint parliamentary committee and a joint consultative committee, which exist in the Cariforum EPA but are not part of the SADC EPA text, may be felt here unless existing structures can be used. We think that pragmatic solutions are now key in order to maximise the positive impact of the Agreement. Today, therefore, we, as the INTA Committee and as this Parliament, would like to know the following points from the Commission: 1. What specific measures will the Commission take to ensure that the EPA is implemented in a manner which upholds the sustainable development provisions of the SADC EPA, and will it consider setting up a structured civil society monitoring process, such as a Domestic Advisory Group and provisions for parliamentary oversight? 2. Could the Commission elaborate on how any civil society involvement would be financed? 3. How does the Commission intend to take on board civil society reports and recommendations to address cases of infringement of commitments under the EPA?  4. What measures will the Commission undertake to ensure policy coherence for development in the implementation of the Agreement? Thank you very much for your attention, and I am looking forward to our debate here.

It says that: ‘as free trade agreements enters into force, the EU will have to make sure that the provisions on trade and sustainable development are implemented and used effectively’. That is exactly what we will be talking about today in relation to the agreement with the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Sustainable development issues are of high importance but they also need to be implemented and monitored and that is why I am very grateful for the opportunity of having this debate and answering the questions here tonight. You will vote tomorrow. As the rapporteur said, and I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs for the work on the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), with six countries in southern Africa. I had the pleasure of signing the agreement when I was in Botswana this June. This agreement will start a new relationship between us in the European Union and these six countries: Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland. Why will it do this? Well because, while negotiating this deal, we took full account of the economic and societal differences between the countries involved and that has led us to eliminate much more of our custom duties than we are asking our Southern African partners to do. So the EU is opening up our market much faster and, furthermore, providing free market access to the African countries involved. The markets of the six African countries are going to be only partially and very gradually opened to European products, and their right to vote on protective measures, to protect nascent fragile industries and for future food-security reasons, will remain. Our trade relations will be based on a predictable business environment, getting rid of customs duties for African exporters, big and small, and by then we will have commonly agreed rules in areas such as customer procedures, future sanitary measures, rules of religion, and technical barriers to trade. This will also contribute to diversifying the economies of many countries in Southern Africa that are seeking to broaden production and include a wider range of products and services, and it will foster regional integration of markets in Southern Africa. This is a powerful tool for prosperity, stability and growth, and all the countries raised this issue with me when I spoke to them in Botswana. Let me also underline what the rapporteur said, because I have heard that there are some concerns circulating here about this Economic Partnership Agreement and oranges. The agreement has been available online with all its annexes, all 1 300 pages, on our website for more than a year. Nothing has happened since: everybody has been able to read it and we have not heard any of these problems raised before. Imports of oranges or citrus fruit during the EU season from December to May will not be liberalised. We are talking only about out-of-season imports and that has been the case since the year 2000: imports of oranges from 1 June to 15 October. The SADC EPA adds only six weeks to this period, and that includes the month of November, during which South Africa exports less than 1% of its total production. The duties will remain high, there are specific safeguards and we will monitor the process, so I am happy to tell you that some of the concerns I have been hearing are not really grounded. We will continue to monitor this very closely. Turning now to the questions that the rapporteur raised on behalf of Parliament and the Committee on International Trade, let me assure you, first of all, that we are obliged to monitor the operation of all the agreements. Like other economic partnership agreements, this SADC agreement requires monitoring to assure that all the objectives of the EPA, including those of sustainable development, are realised, and that the benefits are maximised for all, especially the most vulnerable. EPAs are, furthermore, anchored in the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement and that includes sustainable development objectives, provisions on labour and environment and, very importantly, democratic principles and human rights. The monitoring we will put in place will contribute to assessing whether our partners respect the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement and, in the event of breaches of it, appropriate measures can be proposed. The monitoring will also be fed into a review that each EPA undergoes every five years. So more specifically: I propose to you that the monitoring will be based on three principles: transparency, objectivity, and openness. Transparency in the sense that the results of the monitoring will become accessible to all – to you, of course, but also to a wider audience. Objectivity in the sense that the monitoring will be neutral, systematic, and involve independent expertise. Open in the sense that the monitoring will involve outside stakeholders. I believe it is very important that outside stakeholders are involved in the monitoring. So I am committed, as is the whole Commission, to structural civil-society dialogue, ideally once per year. We will have no problem finding parties, including relevant organisations, to take part in this. We have already started to identify possible civil-society organisations, and we are already planning the first dialogues this month and in October in South Africa. With regard to parliamentary oversight, I fully support an interparliamentary dialogue between the European Parliament and the parliaments of the six states and I really want to encourage you to establish this already. How will we finance this? Well, you have my commitment that we will seek to ensure adequate funding is put aside. One route is a project that the Commission’s Directorate-General for Trade, in collaboration with our service for foreign policy instruments, is drawing up to finance the involvement of civil society in trade agreements. The Commission also has other funding possibilities – for instance, under thematic programmes that support specifically the participation of civil society in partner countries and the EU. How will we then take on board this civil-society input? Well, we will ensure that the results of the dialogues are made available to the ministerial councils established under the EPAs to oversee the monitoring process. In the case of West Africa and East Africa, those EPAs contain provisions for the civil-society dialogue to work in consultation with the EPA institutions. In the case of the SADC EPA, the text requires the parties to undertake the monitoring within their respective participative processes and institutions. The last question was on policy coherence. We have a long track record of making trade a tool for development. This is done by granting preferential market access, by providing aid for trade and by addressing any coherence issue that arises, and the EPA is, of course, part of this policy. We give full access to our market, but we ask for less in return. We provide for safeguards to make sure that domestic industries are not damaged and we will introduce flexible rules of origin. We will also accompany our trade partners in meeting the commitments on trade and sustainable development in accordance with the provisions in Article 11 of the agreement, and this includes assistance through EU development cooperation. In addition, we have made available support under the European Development Fund. In Eastern and Southern Africa, regional programmes amount to EUR 1.3 billion and national programmes to around EUR 7.2 billion: these funds are not used entirely for trade-related support, but spending of EUR 600 million on relevant infrastructure gives you an idea of how much this can facilitate trade. Also the EPAs provide the structures in which any coherence issue can be addressed. So I think we have a good chance of getting this right. Our partners are very keen to start working together as soon as possible under these premises, and we are convinced that the economic partnership and sustainable development can go hand in hand. I am committed to make that happen and I am looking forward to working with you on all these steps.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3343, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Pedro Silva Pereira", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  draftsman of the Opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. – Mr President, this economic partnership agreement with the six southern African countries of the CADC community has come a long way, but the result is overall positive and deserves the support of this Parliament, as the Development Committee has concluded in the opinion of which I am rapporteur.  First, this agreement is necessary to comply with world trade organization rules. Without it, African countries would be less protected in trade with Europe.  Secondly, it is an agreement that seeks to be fair and is therefore asymmetrical and gradual: it allows developing countries to protect their most sensitive sectors and includes safeguards for industries, agricultural markets and food security.  Thirdly, this agreement has a chapter on sustainable development, with clear commitments on labour rights and environmental rights. Not everything is perfect, certainly, but I think we can say that the end result is indeed positive. The challenge is now in good implementation and effective monitoring, and this will only exist with an effective involvement of civil society. We of course welcome the commitments made here by the Commissioner, but this Parliament expects more than words and will not fail to monitor this process itself and ensure the proper implementation of this agreement, for the sake of our partner countries in Africa, but also for the sake of the values of the European Union's trade agenda.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3344, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Gabriel Mato", "mepid": "96936", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, we are discussing an Economic Partnership Agreement which, as we have seen, opens a new stage in relations between the European Union and six countries of the Southern African Development Community. It has been a difficult and protracted deal, but I am sure that the end result will generally be beneficial. Hence, our support, as we created a clear legal framework and also succeeded in extending the previous Interim Agreement, as South Africa joined these talks. Having said that, we cannot ignore that, in general, all economic partnership agreements always have some point of friction, and it also has them. As I have heard many times, someone has to pay the bill for these agreements and, unfortunately, this bill is usually paid by the agricultural sector. In any case, we are facing an important agreement, as it is the first one we signed in the European Union with an African region. I hope it will serve as an impetus for talks to strengthen the relationship between Europe and Africa soon. On the positive side, the Agreement enables certain sensitive sectors to be protected, safeguard clauses and measures to protect nascent industries, as well as facilitating export, while providing for human rights protection clauses and a commitment to sustainable development. But it's not all positive. The Agreement may have negative consequences for Community citrus production, and this could have been avoided despite what has been said here. You have to take two aspects into account. I believe that there has not been enough information in the negotiation on the concessions granted mainly to South Africa – a direct competitor to European Union productions - nor has there been a study of the impact of these measures on our productions. On the other hand, we are extremely concerned about the guarantee, or rather the absence of a guarantee, of the phytosanitary control of these productions. The replies which the Commission has given us so far on the black spot do not reassure us at all.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. The so-called Economic Partnership Agreements have been under negotiation with the ACP countries for some 15 years, and it is still debatable to this day whether the ACP countries will really benefit from these agreements.  The debate on citrus fruit is now completely new, and I think it has already been said sufficiently that the fears are really unfounded and that we cannot do that. But there is indeed a question: does the expansion of free trade not threaten young industries in African countries, and does the abolition of tariffs not lead to a weakening of African states? However, it must also be seen that the debate on this is often very general, and we must not lump all African regions together. Nor must we lump together the various Economic Partnership Agreements. And if you look at the agreement for southern Africa, I think most of the points are addressed.  The agreement contains a sustainability chapter. It contains references to the Cotonou Agreement, which will apply even when the Cotonou Agreement expires in 2020. It includes an obligation to link trade with development cooperation. Trade liberalisation is asymmetric. If there are disadvantages for economies or industries, industries or even agriculture in southern Africa, it is possible to use comprehensive trade defence instruments. So the agreement has all the potential for mutually beneficial development. Whether these potentials are realised will, of course, depend on how the agreement is implemented.  That is why we in the S&amp;D Group have also pushed for strong monitoring structures involving civil society, and the Commissioner has just explained what the Commission intends to do about this. And I believe that we in the European Parliament should also take note of the fact that the South African states also see the agreement as a positive opportunity for their development. That is why the governments and the parliaments have also agreed, including those of the states that have been very critical of these agreements for a long time.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. To present this reciprocal asymmetric agreement under the name SADC is misleading. Only six of the fifteen Member States of the Southern African Development Community have signed. The others are in three other negotiating groups or have immediately decided against such an agreement. Why? The fifteen will therefore in future have completely different trade rules with regard to the EU, but also with each other, and the SADC secretariat will be completely undermined.  Is this the promotion of regional integration called for in Africa, in the eu-AU joint strategy on Africa? Is this the response to the concerns of the Heads of State or Government of the eighth ACP Summit, who emphatically made regional integration the centrepiece and objective of the negotiations? Not to mention the demands of many, especially often weak trade unions and civic-society initiatives for enforceable labour, environmental and social standards.  And – yes, many African governments also shy away from enforceable norms and appropriate instruments. We are in this situation because the EU-Commission wanted to force its success in the negotiations. It has already been said that Cotonou will soon be leaving. What comes next is open.  New competitors in the American markets have appeared. It is therefore also and specifically a question of market access and the assertion of positions. That is why there has been a successful threat of withdrawal of market access to the EU's internal market. The partner governments and parliaments bowed to this blackmail very quickly, understandably. The debates in the societies of the SADC states and really new strategies are being stifled.

It is a very important agreement that abolishes virtually all EU tariffs against these countries, but allows African trading partners to abolish their tariffs gradually and in the sensitive product areas is not actually at all. This is very important for regional integration in these African countries. It simplifies the rules of origin and makes fewer barriers to trade between African countries, which until now has been one of the biggest obstacles to development. This is important because free trade in history has proven to be the best tool for lifting people and countries out of poverty. Yet it seems that there is a risk that a majority of members of this House will vote against the agreement. However, it is not only the case that there is a risk of missing out on all these benefits of the agreement, but it also risks giving poor countries such as Swaziland, Namibia and Botswana higher tariffs to the EU and meeting the FULL CUSTOMS WALL of the EU when their current trade regime in the EU expires in December.

It is an unholy alliance between those who, on the one hand, say that the agreement threatens production in Europe, especially on the agricultural side, on the other hand, some who say exactly the same thing, but that it threatens agricultural production in Africa. One of them is wrong. I am thinking about who is actually the worst of these groups of protectionists. I have never met anyone who claims to be a protectionist in this house, but I have met many who say they want to protect one or the other. I have come to the conclusion, after mature consideration, that they are probably the ones who, here tonight and tomorrow when they vote, claim that they are voting against the agreement in order to protect African countries. Those Members say they know better than these African countries themselves do. This agreement between democracies is approved in the parliaments and ratified by these countries. Yet you mean that you can sit down to judgment over and think it's bad for them, even though they want it. It is not just protectionism, it is neoimperialism. This time neoimperialism comes from the left and is at its most dangerous. I therefore hope that tomorrow we will vote in favour of this agreement.

This is a ridiculous last minute scare story that has been thrown into the pot here. On the other side of the coin, some Members think that the Agreement is a threat to SADC countries and to their economies. As we have heard, though, from virtually every speaker, this is an asymmetrical agreement. It contains safeguards for infant industries and it protects sensitive products. As we have just heard, if we reject this agreement the situation is worse for African countries because they will have to revert to GSP or to other less—satisfactory regimes. I welcome what the Commissioner said about the sustainable development chapter. I am glad it is going to have adequate funding and I look forward to civil society being fully involved in monitoring this EPA. I am personally absolutely convinced that a properly implemented EPA with accompanying measures such as aid for trade will be good for Africa.

I come from Sicily, Mrs Malmström, and Sicily is a citrus fruit production area, an area in which I will invite you to come and invite you on 15 October, because you have just said in this House that this six-week extension does not overlap with European production. I will invite you on 15 October to taste the fruits of our trees, precisely so that you can see that from 15 October to 30 November citrus fruits are produced in Sicily, as well as in all the other European countries, in southern Europe.  Therefore there is an overlap of production and the oranges that will be exported from South Africa will compete with those of my territory. Since the highest prices are popping up at the beginning, with the most early production, it is clear that these late exports, in the counter-season, from the southern hemisphere, will have a major impact on farmers' incomes. That is why I invite you to come to Sicily to see what the real situation is and what the effects will be.  A second aspect, however, is the implementation of the agreements.

Unfortunately, I have to admit that the Government of Spain has not done its job in defence of Spanish citrus fruits, and I ask the Commission to be concerned about protecting and defending the interests of Mediterranean producers. That is why I believe it is essential that South Africa's volume inlet and citrus sales be monitored monthly, applying the safeguard clause if necessary, as well as countervailing measures. Extending the period of entry of exports from South Africa, so as to coincide with the European production campaign, will have an impact, and the important thing is to have assessed it before and measure it in case protective measures are necessary.

Lesotho is running out of water and can no longer produce its maize. There was a 60% increase in the price of maize in Lesotho. He can no longer feed his people.

So of course it's harmful. In addition, there has been shown that there is no impact study, and this impact study on the extension of the period must be required.

It is indeed, not a perfect, but a good agreement and it has a lot of potential and I have promised you that we will do this. Actually, preparations have already started in South Africa for a structured civil society dialogue where we will be monitoring these issues and we will do that in an independent, objective and transparent and open way, and share those results with you. We will encourage – as I think you have already started to plan – parliamentary dialogue between you and the parliaments of these six countries, and we will make sure that there is sufficient funding to make this exercise a real one. I will be happy to report regularly to you on how that goes. On agriculture: we have made an impact assessment. It has been available and online for months already where we can read that actually we have some very positive effects from the EU that we expect and also that the impact of the SADC EPA on agriculture will be very limited because the SADC EPA liberalises almost no new agricultural products. All new liberalisations are limited in time and in quantity. I hear what you see on the lemons and oranges of Sicily. I would be happy to come to Sicily, maybe not the 15th, but that would be good. I have spent hours negotiating with the Greek Government on FTA... (Loud heckling) ... If you let me speak I can tell you. I have spent hours negotiating with the Greek Government and we have found a good solution to this, where the Greek Government is happy with the result, because we protect this FTA as it has never been protected in South Africa and we will monitor the oranges very closely.  There is a system, an early warning system, where we make sure that, if there are any tendencies of market disturbances, we can alert very, very quickly. The black spot disease has indeed been a problem and we have been working very closely with South Africa and with my colleagues in DG SANTE, Commissioner Andriukaitis, and we have not spotted any problems for this season at all. We think that the problem is actually being solved, but of course we will keep a very close eye on this. Whatever happens to the Cotonou, the EPA references to it remain after 2020. They are enshrined in the Agreement and are also enforceable. Now this can really turn out to be a win-win situation for all of us. All the parliaments, except for Mozambique where the process is in line, have ratified this agreement. Very recently the elected parliament of Lesotho has ratified this and I have spoken with representatives of Lesotho who very much welcome this agreement because they think it is a chance for them to reform, to modernise and to diversify their economies. So again I think the Africans know what is best for them, and we should listen to their voices. So this is a good agreement. It will be monitored together with you, and with your help and support I am sure we can make it even better and make sure that we also have a very vital parliamentary and civil society dialogue and hopefully contribute to growth, diversity and modernisation and regional integration, which is a very important part of this EPA and which we will monitor closely as well.

It was a very good debate. The majority of the Committee on International Trade recommends that we ratify. I am very happy to hear that the same goes for the Development Committee because I think they have made a very thorough assessment of the impact on the region. I think the number of safeguards, the number of provisions in the agreement protecting our partner countries, is so overwhelming as to make this an agreement that the region can live with. As we have just heard, all our partners have agreed. One thing I have to say, though, is that I am a bit disappointed by the citrus aspect. We have discussed this for a year in our committee and it has never come up. The issue has not been there. The agricultural industry in Europe is a strong one. It has no threats to face from a rather developing region with few exports. I am a colleague and I know how it goes. I come from a chemical region in Germany. The car industry lobbies me, the chemical industry lobbies me, and you do not have to come at the last minute and do exactly what they say. Think of the European interest and think of the African interest. I think this is what is at stake here. It is not just one industry. Think of all the agricultural producers whose products are now protected under the geographic indication protection scheme. I have quoted a number of them. It is not just that some citrus growers who did not notice that there was an agreement until the very last minute and called all of you and made you nervous; no. I think this is a good agreement. The two leading committees in this House recommended that governments in the region ratify it; and we should ratify it too. The discussion has been ongoing for a very long time. Let me conclude by saying one thing: In 1929, in the age of the economic crisis, Kurt Tucholsky, a German left-leaning poet and satirist, said: concernant l'agriculture régionale, les produits locaux, il a dit aux Allemands de n'acheter que des citrons allemands „Deutsche, kauft deutsche Zitronen!“  Ich ende auf Deutsch. Man kann es auch übertreiben mit der lokalen Landwirtschaft. Wir haben keine Zitronen in Deutschland. Liebe Maria Arena, ich respektiere Ihre Haltung in der Sache, aber weder belgische noch deutsche Zitronen werden uns glücklich machen. Also ganz lokal geht es nicht.

Let me start by thanking all my colleagues who were co-authors of this resolution. I think that we found a unique way of working together to come forward with a very coherent cross—party resolution. Yesterday there was an article in The Independent by the Secretary of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), John Scanlon, and the Director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Helen Clark, in which they stated that the upcoming CITES conference is the most critical CITES meeting in history. I think they are right. The poaching crisis has reached an unprecedented level and because of that there is huge pressure on the CITES system. Can we fix it? Can we make sure that it will work in the future in a better way than it is doing now? For Europe, this CoP is quite unique as well because it is the first Conference of the Parties in which the EU is participating as an official partner party. That is, of course, a very important step. Strangely enough, it has led to criticism from two sides: from third countries criticising the EU for wanting to have 28 votes with one voice, like the US – and I hope the Commissioner can explain what the latest state of play is there – but also internally from our own Member States. I understand that during the COREPER meeting where this was discussed there was quite an intensive debate about which topics the EU should speak on with one voice, and which it should speak on with 28 voices. I hope that is not a precedent for the future, especially because I was present in 2010 at the CITES CoP in Doha, and the EU contribution there was very ineffective. The Commission, of course, had no speaking rights at that Conference of the Parties and the Member States were very disorganised and not united. There was a common position but there did not seem to be any common strategy, and that was quite painful to see. So my question to the Council is to ask whether it can explain how it is going to ensure that we are united and speaking with one voice and making the best of the fact that we have a common position there. I believe that the EU is ready for this Conference of the Parties. We finally have our EU action plan, which we discussed previously. Parliament is now working on its reaction to that so I am looking forward to a strong European position. There again, I must say that what is lacking are strong commitments from the Member States. Let me come to the resolution. This resolution is different from previous resolutions on CITES. I believe it is much more integral and holistic than ever before. We are not only talking about elephants, rhino or the psychedelic lizard: no, we are focusing on the main problem that we face in the world in this regard, namely wildlife crime – a growing threat to biodiversity and the environment, and also a global problem in terms of security, the rule of law, human rights and sustainable development, because we all know that those things go together. Like the agenda of the Conference of the Parties, we are focusing on different issues than before, like demand reduction, sustainable livelihoods, combating corruption and effectiveness and implementation of CITES. I must say that the success of these elements will really determine the future of CITES, I would like to highlight five elements. First of all, how are the Commission and the Member States going to succeed in getting stronger enforcement of the CITES rules? One of the main problems is that the rules are simply not enforced in the right way. That applies not only in countries where we might expect it to be so, but also in the EU itself, and paragraph 28 of our resolution is pretty clear. Also within the EU we see widespread abuse of CITES documents. Secondly, corruption is a fundamental problem and the EU has tabled a resolution, together with Senegal. My question is to ask whether you believe that this resolution will be successful in Johannesburg and, if it were adopted, would it also be effective in practice? Maybe you can elaborate on that. Thirdly, regarding demand reduction, we see several proposals on the table. Please tell us the latest state of play and how we can assist in reducing demand in many countries. My fourth point concerns the CITES secretariat. Everything that we want them to do puts more work on their shoulders but, if you look at their budget, in real terms it is now lower than it was 10 years ago. So the CITES secretariat is simply not fit for the tasks that we give it, and official contributions are relatively small. So my question is to ask whether both the Commission and the Member States, on an individual basis, are willing to increase their contribution. That would not only help the secretariat but would also show commitment and trust in CITES. Finally, on the resolution on hunting trophies: this is important for us and it is also important to send a political message to the world that trophies should be subject to strict criteria, if allowed at all. But I understand that the USA and Canada do not support the European resolution. So, do the Commission and Member States still foresee success in this field? To conclude, we need a high sense of urgency, unity and, please, a strong European common focus.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3362, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Ivan Korčok", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, the 17th Conference of the Parties (CoP17) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), that will take place in Johannesburg from 24 September to 5 October this year will welcome the European Union as a new party, alongside the 28 EU Member States and among the other 154 parties. The Presidency will make sure that the EU and its Member States will act jointly at CoP17 to promote the EU position and speak with one voice. We go to Johannesburg having put a number of important proposals on the table and having co-sponsored some others. It is our intention to engage with other parties and stakeholders in promoting our proposals. We will also look for acceptable solutions that encompass the need for species conservation and at the same time respect the means for subsistence of populations with fewer or insufficient resources. First, concerning some procedural aspects. The EU has tabled a proposal on voting transparency. It should be at the heart of the development of conservation policies and practices within the Convention. The use of secret ballots can cast doubts on the basis on which decisions are made within CITES. We have also made a proposal for a resolution on the sponsored delegated projects to increase transparency with regard to the funding of delegate participation. We are of course particularly encouraged by the support of the European Parliament on these issues. The Council, on the other hand, does not support the suggestion made by some parties to foresee in the revised Rules of Procedure certain conditions to the exercise by the EU of its voting right.  Now on more substantive aspects. The EU and its Member States, along with Senegal, have tabled a proposal for a resolution against corruption-facilitating activities conducted in violation of the Convention. Wildlife trafficking has become one of the world’s most profitable organised criminal activities. It is facilitated by corruption and weak governance structures. In some regions wildlife trafficking threatens national security and fuels conflicts by providing funding to militia and terrorist groups. We will actively promote the adoption of international criteria on the sustainable and illegal trade of hunting trophies in order to ensure that imports of these trophies are of legal and sustainable origin. The Council has recently urged the Member States to do so.  Our proposals for amendments to the CITES appendices are based on the conservation status of the species concerned and the listing criteria developed by CITES. We will do our utmost to have them adopted in Johannesburg.  We need to ensure efficient risk-based and proportionate in-country compliance monitoring and enforcement in order to improve the rate of detection of illegal wildlife-related activities. In addition, we need to improve cooperation, coordination, communication and data-sharing with wildlife implementation and enforcement agencies in third countries. I would like to underscore the need to enhance awareness-raising and education about wildlife protection and the impact of illegal trade in wildlife, as well as the need to step up training for all parts of the enforcement chain in source, consumer and transit countries. The Presidency, together with the Commission and the Member States, is determined to take an active role to ensure that CITES continues to be an effective tool in order to attain its two main objectives: conservation and sustainable management of natural resources. The decisions that we will take in South Africa on plant and animal species will show whether CITES parties are prepared to find acceptable solutions that balance conservation needs with economic justification. We will conduct the upcoming deliberations in a spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding. Our decisions should be based on our joint interest in the protection of species that are threatened by trade. We need to maintain a diverse environment for our future generations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3363, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like, first of all, to agree with Mr Gerbrandy that this CITES meeting will be fundamentally important for the protection of biodiversity and also important for the fight against wildlife trafficking and for the EU itself. It is important for the EU itself because it will be the first opportunity to deliver many of the actions contained in our new Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking, as full members now of CITES. The European Union has already tabled ambitious proposals and the European Parliament has been very active in shaping the EU position. Your resolution is largely supportive of the EU approach and I am very glad to see that a delegation of MEPs will attend the CoP. The EU position for the CoP will be finalised by the Member States and the Council in the coming days, as just explained by Mr Korčok, but I can already, perhaps, highlight what the EU priorities are likely to be. First, we will support concrete measures against wildlife trafficking to strengthen enforcement in terms of range, in transit and in destination countries, and to reduce demand for illegal wildlife products. When properly implemented, CITES can make a difference against wildlife trafficking. CITES tools must be used by those countries that are hot spots for wildlife trafficking, particularly ivory trafficking, including through the National Ivory Action Plans. This needs to happen as soon as possible. We cannot afford to continue losing tens of thousands of elephants to poachers each and every year. We will press for quick progress on this and for sanctions if progress is too slow. International trade in ivory is banned under CITES. We fully support a continuation of the ban. We must focus on action, as Mr Gerbrandy said, to reduce demand, to eradicate the drivers of ivory trafficking, and not only spend hours discussing the hypothetical merits of an indefinite trade ban or of the legislation on this trade. We want solutions that target the real problems on the ground. The European Union is also proposing a resolution on corruption facilitating activities that are in violation of CITES. Corruption – again as already mentioned – is at the very heart of wildlife trafficking but it has not been given sufficient priority. Our second priority is to extend CITES protection to a number of species threatened by international trade, and this is the case for species imported into the EU as exotic pets, such as the Barbary macaque, the African great parrot and a number of very rare and valuable lizard and ornamental fish species. Also, the protection of rosewood timber is a priority. Illegal trade in rosewood species has boomed in many tropical regions and the international regime is not sufficient to stop this massive problem. The European Union decided to co-sponsor Gabon’s and Senegal’s proposal to bring more African rosewood species under CITES protection. Their inclusion in CITES Appendix II will ensure that they can only be traded if developed sustainably and legally. We also propose to include new shark and ray species in CITES Appendix II. Much has been achieved in CITES in recent years in favour of sustainable trade in marine species, notably sharks. Work on implementing the current listing of sharks should continue and further species should be included in the CITES Convention where the listing criteria are met. Our third priority is to reinforce the standards applying to international trade in hunting trophies of species such as lions. This issue has generated a lot of attention in this House and amongst the wider public. The European Union believes that the time has come for all CITES parties to agree on common criteria to ensure that hunting trophies of CITES species come from sustainable and legal sources. With regard to funding or financing, I have to say that, in terms of funding, the European Union is always the leader in helping third countries cope with this issue. With regard to the CITES secretariat, I think we are already taking on board some 60% of the costs and the European Union, in addition to that, is also proposing to help fund the participation of delegates from developing countries at the CITES conference in Paris. I do not have time this evening to mention all the issues that we will address, which include rhinoceros, pangolins, reptiles, the need to better associate local communities in wildlife programmes, the reduction of demand for illegal wildlife products, and means of stepping up police and customs cooperation against transnational organised wildlife criminals. I agree with Mr Gerbrandy that we have to enforce CITES rules at source, in transit and in destination countries, including in the European Union itself. But let me conclude by noting the significance of this meeting for the European Union where we will be participating for the first time as a party. We have been driving the development of CITES for decades. At CoP17 we will also be able to sit at the table and to engage with others to make it a success. In order to do that, however, we will have to work constructively with Member States to ensure that we speak as one with a strong voice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3364, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Norbert Lins", "mepid": "124808", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and for the work he has Illegal wildlife trafficking is one of the most lucrative crimes in the world and plays a major role in financing organised crime. The flourishing trade in illegally acquired plants and animals is a serious threat to nature, especially in terms of biodiversity loss, and also to humans. Key words include security risk, instability, lack of legal income and corruption.  Europe is both a destination – transit – and the region of origin, and therefore heavily involved in illegal trade flows. Global cooperation is essential; the UN Commission on the Protection of Species (CITES) is a very good framework for this. As has already been said, the EU has been a full member of CITES since 2015 and is therefore a key player at the Johannesburg conference.  In this resolution, we set out the main objectives for the European Parliament, and in principle we also welcome the objectives of the Member States and also the commitment of the Commission. In particular, it is about enhanced international law enforcement cooperation – keywords: police and customs authorities. It is a question of cross-border action against corruption, which must be developed. And the EU has important international obligations here, and commitment is essential.  It is important to me not to ban trophy hunting in principle, because I believe that well-organised and sustainably organised trophy hunting has very beneficial effects for nature and people, and that is why common rules within the framework of CITES are needed.

It also has a negative impact on the rule of law, due to its close links with corruption. The EU has an important role to play in addressing this issue as Europe is currently a destination market for trafficking, in transit to other regions, as well as being, for some species, the source region for illegal trade. The EU is a part of the problem, but also a big part of the solution. I highly welcome the fact that some of the most ambitious proposals, for example strengthening capacities to combat illegal wildlife trade, or a global support programme to reduce demand for illegal products, come from EU Member States. I personally think that another proposal that should emerge is to reinforce the global partnership against wildlife trafficking by using diplomatic tools and trade policy in relation with the key source transit and consumer countries. That should also become a key strategic objective for the EU at the upcoming CITES meeting in Johannesburg.

I am particularly concerned though, about wildlife trafficking, as we all are, and it is vital that we make sure that the rules, as represented in CITES, are watertight so that we can be absolutely clear there is no ambiguity between what is legal and what is illegal. To that end, I support the position of some colleagues on trophy hunting, that it should be outlawed. In that sense I do not support the Commissioner’s view: this is perhaps a small point but I really do believe it is important that we make sure we have zero tolerance on these issues. The species-specific recommendations are obviously very varied, but most of the representations I receive from members of the public – and there are a lot of them as this is a very important subject – are about ivory. Ivory is totemic. I know we spend a lot of time talking about ivory, but it is really important that we get ivory right. To that end, I would remind you of the maxim that has been in use for the last five years or so, namely that all ivory, even if legally sourced, fuels the ivory trade. I am very proud of the fact that the UK already has a ban on the export of pre-convention raw ivory and I would prefer to see this extended to all Member States and made part of the EU negotiation brief. I would ask you, Commissioner, to raise yet again the issue of mammoth ivory, which is increasingly being mined and is increasingly muddying the waters when it comes to seeing what is legal and what is illegal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3367, "date": "2016-09-13.json", "name": "Frédérique Ries", "mepid": "4253", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. Mr President, the European Union joined CITES 11 months ago now. Progress is essential for us, but of course the work remains immense. It is a little bit as if every time the fate of a species improves a little — I am thinking, for example, of giant pandas — it is another species that is added to the IUCN Red List of Critically Endangered Species.  This is now the case for the great eastern gorilla, which is the victim of intense poaching in Congo. It is now - and it is the organizations that say so - one step away from extinction. The European Union, it is the case to say, has a vital role to play at the Grand Mass that will open in Johannesburg. It must dare to shake up some of our strategic partners, I am thinking of China, I am thinking of Japan, and put on the agenda - as mrs Girling has just mentioned - the sensitive issue of the trade in elephant ivory, rhino horns and tiger bones. Europe must also lead by example as an important transit market, and I am delighted that this issue has been highlighted as one of the priorities by our rapporteur and by the Commissioner as well.  It is unacceptable that traffickers - these criminal traffickings - incur in some EU countries, therefore, only minimum penalties: fines of up to EUR 15,000 in some Member States, while rhino horn on the black market can reach EUR 50,000.

Mr President, Minister, Commissioner Vella, I do not know whether we should talk about the wildlife trade, or whether it would be more appropriate to talk about the wild trade in species, since when it comes to savagery, savagery is on the side of humanity. I also do not know whether we should talk about trade, but rather about crime, about the crimes of humanity against endangered species. We always tend to wait for drama to begin to act, and the decline of these species has now become tragic. As you said, the African lion is in decline by almost half of its population and is disappearing from twelve European countries. African elephants are almost all slaughtered for their ivory. Millions of pangolins and rhinos are poached for their scales and horns, and the forests of Madagascar, near the island where I live, Reunion, are plundered for their rosewood. We have to measure the time factor.

In the heart of Europe, there are regrettable cases of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the sadly famous IUU fishing. The cases of sturgeon and eel, specifically glass eel, are clamorous. When we are handing out yellow and red cards all over the world, we do not avoid, to our embarrassment, that IUU fishing is raging in the middle of the European Union.

Mr President, I would like to say to the absent Mrs Malmström that there is no protection for feta cheese and that producers in Greece are upset and complaining. It would be good if he went to talk to them and explain to them what he told us here. In her attempt, of course, to justify the unjustifiable, she was also forced to nail down the Greek government which, while in Greece it presents itself as a dissenter, finally, according to Mrs Malmström, has found itself with her and is pleased with the solution given by the agreement with South Africa, an agreement that does not protect the Greek feta cheese. That is why I will be voting against tomorrow the ratification of the Agreement between the European Union and the countries of South Africa. As far as CITES is concerned, I would like to say that this is an important international agreement which effectively protects more than 30 000 species of wild fauna and flora. This convention effectively tackles smuggling and the various circuits.

Many commitments have been made in recent years at the international level to combat wildlife trafficking and to make international trade in wildlife products legal and sustainable. We now have a duty to implement all these commitments, and CITES CoP17 will be a test to see how serious the international community is about turning these commitments into concrete actions. One or two comments with regard to what Mr Omarjee said. Yes, I do believe this is a criminal act and I also believe this is a criminal act which could be linked to other similar illegal trafficking of arms, drugs and possibly also human trafficking. With regard to our position, the EU position on ivory trafficking, the EU is extremely concerned about the current levels of ivory trafficking and elephant poaching, and we are proud to be a world leader in the fight against this trafficking. The European Union is the biggest donor for conservation in Africa. I am sure you all know that without the European Union support a large number of protected areas would simply not exist, and emblematic species would have been wiped out from large parts of the African continent. With regard to trophy hunting, yes, there is – as Ms Girling said – another view on the European Union’s perspective, but here I want to explain that the European Union has very strict rules when it comes to authorising the import of trophies into the European Union. They were tightened in 2015 to ensure a thorough check by EU scientific experts on the sustainability of these imports. When the sustainability of these trophies cannot be established, no imports into the EU can take place. We now believe that internationally agreed guidelines should be agreed in the context of CITES to ensure that hunting trophies of CITES-listed species come only from legal and sustainable sources.  With regard to Mr Serrão Santos, I think he made a comment about eels, something which is also very important, especially the European eel. The EU has also submitted a proposal to review the status of eel species with a view to making recommendations to ensure sustainable trade in them. To conclude, you as Members have worked for months with the EU Member States, with a lot of MEPs, with stakeholders and countries to prepare for this meeting, and we are ready for the challenge. There are many differing views around the world on the best way to conserve animal and plant species and fauna, and there will certainly be long and difficult discussions at the CITES CoP.  We have a proud record in bringing new species under CITES protection and supporting its action against criminal acts. The EU’s accession to CITES, as Mr Marias also mentioned, further reinforces our determination in that regard and we will work actively in Johannesburg to make a success of this COP.

Now that the EU is a CITES party alongside the 28 Member States, Mr Gerbrandy asked who will vote on what and who will speak on what? In line with Article 21(5) of CITES, the EU will vote in the fields of its competence. Those have been set out in the declaration of competences when the EU deposited its instrument of accession. Irrespective of whether the EU or the individual Member States vote, the vote will be based on a coordinated position, as has been the practice at previous CoPs, with the exception of budgetary matters where the EU and the different Member States contributing separately to the budget may express separate views. As in previous CoPs, the EU and its Member States will deliver statements based on positions agreed between them. At the CoP17, statements will be delivered for the first time from behind the EU nameplate. Finally, please allow me to conclude by saying that CITES CoP17 is an excellent opportunity to further strengthen global efforts against wildlife trafficking, including through new listings of endangered species.
