Clearly, Brexit has created a shock wave, and we do not yet know exactly what the consequences will be. We are in uncharted territory. And we must be honest: even if we find the perfect way to handle this ‘divorce’, our problems won’t simply melt away. It is not only British voters who have doubts about European cooperation. In other Member States too – including the Netherlands – there is widespread criticism and euroscepticism. And we need to address it. As a representative of the outgoing Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I feel conflicted standing here today. I am proud of the concrete results we have achieved in the past six months. But of course I am disappointed by our British friends’ decision to leave the EU. It is a decision that creates a big problem both for the citizens of the UK and also for the other Member States. It is a decision that shapes a new reality, and we should proceed with all due caution, to minimise the damage to the Member States and the British people themselves. It is in everyone’s interests to know as soon as possible – as soon as is responsible – how we will move forward, and this will demand our full attention in the coming period. The decision poses a whole range of broader concerns, too. Because this is not simply about a split that many people did not want. It is also about how Brexit affects the partnership between the other 27 Member States. The purpose of the European Union is to tackle issues and seize opportunities that transcend national borders. Issues and opportunities that are too big to tackle alone. The Member States all have their own interests, but to a large extent these overlap. These shared interests form the EU’s field of activity, and they provide a basis for public support and legitimacy. The EU can make a big difference. That is not a new insight, but it has been reaffirmed for me in the past six months. Because I have seen for myself how cooperation produces results that individual Member States could never achieve by themselves. The most obvious example is, of course, the EU’s agreement with Turkey on managing the flow of refugees from Syria. A lot has been said and written about it in the past few months. And in all honesty, is the agreement ideal in every respect? No. But was it sorely needed? Absolutely. And it was a deal we could only reach jointly. Because only by acting in concert could we break the criminal business model of the people smugglers. And greatly reduce the number of migrants drowning in the Aegean Sea. Last January alone the death toll was close to 90 and since 20 March fewer than 10 people have drowned – though that is still, of course, 10 too many. Only by acting in concert could we bolster the EU’s border-control capability. And only by acting in concert can we put into practice the measures we have agreed on setting up hot spots, improving registration, redistributing refugees among Member States and improving the situation in the region. You know as well as I do that implementing all this will be a big challenge. Progress is certainly being made, though. Between March and June almost 100 000 classroom places were created for refugee children in Turkey. Another example, of course, is the fight against terrorism – a threat that by definition transcends borders and demands an international response. We will never, never forget the attacks of 22 March, which hit Brussels, and with it the heart of Europe. Last week we were shocked once again by another dreadful attack, this time on Istanbul’s airport, and a few days ago, Baghad. In recent months the EU has taken some important decisions. On improving the exchange of information between intelligence services, for example. And on sharing passenger information without compromising privacy. It shows that both our vigilance and our willingness to join forces in this area are increasing. Which is great, because they are absolutely crucial. So the EU is more than simply the sum of its parts, and of course the best illustration of that is the single market. During the Dutch EU Presidency we worked on the principle that our most urgent problems – like the refugee crisis – should not overshadow our most important ambitions. So we made sure that enhancing the single market remained a priority. Last week, the European Council agreed that all the measures the Commission has planned for the single market must be adopted by the end of 2018 at the latest. And every year in June we will take stock of progress, in all openness. I am pleased with this new form of self-imposed commitment, which compels us into action.  You have an important role in this, as Members of the European Parliament. Not least as legislators, of course, but also as a champion of the single market. After all, your report on ‘the cost of non-Europe’ has played a big part in the discussion in recent months. Completing the single market could add an extra EUR 1.25 trillion to the EU economy, which would mean millions of new jobs, and this argument has proved a convincing one. Besides a deeper market we also need a fairer internal market where the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same place applies. So migration, terrorism, the single market and Brexit: these issues have grabbed the European headlines in recent months. But a lot of work has gone on in other areas too, both behind the scenes and out in the spotlight. Take the agreement on a common approach to combating tax avoidance by multinationals. Take the progress we have seen on the Fourth Railway Package, national emission ceilings and the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy. I should add that there are also areas in which progress has not been as impressive. Take the trade defence instruments and the Posting of Workers Directive. More could have been done there. Although this short summary is perhaps a good illustration of the way European decision-making works: moving forward in small steps, with now and then a step back or sideways. The EU is still a work in progress, and in principle that is absolutely fine. But as I have said: Brexit is a signal – and certainly not the only signal – that change is needed. Indeed, it cannot be avoided. And I am certainly not the first person to say so. I firmly believe that the worst possible response to Brexit would be for ‘Brussels’ and the European capitals to continue with business as usual. This would show complete disregard for the reality in the Member States. I also believe it would be wrong to rush blindly forward towards more political integration and a more ‘federal’ Europe. Because that too would be a denial of the sentiment felt by many European people, to whom the EU is – or has become – something remote and aloof. When it comes to the issue of ‘more’ or ‘less’ Europe, I believe that the only sensible debate is the one about less bureaucracy, red tape and regulation, and more concrete, visible results in terms of prosperity, decent work and security. And having held the Presidency for the past six months, I am well aware that we cannot just silence the critics with a magic wand. Building public support takes time and effort. You may remember me saying in January that the Netherlands wanted a pragmatic Presidency. We wanted to serve the interests of the Member States, whose positions should be reflected in all joint decisions. We wanted to move the agenda forward. And we wanted to address the urgent challenges of migration and terrorism. I hope that this approach has been a visible one, and I hope it has contributed to the results we have achieved together. We do not have much time now to pause and reflect – and not only because of the Brexit situation. We need to implement the Turkey deal. The instability surrounding Europe and the related migration from North Africa demand urgent action. And of course there is still a lot to do on the single market. And for that reason I hope that the EU – its institutions, Member States and particularly citizens – will continue our pragmatic approach.  My experiences over the past six months have underlined that we need an EU that delivers. An EU that focuses on the essentials and on issues that transcend borders. An EU that makes and then sticks to agreements. This will be a stronger EU, and one that can grow still stronger.  In closing, I would like to express my thanks to the Commission, to our colleagues in the Council and, not least, to the European Parliament for an outstanding and constructive partnership. It was an honour and a pleasure for us to hold the Presidency, and we wish Slovakia every success for the coming six months.

As the New Year began, the refugee crisis had reached another critical moment. Thousands of people continue to risk their lives at sea. The humanitarian situation was becoming worse each day. At the same time, the terrorist attacks in Paris were fresh in our minds. We were determined to defend our way of life, but we understood that our open society would always be vulnerable. Sadly, this was confirmed a few months later in Brussels.  These were the difficult circumstances of the Dutch Presidency, but when you began to work, I was confident that this great country, one of our founding members, would call on its best qualities in a time of need. I am thinking of your belief in freedom and openness, your attachment to the rule of law and your commitment to responsible free trade and better law—making. This, as well as your pragmatism, will continue to shape the course of our Union in years to come. I am particularly grateful to the Dutch Presidency for having been an active supporter of one of the leitmotifs of this Commission: to be big on big issues and modest and timid on smaller ones.  Despite all the adverse circumstances, the Dutch Presidency has always shown prudence and perseverance. This attitude has been good for Europe as a whole. Thanks to the unexcited and gripping mediation of the Dutch, we have made great progress. So that we can manage the arrival of refugees in Greece, we now have an agreement with Turkey that has begun to work. The Dutch Presidency has played a decisive role in ensuring that this agreement with Turkey was reached and has played a decisive role in ensuring that these agreements are implemented in spirit and in letter. This has also provided the basis for addressing longer-term solutions. We have already made concrete proposals and progress to bring asylum systems into line and to share responsibility in Europe in a more solidarity-based way, because it is not only the place on the map that can decide how many refugees a country takes in. However, I would like to highlight the strong work of the Dutch Presidency on the protection of external borders and coasts. Within a few months – six months and a few days – we managed to put this important piece of foreign and domestic policy on the tracks. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Dutch Presidency for this. There has been a trialogue, the agreement has been reached, it must now be implemented. And I would like this to happen quickly, because the citizens of Europe have a right to the protection of Europe's external borders. Monsieur le Président, l'une des grandes priorités de cette Commission est de compléter le marché intérieur l' o cela est nécessaire. Gr éce l'efficacité de la présidence néerlandaise, nous avons bien progressé sur plusieurs fronts, en particulier dans notre action pour une fiscalité des entreprises plus juste, mais aussi dans le domaine du marché numérique ou bien encore en mati re de financement des entreprises, surtout des petites et moyennes entreprises, avec l'indispensable mise en place d'une Union des marchés de capitaux. \" cet égard, je me réjouis de l'accord intervenu au Conseil \"Affaires économiques et financi éres\" sur une feuille de route pour l'ach vement de l'union bancaire, complément indispensable de l'Union économique et monétaire et du marché intérieur.

I think that a special word of appreciation on behalf of colleagues should also go out to Minister Hennis who spent hour after hour here in the sessions that you could not be there, and that is greatly appreciated by this house.  On behalf of the EPP Group, let me also express our appreciation for your presidency. It is the twelfth time and a country that does this for the twelfth time does so like a well-oiled machine. You took over the president's gaver at a difficult time. You are giving it away at an even more difficult time whenever possible, and I have not yet said anything about the quality of the presidency in between.  The fact is, you were president at the time of the biggest migration and refugee crisis since the 1990s. Economically, investment in Europe lags far behind pre-crisis levels, and the situation at our borders is unstable. We've seen attacks.  The highlights, as far as I am concerned, the agreement on the Border and Coast Guard that we are going to vote on this week. I dare not mention the Turkey Agreement, because there are a number of things that you can question. On the other hand, it works. And a situation without a Turkey deal, we do not want to go back to that either. But the point I want to make here is: the Turkey deal buys time. But in the meantime, we will continue to be blackmailed by a country like Turkey if we do not get our own affairs in order. This means that further steps are needed in the area of a genuine asylum and migration policy: rapid assessment and also readmission agreements that propose some.  A highlight: the agreement on combating tax avoidance. The highlight, as far as I am concerned, is also the sharing of national terrorism lists. That is not enough when it comes to sharing information, but it is an important first step. I know that I am failing a lot of colleagues who have worked hard in their field to reach agreements. I would like to mention one: IORP 2 for enthusiasts and the techies, also for our country, a text which, as it stands now in black and white, represents a number of major improvements in relation to the Commission's proposal. But instead of expressing that, your government is pushing that agreement 24 hours before it takes Coreper to a House of Representatives and leaves it in the debate with that House of Representatives to underline the real benefits of that agreement.  I have arrived at one of the key points of europe's current malaise: we take decisions here together, the Council and the European Parliament on a proposal from the European Commission. It is time for the Council side to take responsibility for this at national level. Because taking decisions in Brussels, very collegial, and then promoting something else at home or even distancing themselves from them, destroys our cooperation. Just like delaying decisions over and over again! It took three months – just this one point, Mr President – before we got any indication from you what the Netherlands wanted to do after the No vote in the Ukraine referendum. And that indication was not very concrete either. So there is no clarity. We do not need years of ambiguity in the situation in the United Kingdom.  I conclude, you return to national politics. I wonder if you will remain as keen in the end of the banking union as you were as president. I would like to give you one wish, and that is that, under the Hague cheese stew, you will not be the first victim of the election in the Netherlands next year in the national elections in the Netherlands.

He spoke passionately about it, and that fire is needed. But that hasn't been the last six months. On the contrary, after a battle between two Churchilladepts, Johnson and Cameron, the British people have opted for Brexit and the European flame has started to burn a little weaker.  The case for the European Union as a market, as a sweet shop, has not been able to convince the British people. The ratio of growing economy has not won the emotions of powerlessness and \"take back control\". In the age of globalisation, too many people in Europe still see the European Union as an extension of the free market, which is targeting their security, their jobs, their social security and their security. Europe must not threaten, but must protect, must be like a shield. Only then can we improve the environment, take in refugees humanely, tackle tax evasion. Only then can we defend ourselves against the dangers of the rings of instability around us.  The Dutch Presidency has played a role in this with gusto. Many thanks for that. The pragmatism of this Presidency has shown that Europe is more than that market, is more than that sweet shop, is more than a revenue model. And we have to show that.  Churchill has already seen that Europe is more than a market, and let it be a lesson for this Presidency that if we want to win referendums, we rely not only on the story of that market, but on Europe as a community, in which we stand together, countries and we, stronger.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Syed Kamall", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, there is no doubt that the Dutch Presidency will go down as a historic one, but for reasons for which you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, cannot be blamed. Six months ago, the main challenge of this Presidency was the migration and refugee crisis and, while we cannot say that this crisis is over, we can say that it is more under control than in January, and this is due in no small part to the diligent work of your Presidency, thanks to the professionalism of your officials and the commitment of your ministers. This Chamber has benefited from the good sense of Bert Koenders and the input of our former colleague Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and, as a result, under your watch we have found agreement on important legislation: the new Frontex European Border and Coast Guard, the Fourth Railway Package, passenger name records, data protection and other matters. You have achieved these agreements not by seeking to deliver an abstract vision but by delivering concrete and practical results that make the EU work better. The Dutch Presidency has set an example for other Presidencies to follow. A few years ago, Mr Rutte, you called for a policy of ‘European where necessary, national where possible’. You admitted that, all too often, agreements regarding the budget or the democratic rule of law have not been respected. You warned that Europe is being associated more and more with an anonymous, formal and impersonal layer of government in which national sovereignty is being replaced by normative rules from Brussels. Those in this House – as well as Commissioners and national leaders – who are impatient for a European army, who are impatient for a European FBI, who are impatient for European government would be advised to heed your words, and also to bear in mind the old Dutch proverb that ‘a handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of praise’.

I do not know, Chairman, dear Mark, whether it is so pleasant to be praised by those who leave us. I don't think that's so much fun. But I would like to thank you, the Dutch Presidency, Mr Koenders, also Jeanine Hennis. For her, coming home was natural, so that wasn't such a hard job. But I would like to thank you for those six difficult months for the Union. It was a turbulent sea, but we all know that the Netherlands is a seafaring nation, so to whom could this be left to it than to the Dutch Presidency?  I will not go into today, at least in this debate, the discussion 'What Europe should we go to now?' I only know one thing, which is that the greatest success the Netherlands has had was the Golden Age in the seventeenth century. That was the Republic of the United Netherlands, a federation of the seven provinces, which could not resist the Spanish armada, but when all warships and commercial fleets were placed under one command and were able to defeat the Spanish armada not only on the football field but also at sea. So having said that, I think that Dutch history contains a lot of interesting lessons for us today.  For the rest and otherwise, I would like to thank you mainly for the various points that the Dutch Presidency has managed to achieve: the European Border and Coast Guard, a number of Council decisions in the fight against terror, the fourth railway package, money market legislation, anti-tax evasion legislation and, perhaps most importantly, the new calendar to complete the single market. Because let us admit it honestly: 65% of the single market today is not one, not liberalised and not open.

On technical issues, the Presidency has shown that it can build bridges. I myself have experienced this as rapporteur for the Legal Aid Directive. That was fine cooperation and I would like to thank all those who worked the Dutch side to find solutions to this dossier, where initially the views of the Council and Parliament were far apart.  On a strategic-political level, it's a very different story. Of course, Prime Minister Rutte cannot be held personally responsible for the brexit referendum result. That was and is a British matter. However, we can hold him responsible for his reaction to the result of that referendum. This meant that citizens in the European Union must get more value for money by increasing and deepening the market. So even more market.  At the beginning of the presidency, Mark Rutte said he didn't like vistas. I understand that because when you're in a tunnel, you can't look far. The tunnel of the Dutch Presidency was called market, market, market, and it is precisely this fixation on the market that leads us all to become competitors of each other. One's profit equals the loss of the other. Just ask the army of unemployed people and the growing group that has been living in poverty for years. A world characterised by globalisation, based on market forces, makes people anxious and angry. They want to get a grip on their own environment. They want to have the space to set it up together for a common future. However, the fixation on the market turns people against each other and gives far-right away parties ample space. That's why I say, Mark, you were small in the big, you were stuck in your market fixation.

I would even say: I am extremely disappointed. And I will mention three examples of the failures of the Dutch Presidency.  Firstly, the fight against tax avoidance. I have heard Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Minister of Finance of the Netherlands and President of the Eurogroup, say several times: 'We were part of the problem, now we want to be part of the solution'. What is the result? A minimalist agreement that still offers Member States enormous opportunities to compete with each other in the battle over who is the best tax haven for companies in Europe.  Second example: the referendum on Ukraine. This agreement is an important part of the European Neighbourhood Policy. We have the Netherlands, which presides over the European Union. Where's the Prime Minister? At the head of the campaign? Not at all! On the sidelines, making sure he doesn't lose too many points. To whom? To Wilders and others, I suspect.  Thirdly, the refugee crisis. The Netherlands has a tradition, a centuries-old tradition of welcoming refugees. So I had expected your country to lead a coalition of volunteers that would stand alongside Chancellor Merkel to ensure that Europe welcomes its fair share of refugees.  What have we seen? Netherlands on the sidelines. Well, in the picture, Mr Rutte, when a morally unacceptable agreement was reached with Sultan Erdogan. But is this a surprise?

I had spent the whole night watching the results come in, drinking local beer and having a fantastic local curry, and I must say, I felt fantastic. But I think that is probably to do with the feeling of freedom. I think it does that for you.  Now is the time to embrace the democratic will of the people. Now is the time to stop with any further ‘project fear’, any talking down of the economy, any more concerns. Now is the time to be bright and positive, to look to the future, to put aside the arguments of the campaigns and to be friends, because Brexit brings hope – not just to the UK, but to all the peoples of Europe. We can have a better future, we can be different, we can have change, and we can show that through the democratic will which was shown in the UK and which, hopefully, will be shown in many countries – even in Mr Rutte’s. It is time to be positive, friendly and optimistic. The future for the UK is golden, but we truly wish the best for our friends in Europe too.

First of all, we can only achieve something if the three institutions involved in taking decisions all take their responsibility and do not blame the others when things do not work. We are all responsible for the end result of what we do, and we should stop claiming success in national capitals and blaming Brussels if something goes wrong. Brussels, as a metaphor, is all of us – including the Council and its members. Secondly, I would argue, given what was said this morning here by you and by Prime Minister Rutte, that indeed it cannot be business usual, but at the same time, what was agreed between the three institutions on the priorities of the Commission is a good basis for not continuing with business as usual but rather doing the things we all agreed in the three institutions should be our priorities : getting the internal market to function better, advancing on the digital single market, doing more and better regulation, making sure the energy union gets going and making sure we get the issue of migration under control in a sustainable way. These are the priorities of a Commission that has chosen to be big on big things and small on small things, and this is also the way forward in the near future. Thanks to the Dutch Presidency, we can build on a basis that will allow us to choose these priorities and give them concrete results. The only thing that can convince wary and unconvinced citizens is concrete results in solving the problems they face every day and problems that, very often, can no longer be solved just at the national level.  If I may: if there is one thing we see after the British referendum, it is that people do not believe that they can get control of their lives back again within the European Union. That is why some chose to say, ‘OK, this is not working, let us try something else’. Whether that something else is going to work remains to be seen, but our task as Europeans is to prove that we can deliver the results for people who want to be able to be optimistic about their position, about their children’s future and about their grandchildren’s future. That should be our task. That is where I think the three institutions should be working together very closely indeed.  Thank you very much to the Dutch Presidency for a job well done.

Mr Timmermans, I do think you are absolutely right. It is about the three institutions working together, exactly as Esther de Lange also said in her short introduction. It is for the three institutions – the Council and the European Parliament, working on the basis of the proposals of the European Commission – to take the business of the European Union forward. Esther de Lange also spoke about Turkey, and I agree with her. I will now continue in Dutch, as otherwise I will be criticised in the press.  I agree with her that the Turkey deal must, of course, be part of an 'and-and', approach. It can't just be a Turkey deal. Stopping the way through is crucial, shutting down the Balkan route, investing in reception capacity in Turkey. Greece, where measures are taken to register, to absorb. So it's part of an \"and-and-and\" approach.  Paul Tang, rightly so, he said churchill is far away. I mentioned him in my speech in January. But Churchill would have been very unhappy with the decisions taken by the British people last week. I have no doubt about that. And I also agree with him, funnily enough, as a liberal right of the centre and he to the left of the centre, that Europe is more than the market. But that market, as Guy Verhofstadt has also talked about, is an engine to bring people prosperity and therefore jobs in the end. Mr. Kamall, thank you so much for your kind words and your compliments about our Presidency. I am, of course, extremely disappointed about the Brexit vote, not just for economic reasons, but also geopolitically. I think it is a great loss that, in an unstable world, the European Union now faces the second largest Member State leaving this Union. This is good news for some of those who do not wish us the best things in the world – and they are not part of the European Union – but it is not good news for those seeking protection and collective safety in the fact that we work so well together within the European Union. Guy Verhofstadt, thanks for the kind words. I agree with him as always, not in the matter of a more federal Europe. I think there may also be a difference in how Flemings see the word federally and how Dutch people see it. It also has to do with the translation of the word.  I do agree with him – and also thanks for his help during our presidency – that one of the most important tasks we have is to strengthen the internal market. And I say the same to Dennis de Jong, because it is wonderful to talk about values, about all great interests, but in the end, if we cannot take care of it, in the Netherlands for example, where we have more than 10 million jobs, that ultimately 2 million of those jobs are directly linked to the fact that the European Union exists and that the single market exists. , we would not be able to explain the relevance of that European Union to our people.  Then, Philip Lamberts had a lot of criticism, I could not quite convince him of the blessings of our presidency, i have deduced so much from that. We also criticise our approach to the refugee issue. But I'll tell him two things. If we had not made the deal with Turkey, 100 people would still be killed every month in the Aegean Sea. Ten more since March 20. That's still ten too many, but not 100 a month! So that business model of the people smugglers has now been scrapped. I think that's good news. And the second is that if we had not made these agreements with Turkey, the feeling that politicians are no longer in control of the situation would have grown in Germany, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium. And that is ultimately unacceptable. We must maintain our support, including in our countries, to ensure that people who are really fleeing real danger are safe. But the numbers have to be manageable.  Mr. Etheridge and Mr. Balczó, again I believe that Brexit is extremely unfortunate, especially for the United Kingdom. That country has now collapsed, politically, economically, monetarily and constitutionally, and you will have years of work ahead of you to get out of this mess. And that would also be an answer to Olaf Stuger who I actually hear flirting with that thought. \"Why not other countries have such an exit scenario?\" I would say, Mr Stuger, look at the United Kingdom! Is that what you want other countries to fall into the same mess as the UK did last Friday?  That's why I'd like to end with a simple statement. I believe that we as politicians should never, ever play games at all. playing with people's jobs, with people's interests, with people's futures. Flirting with exit scenarios in other countries is playing games. I'm not doing that.

The Dutch Presidency's priority was, inter alia, to increase EU innovation, focus on growth and jobs, a comprehensive approach to migration and border security, and a unified approach to climate change and sustainable development. One of the main elements of this Presidency's strategy was to strengthen the implementation of EU legislation and to improve the functioning of the market for services with high economic potential, inter alia by strengthening the principle of mutual recognition. In this context, it has been a great success to simplify the formalities to which citizens moving abroad are subject. The introduction of standard multilingual forms for most of the documents covered by the Regulation, including documents relating to residence, nationality, marital status or a certificate of non-criminal record, after entry into force, will avoid costly translations and make it much easier for Union citizens to move. Tackling the migration crisis and stemming the flow of refugees and combating terrorism and countering radicalisation were priorities of the Dutch Presidency in the area of justice and home affairs.

Following the terrorist attacks on Brussels, the Dutch referendum on the Ukraine agreement and now Brexit, the EU construct is increasingly being seen as ineffective. We are told that the only viable way forward is by promoting ‘more Europe’; that negotiating Brexit will mean first negotiating a British exit then negotiating what arrangement to apply for relations with the UK; that managing the migration crisis involves a deal with Turkey that amounts to a hidden strategy of refoulement plus the creation of an external borders agency; that to beat terrorism the cooperation between national security services needs to be strongly reinforced. All this is highlighting divergences within the Union, between its heterogeneous parts, divergences already accelerated by the neo-liberal austerity that is the hallmark of what passes for economic policy. It is puzzling that so many fail to recognise how, in order to stabilise the situation, we need consolidation, taking full account of national perspectives and interests, with, as first priority, the need to counter the divergences that have developed between north and south and between east and centre of the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 17, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   The next item on the agenda is the debate on the statements by the European Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the European Council (28-29 June 2016) (2016/2711(RSP)).

The referendum in the UK does not relieve the EU of its duty to resolve the migration crisis, which has undermined the sense of security across the whole of Europe. The EU must also boost its resistance to growing hybrid and cyber threats. To that end, we have adopted a decision on increased cooperation with NATO. Even in the UK referendum campaign, few questioned the fact that economic integration among Member States benefits Europeans, as it creates jobs. That is why we have made the decision to work more closely together in the areas of digital and capital markets. The decision taken during the summit will have a positive impact on the lives of Europeans, regardless of the UK’s leaving the EU. On migration, the leaders reviewed the situation on our external borders. Crossings from Turkey to the Greek islands have now almost come to a halt. In October 2015, that border was crossed irregularly by 7 000 people daily. Now it is around 50 per day. Given this significantly lower influx, we can now efficiently manage this part of our external border. This, in turn, should restore the sense of security in Europe, which has been our aim from the beginning. Now our attention will focus on the Central Mediterranean route, where flows of predominantly economic migrants remain too high, although there has not been a significant rise in numbers compared to the last two years. Leaders agreed to move to a new way of working with third countries, applying the necessary leverage to ensure fast and operational returns of illegal migrants. The aim is clear: all irregular economic migrants must be returned to their countries of origin. The High Representative is already taking negotiations with these countries forward. We also addressed Libya and what needs to be done to stabilise the situation there. More broadly, we welcomed the presentation by the High Representative of a new global strategy to guide the Union’s foreign and security policy. The leaders thanked Prime Minister Rutte for a very professional Dutch Presidency and the hard work over the past six months. This includes the arrangement with Turkey to stem migration flows to the Greek islands and also the political agreement on the new European Border and Coast Guard. I would like to thank this House for your invaluable contribution in helping to achieve this within the necessary time-frame. Let me now turn to Brexit, on which our discussion was calm and measured. Respecting the will of the British people, the EU leaders recognised that an  orderly exit process is now in everyone’s, and especially in the UK’s, interest. Prime Minister Cameron explained why he is leaving the decision to trigger Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union to the new leadership in Britain. The leaders understand that some time is needed to allow the political landscape to settle in Britain. But they are also looking to the UK Government to specify its intentions as soon as possible. We also considered the post-Brexit economic situation in the presence of the European Central Bank President, who reassured us about the cooperation of international financial institutions. However, it was also made clear that Brexit means substantially lower growth in the UK, with a possible negative spillover all over the world. For the second day of our summit the leaders met informally without the UK Prime Minister to discuss our common future. I would like to reassure you that the leaders are absolutely determined to remain united and work closely together as 27. We also agreed that there will be no negotiations of any kind until the UK formally notifies its intention to withdraw from the EU. It is now up to the British Government to submit such a notification to the European Council. We hope to have the UK as a close partner in the future. But leaders made it clear that access to the single market means acceptance of all four freedoms, including the freedom of movement. We will not sell off our freedoms and there will be no single market ‘à la carte’. This was the first exchange of the 27 leaders after the British referendum. It is still too early to draw conclusions more broadly on our future course. But it is clear that too many people in Europe are unhappy with the current state of affairs, be it on the national or European level, and expect us to do better. The leaders recalled during our debate that for decades Europe has brought hope and that we have a responsibility to return to that. This is why the EU-27 will meet informally on 16 September in Bratislava, kindly hosted by the Slovak Presidency. We will take the opportunity then to continue our political reflection.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Commission. The truth is not in repetition. Therefore, I will not repeat what the President of the European Council has just said, since I am in full agreement with what he has said. Nor is the truth in paraphrase; I am therefore not going to paraphrase the conclusions of the European Council, since you have carefully studied them - I am not going to insult you by repeating what has been adopted in writing by the European Council.  I am particularly pleased that the European Council has adopted the Commission's programme on deepening the internal market. I am pleased that the European Council, once again, has stressed that the right response to the refugee crisis must be European, and that it has reconfirmed that the solution to the refugee crisis requires a much-needed solidarity between the Member States. I agree with the European Council that the priority now must be growth and jobs. This is exactly the first priority of the Commission which I have the honour of chairing, and which I presented as one of the ten priorities when I addressed you in July 2014. That is why I would have liked the European Council to have already agreed with the extension of the investment plan over the next three years, an investment plan that we have submitted, which Parliament has accompanied at a pace that has impressed me, and which is already producing results. To date, we have been able to mobilize investments of $108 billion, investments that would not have been made if the investment plan had not existed.  I agree with all those who say that we should not go on as before. But, to be honest, are we going on as before? We agreed, Parliament, the Council, which adopted a programme, and the Commission, to change its policy and pace. Do the priorities we have set need to be reviewed? No, we are not going to continue as we have done now, but we will ensure that the decisions made are implemented. I would like us to make the European Union the Union of Europeans. That is why we will have to make better use of the decisions we have made from now on. I say we can't go on like we used to, but I refuse to see everything again. I agree with those who say that now is not the time for institutional reforms that would go a long way; I agree with all those who say that the time has not come to review the treaties, but we must continue to implement the program. The digital union, the energy union, the union of capital markets are projects that come from afar and will go far and, therefore, we must accelerate reforms instead of changing their content. Wenn es um Brexit geht, habe ich auch keine Lust zu wiederholen, was ich letzte Woche im Plenum gesagt habe. Ich stelle nur fest, dass die strahlenden Brexithelden von gestern die traurigen Helden von heute sind. (Beifall) Diejenigen, die dieses Ergebnis in Groebritannien mit herbeigef-hrt haben, treten einer nach dem anderen von der Bàhne ab: Johnson, Farage, andere. Das sind eigentlich - und als solche entpuppen sie sich - Retronationalisten und keine Patrioten. Patrioten gehen nicht von Bord, wenn die Lage schwierig wird. Dann bleiben sie. (Beifall) That is the reason we are waiting for the British notification. I could understand that the Remain camp needs weeks to reflect but I do not understand why the Brexit camp needs months before knowing what to do. I would have thought that they would have had a plan. Instead of developing a plan, they are leaving the boat. So I totally agree with President Tusk: we are waiting for the notification. No negotiation before notification, and those who want to have free access to the internal market will have to respect the Four Freedoms, including freedom of movement. This has to be done.

I would like to start by thanking you. We have had unrest, including in the markets, the economy has been unsettled, and that is having an impact on jobs on this continent. I would like to express my sincere thanks for the wise behaviour, for the prudent behaviour of all those responsible, because stability has been maintained, and that was important. The second thing is that the Brexit result must be respected, and the framework, the rules for the talks now under way, are clear. I would like to thank Jean-Claude Juncker for the clarity that there are no informal negotiations. The internal market is closely linked to fundamental freedoms. This has been made clear by the European Council and by others. Let me put it in a picture: it is not acceptable for lorries on this continent to have free movement, but for the citizens to stand in front of closed trees. It must therefore be clear that the internal market is linked to fundamental freedoms. There are no treaty changes to come. Nevertheless, a period of reflection, a period of pause, and also of considering where our contributions lie, is right. I would also like to say that we should not be in a blockade now. If the British do not know how to deal with the result, please go to the second row and consider what happens next. But the remaining 27 should not be deterred from doing their jobs. What's going on in the UK? We discussed it last week: there is a problem in London and none in Berlin, Rome or Paris. Four million people are calling for the election to be repeated, Scotland is considering how to go its own way, the economy is suggesting that it no longer sees London as a priority, and the country is leaderless. We have the effect of people seeing that london, not the European Union, after Brexit – and I hope that the people of Europe will see this. The chaos is being condensed – Mr President of the Commission, thank you for the clear statements – by the fact that the campaigners, the Brexiteers, are leaving. Both the winners, Farage and Johnson, who were successful in Brexit, now prefer a beautiful life. Farage is no longer there. I don't know which island he's vacationing on now and enjoying life. But he is no longer there. From my assessment, such behaviour is simply cowardly. The credibility of politics is not destroyed by European policy, but by such irresponsible behaviour. We in Europe need to disase the myths. \"Europe costs sovereignty,\" it is claimed. Anyone who looks at trade policy today – the Commission, for example, will continue to discuss privacy shields, data protection on the Internet – is a gain in sovereignty for the people and for the Member States, not a loss. Europe is undemocratic: no decision taken in Europe is decided by European ministers without a majority in the Council of the European Union – by and large even unanimously – and is responsible in the European Parliament. Every Member here is responsible to his homeland, to his citizenship at home. Europe does not need tutoring in democracy. Another myth is 'Europe does not act'. Yes, sometimes it takes time, sometimes it takes time for us to get together. But this week we will be voting on the European coastal protection, which we have launched and legislatively implemented within five months. Europe can deliver when the will is there. We have also proved this in the banking union. Last but not least, Europe is to blame for Brexit. Self-criticism is always called for, but to those who have been banned in recent months from having any opinion at all about Europe, namely at the European level, to say now that they are to blame for Brexit is slanderous and downright madness. Above all, we need a new culture of responsibility in Europe. Blaming is not a good way to solve the challenges of the future. A democracy of responsibility would be required. For example, if the ambassadors in the Council unanimously decide to extend the Russia sanctions, one sometimes wonders why, in the same week, foreign ministers of that continent criticise and question these Russia sanctions. Responsibility would mean standing at home and also explaining why the ambassador in Brussels agrees to these sanctions. We need a democracy of responsibility in Europe, also in the sense of state-supporting parties. In Britain, the mood has only changed when relevant Tory forces have opted for populism and tried to follow the populist path. We need not be afraid of Farage and populists, but we must be afraid if the responsible democratic forces follow this path. That is why our task today is to build a new democracy of responsibility in Europe and to achieve solutions on the substance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the shock of the referendum, last week's summit, Mr Tusk, should have been the turning point. We see lights but also shadows. Let's start with the lights. The decision to say no to blackmail, not to negotiate before notification of the will to withdraw is a good one. No to considering the European Union as a menu from which you choose the dishes you want: the four freedoms go together. If we want market access, then we must also accept the free movement of persons. Good on immigration: let us move forward on the partnership with African countries. But, there are also shadows that would make me almost say that the mountain gave birth to the mouse.  In the face of this crisis, the unity that you mentioned, welcome, of the 27 should have led, right away, to a project of relaunch, of greater integration, and instead it was preferred to postpone everything until September, in Bratislava, pretending not to understand that we are at a point of no return. Let me make it quite clear: this delay is yet another proof of the weakness not of the European Union but of an intergovernmental Europe. I do not understand where Schäuble lives: but how do you say that the intergovernmental method has worked well in recent years? Where was Schäuble during the Greek crisis? And what role did he play? Where was he during the migrant crisis? The objective of this offensive is clear: to try to marginalise the European Commission as the centre of the Community engine.  But we're not there. We want to defend the Community method, by defending Mr Juncker and the European Commission, we are defending the Community method against an intergovernmental revival which is totally unacceptable, because it is fruitless and harmful. I therefore appeal to the Council to change its register. But I am also addressing the Commission, which has done well on many points: I urge you not to be afraid. I know, Jean-Claude, that you're a brave person. You don't have to be intimidated, you have to move on. Yes, the Brexit negotiations must be swift and we cannot waste time waiting for conservative party members to elect the new leader. But it's absurd! It is a species – as Jean-Claude said, Manfred Weber said so well – that the heroes of the disaster should let the disaster produce rubble and return here, to the place that they called hell. In the face of consistency. We must act: on social issues we need momentum to eliminate dumping, we need an all-out fight against fiscal dumping, tax havens; we must put an end, once and for all, to austerity, applying the budgetary rules with flexibility and intelligence, and I say this too, here too I do not want to open up polemics with anyone, today words and deeds must be based on support, encouragement, not sanctions, punishments, rigors that do not take account of reality.

Thankfully, last Tuesday and Wednesday the eagles – the Heads of Government – spoke. Cooler and calmer heads began to prevail, drowning out the parrots. And, while the Council does not want to live in limbo forever, it is right that EU leaders are saying they must respect the Treaties and respect the right of the British Government to decide how best to respond. In the EU it is for the respective national governments to decide how best to respond to a national referendum. This is the case even now, where the Netherlands has been given the space to decide its response to its referendum in March. The Treaties are clear, and if anyone does not like what the Lisbon Treaty says, then blame the authors and the signatories. Who knows, maybe one or two of them are in this Chamber here today! Some here are quick to point the finger at others and accuse them of breaching the rule of law, while at the same time casting aside our own rules and precedents when it does not suit the majority: ganging up on political groups they do not agree with to deny them committee positions or responsibility for reports that they are entitled to under the D’Hondt system; or interfering in the internal affairs of Member States where they do not like the democratically elected government of that country. The more that Commissioners, the European Parliament and international leaders try to pressure the UK, the more they justify the decision that the British people have taken. The British referendum was just the latest wake-up call for the EU, and many rightly respond by calling for more reform. The problem is, it is not the reform that Mark Rutte speaks of when he said ‘European where necessary, national where possible’. Instead, they seek to pursue the 1950s European project, to build the United States of Europe and to ask why it has not happened already. Donald Tusk was right to say that people are disillusioned with grand utopian visions of the future and just want us to cope better with the present. Some in Brussels draw different conclusions and, instead of wanting to get on with a friendly relationship with the UK, foster hope that maybe a part of the United Kingdom can remain in the EU, rolling out the red carpet for the First Minister of Scotland. I am sure that the people of Flanders, Catalonia and the Basque country will be encouraged to see EU leaders enthusiastically embracing regional self-determination. In this Chamber we rightly talk about the lessons of history, but what about the lessons that warn of the peril when leaders become disconnected from their people? Increasingly, decisions in the EU are not necessarily being made in an open and transparent way, especially in this Chamber. Decisions are not always made by all 751 MEPs from across the continent. Politics is about perception and there is a perception that decisions are increasingly made by five men sitting in a room and cutting deals among themselves. This is not a perception of democracy – and, if you really want to show that you are open and transparent, then stop the ‘grand coalition’ backroom stitch-ups. My Group does not want the EU to break up, but to avoid this the EU must seriously change how it works. Whatever the challenge, ‘more Europe’ is not always the answer. Ignoring the results of national elections and referenda and saying we continue anyway is not a good enough response. EU Heads of State and Governments are rightly meeting in Bratislava this September to ask some tough questions, and that is what the ECR Group was created to do: to sometimes ask those tough questions that people in this Chamber do not necessarily want to hear. With or without the UK, there are a growing number of people across the European Union who want change. So my plea to all of you is, listen to those who want the EU to meet the challenges of the future. Listen to those who want politicians to start addressing their legitimate concerns even where we may disagree, and listen to those who want their leaders to focus on creating jobs and growth, rather than creating political utopias.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I always find it a little difficult that Mr Kamall gives lessons to us. Mr Kamall, you are leaving the Union and you are explaining here what to do in the future: it is incredible. Would it not be better if you knew what to do in Britain? In my opinion, the Brexiteers have no clue about what needs to be done for the moment. It would be better to give lessons in London and not here in Strasbourg. In fact, the Brexiteers remind me of rats fleeing a sinking ship. Cameron resigned, Johnson abandoned ship and Farage apparently wants more time for himself and his family to spend his European salary. So the Leave man remains – or has disappeared for the moment. I think that the last man standing in Britain will probably be a woman. That will happen and, like in the time of Margaret Thatcher, only a woman will be capable of managing a divided Tory party, as we see it today. Yes, women will rescue Britain. My second surprise last week, Mr Tusk, was the reaction of the European Council to this political earthquake – because what happened in Britain is an earthquake. The only reaction I have heard from the Council was that we should not change anything and that it is just a question of implementing the existing European policies. I find this shocking and I also find it irresponsible. I do not think that you understand what is happening. It is not only a Brexit referendum. Before that there was a referendum in Denmark: negative. There was a referendum on the Ukraine agreement in the Netherlands: negative. Now we have had this referendum in the UK. What are you waiting for? For the next referendum in France? The next referendum in Italy maybe? When will the Council recognise that you can no longer defend the European Union of today and that Europe needs to be reformed? In my opinion, a new project and a new vision should be presented to the citizens of Europe because the truth is that European citizens are not against Europe, they are against this Europe. The proof of that is the Eurobarometer. I wonder why the Commission and Parliament did not published this Eurobarometer much earlier because it dates from a few weeks ago, in April. Do you know what the results are? Eighty-two per cent of people want more European action on the fight against terrorism; 77% of European citizens want more European action in the fight against unemployment; 75% of European citizens ask for more European action in the fight against tax fraud; and 74% are asking for more European action on the issue of migration. On 14 of the 15 questions put to European citizens in this Eurobarometer a few weeks ago, people are asking for more European action, not less. The problem is that Europe has become ... what? Europe – our Europe – has become an expert on legislation on the exact measurements and colour of our cigarette packets. We have become an expert in deciding the amount of water flushing in toilets and also in the level of subsidies that a local football club can receive from local government. But what the citizens want – and that is what the European Eurobarometer tells us – is a European Border and Coast Guard, a European asylum and migration policy to tackle the migration crisis, European intelligence capacity to tackle terrorism, a European government to defend the euro and a European army to defend our borders and to end conflicts in our neighbourhood. That is what the citizens are asking for here. The inconvenient truth is that more of the same will not get us out of this crisis, dear colleagues. That is burying our heads in the sand. People want you to work on another Europe, a Europe that delivers results. By not doing that, you are sleepwalking towards disaster, towards 27 other referendums in the near future. So let us not be naive. The real problem today – and Mr Pittella is right when he mentions Schäuble – is intergovernmentalism. A loose configuration of nation states based on unanimity cannot work. That is the reality today that you have not recognised until now. I will conclude by saying that we are going to do our homework. Parliament will be ready in October with a global plan based on three reports on the way forward. We are not going to talk –you can be sure – about federalism, integration, deepening, widening, coordination, implementation and all these other buzzwords that are at the centre of our discussions. We are simply going to go back to the ideas of our founding fathers. That is what we have to do. That is the challenge. Now or never. Either the Union will change, Mr Tusk, or it will die. That is what is at stake.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I believe that enough attention has been paid to Mr Farage, Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron. We should not shower them with even more honours. For me, they only behaved like children who play with wooden blocks for the first time, built a turret and were happy when this wooden turret collapsed. However, this is possible in a children's room, and this is not possible within the EU. That is why I also think that, on the other hand, the results of last week's Council meeting were scandalous. To explain in such a situation that we need a new period of reflection, and ultimately nothing concrete to say, which should be pointed out by this reflection, what needs to be changed, reminds me of exactly the same reaction after the failed constitutional referendums in the Netherlands and France. We have had exactly the same debate here! Has the confidence of EU citizens in the EU institutions, in the Council, in the European Parliament, in the Commission changed since then? Yes, it has changed. After all, there is even more divergence. On this issue, I am also absolutely right to the previous speaker. If nothing is changed, if we do not finally make this European Union the Union of Citizens, then it will fail, and then we all have a shared responsibility for it here! But the messages that have been sent out in recent days are not messages of change. These are messages towards austerity, policies of rigid cuts to public budgets. After Greece, Spain and Portugal are now being targeted and threatened with drastic sanctions. The EU continues to be hierarchical. Open threats such as those made by German Finance Minister Schäuble are in the air: those who do not go along are left out. Individual states, groups of states, are announced. This will further increase inequalities within the EU and within the eurozone. In view of the protests of millions of citizens on TTIP and CETA, Mr Juncker, it is an absolute mishandling to declare that CETA should not be negotiated in the national parliaments. I don't know what you thought! They thus feed the idea of the UNdemocratic decision-making level of the EU, which cares a bit about what moves the citizens. But let us put aside the dispute over treaty changes and a Convention. As long as you just want to haggle over voting rights, weighting, different speeds, regrouping of power blocs, the citizens do not need a Convention. Many are fed up with the lone-offs, power struggles, blockades and failures of the economic, political elites in the Member States. But what is now immediately possible? Now immediately and practically feasible? It is high time that we now stand together in solidarity as Member States of the European Union and, for example, set up a European emergency humanitarian programme. Such a programme would send a clear signal, especially to the most marginalised, to those who have had to bear the crisis, the debt crisis in recent years, on their hump, and would be able to help appreciably. We want the immediate introduction of minimum incomes above the poverty line – we do not need a treaty change for that! We want the principle to finally apply: equal pay in the same place for the same work! This is also possible without a treaty amendment. In doing so, they wanted to take the tooth out of those who take advantage of the fear of social decline and the fear of refugees personally. This would give the Member States a minimum social standard. We could work on that. Give back their rights to the trade unions. Above all, you explain one thing: explain clearly, especially to the younger generation, that even if the UK leaves, the necessary redistributions in the EU budget will not lead to a reduction in youth assistance programmes, youth exchange programmes and not Erasmus either. Let young people continue their education in the European Union. Do not pass on the victim role to them.

And I have to say that i was not surprised by this dangerous mule- hero that he is now evasing his responsibilities. The situation in the United Kingdom is much more difficult than you have shown here. But in all the inconsistency of the last few days, one thing was surprising, namely that after the Brexit decision in Britain, the defeat of the European Union was the first time that an emotional discussion about the European Union had taken place. Suddenly, in the reports from the United Kingdom, there are the stories of tears flowing on the streets, in companies. There are words such as European pain or the word of the new desire for Europe, and I have to tell you that I have a great desire to deal with this. What happens next with the Brexit decision is likely to be in the hands of a new British government. The European Union of 27, on the other hand, must defend the interests of the 27. But anyone who looks at the whole of the UK today must say that Nicola Sturgeon, with her appeal and the speakers at the demonstration at the weekend, were absolutely right in their appeal that our doors must remain open for Britain. Ladies and gentlemen! What can we do to connect with those who have been on the streets of London? What is actually behind this Brexit decision? What happened? There are too many reports about these neo-nationalists, about populists and anti-Europeans of all stripes, who do not want to dissipate the concerns and insecurity of the citizens, but who simply use, cheer and convert for their ideas. And we need to deal politically with these concerns of the people who also contributed to this Brexit decision and give other answers. Few places I know in Europe represent the new and unjust social order as London. There is still room for the super-rich and the rich and some of the wealthy. Ordinary people, let alone have nothing, where are they still in this capital? And this social polarisation, this growing injustice, which people are also observing, to which we must give answers if we do not want to watch as it is used time and again by those who engage in nationalist and anti-European incitement. We have talked here time and again in recent years about how we can set fair taxes for companies, how we can tame or at least regulate the financial markets. We have talked about how a New Deal, a Green New Deal can create jobs and jobs and prospects and innovation, and we have also talked very often about the need for binding social standards throughout Europe, especially when we see that social security systems are simply collapsing throughout the countries of the European Union. What has occupied me a lot over the last few days is how the people who are now somehow looking weird out of the laundry have made the little people vote against their interests. I am a child of small backgrounds, and I have nothing but contempt, I have to tell you, for the Farages, the Le Pens and those of storks of this world, who incite small people against small people and against the weak. And I believe that it is really a big question, such as Poland, for example, like the PiS Group, the PiS delegation, that Poles in Britain, as citizens who have done a great deal for the country, are no longer suffering today. The European Union must change. The European Union must change, but only those who are prepared to defend this European Union will also have a chance against this neo-nationalism and the incitement of the continent.

Ms Harms, I am not going to rabble-rouse in any way, shape or form, because I am sure that things were said in the heat of the moment, in the aftermath of Brexit, which many people regret – not only certain people in this Chamber and in the Commission, but also in the UK itself. The British people have spoken, and threats and bullying are not the answer to the questions that the UK leaving the European Union has thrown up. I want to look forwards and not backwards, because what is needed is some fair and equitable negotiations that will ensure that the best deal is struck, both for the British people and for the European Union. As an elected representative, I have a duty to ensure that the will of our people is fulfilled. Now, Mr Juncker, I am not here to crow. I am not here to gloat. I am not here to hector, but merely to tell you that it is in both our interests to get the best deal possible. We, in the European Parliament, should put aside the language of conflict and, as elected representatives, work towards a viable and prosperous future together. The outcome of this referendum is clear. The British people want to leave the European Union and also cease being a member of the single market which entails freedom of movement of people. We want access to the single market, like the United States, like China, like Russia and many other countries around the globe. But we will take back control of our borders, our own laws and our own money. In the longer term, we would like to see a free trade deal between the European Union and ourselves. This makes sense not just for us, but also for the EU. We, the British, have a huge trading deficit with the European Union: GBP 60 billion alone last year. Millions of jobs on the continent are dependent on British trade. We are the French farmers’ biggest marketplace, purchasing 35 million bottles of champagne last year alone. We are the German car manufacturers’ biggest marketplace, buying 800 000 German cars last year. The last thing any of us want, in my country or here, is a tariff war, which will be mutually destructive for both our economies. The UK and Europe are joined by geography, culture, history and trade, and that will not change. Therefore, it is imperative on so many levels that we are good, healthy trading neighbours. We owe it to the citizens of both the UK and Europe to conduct these negotiations in a grown-up manner so we can get the best deal for everyone.

Mr President, what hatred, what rage on the part of the Europeanists! Thank you, my dear friends, for showing your true face. The day after Brexit, I had a press conference saying to the French: \"Listen to them, look at them well in the coming days, and then you will see the true face of the European Union and its defenders.\" The least we can say is that we have been served. After the gigantic manipulations of pre-Brexit, where we were told the apocalypse according to Tusk - European civilization was about to collapse, the stock market was going to explode and it was hardly if the United Kingdom was not going to sink - none of this obviously happened. So we have moved on to the second phase, the phase where we question the people, their will, democracy. Bertolt Brecht said: \"When the people vote badly, the people must be dissolved.\" That may be what you have been doing for years with mass immigration, but you go much further. You say, \"When the people vote badly, we must suppress the vote.\" It's so much simpler like that, indeed. So it was a contest: in France, it was proposed that young people vote double, it was proposed to ban the elderly from voting; in the United Kingdom, there were demonstrations, up to this totally bogus petition with millions of false signatures, of which you have made yourself, of course, relays throughout the media. At the 28-29 June summit, EU heads of state found no conclusion to Brexit: they remained dry. The European Union without the United Kingdom has no more ideas and a future than the European Union with the United Kingdom. Yet the challenge in the coming months is simple: will the separation between the European Union and the United Kingdom be conducted in good faith or bad faith, allowing partners to remain on good or bad terms? We have heard many Europeanists unable to admit the result that came out of the polls thundering that the British people had to pay dearly for this divorce, for the sole purpose of making an example, of course, to deter other peoples with terror. Of course, you will shoot yourself in the foot, as you well know, because this policy of the worst will be detrimental not only to the United Kingdom, but especially to France and many European countries. Our exports to the UK are well above our imports. You can see that it is absolutely not in our interest to create tensions, but with you, it is true, the worst is always safe. The reality is that the links between Switzerland and the countries of the European Union, for example, should be a model for forging a realistic and friendly partnership with the United Kingdom, but you do not want to see it. You refuse to admit that people reject your European Union; it's as simple as that. They tell you in every tone, they have told you every time they have been asked the question in recent years. You continue to want to impose more integration and more European Union, and you are even considering - and I almost want to thank you again - to pass CETA and TAFTA without the advice of parliaments. You'll show, again, your true face. The people want their sovereignty restored, they want to cooperate freely in a new Europe of nations and peoples.

Two examples have been given of these conclusions: national parliaments will have no say in CETA, the agreement with Canada, and in July in Warsaw, our foreign and security policy will be further aligned with that of NATO, that is, that of the United States. But autism does not exclude contradictions. Mr Weber, for the EPP, is outraged that he does not see Mr Farage here, but Mr Verhofstadt, for the Liberals, is outraged that Mr Kamall is still here, and even dares to speak there. Mr Verhofstadt explains that, according to the Eurobarometer, European citizens want more action from the UNION, especially on migration.

In all clarity, we must no longer allow – as we have often done in recent months – to allow such false statements, such populist slogans, lies that are spread here to simply remain uncontested and to plunge peoples into their misfortune. The British people will end up paying the bill. I have no desire for such sayings to infect other peoples in the future. This must be contradicted in all clarity. However, we also have to do our job, that is also true. (Applause) That simply means continuing, and it is not possible, but Mr Verhofstadt is right: less small-scale regulation. Incidentally, we do not mean that, with more Europe. Making Europe in the right places, where the citizens expect us to solve the problems that are there, but not to regulate every small, that is true. But we will do this again tomorrow with a database for energy efficiency labels. By the way, you may be taking part in this. I believe that we must then also say no to this small-scale regulation and concentrate on the essentials, as the President of the Commission once proposed and how we sometimes do not. That is the truth.  The refugee issue, the question of growth, the fight against terrorism, that is the truth. It has to be delivered, because people expect us to find answers and offer solutions and not just talk around and make some nice suggestions. Incidentally, we must also eliminate a few untruths among ourselves here. Now to discuss youth unemployment and austerity while Brexit was! What does Britain have to do with austerity and youth unemployment? This is a huge quark! All I can see is that a policy has been successful in Spain, and that in Portugal a policy that has been based on stability and growth promotion has been successful in the end. That is the truth that must be described here. Now they are saying: yes, this is not hoppla-hopp, not overnight.

Allow me to speak as one of the 48% who voted to remain, who regret this decision and who will be sad if Britain leaves this Union that we have helped to build over many years. A referendum is normally called to settle an issue, but Britain at the moment does not seem to me to be calm and settled. It is in political turmoil. There are economic problems, with the pound falling and the AAA rating lost. Huge questions are being asked about what comes next. There are even people – perhaps surprisingly – challenging the result of this referendum. There is a petition to Parliament, started by a Leave supporter, which has had over 4 million signatures asking Parliament not to trigger Article 50. There are demonstrations. There is the Scottish Government saying that this decision should not necessarily apply to all the countries of Britain. Why do you think there are challenges to the result of a democratic referendum? Well, partly because Nigel Farage himself said that 52% to 48% settles nothing. Of course, when he said it he thought the result would be the other way around. People now are perhaps beginning to take him at his word. Others are just shocked at the number of Leave lies that were told in the referendum campaign, the number of issues where those wishing to leave simply told, and repeated, blatant lies. Finally, there are what I would call the Remain truths – the warnings about the consequences of leaving, which were rubbished as being scare tactics. However, the reality is beginning to show, with companies leaving Britain, what has happened to the pound and what has happened to the economy, and in these circumstances it is not surprising that many people wish to reconsider – those who voted to leave, crucially. Above all, there is one point that is much more important. Why has the Government not triggered Article 50? Because it cannot. There is no agreed position in Britain on what it should seek as an alternative. The Leave side offered two completely different visions. One group said ‘Let us stay in the single market’ (we heard that just now): ‘of course there will be no problem; they will let us trade with the single market.’ But then you have to follow the common rules for the common market (on which you would have no say anymore, by the way), including the principle of free movement, which is exactly what they were urging people to vote against. Others in the Leave campaign said ‘No, no: leave the European market. We will go global.’ But then you face a tariff barrier on every British good sold in the single market. So when the Government, or the future Prime Minister, comes off the fence and chooses one of those two options, there will be people in Britain, who voted to leave, who will say ‘Hang on a minute: that is not what we were told, that is not what we voted for.’ And I will not be surprised at all if you see Leave supporters asking for a rethink.

Perhaps we should not be surprised, given that their campaign was based – as many have said – upon lies, but also that it seems that they did not expect to win.

Dear, Brexit did not start yesterday, and it began when we easily cut off the Christian roots of Europe with an easy hand in the european Constitution that did not enter into force. And when European politicians did not hear the voice of either French or Dutch citizens in 2005, rejecting that Constitution. It has been replaced bureaucratically by the Lisbon Treaties. Even later, the Greek financial crisis, the migrant tsunami, etc., but nothing has actually been done to hear the British voice, to change the European Union, to make it more democratic, so that all countries are equal, that all voices are heard, that collective decisions are taken, that we have national states, otherwise it will be bad. Dear, the British didn't betray anything. They provided a last chance to change the policy of the European Union. From globalisation and federalisation towards free states and peoples towards Europe. Who are we today if we are left behind by a country that lives within the oldest western policy rules and highest standards?

But I must say that there is often such a temptation to blame a distant Union for national problems, because it is easier to say that Brussels has done so. On the other hand, we do so for the purposes of the national debate. As a result, we expect effects such as Brexit, but also effects such as the Dutch referendum. This is a Ukraine that we could help by accepting this association agreement and the free trade area, and at the moment it cannot take full advantage of it, because it has been blocked in the Netherlands. Sometimes we say that it is not us, but the Union, that it was not the authorities of the Member States that took part in this decision, but some distant Union.

Many of those who voted for the UK to leave the EU did so for principled reasons, some of which I agree with, but I think it would be dangerously politically naive to ignore the fact that, within the current wave of inarticulate hostility against the European Union, there are forces whose intention is not to reform our institutions, but to undermine democracy itself. As a result of the vote to leave the EU, my country is left without a government or opposition and with a frightening increase in the number of racist attacks.

What is the legitimacy of a Commissioner appointed by the country leaving the Union? Jonathan Hill responded with great elegance, but he will have a successor.

No, the British are part of the European family of nations.

The starting point is the concern expressed by European citizens when they ask how we can get control of our lives, and in fact there is a choice to be made about this. The choice I see is clear: it should be based on better European solutions because, in the face of larger migration flows, we cannot go back to national borders. We need instead to build up a real European border, to host refugees and to manage migration with the origin countries. In the face of the problems we have regarding global challenges, we cannot just play with our little economies.

The first principle is that we should give the United Kingdom some time to organise its proposal since, incomprehensibly, it had nothing prepared, and indeed, all those who had responsibility on leaving have fled the ground. The second idea, which I think is very important, is to be very firm with the UNITED KINGDOM: if you want access to the single market you have to fulfil the four freedoms, if you want another kind of agreement you will have another kind of agreement, but you certainly will not have a better situation than you had today. This is absolutely essential to maintain this principle. And thirdly, I think it is essential to maintain the best possible relations, the best possible deal with the UK.  Obviously we look at the British with great, say, sense of common belonging. We feel that we belong to the same civilization and to the same community, so we have every interest in having a good deal with the British. Now it cannot be at the expense of these principles.

Nevertheless, we must not ignore the fact that our own family, the European one, has and is facing too many problems, and we must be in favour of it in order to stop Euroscepticism.

The European Union cannot identify only with austerity, troikas and memoranda, when at the same time there are programmes important for young people, there is Horizon 2020, and the European Union every year distributes EUR 145 billion in various areas, and this work is being zeroed in and the Eurosceptics are effectively left to grind, as has been the case in Great Britain.

It was rather a victory of a campaign of disinformation and lies about the EU, which was presented in an absolutely distorted way, like a Loch Ness monster. The result, sadly, is more confusion. Actually it is a limbo. The country remains divided. But we cannot continue in the same style. We need to address the fears and uncertainties of millions of our citizens and provide clear answers to questions about their identity, cultural continuity, economic justice and defence.  Second, now it is especially crucial to keep together in the issues that remain and one of them is mutual defence. The UK continues to be our ally in NATO. The Council plan for accelerated practical cooperation with NATO is to be welcomed. In the new situation it is especially important to remain united in our common approaches toward Russian aggression in defending the credibility of our own values. Third, our best practical answer to the crisis is completing the digital single market.

That does not seem to me to be the case. I read an interview with Mr Schäuble who has the extraordinary talent to propose the cause of the problems as a solution.

But both the Scots and the Irish are well aware that the so-called solidarity suddenly expressed by the European bureaucracy is nothing more than crocodile tears, because when there was a referendum in Scotland in 2014, no Europeans were involved.

Mr. President! I have listened carefully to this debate. She was very interesting, very often moved, sometimes moving, and yet had only indirect to do with the Brexit issue. Many people , including myself, have said today what they have always wanted to say, and they are using the decision of the British people as the reason to say exactly what they wanted to say anyway. You have to see what Brexit was all about. You don't come to me with new lies! The UK vote, which we respect – no one here needs to throw themselves in the ring in a sweaty way to convince us that we have to respect this vote – was not about the euro and the so-called, sometimes actual euro austerity policy. The majority of the British did not vote against the European Union because they had problems with Schengen, because Schengen does not apply in The United Kingdom. The British did not vote against Europe because they would be against the European Defence Union, because there is no European defence union. The British did not vote against a European army, because there is no European army. So you shouldn't reinterpret the British vote to end up in the target area where you always wanted to land. (Applause) I am listening to the message that we should modernise the European Union. Yes, are we doing something else? This Commission is, after all, a reform commission, acting within the framework of a mandate it received from the European Council. This mandate has been called the reform agenda, and this Commission is acting on the basis of a programme which the European Parliament overwhelmingly felt was the right one. This is being implemented piece by piece, and I will not be persuaded that what we have agreed together is now suddenly going to be wrong because the British voted for Brexit for reasons that are not linked to the euro and the social union.  I tell you why the British voted for Brexit: anyone who has been telling for forty years – politicians of all parties, and no government has crept into the hearts of the people through particular European courage – that the European Union would be nothing if it were nothing, if the British were to limit their desire for freedom, if it were an invention against the peoples of the European Union, it would be a fighting machine of international big business. , and there are no social rights, he should not be surprised if, at the end of the day, many believe this and cast their vote accordingly. It has been lied to for decades, and the result is now there. (Applause) And that goes on. I read , not only in British newspapers – what new inventions are being devised. I read that the Commission – usually the President of the Commission – would be thinking of introducing the euro in all the Member States of the European Union the day after tomorrow. I am not thinking about it, and those who are concerned are not thinking about it, by the way. I read that I had asked the Scots to declare themselves independent of the United Kingdom. I didn't do that. The British know how to solve internal British problems, as was noted on 23 June. They will also solve the problem. I read – not only in British newspapers – that Juncker wants to abolish the nation state. I don't want that at all! You have never heard me say that I have advocated the Causa United States of Europe. I believe that Europe cannot be put on the right track against the nations and not without the nations. Nations are not a provisional invention of history, they are permanently established, and Europeans must respect that. And that, by the way, is far from contradictory – nations and the European Union go together! I therefore warn against simplifying the debate. We must do what we set out to do. I am not advocating major institutional reforms. I am also opposed to treaty reforms at this moment, because I am opposed to digging up divisions rather than filling the gaps. But the fact that some are developing long-term projects must not be prohibited! I am not going to develop such projects, because I am responsible for the short term. We had planned to be big and small in small. That is what we are doing. The Commission has withdrawn more than 100 draft laws and is launching only 23 new initiatives per year. Is this de-bureaucratisation, or is it not? It's de-bureaucratization! The Commission is held liable for many things which are not at all a matter for the Commission Is. Take a look at the decision-making channels in the European Union. Very often it is the Member States, sometimes even Parliament, which is small and small, not necessarily the Commission. Do we need to change these rules, or do you think it is normal for the Commission to have to take a decision on glyphosate when there is no clear majority in the Council of Ministers? That is not normal! This is undemocratic. The Commission should not have that many rights at all. I would like to give up the rights that are not democratically based, and I think there is a long list of them. (Applause) I would like to say a word about CETA. Mrs Zimmer, you should not talk to yourself in zeal. We have a summit with Canada on 27 October, where the CETA agreement is to be signed. The President of the Commission may ask the European Council whether all the Member States still stand by this agreement. All the Member States say that the European Union has never concluded such a good and successful trade agreement with third countries. And I must be able to point out – where are we that we can no longer do this – that it is the Commission's legal position that this would be an EU-only agreement! And I say the following to you: the Commission is discussing this today, I am not stubborn and have said this on several occasions, but anyone who here in this House pretends that the European Parliament, directly elected by the citizens of Europe, is not a democratic body that is likely to decide, should consider whether it is in the right place here. (Applause) Now we are listening to the debate situation in the Member States – I am not deaf, I am hearing what is being said – and the Commission will be working definitively on this issue these days. The long speech is short-term: we should not continue as before, but the European Union cannot solve the problems that the Member States are unable to solve. We need the European Union, the Commission, Parliament and the Member States. Incidentally, because Mr Lucke has reappeared: if I have understood you correctly, I should resign. I do not take the blame for the fact that the Commission was to blame for the outcome of the British referendum.

It is fully understandable that the events of the past days have produced a lot of negative emotions, but we cannot give in to these emotions. We have to preserve the ability to make sober assessments and rational decisions. First, I would like to stress that the EU is ready to proceed with an amicable divorce with the UK even today. In this process we will stand firmly on the grounds of the Treaties, which have prepared us for such a situation. And one thing must be clear: the Treaties have left the decision on the initiation of the divorce proceedings to the Member State that wishes to leave the EU. In other words, we cannot effectively force this decision on the UK. Secondly, before launching the divorce proceedings we will not undertake any negotiations on the future shape of relations between the EU and the UK. Future relations will be based on a balance of rights and obligations. I would like to reassure you that, wherever there may be a conflict of interest, we will act in the interests of the EU and we will do so effectively. Thirdly, today we have heard a lot of severe and critical comments aimed at Member States. I want to tell you that in our talks with the leaders of Member States I always repeat that there is no EU without the EU institutions. In the current situation, attacks on the EU institutions, including the Commission and Parliament, can only deepen the confusion. The national capitals must make an effort to stop accusing the EU and its institutions of weaknesses and failures.

That is why many states are turning their backs on the Schengen Treaty and closing their borders. It is the removal of the EU from the principles of its creators who provided for the cooperation of equal and sovereign nation states working together to promote the interests of its peoples. This has now been replaced by Germany's dominance, with the result that we are heading for a two-speed Europe.

It is obvious that the United Kingdom is under an unprecedented attack in its history, with the aim of overturning the democratic will of its citizens.  At the extraordinary plenary session of the European Parliament last Tuesday, the vindictive attitude of various sides against Britain and the launch of the Uk's Ukrainianisation were evident. It seemed unrepentant that the old political world of Europe continues the \"business as usual\", continuing the policy of merch austerity, violent fiscal adjustment, support for banking and TTIR.

All this is madness and, I tell you, this Europe - the peoples keep telling you - either you change it in favour of human beings, or we will all leave it, because no one wants to live in such a space that opposes the slightest effort made by our citizens for their own development and that of their children.

Managing the refugee crisis is one of the most important challenges facing the European Union and its society today. This is not only a humanitarian crisis, but also a global political crisis. The new European Agenda on Migration has been adopted to overcome the challenges of managing the influx of arrivals, which requires further strengthening of border management, search and rescue operations and the renewal of the Common European Asylum System. Efforts are also needed to integrate asylum seekers and refugees into society. A holistic approach to migration requires that eu external policies can address the deep causes of migration and that internal policies are open and coherent. Another set of factors in the complexity of the social inclusion and integration of refugees into the labour market relates to the current macroeconomic situation of the European Union. Record unemployment, poverty, labour market fragmentation and slow economic recovery show that this could be an obstacle to the integration and inclusion of refugees.

It is emphasised that trafficking in human beings includes sexual exploitation, prostitution, organ trafficking, forced surrogacy and other cases. Forced marriage can also be considered a form of trafficking in human beings. It is noted that children and people with disabilities are considered to be the most vulnerable to trafficking in human beings. Calls are therefore called for these groups of people to be given close attention and to strengthen national child care systems in Europe or to continue efforts to combat the phenomenon of child-soldiers.

Trafficking in human beings is one of the most serious forms of human rights violations and is not acceptable in a society based on respect for these rights.

Europe must not be immune to these despicable acts, we must clearly condemn them and stand up to them more strongly.

In addition, an integrated approach to trafficking in human beings is proposed. The proposed initiatives concern the prevention of trafficking in human beings, assistance to victims and the detection and prosecution of traffickers.  Nevertheless, the N-VA wishes to make three critical comments on the report. Firstly, we regard a strict separation between immigration authorities and labour inspectorates as a counterproductive measure. Indeed, many Member States are just trying to coordinate the work of their various public authorities so that trafficking in human beings can be tackled more efficiently.

The Regulation on the multiannual financial perspective provides for an obligation to review the functioning of the multiannual perspective and, where justified, to make appropriate changes. This regulation, of course, mainly provides for the role of the European Commission and the Council. The European Parliament has entrusted us with the task of preparing a position in the form of an own-initiative report, a position showing the Expectations of the European Parliament and the Council in connection with the multiannual financial perspectives. The European Parliament therefore, when adopting its own-initiative report, clearly shows what its expectations are when it is to agree to the findings and changes made after the whole process. In its report, the European Parliament, firstly, refers to the state of play of the financial perspective, i.e. it points to certain elements of difficult or even difficult risks. The European Parliament also points to the changing nature of the European Union budget and the growing role of external financial instruments. The European Parliament's report also shows what Parliament believes – and that was our task as rapporteurs – should be changed even in this perspective. In this regard, we draw attention, inter alia, to the change of ceilings for individual headings. We draw attention to the change in the ceilings for payments to the adjustment of payments relating to commitments, in particular in cohesion policy. We also draw attention to the need to increase resources both for those departments that concern youth employment and for security and migration issues. We are also proposing changes to the flexibility mechanism. The European Parliament will, hopefully after this debate, also adopt the following recommendations that we should indeed change the rules for using the budget surplus. In our opinion, the budget surplus should remain in the budget and not be returned to individual Member States. The whole package of proposed changes, of course, also concerns the issue of simplifications, which we believe should be made in the near future, i.e. in the coming months, so that the perspective can be completed. In addition, in our report, we propose changes to the functioning of the multi-annual perspective after 2020.  The European Parliament therefore makes it clear today that it expects concrete, decisive action from the European Commission and expects not only a review of the budget and policies, but also proposals for change.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would particularly like to thank my co-minister, Jan Olbrycht. I believe that we have worked in accordance with our convictions, but above all in the interests of the European citizens, and my thanks, of course, also go to all the shadow rapporteurs, who have enriched the text, and to the Committee on Budgets, in particular to its president. During the negotiation of the 2014-2020 Multi-Year Financial Framework, Parliament had removed the obligation to carry out a budget review and, if necessary, a revision before the end of 2016. It is in order to prepare Parliament's position and a little to refer the Commission that the Committee on Budgets has taken the initiative of a report on this revision. In a Europe that is pitching, doubting and waiting for a new course to be proposed, this text is seen as a revelation, where Parliament makes a clear and clear diagnosis of the budgetary situation. And this report is sounding the alarm: we must respond urgently and use this revision to ask the questions that will allow a budget to be up to the challenge. Youth unemployment, migration crises, the refugee crisis, COP 21, agricultural crises, underinvestment, internal security: unfortunately, in the last two years, new challenges and emergencies have rendered the multi-year financial framework voted in 2013 obsolete. This report takes a clear-eyed look at the situation. What is it? The multi-year financial framework no longer meets priorities, its limits are reached, all the instruments of flexibility have been called upon to deal with the various crises and, without revision, we will continue to undress Peter to dress Paul. Cuts to key programmes have been made - as is the case in Horizon 2020, as is the case in Connecting Europe Facility - and a freeze on commitments to combat youth unemployment has been agreed, while the ceilings, particularly those in heading 3, have exploded.  I think I can say that this report refuses to make any changes between trust funds and facilities. He refuses to allow the proliferation of financial instruments to become the rule at the expense of democratic control that is fading. And then, of course, there are the payments: the payments crisis is coming for the end of the period. If we do not make changes, we must stop being ostrich and flee our responsibilities in dealing with this situation. It is a matter of the credibility of our institutions and, more importantly, of the situation of all those who are waiting for these funds, whether it is local authorities, businesses or Erasmus mobility students who would find themselves waiting for the European Union to be able to pay what is due to them. This hidden deficit of the Union is contrary to the Treaty and this report points it out: the adjustment of the payment ceilings would prevent us from falling into the mistakes we experienced in the last years of the previous financial framework. The Committee on Budgets voted by a large majority on a long list of recommendations. We had asked for it as soon as the Juncker Plan was put in place. The budget cuts of 2.2 billion euros in the Horizon 2020 programme and 2.8 billion euros in the Connecting Europe Facility programme must be fully offset by the increase in commitment and payment ceilings in this category. To the same causes the same effects. How can we accept that there are no more commitment credits until 2020 for youth employment initiatives, when this evil of youth unemployment is eating away at us? The Commission cannot continue to oppose its late assessment, firstly because no one can avail themselves of its own turpitudes, but above all because the evaluation of this programme will not eliminate the need for means of action. It is therefore a priority to review the ceilings in heading 1B, at least in line with what we have done for the two years of launch, i.e. EUR 3 billion per year. The same goes for internal security, for the promises made at COP 21, for the refugee crisis or for agricultural crises. Ladies and gentlemen, how many exits, how many cries of alarm will it take for us to take responsibility?

We look forward to engaging further so we can reflect as we prepare to submit our proposal for the midterm revision in the coming months. We have an obligation to complete this work by the end of the year and we will do all we can on our side to meet that obligation. It is an opportunity to examine the implementation of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and, as the rapporteurs have said, this is not a usual period in the history of the European Union. Since 2008 we have gone from one crisis to another. We have had a financial crisis, an economic crisis in the eurozone, hitting Greece the hardest, the migration crisis, terrorism and now, very recently, we have experienced the earthquake of the referendum in the United Kingdom. In this context, what we have in our hands is, for the first time in the history of the European Union, a smaller budget than the one we had before. Needs have gone up and resources are tighter. This puts us in a position that requires collaboration between Parliament, the Commission and our Member States to make the best out of the budget: to answer the questions that both the rapporteurs have framed about how to help our economies and our people, especially the young people who are jobless in Europe; how to make sure that we have the capacity to address the flows of people coming, seeking rescue or out of hopelessness; and how to make sure that the external challenges of Europe are buffered appropriately with the use of our budget. These are not easy questions and I can say that there are areas where there is very strong agreement and there are areas where there would be a lot of work to do. Where we are in agreement is that we have to expand the flexibility of the budget. I say that every time I have the chance. I thank Parliament for what you have done to negotiate flexibility in the MFF, which is what has saved us in recent years, and I am sure will do so again in the years ahead. We also have to simplify our rules, to use the revision of the Financial Regulation to make it easier for money to get to where it is designated to go. We have, broadly speaking, an agreement on the fact that we have to sharpen the link between money and priorities and make sure that we address top priorities with top euros. There are also very difficult questions and I am not going to shy away from those. The expectations in Council and in Parliament in terms of what we would deliver are quite diverse. We have to work on finding a way to bridge this divergence. We also know that the Monti group is due to produce its report on own resources, and that is going to be an incredibly sensitive – and yet critical – issue for the future of the European Union. From the Commission side, I can tell you that we are working with all we have to make the budget deliver more, bigger and better results for our people, to stretch every euro to the maximum and to use our great creativity and flexibilities to do more with the money we have. I want to address a particular point that Ms Thomas brought up – the issue of legitimacy and accountability to Parliament in respect of the instruments which help us to do more, like the Turkey Facility, but which fall outside the oversight of Parliament. I believe we need to address that: to give Parliament a role, to bring Parliament into the decision making, and to be sure we do the best with the money we have because we will have Parliament’s eyes looking over everything we fund from the sacrifice of our taxpayers. Our commitment to bridging these difficult issues and to bridging the divide is genuine and we count on your being on our side as we go along this difficult road in the months to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1504, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Neena Gill", "mepid": "4533", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. –  Madam President, my thanks to the two rapporteurs.

At the same time, the ongoing turbulence in Africa and elsewhere will be detrimental to our own future security, and the consequences of climate change are plain for all to see.

Today we have a golden opportunity to make amends for the mistakes that were made when we approved the current financial framework. We were not then able to get the Council to accept the Commission's proposal and in the end there was a financial framework with insufficient funds to deal with the economic crisis, without funds to revive investment, without funds to establish a true and effective youth employment plan and with substantial cuts in development cooperation. I recall that in 2011 this Parliament adopted a report entitled 'Investing in the future: a new financial framework for a competitive, supportive, sustainable and inclusive Europe'. Unfortunately, the facts have shown that the financial framework has not been the case, that there was no funds for a competitive, sustainable, much less inclusive Europe. It is true that, since 2014, we have tried to change the financial framework, but we have not been able to turn our budgets around. To finance the investment plan we have had to cut funds in infrastructure and research projects. To finance refugee policy, we have had to cut back on development cooperation funds. We do not know how we will finance the agreement with Turkey, nor the commitments of the London Conference, let alone know how we will finance that investment plan that we seem to want to make in third countries. In youth unemployment we have not put a new euro since 2015 and the results of COP 21 are not yet budgeted. I could continue to give examples, but I think it has become very clear that we really need to change this financial framework to meet all these challenges. We need more funding for everything I've said, but we also need a proposal on own resources. In the current context we cannot continue to depend on the goodwill of the Member States, as if the European Union were a work of charity. If we want to have a solidarity future project, we cannot have a stingy and regressive own resources system. We need to launch a rate of financial transactions, we need a real common and harmonised corporation tax and we need an 'evasive' against tax evasion. This Union needs a tune-up and of course it is not all money. We need to make things easier, simpler, because today there are funds that cannot be spent because it is too complex, although sometimes I think this is no coincidence and that some Member States are very happy that this is not spent. And we also need a little coherence in our policy. It cannot be that we are calling for investment in the European Union to emerge from the crisis and at the same time have half of the countries of the European Union under surveillance, which cannot co-finance their share in structural funds and in European Youth Guarantee.

Firstly because, over time, the parameters affecting the Union and the Member States are evolving rapidly and secondly because it requires the implementation of a false economic policy, this tight budgetary discipline. It is counterproductive, if not foolish, economic policies which lead the economically weak countries into more recession and the correspondingly strong ones in their sovereignty, to be a legally binding act.  The Multiannual Financial Framework does not need to be revised, it needs to be abolished. It does not have the capacity to deal with existing crises, such as illegal immigration, terrorism, BREXIT, economic recession, unemployment, climate change. It does not have the necessary flexibility to adapt to emerging threats, extreme situations, but also to future looming challenges.  Of course, on the other hand, in order for the heads of institutions to be able to understand the upcoming challenges, they must, in the first place, be able to keep their own home together.

Markus Söder, the Bavarian finance minister, was very concerned over the weekend about whether German contributions to the EU budget would not rise if Britain were to fail as a net contributor. His answer was that savings had to be made in the budget because it was bloated. Either he doesn't know better – that would be bad – or he deliberately tells the untruth – and that would be even worse. However, this is the Bavarian answer to Boris Johnson: obviously no idea about the real facts, but comforted something in the world that diminishes the EU's reputation. This is how Euroscepticism is made. As the Vice-President said, the governments of the Member States have decided that the ceilings of the EU budget will be reduced at least until 2020. At the same time, however, the requirements are going up. Just one example: in order to control the protection of external borders, Frontex is to be expanded. That's right. But do the additional services follow these additional requirements? Of course not. This bad game continues through almost all areas of the budget. I can draw up the European Parliament's draft for the 2017 budget, and this draft is like a patchwork, because the ceiling is too short. We have to cut a hole somewhere to put the patch somewhere else. Because the medium-term financial framework as it is today is a fair-weather event – as we say in German – that does not meet current requirements. Already in the second year, we have to go to the upper limit of the medium-term financial framework in domestic and foreign policy, and it is still stuck in all sorts of corners, because we have to take money away from other important points, for example at the UN Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinians. We are therefore in danger of replacing the Syrian civil war refugee, whose children are being trained with eu money, with the Palestinian refugee, who no longer sees any prospects because his children are no longer being educated. The essential point, then, is that the tasks and requirements have grown since the decision of the medium-term financial framework. Yes, we want to budget sparingly. Yes, we want the use of funds to be as effective as possible. However, this does not change the fact that Europe, which is supposed to help solve problems, needs the necessary resources to do so.

The low level of investment as a consequence of the establishment of the ESI Funds has resulted in a reduction in funding for Horizon 2020 and Connecting Europe – a total of EUR 5 billion – and Parliament has committed itself to offseting these cuts. The persistently high level of youth unemployment up to the age of 25 means that the measures in the Youth Employment Initiative programme, after two years of operation, are in principle over. The long-term negative effects of farmers' losses resulting from the Russian embargo, the extremely difficult situation on the dairy market and the difficult situation on many other agricultural markets point to a persistent crisis in the agricultural sector as a whole, which requires and will require additional expenditure from the Union budget. All these challenges require not only that expenditure from the Union budget be not reduced, including compliance with Article 2 of the Financial Framework Regulation, which ensures that the appropriations allocated to individual Member States are not reduced by revision, but, on the contrary, that the expenditure ceiling is raised, in particular in Headings 1B and Headings 3 and 4.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1529, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Jean Arthuis (ALDE).", "mepid": "124773", "text": "   Madam President, I thank and congratulate our two rapporteurs.

Madam President, this is a real budgetary galaxy, which is not legible, which is not understandable by the citizens of Europe. These are instruments for begging Member States for failing resources. Without flexibility, our budget is not understandable. Moreover, it is not accessible given the dam made up by the accumulation of bureaucratic procedures and administrative complexity.

It is only thanks to the European Parliament’s commitment to more flexibility that the EU budgetary system has not yet collapsed. My view is that the Member States have to realise that, if we want a strong response to the current challenges which we are facing, we need adequate financing at EU level. I have two concrete proposals: firstly, we need an upward revision in ceilings in heading No 3; and secondly – and I believe this is really essential – we need to repeal the provision in the MFF regulation that stipulates that the contingency margin has to be offset.

It is also significant that this multiannual budget has declined for the first time in the history of European integration. Secondly, this budget is short because an important part of the resources, which are already scarce, are not directed towards fostering cohesion.

I have listened very carefully and I want to start from the recognition that came from many of you that we have a new budget for a reason, and the reason is that in the EU we have invented one of the best achievements of the 20th century, the convergence engine that enables us to lift up regions and countries that are falling behind and , in so doing, to  benefit everybody. We do that with the internal market, but of course the budget is the fuel for this convergence engine. For it to work we have to make sure that we spend our money carefully so that we can get the highest impact. Let me sum up some of the key messages that I have got from the debate today.  First, there is a very clear recognition that the world is changing, but our budget has not been designed to offer the necessary flexibility. We have to use the mid-term review to see how we can do better in terms of aligning the budget with the priorities in a fast-moving world. Secondly, we recognise that, when it comes to that alignment, there are certain priorities that we have to concentrate on, as otherwise our citizens would not forgive us: how can we get more jobs, especially for our young people; how can we get more innovation to generate SMEs that push Europe forward in competitive terms; how can we get a more hopeful, youthful Europe, without which, I think, we would all be very depressed. I have listened to the conversation here and it is a bit depressing, if we are to be very honest with ourselves, so we have to concentrate on ways of using the budget to lift up our Europe, especially the young people of Europe.  Secondly, how do we deal with the migration crisis? It is going to be with us. It moves from one place to another, but in a world that is, unfortunately, so severely undermined by conflicts and violent extremism, given the geography which we have in Europe there are no walls that can be built to stop the flow of people. Of course we have to protect our borders better. We also have to find more equitable, fairer, and more dignified ways to accommodate the migrants flowing into Europe.  Thirdly, there is a very clear desire for our budget also to play the role of flag-bearer in addressing great global challenges such as climate action. If we are not strong on that front we would be undermined all because of the extreme weather that comes with unmitigated climate change. And the good news is that we have achieved over 20%: 20.3% of the budget is to be spent on climate action. Of course, we have to do more. The same applies to our role internationally when it comes to dealing with conflicts and the stabilisation of fragile countries. So in your next very clear message you turn to us and say look, we have all these demands. Prioritise. We will need your help to prioritise. Given the limitations of the budget, not everything can be funded on an equal footing. There are old priorities and new priorities. We will have to be very disciplined in aligning our budget with them.  Looking to the future, we will have to modernise the budget significantly, and modernisation is not only on the expenditure side. I want to thank Mr Arthuis for reminding us that we have to sort it out and be more systematic. There also has to be modernisation on the revenue side. Obviously the Monti Group is there to help us, and we have to have the guts to come up with proposals that give us a modern budget.  Last but not least, the budget also has to be modern in terms of the rules and procedures that we apply for the use of money and it has to be simplified. In the past every effort to simplify things would start out with great ambition, and then we would all come along, – including, with all due respect, Members of Parliament – and add our bells and whistles so that by the time we were done, things, instead of being simple, had been made more complex. We have a unique opportunity. In the next six months we need to dedicate ourselves to making best use of this opportunity to have a modern budget that serves us to the utmost. I look forward to our cooperation in these next months.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1552, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Jan Olbrycht", "mepid": "28288", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for This debate has shown that the conversation is not just about money, it is about politics, and there are a few conclusions. First, it's a conversation about what we're supposed to do together and what we're not supposed to do together – it's kind of the first and crucial thing. Secondly, we are thus starting a debate on the next post-2020 perspective. Thirdly, we must have a budget flexible enough that there is no need for another revision. If the British Government notified, we will have to revise the framework in two years' time. That is what we need to be prepared for.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank my co-rapporteur very much: not only have we ensured cross-party cooperation and gender balance, but also mutual trust in work. I would like to thank my colleagues, advisers, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and the Commissioner for their openness.

Madam President, I would like to thank the colleagues for their support and the Vice-President of the Commission for listening. If I take the four points that seemed to me to echo among colleagues, I would say, first, Madam Vice-President, that there is a large majority here in favour of a revision, not a technical adjustment. This is the time because the multi-year financial framework is obsolete, and because the historical situation dictates it. Second point: as you have seen, Madam Vice-President, the new financial tools - I hope this is not what you call 'modernisation', are a bit of a concern for Parliament, not just for reasons of democratic control - although I thank you for the proposal to invite Parliament to sit or put its nose, at least, in these funds , but also because we do not want to change the budget into a guarantee fund. , and we will be very careful about that. Third, we do have a new deal, namely the departure of the United Kingdom. I asked President Juncker this morning for the Commission to quickly assess the budgetary implications of the UK's departure, cheque and rebates, because there is also the issue of rebates that we talked about in the report. Fourth point: the causes. As many colleagues have said, the causes of the problem are in the structure of budgetary resources. Twenty years ago, we had a budget of 75% of our own resources and 25% of contributions from the Member States. Today, more than 80% of the budget comes from Member States' contributions and less than 20% from own resources. This is a huge undertaking here, Commissioner, which we really want to open up in parallel with these discussions, because we are only at the beginning of a great story between us, that of the fundamental overhaul of the budget of the multi-year financial framework and the own resources that will finally allow us, at the end of each year, not to be beggars vis-à-vis the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1554, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Tamás Deutsch (PPE)", "mepid": "96826", "text": "  Writing. – The European Parliament's Committee on Budgets adopted only last week its report on the mid-term review of the current seven-year framework, in view of the British referendum, before the European Commission's proposal. It is a success that, in order to protect cohesion funds and rural development funds, the text underlines that the reduction of the resources previously allocated to Member States is legally excluded from the review and adds that direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy should not be affected by the process. This has ensured that the EU tender resources raised by the current Hungarian Government cannot be reduced and supported by Hungarian farmers is not reduced and secured by the review. The report proposes to raise the ceilings for payment levels in order to avoid a 'liquidity' problem in the previous financial framework, i.e. sufficient resources to pay the cohesion accounts received at the end of the cycle. Unfortunately, it must be highlighted that, despite the opposition of the Members of the People's Party in the committee vote, another delusion of a failed socialist-liberal immigration policy, eerily similar to the proposals made by George Soros, prevailed.

In reverse order: we need to protect whistleblowers, we need to punish those who profit so immensely from illegal tax construction, we need automatic and mandatory systems to share and disclose our own data, and we need to expose the shadowy practices of the industry of tax avoidance. The final report of the Tax Rulings Special Committee provides concrete proposals and demands for doing just that.  In the last few years, two events have been absolutely instrumental in our fight against tax evasion and tax havens: LuxLeaks and the Panama Papers. Let me be crystal clear on this point: if it was not for whistleblowers, we would not be gathered here today, and if it was not for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the secrecy would have remained and the shadowy business practices would have continued. So to Mr Deltour, Mr Halet and Mr Perrin, I say a clear, warm and heartfelt thank you on behalf of this Parliament and on behalf of taxpayers and citizens across Europe. It is, quite frankly, a disgrace not befitting a modern democracy that two of the three have now been sentenced by a court of law for exposing the crimes of others. This much must be cause for outrage and for real change in Europe. I therefore look to the Commission to come forward with a clear legal framework for the protection of whistleblowers in Europe. I look to the Council to work with Parliament to ensure the swift and efficient adoption and implementation of such new safeguards for whistleblowers. Tax havens should not be able to exist in the year 2016. We know exactly where they are; we know exactly what they are doing; and we know exactly what we, the politicians of Europe, should be doing to stop them. So why don’t we? I want to thank Commissioner Moscovici for his excellent work on the proposal for a common EU list of non—cooperative jurisdictions, the so-called blacklist of tax havens, and it has to come with clear, automatic and substantial sanctions, not only for the countries and territories on the list, but also for the banks, tax advisers and companies who are engaged in unlawful practices in these territories. Europe is an economic superpower, and only together can we bring tax havens to change their ways. Together, we have entered into groundbreaking new agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, San Marino and Monaco. Together, as a European Union, we are on the brink of doing away with banking secrecy in Europe. No single European nation, no matter how large, could bring about this change on its own, but together we can – and must – ensure tax justice for European citizens, for developing countries and for small and medium-sized enterprises, who pay on average 30% more in tax than the multinational corporations, and, of course, for the sake of justice and preserving our welfare states in Europe. Transparency and accountability are our most important tools in the fight against tax havens and tax evasion. Today, I am calling for an EU register of beneficial ownership to form the basis of a global register and for the Commission to give serious consideration to the idea of a global register of financial assets. These two proposals alone will cut to the very heart of the shadowy business of tax havens and tax avoidance. We need to bring them to the table now. Let us do away with our own secrecy in the European Union. For years on end, European progress on curtailing harmful tax practices was slowed – and sometimes even stopped – by some Member States in the Code of Conduct Group. The Code of Conduct Group has for far too long provided a closed forum for the countries of Europe to stall needed new rules and legislation. Let us work together to fundamentally reform the Code of Conduct Group to ensure that it is both efficient, transparent and accountable to the citizens of Europe. Finally, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Michael Theurer, for his excellent cooperation and constructive spirit. I want to thank the shadows and Commissioner Moscovici, Commissioner Vestager and Commissioner Hill for their contributions to the Special Committee, and I also want to give special thanks to my good colleagues in the Tax Rulings Special Committee for their excellent work. I look forward to the debate.

Madam President, Commissioner Moscovici, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, for the work she has been on Against enormous opposition, the TAXE Committee has won access to internal documents of the EU Commission and the Group on Code of Conduct of the Member States for this Parliament. This confidential document was first taken to a secret reading room here in Parliament, and we have shown that we are handling these documents responsibly. However, some of these documents are still withheld from us, and this House must not accept this uncontested. Against enormous resistance, we have managed to ensure that representatives of large international companies, banks and tax advisory firms have come to our committee, and that ministers and secretaries of state, Commissioners and the President of the Commission have also answered us. We have gained important insights from this. Some evasive answers, however, have raised completely new questions, which we have also taken up. Two key findings characterise the report. On the one hand, the combination of 28 partly over-complex national tax systems leads to tax loopholes that can and have been used in particular by internationally active multinationals. Secondly, as the documents show, the Member States have been dealing with these problems for years. In other words, the ministers, including the experts, have been discussing these issues behind closed doors for years and have not come to a solution. No, it was not the European Parliament that prevented the Member States from doing so, nor did the Commission prevent them from doing so, but they were not in a position to allow the conflicts to be constructively incorporated into common legislation and to resolve them. There is therefore a considerable need for action. Experts estimate that the global treasury is missing out on more than €200 million through aggressive tax avoidance. Tax justice is one thing, fair conditions of competition are the other. This is particularly important to us as liberals. It cannot be the case that the pastry chef in Strasbourg or Karlsruhe pays his taxes, but international chains and corporations do not. The outlines of the new tax architecture are now becoming apparent. The foundation must be a common corporate tax base in order to stop the manipulation of the tax base. This will create competition over tax rates and no longer on the tax base. We need an automatic exchange of information, which is now law. We are proposing a study centre which will finally deal scientifically with a comparative analysis of EU tax systems in order to propose a consistent policy. And we demand a guarantee that every profit that leaves the EU will be taxed at least once. This means that we need a regime for double taxation agreements, so that double zero taxation and double non-taxation are no longer possible in the future. This would be possible, for example, through a single withholding tax regime. We also want a code of conduct for tax consultancy companies, and what is very important is that this approach is to be brought to a global breakthrough. Here we want reciprocity towards the United States as well. It is not acceptable for us to provide tax data to the United States, but to receive none from there. Nor is it okay for constructions to be possible in Delaware, for example, that are otherwise only suspected in tax havens. Another proposal is a register for the beneficial owners. Whether this must be publicly available on the Internet is a question. But it must be accessible in the case of legitimate interest. We believe that country-specific reporting requirements are necessary, at least with regard to the tax authorities, and these tax authorities must also cooperate jointly, perhaps joint audits, at least in Europe. That is what we want. What we do not want is a public tax denunciation. Patent boxes are an issue that the EU must address, including transfer pricing, and transfer pricing must be taken into account. And most importantly, better protection for whistleblowers. The civil courage of Antoine Deltour should have been rewarded and should not have been punished. This report is a milestone. Parliament can build on this and be proud of it. What is at stake now, however, is that it should be poured into concrete legislative proposals by the Commission. There are a number of things on the table, but this must now also be implemented. We need fair tax competition. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to my co-rapporteur Jeppe Kofod and to the chairman of the committee, Alain Lamassoure, the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and also our son. Employees in the secretariat and group as well as our assistants.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1559, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Pierre Moscovici", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Madam President, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, let me first extend my sincere congratulations to the two rapporteurs, Mr Kofod and Mr Theurer, to the special committee TAXE, to its president, Mr Lamassoure, and to all those who have been involved in the drafting of the report, for a work of very high quality. In order to achieve this result, the European Commission and Parliament, I think I can say this, have worked very narrowly and very positively. I myself have participated, on several occasions, in the debates of the TAXE committee. My colleagues, who have been quoted, Commissioners Vestager and Commissioners Vestager, have also appeared before her and our services have cooperated closely and, I believe, effectively. We are in a political context that we cannot ignore, with turbulence that invites us to reflect together on how we respond to the issues most crucial to the European peoples at the political, social and economic levels. This reflection is beginning and it deserves to be deepened, it must be open and take into account the demands and needs of all the citizens of the European Union in their diversity. A specific issue, which keeps coming up in the public debate, is, of course, the need for greater social justice alongside economic growth, and it is inseparable from the question of transparency. I am not suggesting that this is an easy question to solve, but it is a question that we must answer first and that we must answer quickly. It did not prevail, moreover, with the vote of the British. It has been a concern for us for a long time and must remain the red thread of our action.  In a context where the legitimacy of the European Union is being questioned by some, I am convinced that transparency and fiscal justice are essential to restore a pillar of democracy, which is consent to tax. That is why the Commission has identified fairness, particularly in the area of taxation, as one of its main political priorities for its mandate and, with the full support of this Parliament, our work is progressing, I believe it is fair, considerably in pursuing this objective. Let me review some of the key developments in our tax fairness strategy in the months since the creation of TAXE 2; our interaction has already been extremely positive. Some of these actions, in truth, are already direct responses to the recommendations of this Parliament, which have been directly operational, as the rapporteurs have said. First, and this remains an important point in the report we are discussing today, we have made great strides towards what I call the transparency revolution. Following a Commission proposal in January, Member States agreed to automatically exchange tax information on the activities of multinationals. This agreement is based on greater openness and cooperation between the tax authorities, to which we had already contributed last year with the new legislation on tax rulings. The Commission also recognised that tax transparency should extend beyond administrations. I repeat here - for those who have not heard it - that since the first day of my taking office, I am in favour of country-by-country reporting - I say public good. In April, we proposed country-by-country reporting obligations for large multinationals. Your report welcomes these proposals. He would even like, Mr Lamberts, to go further. This proposal is now in the hands of the Council and Parliament. I am sure you will give an ambitious answer. And we presented our latest initiative today to combat unfair tax practices with a proposal that aims to enable tax administrations to access key information on actual beneficiaries and other data that allow for increased vigilance. These are concerns that you have raised, as have the G20 and the G7. In this way, tax authorities will be able to identify and act against those who hide their income and assets in offshore funds, as was the case with the Panama Papers. You can see that we have an immediate answer to the problems that are raised. We also announced that we would work across borders to expand tax authorities' access to information on actual beneficiaries, and to work towards greater control and better accountability of a profession, namely tax advisors, some of whom, not all of them, allow or encourage tax evasion. Again, these are proposals that I had already made in this Chamber a long time ago. We therefore have other projects to come to ensure greater transparency, in line with the recommendations of your report, which I would say are entirely in line with our priorities - which are my own. Secondly, and on this point too we agree, we have put in place new concrete measures to ensure that companies pay their taxes where they make their profits, a fundamental measure in tax justice - a whole debate that has taken place in the Council on minimum taxation, but this is not about that. , it is effective taxation. In January, the Commission proposed an ambitious directive on tax evasion to end certain loopholes, certain schemes used by some companies to evade tax. I am pleased that less than six months later the Council has reached political agreement on most of the Commission's proposal for a directive. These new rules, once implemented, will deal a blow, a severe blow, to aggressive tax planning in Europe and will allow us to go one step further, towards fair taxation in the European Union. I am not going to argue here that this directive is sufficient or perfect. I am well aware that the TAXE Committee and this Parliament expect more, and I also know that the Commission's proposal was, as is often the case, a little more ambitious than what was decided by the Member States, finally, but again, I believe that we have a good quality compromise, to which the Commission has joined. I will spare no effort to achieve the results you expect. For example, as requested in your report, we will strengthen measures to combat tax evasion later this year, with a proposal to combat hybrid schemes with third countries. We will, of course, as you ask in your report, relaunch the CSTA, the proposed consolidated common corporate tax base, before the end of the year, to make it mandatory for large multinationals. This will create a more favourable and fair tax environment for all businesses in the European Union. This is obviously a fundamental structural measure. I note that the adoption of tax measures, when it comes to combating tax evasion, has nevertheless had a tremendous acceleration effect. It took several years, and again, to pass tax guidelines in the Council, given the unanimity rule. With the high pressure of events, it now takes a few months, as you can see. I hope that this acceleration will also manifest itself when we propose measures that have a structural, long-term structural effect, as is the case with the ICCT. We have failed in the past on this point. We will take it up again in a slightly different way, but I want to tell you the interest, and even the importance, that I attach to this proposal. Third, we continued our work to expand good tax governance globally. On this last point too, the objectives of the Commission and those of Parliament are the same, or very close. Our initiatives to combat tax evasion include a new external strategy to encourage good governance in the tax field, beyond the single market, and to combat countries that do not respect the rules. A central element of this strategy is to draw up a common list of the European Union listing non-cooperative third countries - let us say it in French, but this is understandable in other languages - that is, a pan-European blacklist of tax havens, and also to provide counter-measures, an idea which I know has the approval of the TAXE Committee. We have already embarked on this process of drafting lists with the Member States and, contrary to what was the case in the past, a still recent past - I had proposed a first list, whose limits were obvious to me, but which had the merit of existing a year ago, however things have changed a lot - I note that the Member States fully support this project and I want to tell you that the first list of the European Union must be ready in 2017. This will be a major step and built in articulation with the OECD. I believe that this measure will have a major deterrent effect on third countries that believe they are in a position to to take advantage of the erosion of other countries' tax bases. Of course, the need for efficiency and fiscal justice does not stop at the borders of the European Union. That is why, as part of our external strategy, we place a strong emphasis on supporting developing countries to combat tax evasion and integrate them into the network of good international tax governance. It's not just the G20 countries, it's the whole world.  In The Addis Ababa Tax Initiative, we have committed to doubling our support to low-income countries to help them improve their tax collection. We will keep that commitment and go further, providing full political support to these countries within the OECD and other international organizations. My services have also engaged in discussions with Member States and stakeholders on how to prevent EU and national tax policies from having a negative impact on developing countries. It is, I know, a shared concern on all your benches. Ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I have outlined today the outlines of the work we are doing to ensure fairer and more effective taxation in the European Union, in line with the expectations of our fellow citizens and certain recommendations - the essence of your report. I have been able to cover all of these recommendations, because this report is very comprehensive, but I remain of course prepared to discuss them with you. The strong political pressure of Parliament as a whole, through the TAXE 1, TAXE 2, and I do not forget ECON, because there has been a common work, again, of very high quality, has contributed greatly to the progress made. Our program, my program, continues and it addresses many other areas that you have mentioned, from improving transfer pricing to strengthening good governance clauses in the case of our international agreements. We have a clear public, political mandate to encourage Member States to implement the measures agreed upon, through a swift and ambitious agreement on these initiatives. This has come out, I believe, very strongly from the popular indignation that has not subsided following the publication of the Panama Papers and also from other scandals covered by the media which, in this case, are allies. There is a real demand from citizens, at the European Union level, to strengthen social justice, to improve transparency and to go through with transparency within the framework of an economic and fiscal policy. I am therefore pleased to continue this work, happy to do so in close partnership with the European Parliament to achieve fairer taxation in Europe as our fellow citizens expect, and to this extent I am also very pleased to welcome this report as an important step in our common struggle.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1560, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Danuta Maria Hübner", "mepid": "96779", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, I think that both Tax Committee reports proved that matters relating to tax rulings cover a wide range of issues, from the tax rulings themselves and administrative practices to the protection of whistle-blowers, to beneficial ownership, to tax competition and state aid. The issue is central also because of the amount of funds involved in tax dodging and the impact on growth fairness. But what makes this issue even more complex and specific is its cross—border dimension. Tax dodging thrives on the mismatches between systems and the lack of cross—border cooperation. Unilateral actions to fight it can create unwanted competitive distortions that are harmful for law-abiding businesses. Therefore, when addressing tax avoidance and evasion, it is important that we act in compliance with global standards and achieve a high level of international cooperation.  On all issues covered by the OECD BEPS Action Plan, we really need to have all countries on board, because there are rules that are likely to influence the location of business activities worldwide. And last but not least, when we – as the European Union –plan to go further than the OECD, we must make sure that our ambition is not to depart from those recommendations, but to build upon them.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I too would like to begin by thanking our two rapporteurs, Kofod and Theurer, as well as our chairman Alain Lamassoure, very warmly for their work. The climate in this committee has shown that we are pulling together across party lines when it comes to promoting tax justice in Europe. I would like to thank the Commission, Commissioner Moscovici in particular, for the fact that our work here has also been reflected in the Commission's work and that Parliament and the Commission are all pulling together here. But the work in the TAX Committee, as in the TAX 2 Committee, has shown that without the pressure that we have been under with the public over the last year and a half, Member States would never have been prepared to go as far as they are now prepared to go in the current legislative process. But that is not far enough! Because the proposals that the Commission has put forward are being watered down by the Member States – and we are already seeing this now. So it is up to us not only to maintain this pressure, but to increase it. That is why it was important, and it was right, that we, together with the Panama Investigation Committee, have now given ourselves another body here in this House with which we can continue to exert pressure to be able to take stronger action against state-organised tax dumping, but also against money laundering, than has been the case in the past. We can all say today: Commissioner Moscovici, Parliament here is fully behind the work for more tax justice in Europe, for greater transparency, for fairer corporate taxation, but also for strengthening the fight against money laundering. We will maintain this in the Panama Committee of Inquiry, but also in our regular work in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this House. In the past, we have shown, with the reports by Mr Bayet and Mr Dodds, that we are willing to make legislative progress here as well. This will not decrease in the future, but will increase.

We will not allow state-organised tax dumping to continue in Europe as it has been in the past, and then individual states will have to rethink. I am sure that we in this House, among the citizens of Europe, will get a clear majority for this: because it is not acceptable for individual states to ensure that they receive a little, but the majority of the Member States do not have at all the taxes that every company has to pay.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We have here a report dealing with the LuxLeaks scandal. However, we must state quite clearly that this is not a scandal, but a whole series of scandals. This is very good to read from the report, and so I am very grateful to the two rapporteurs for the fact that this has been worked out so well. Scandal number one is this: multinational companies do not necessarily pay the appropriate tax burden that corresponds to their capacity. This is a slap in the face to the honest taxpayer who is doing just that, and it is a significant distortion of competition with those companies that do not have these opportunities or that are simply decent enough to pay their taxes as intended. We have developed some measures against this, which are very good. Some people are, to be honest, also in such a way that one thinks: well-meaning is not always equally well done. In essence, however, what has been proposed in this report is a good thing. Scandal number two, however, is that states are also helping with this practice. Some countries in the world, some states in the European Union, are helping businesses, they are actually encouraging them to pursue this tax avoidance strategy. Far too little attention has been paid to this fact, at least in the public debate. We must make this quite clear: it is good that we are committed to having a blacklist of tax havens, and we must tell everyone that the tax havens are not only found in the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, but that they are also found in the heart of Europe, for example in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. All this must be made clear. Scandal number three, after all, is that states knew this. The member states of the European Union have known for a long time what practice exists here. They have covered it up by talking about it behind closed doors in the Code of Conduct group, but they have kept all their knowledge secret and tried to sort this out in some way behind closed doors. It didn't work out. The sparrows whistled it from the rooftops that there was this tax avoidance, and tax evasion. Scandal number four: the people who have now brought this into the public eye – the whistleblowers – have been brought to justice and sentenced to prison. The people who have done the tax avoidance go out freely. They still have the benefits of their tax avoidance. But the whistleblowers are put in jail.

In Parliament today, Kofod is an instrument of lawful activities, um es nicht \"teurer\" zu machen.  Today, just in these minutes, the Commission has come out with a proposal to renew the Money Laundering Directive. It is, of course, no coincidence. We saw in the context of the Panama Papers that the Money Laundering Directive in particular has a huge hole in it, even though we tried at the previous stage to correct this. The essence of the work we did at the time is really about what is called \"beneficial ownership\", i.e. the real owner. Beneficial is translated into Swedish to charity. In this case, it's not about charity. It is a question of building in the mazes of tax evasion various shell companies that make it impossible to follow where the tax money disappears.  During the review we carried out at the time, it turned out that the big problem was really britain's beneficial ownership. The structures of various foundations that Britain has built over the centuries. We know that this is one of the fundamental elements of the whole system of tax avoidance that exists in the world.

The two TAXE committees 1 and 2 confirmed this breadth and confirmed that this is a widespread practice throughout Europe and in all capitalist economies.  The report points out several highly relevant aspects, but it does not go to the bottom of the problem, because all these assemblies that provide authentic tax banquets do not happen by chance, they happen because of a long process of financial deregulation, which has increased since the 1980s and which has been led by governments and parties present in this House today. Let the Dutch, UK or Luxembourg governments say so.  We therefore do not fully monitor this report because it exonerated the capitalist system that promotes the free movement of capital and financial liberalisation and promotes tax evasion.

I would like to rejoice, in any case, at the strength of the report which was adopted by the TAXE 2 Committee and to pay tribute to Michael Theurer and Jeppe Kofod for having really produced an excellent report. I think this report, indeed, is moving in the right direction. I am also pleased to see that Commissioner Moscovici, on behalf of the Commission, is in tune with this report. But then, where is the error? If there is a large majority here to fight tax injustice, how is it that it actually persists? In fact, I have a clue: it is the requests for amendments to the report that we will adopt tomorrow, and in particular the requests for amendments that come from the largest group in this House, the EPP, which does not want to be appointed Member States, because - Bernd Lucke said - there are many Member States, including my country, which are tax havens and are actively involved in this unworthy tax competition. Ah, can't we name them? Nor does the EPP want us to denounce the role of audit and tax advisory firms, and to appoint them. Oh no, that's not to be talked about. Here, why don't we talk about it? They would have no role to play? The same group does not want us to protect whistleblowers, at least with ambition. We must reduce the ambition to protect whistleblowers, or there is no question, as the report calls for, of banning this new vehicle of tax evasion called patent boxes or patent boxes. We propose that they be banned from 2021, but there are some here, especially in the EPP, who say, \"Oh no, all in all, maybe we should leave them.\" We are at the point of denial of reality where even statistics on inward and outward financial flows from countries such as Luxembourg and the Netherlands are a secret that should not be revealed in our report, because obviously this indicates, perhaps, that these countries have become large-scale financial washing machines. So I am speaking to EPP colleagues: but do you really want to fight fraud and tax evasion, or do you want to look like you are fighting fraud and tax evasion? Because, of course, it is not very popular to charge small taxpayers, whether they are individuals or businesses. That, of course, is the question I am asking you. Quite honestly, I was extremely disappointed to find that, in all respects, the first resistance came from the largest group in this House.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote in this report of the TAXE 2 committee reminds us that the issue of tax justice is at the heart of any social project. Each rule of law has a duty to combat the abuses of tax optimisation by multinationals. It is no longer possible, in a world of inequality, mass unemployment and growing precariousness, to allow a haemorrhage of budgetary revenues to escape the states. The tax shortfall in France, which has been cut off by large companies, has amounted to more than 15 billion euros per year for nearly two decades. It is detrimental to our public finances. This lack of fiscal resources must be compensated in order to balance the annual budget with your policy of austerity and structural reforms, which the European Commission has, and which all Europeans see the result in Greece. We are a long way from your Europe of prosperity and full employment, which your propaganda boasted to us in 1992 during the Maastricht referendum. Those who suffer the consequences are other taxpayers, small domestic businesses and households, hence their loss of competitiveness and purchasing power. I recall that, since 2014, the National Front has voted all European texts to combat bank secrecy, fraud, evasion and abusive tax optimisation. In the French Parliament, MEPs voted in favour of the law on the transparency of political life in the wake of the Cahuzac case. That is why we will still vote for this report on international European cooperation. The patriots are in favour of tax legislation at European level, but on the condition of unanimity of the states and the maintenance of our fiscal sovereignty intact. Luxembourg, the Netherlands and other countries, under the leadership of their complicit leaders, such as Mr Juncker, have set up and developed lax regimes for unscrupulous multinationals. For patriots, this tax and unfair dumping constitutes an economic crime against peoples. If Mr Juncker had a modicum of honour, he would resign from his current position.

I have to say that from the report leaving the TAXE 2 Commission we have a very good text with many things, including the protection of informants. But - surprise!— today we get the partial votes which the People's Group is asking for, and it wants to eliminate a lot of things: the reference to the European Investment Bank, the responsibility of States, even the reference to the protection of informants.

Some Member States have become experts in undermining their neighbours' tax bases. Some multinationals have perfected the way Member States play off their tax issues and minimise their tax liability, often legally. The Member States have looked away and not asked.

The Member States did not want us to enlighten. They have put enough obstacles in our way where we could, for example, when accessing relevant documents.

There is a total social alarm for Europe to respond to these problems. And there we have a fantastic opportunity for Europe to respond to these problems, being more Europe and doing better Europe.

We see this in the case against Sweden, among other things. Sweden tried in 2013 to curb tax evasion by limiting interest deductions for internal loans. The Commission is dissatisfied with this and has sent a letter of formal notice. We should have room to criticise this from the European Parliament.

Secondly, and importantly, each country of the European Union has the possibility and the possibility to have its own tax rates, but not to avoid or evade taxes.

Of course, the protagonists in these practices of tax evasion and avoidance are multinational companies, which do not pay taxes and thus affect public revenues. Moreover, research shows that Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises pay on average thirty per cent more tax than multinational companies, thus distorting competition and leading to job losses.

Mr President, I would first like to thank all parliamentarians for this rich and interesting debate, which shows the great importance you attach to the subject we have debated and Parliament's involvement in our common fight against tax evasion and tax evasion. A recent survey commissioned by Parliament revealed that 75% of the citizens surveyed want more action at European level in the fight against tax evasion. This is a priority for our citizens. It is preceded only by the fight against terrorism and the fight against unemployment. That is to say how, in a few years, in a few months, this fight has now reached the top of the political agenda. I can assure you that he is at the top of the political programme of this Commission and that, as European Commissioner, I feel that I have the confidence of all, the confidence of the President, the confidence of the college, who have never constrained my initiatives and are very much attuned to what this Parliament can put forward or undertake. This requirement has been well understood by the institutions. The Commission takes full advantage of its right of initiative and rest assured that it also relies on your work and on the revelations that may have arisen here and there. These revelations are never a problem, and we have to go all the way to find out what happened, whatever the situation. They are always an asset because they give strength to those who want to make this fight a priority. Parliament - you, yoursors, my Members of the European Parliament - is a real engine for progress in this area; the actions of the TAXE 1 and 2 committees and the ECON committee and the quality of the report we are reviewing today bear witness to this. Finally, in this context, the Council, at our common instigation, has been led to take quick decisions. It does so with its own logic, with the constraints we know about the tax decision - the rule of unanimity is probably a hindrance - but it does so with much more acuity, much more speed and, I believe, much more ambition than in the past, which makes progress in this area and your role as a driving force. management, monitoring the various stages on our way are essential for fairer and more transparent taxation in Europe. Progress in this area is undeniable and we should all be pleased.  I note, moreover, that this is a subject that allows for a quasi-consensus on all the benches of this House. Your task does not end today. Our common task does not stop. We all need your technical and political vigilance, and as far as I am concerned, you know that you will also be able to count on my personal commitment to continue this fight until the last day of this Commission's mandate. The new initiative that I have introduced in the introduction, which the Commission has just adopted today, is further proof of this, but we still have many more projects to open. I do not want to go back to what I said in the introduction because, in essence, I expressed all the esteem and support I gave to the report of Mr Kofod and Mr Theurer. I would just like to emphasise two points which have come up in many of your speeches and to which the Commission is sensitive. First, it is the protection of whistleblowers. This is a subject that is clearly now important to us and is unavoidable. Although there are specific areas of European law that provide for the protection of whistleblowers, such as rules against money laundering, we must be clear among ourselves. This issue is largely resolved or to be resolved by national legislation. However, I fully agree, and the Commission is also in agreement, with those of you who express a sensitivity, a concern and a wish that we can act to defend them. In this regard, I can tell you that the Commission will look into this issue to see if there are opportunities to strengthen the protection of whistleblowers at European level, while supporting Member States in strengthening this protection at national level. I think that this is a subject which we must in truth all take over together, whether it is the Member States or the Union, which undoubtedly has limited competences in this area, but which can play a role, at the very least, of a useful sting and a driving force in the field which is its own. My colleague Vera Jourova will be with you tomorrow to discuss this further. It is very clear that our sentiment, as politicians, is the same that these men and women must be protected in their roles - and we intend to do so. The second issue that has been raised by many of you is access to documents, which is still a problem for them in the relationship between our two institutions. I would like to put my cards on the table on this subject: since the establishment of the first TAXE committee, I have paid my full attention to the problem, and all the availability of my services has turned to this requirement. On 22 June, I personally wrote to the President of the European Council to relay the requests for documents authored by the Council. I sincerely believe that the Commission has behaved with the maximum openness - and many exchanges have taken place with Alain Lamassoure and with other parliamentarians whom I welcome here in order to reach a solution which allows parliamentarians, as far as we are concerned, to obtain as much access as possible to the documents available to us. But there are still Council documents. I have no doubt that it will take this into account. Believe me, I will continue to lobby the Council to keep things moving forward, because I am sensitive to your concern. In conclusion, I would like once again to thank all those who have contributed to the work of the TAXE 1 and 2 committees, which I think have been a great success. I am convinced that our synergy, that of Parliament and the Commission - again respecting the responsibilities and sensitivities of each one - will continue to develop also in places other than the TAXE 2 committee, starting with the forum in which we are here, namely the plenary of the European Parliament, because it is here that many initiatives have been taken , this is where a lot of political positions have been formulated, this is where many ideas have been expressed. Our future initiatives, the ones I will take as European Commissioner, need you, your unique expertise, your support, your critical support, possibly your vigilant support, your demanding support, but your support.

I want to start by thanking the Commission and Commissioner Moscovici, including for the decision taken in the Commission today, again enhancing the fight for transparency. I could highlight a number of the issues on which you adopted positions today, but one of them is beneficial ownership: a public register is something that we really need in the European Union and I also commend you for taking the step you did in that regard. I hope that Member States will follow suit on your ambitious proposals. Secondly, there was a debate on what a fair tax system is. We have to remember that a tax system in which some multinational corporations are paying less tax than small and medium-sized enterprises is not fair. It actually distorts competition. It is destroying jobs in Europe when small and medium-sized enterprises, which create eight out of 10 jobs in Europe, do not have the same conditions as the big multinational corporations. Also, if we allow our tax base to be eroded by profit-shifting out of Europe, we will leave the tax burden to ordinary citizens – to labour, to people who work hard and pay their taxes and are maybe on very low salaries. It is really important to understand that a fair tax system is one in which multinational corporations will pay the same type of tax as small and medium-sized enterprises and contribute to society so that we can maintain in Europe our welfare state and our way of life. Tax justice and citizens’ trust in governments also depend on just tax systems, in which multinationals pay the tax they should. Finally, on the discussion here, I want to make one comment in the wake of Brexit. Colleagues raised the issue of corporate taxation. We see in the UK now proposals to reduce corporate taxation to 15%. It is very important for all of us that we fight this race to the bottom. We have to fight fragmented tax systems that allow tax dodging, but we also need to fight a race to the bottom, in which big multinationals do not pay taxes, because this is contributing to the huge and increasing inequality we see in our societies, and we should fight back against that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1605, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Michael Theurer", "mepid": "96871", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, I would like to thank the We have now heard the whole range of positions in the discussion. Some people rely heavily on dirigiste measures and full control, others do not want to change anything and find the current state completely in order. A large majority of this House says that the solution lies in the middle, because the Member States – and this has also become clear – have known that there are harmful tax practices. It is all the more regrettable that there is no representative of the Council today. The Commission has been, and still is, a good partner in drawing up concrete legislative proposals. We have the situation where we have an internal market in the European Union with the freedom of capital movements. This eliminates the rights for Member States to tax at the source of profit creation, and that is why we need a binding common legislative framework. We must continue to move forward on this, also in the sense of a social market economy. Allow me – we have worked here on a bipartisan basis – as a free democrat, as a liberal, to conclude by saying that we should heed the OECD recommendation, which says that, in addition to tightening up the rules, a simple, low-rate tax system is also a good incentive to reduce tax avoidance. In other words, better laws, yes, but also not lose sight of the fact that rates should not become too high – as an incentive to simply be tax-honest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1606, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.

These amounts show that it is not only necessary, but very urgent, to take action to effectively protect the Union's financial interests.

The decision on the European Border and Coastguard Agency actually shows that we can make decisions in a speedy way and in a very efficient way. First of all, I would like to say thank you to the team of shadow rapporteurs present here. If we speak according to terminology of this agency, I would say that if the European Parliament needs a rapid reaction force to make some decisions go through, then these people are probably ready to do this. Secondly, I would very much like to say thank you to the Commission – to both Commissioners Mr Timmermans and Mr Avramopoulos – and, of course, I would like to express my gratitude to the Council, which was represented by the Dutch Presidency. It was very constructive work. There are a number of things which, within this agency, we can really consider as a positive achievement. First of all, we are really strengthening the efficiency and capacity of the existing Frontex. For the first time in European Union history, we have a 1500—person—strong reaction force consisting of border guards from the member countries.  Secondly, what we achieved as a compromise in trialogues with the Council and the Commission, is that these people are not going bare—handed to support some of the member countries which are facing challenges at their external borders, but they will be provided also with modern necessary equipment, starting maybe with night vision goggles and perhaps ending with planes and ships , if needed. Thirdly, I would also say that a big success is the question about positioning liaison officers in the countries with external borders, because this will provide us with the possibility to exchange timely information. In the time when we are facing not only challenges of migration, but also challenges of cross-border crime, terrorism and perhaps even hybrid threats, the necessary information exchange is something which can additionally help our citizens and people to feel secure and to trust that our national governments, as well as European Parliament and European Commission, are working for their interests on their behalf. We have also been putting a number of other things inside, including the guarantee that we can give this assistance to a member country in need without breaching its sovereignty. But, of course, this decision is not a paper tiger. The country in a hypothetical situation, when it is not capable of controlling its borders and when it is not willing to get assistance from the agency – which is just an assistance and not a replacement for the work of a sovereign nation – can also lead to the situation where member countries decide, for temporary reasons and for security reasons, to introduce also border controls with this country because , as a Union, we have to be responsible not only for our security but for the security of other nations as well. Finally, of course, there is the highest guarantee for fundamental rights whenever any job is done, as well as the possibility to help with search and rescue and returns. I am looking forward to a positive vote, because every Member of this Parliament – if he really cares about European Union interests, about the interests of our citizens and rights of our citizens, and wants to make our Union better – will vote in this case to create this agency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1611, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, there is no doubt that among the many challenges we face one of the most serious is the migration crisis. It is equally clear that, if we want to overcome this crisis, we must improve the way in which we manage our external borders because, in an area without internal borders, the effective control of external borders is a legitimate matter of concern to all. That is why, last December, the Commission presented a proposal for a European Border and Coast Guard and why we have made clear that the rapid adoption of this proposal is indispensable for a return to the normal functioning of the Schengen area. It is for these reasons that I am very pleased that Parliament and the Council have been able to reach a political agreement on this important proposal in only a little over six months. I would like to thank and congratulate all those who contributed to this result, in particular the rapporteur, Mr Pabriks, and his team, all the shadow rapporteurs and also the Dutch Presidency. The agreement reached achieves all of the objectives we set out. It will lay the ground for effective and integrated management of our external borders, with a strong focus on prevention. It will be based on the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility. It will ensure that all our external borders will be managed according to the same high standards without affecting the primary responsibility of each Member State for the management of their part of the external borders. Of course the putting in place of the European Boarder and Coast Guard is only a first step. I know we have much more work to do, but the constructive and results-focused way in which we have worked together on this proposal makes me hopeful and should be a model for the future. I therefore call on you to lend your strong support to this important proposal so that we can start implementing our new approach as quickly as possible this summer. With this, Mr President, I ask your permission to pass the floor to my colleague Commissioner Avramopoulos.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1612, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it is a great day today. After six months, as Frans Timmermans said earlier, we have managed all together to deliver. Reaching a political agreement on the European Border and Coast Guard is a tangible success of effective cooperation between the European institutions. This is significant for such a complex proposal and I would like to express my thanks to First Vice-President Timmermans, to Mr Pabriks, our rapporteur, and to the shadow team and the Dutch Presidency. Moreover, this legislation has a symbolic and legal dimension. We are recognising in practice that our European external borders are common European borders for which we all share the responsibility. This very concretely shows what the strength of the European Union can be when we face a common challenge. We have achieved a balanced agreement accommodating the concerns of both co-legislators. At the same time, the proposal has remained ambitious, ensuring the creation of an agency with the task and the means to make a difference, not only during the current crisis but also in the long term. We are providing our agency with a strengthened legal basis and enhanced resources to perform more effectively, particularly when the overall functioning of the Schengen area is at risk. For example, the new regulation establishes a rapid reaction pool of border guards and other relevant staff, as well as a rapid reaction equipment pool to be made available to the agency whenever it is needed for rapid border intervention. We will not have to face again what is one of the main weaknesses of the current system, in which Frontex has to rely on voluntary and often insufficient pledges by the Member States. In parallel, we have put in place a series of strong preventive measures. The agency will closely monitor the management of the external borders, notably by deploying liaison officers to facilitate cooperation between Member States. Mandatory vulnerability assessments will evaluate the capacities of the Member States to face challenges at their external borders, including the capacity to handle the massive arrival of migrants. The new regulation will also allow the European Union and the agency to act where a Member State is managing its external borders insufficiently and thereby jeopardising the overall functioning of the entire Schengen area. The role of the agency with regard to return is also enhanced, without watering down the provisions of the Return Directive as regards return decisions and safeguards. The agency will be able to underpin our efforts to improve returns by making the logistical and operational side more effective. For our European asylum system to function properly we need to encourage third country nationals to use only legal ways of coming to Europe. These elements are comprehensively addressed in other Commission proposals currently on the table. To balance the expanded mandate of the agency, we included a stronger mechanism guaranteeing the observance of fundamental rights. We took into account the views of the European Parliament in developing a complaint mechanism in our proposal, and your amendments strengthened it even more. This will help to deal with possible violations of fundamental rights in the course of operational activities led by the agency. I also emphasise that search and rescue, although a national competence, is recognised as a specific component of European integrated border management. It is an explicit task of the agency during its operational activities. There is one point on which the Commission has some concerns, namely the provision for appointment of the executive director, which deviates from the common approach on EU agencies agreed by the three institutions. The Commission has submitted a declaration in this regard. I look forward to hearing your views on our common achievement. More importantly, I invite you, dear colleagues, to confirm tomorrow the political agreement on this major measure. Last week, the European Council was very clear on the need for swift formal adoption of the new regulation. The immediate next challenge we are now facing is to prepare the implementation of the strengthened mandate in order to make the European Border and Coast Guard operational as soon as possible after the formal adoption of the regulation, as was also requested at last week’s European Council. Making the new rules work without unnecessary delay is an indispensable element in managing migration better and bringing Schengen back to normal, as provided for in our Roadmap back to Schengen. We have no time to lose. This is a unique moment to turn this success story into reality, to show that we can act together, united as one Europe.

At the end of June, the European Council called for wider efforts in solving migration in a comprehensive way, including by strengthening and better managing borders. In this regard, I believe that the proposal for a European Border and Coast Guard recognises the need to ensure the necessary controls at the external borders by ensuring levels of security within them while preserving the possibility of free movement of persons within the Union.

Thanks to the cooperation of the three European agencies, we encourage joint action and the exchange of information.

For many years, the Member States have prevented the management of external borders from being a European one. For many years, we have had to watch and also discuss, in some cases, where there are excessive demands, where there are special crises, where a Member State alone cannot manage, better management is necessary for joint intervention and that they must be of an order of magnitude that is effective aid for the Member State concerned. Today we have come to the point where we have a decision to do so. The trialogue is, so to speak, ready, and I also congratulate the Commission, Commissioners, for having the courage to go for the first time to 1500 people. Because if you want effective border management and a crisis, then you can't get along with 10, with 20 or with 50 experienced border guards or those who are specialists in this field, but then you need an order of magnitude that is firstly fast, effective, well organized and also equipped with a basic base at Frontex in the agency. that can actually work effectively.

I would also like to express my gratitude to the Dutch Presidency and the Commission for their efforts.  We have a very intensive five months behind us, but I am really proud to have been a part of this process. We have achieved a lot together. This regulation is a good example of what the European Union can achieve if there is enough political will. This proves that the EU, its institutions and its Member States are able to deliver results. Under the new regulation, the management of the external borders of the European Union will be the shared responsibility of the Member States and the European Union. I very much welcome this new approach, because safeguarding the Schengen area, which provides freedoms for and at the same time ensures the security of our citizens, requires commitment and solidarity among the Member States at their external borders. This is a European matter, and the regulation is clear on that.  One of the priorities of our Group was ensure that the agency had a bigger role in search and rescue at sea. For years, we saw lives being lost in the Mediterranean. This situation will be improved by the new regulation. Search and rescue operations will be an important component of European integrated border management. The agency starts by supporting Member States in carrying out these operations. Given the increased role of the agency in border controls, handling migratory pressures and carrying out returns, we had to ensure that fundamental rights considerations were adequately addressed. I believe we have managed to strike the right balance in this regulation.  The fundamental rights officer of the agency will have an enhanced role comparable to that agency. I know that there are those who are not convinced about this new agency. I share some of their concerns.

In 2014 3 280 deaths, in 2015 3 770 and in 2016 to now 3 630 victims. The EU's open borders policy is increasingly driving people into rickety boats. That is why Frontex is being transformed into the EU border and coastguard to guard our external borders and actively discourage migrants from making the dangerous crossing.  Yes, the responsibility for border control still lies with the Member States and our external borders, but in an emergency the agency can take over border control. For example, if Greece achieves a low rate of return, the agency can act and carry out its own return operations to Turkey. And if Greece or another member state refuses to let that EU agency work, then other EU member states such as Belgium have the right to close their internal borders for up to two years. Letting everyone in Europe in and forwarding it to our region can no longer be an option.  With the EU-Turkey deal, EU policy will finally focus on return from March 2016. In this context, the EU Border Guard was given broad powers to coordinate and organise return operations.  This expansion is important for the NVA and it is up to the agency to make this happen.  Anti-drowning packages should also be closed with all countries around the Mediterranean. Asylum seekers who were already safe abroad must be returned to those countries after an accelerated procedure. A systematic pushback policy can then be further developed. In Europe, there can only be room for genuine refugees, with a maximum ceiling. The strengthened agency will also deal with the detection and prevention of terrorism.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I, in turn, would like to start by greeting two particular things. The first is the enormous, dense and very intense work of our colleague, Artis Pabriks, on this report and, secondly, it is the culmination of this work in record time, of this dossier which, as you recalled this evening, was a key issue, one of the few issues that our fellow citizens have really heard about and which they understand the very concrete meaning of. The proof here is that, when there is a political will, when the European Union wants to react and act, to adapt to situations, even the most formidable, such as this challenge which presents itself to us and which risks jeopardising the whole European construction, it knows how to be force of proposal and to provide appropriate responses to the situation as it appears. I would like to address a few quick points in the short time given to me, in particular four key points. My first point is that we have an undeniable step forward which aims to remedy the main gap that Frontex has suffered so far, namely the lack of budgetary resources, but also and above all of human resources, since Frontex will now have a reserve in solidarity between Member States of 1,500 people, which can be mobilised very quickly, and that this agency will have , in addition, the ability to acquire clean equipment and use it very quickly. My second point relates to the clear reference to Frontex's jurisdiction over search and rescue at sea. Together with Mr Pabriks and the shadow rapporteurs, we fought this reference, and we got it. Let us remember here that we have a fundamental obligation to save lives. Nearly 10,000 people have died in the Mediterranean since 2014, and I am not talking about the thousands of people shipwrecked, including 304 children who have died since September 2015.

Far from taking the necessary measures to prevent this tragedy, such as establishing legal and safe ways to reach Europe, granting humanitarian visas and, above all, complying with international reception legislation, the flagship proposal of the Council and the European Commission is to replace the Frontex agency with a new agency, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, which may intervene in different Member States to shield borders, even without the consent of these States, which criminalizes migrants, by collecting their fingerprints and other personal data as if they were criminals; an agency with which they also intend to intervene in third countries. This new body is actually a deportation agency to return the bombs and wire to whom it is able to set foot in Europe. This body does not respond to any democratically elected political authority. The lack of transparency and lack of control over respect for human rights have been criticised even by the Ombudsman of the European Union.

So here we have it: the European Border and Coast Guard, the one thing that was supposed to solve pretty much all of our problems – everything related to the so—called refugee crisis. But does this ‘Frontex +’ – because it is really not much more – actually really help with our most pressing problems? Does it help against the drowning of people at sea? No, especially not after the Council has blocked most of the proposals that we have been pushing for in the European Parliament. Does it help against the lack of solidarity and political will in the Member States? It doesn’t. Does it help provide better shelter, more asylum officers, faster procedures, medical care? Does it help at all to tackle the reasons people have to flee? No, it doesn’t. Frontex does not solve any of the most pressing issues that we have. Instead, we are sending border guards against people who are actually fleeing from war and persecution. And by giving so much more power to an agency without actually also beefing up its fundamental rights protection, we are creating a pretty dangerous construction. Europe should rather focus on other things – search and rescue, legal ways, accommodating refugees, sharing the responsibility – all of those things are things we should do, and, rather than punishing Member States who are not closing off their borders, we should support them.

The new agency will have a mandate to send liaison officers to launch joint operations and operate in the territories of Member States and third countries, and of course it will require a great deal of money. It has an estimated cost of EUR 238 million in 2016, rising to EUR 322 million by 2020. The United Kingdom is not bound by this legislation, but even so, as long as the UK remains a member of the EU, British taxpayers will be liable to help bear the financial cost.

It undermines the sovereign rights of each country, because if a Member State does not comply with imposed measures or refuses intervention by rapid reaction forces at its borders, decided by the Council and not unanimously, that Member State will be threatened with blackmail by the reintroduction of controls at its borders, within the framework of the reactionary Schengen Treaty. The main task of the new reactionary mechanism is to deport and repel thousands of persecuted refugees and migrants fleeing the war and poverty sparked by the European Union, its allies and capitalist rivalries.

Those who, by their very nature and mission, are capable of protecting a country's borders are the country's security forces, and this was demonstrated some time ago when some countries decided to ignore the Schengen Treaty and close their borders. Unfortunately, in Greece, the governments of the Memorandum, in collusion with the EU, did not instruct the security forces to secure the country's borders, in order to give the impression that a European Coast Guard-Border Guard should be created. This method is intended to remove sovereignty and powers from states, such as responsibility for search and rescue, to which Mr Avramopoulos referred earlier, and at the same time to support the German Government's attempt to create a European army.

The creation of a European Border Guard could be a first step in tackling the problem, but for the time being it is limited to immigration control issues.

This is the Europe we need to communicate to our citizens.  Now, allow me to slip into Greek since some of my compatriots have asked me some questions.  Κυρία Πρόεδρε, αγαπητοί ευρωβουλευτές, αυτή η συμφωνία που επετεύχθη για την ευρωπαϊκή Συνοριοφυλακή, είναι πραγματικά ιστορική και ιδιαίτερα σημαντική. Στην πράξη, αναγνωρίζεται ότι τα εξωτερικά ευρωπαϊκά σύνορα, είναι κοινά μας σύνορα και ότι η φύλαξή τους, η διαχείρισή τους, είναι κοινή ευρωπαϊκή ευθύνη.  Ακούστηκαν πολλά, ήθελα απλώς να σημειωθεί ότι όχι μόνο δεν θίγεται καθόλου η εθνική κυριαρχία, αλλά αντίθετα, αυτό το καινούργιο Σώμα θα αποτελείται από στελέχη όλων των ευρωπαϊκών χωρών και θα έχει την ευθύνη για ολόκληρη την Ευρώπη, και αυτό εννοούσα πρωτύτερα όταν σημείωσα απαντώντας στον κ. Κύρκο, ότι πόσο διαφορετικά θα ήταν τα πράγματα αν αυτό το Σώμα υπήρχε δύο χρόνια πριν. Θα είχε αντιμετωπιστεί διαφορετικά η προσφυγική κρίση, θα έχει τύχει καλύτερης διαχείρισης και θα είχαν διασφαλιστεί και προστατευθεί πιο αποτελεσματικά τα κοινά ευρωπαϊκά μας σύνορα. Σεβασμός, λοιπόν, στην εθνική κυριαρχία.  Η νέα ενισχυμένη Αgency θα συμβάλει τόσο στην πρόληψη, όσο και στην αντιμετώπιση μελλοντικών κρίσεων. Δεν θα επαναλάβω όλες τις καινοτομίες, τα πλεονεκτήματα που έχει η ευρωπαϊκή Συνοριοφυλακή και Ακτοφυλακή, θα τονίσω όμως ότι είμαι υπερήφανος που η πρόταση που κατέθεσα έξι μήνες πριν, γίνεται πραγματικότητα. Μετά από εντατικές και ιδιαίτερα δύσκολες, πρέπει να σας πω, αλλά αποτελεσματικές διαπραγματεύσεις, ανάμεσα στους ευρωπαϊκούς θεσμούς, ανάμεσα στα κράτη.  Αυτή λοιπόν είναι η Ευρώπη που αντανακλάται από αυτό το κοινό μας αποτέλεσμα. Η Ευρώπη της ευθύνης, της αλληλεγγύης, της δράσης· η Ευρώπη που όλοι θέλουμε ως ευρωπαίοι πολίτες· η Ευρώπη που όχι μονάχα θα αντέξει και θα ξεπεράσει κάθε κρίση, αλλά θα συνεχίσει να δυναμώνει, διασφαλίζοντας τη σταθερότητα, την ασφάλεια και την ευημερία των πολιτών και των κατοίκων της. COMMISSION'S STATEMENT \"The Commission welcomes that the co-legislators maintained the appointment of the Executive Director by the Management Board on the basis of a shortlist drawn up by the Commission following an open and transparent selection procedure, as foreseen in the Common Approach on EU Decentralised Agencies. However, the Commission regrets that the agreement reached by the co-legislators deviates from the Common Approach as regard the appointment process. The Commission sees no objective reasons for this deviation which could affect the autonomy of the agency. The modalities of appointment of the European Border Cost Guard's Executive Director should therefore not be considered as a precedent for other agencies' founding acts.\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1677, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Artis Pabriks", "mepid": "124743", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, the debate showed here in Parliament that the majority of our colleagues really understand the work that has been done in the last few months.

I think it is important to say that we have been working in a very collegial way because we understand that either we win together or we will lose separately, and this is one more example to European citizens that we can do this job. Indeed, this agency will not be a silver bullet and it will not solve each and every issue in the European Union, but we must notice and we must understand that this is a highly important fundamental piece in the larger puzzle of our European Union policy, with these big global challenges. As regards the opposition, I would say that I notice the opposition is coming from both sides, or margins, of this House. One side is immediately saying the European Union is needed while the other side, unfortunately, is dreaming about paradise, but in some way it is also allowing the lives of refugees and also the lives of their citizens to be dreamed away. As one politician in history said, sometimes the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Let us work for now, for today, and let us make the European Union and our countries better today, and here, and not dream about something which is extremely difficult to prove and reach.

The emerging border guards should be based on the current Frontex and much better cooperation between Member States in the protection of the UNION border.

This is, of course, the right direction, but simply increasing the number of posts and financial resources is not enough.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I am pleased that, three years after the Commission came to Parliament with its original proposal for a cybersecurity strategy and the proposal for a cybersecurity directive, we can conclude at the end of a long process. I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the creation of this proposal: the shadow rapporteurs, the colleagues from the other committees, Mrs Pilar del Castillo Vera, especially, but of course also the European Commission and Commissioner Oettinger. I think it is a wonderful moment today to be able to discuss the adoption of this directive here in plenary, after we signed the public-private partnership for cybersecurity here over here in the other building in the European Parliament this morning and the Commission came out this week with its communication on greater cybersecurity. The road since 2013 has been marked by many elements which, in my view – and I think I can say this for the European Parliament as a whole – have led to a better proposal overall. It is a good thing that is done wisely, they say in German, and it is, of course, the case that in the last three years there have been various incidents that have made the citizens, but also the competent authorities in the Member States, think about whether we in Europe are actually up to the challenge of cybersecurity. We all no longer only use our mobile phones to make calls, we no longer only use the computer at home to send e-mails, but we find that the digital world has penetrated much further into our areas of life and, at the same time, we have not mapped the element of security in these services to a sufficient extent, at least not in Europe. There was the incident on the French TV5, there was the incident at the Sony Playstation, there were many other incidents. Unfortunately, many of the incidents we have seen in recent years will not be directly covered by the European directive. But there are also incidents such as the mobile operator in Austria – the country from which you come – who could not avert a several-hour-long hack of a cyberattack and where, therefore, the telephone lines were not reachable for several hours, and we have seen the Polish airline LOT, which had to leave its aircraft on the ground for several hours because corresponding digital map materials were also hacked. These two examples will no longer be possible if the directive is adequately and correctly implemented, if, in any case, we oblige the providers of critical infrastructure that operate across borders in future with the directive to take more care to ensure that such incidents can no longer occur. This is an important step, because it will allow the people, the citizens of Europe, who will end up most affected by such attacks, to hope for greater security in the future. A second point was the big question of so-called platform legislation. Can we also include large Internet platforms in the scope of this network and information security directive? We have had a hard time in this as a Parliament, but in the end we have ensured that we have found a very pragmatic, results-oriented way, which I believe also meets with a great deal of support in the economy concerned. That is why I believe that together we have found the right way forward.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which it has been Three years ago, the Commission first started a cybersecurity strategy to Europeanise data security. With the directive we are debating this evening, we have made a concrete mark-up for legislation. I would like to thank Mr Schwab, but also Mrs Vicky Ford and Mrs Pilar del Castillo Vera, for their excellent, constructive cooperation. The current draft is better than the one tabled by the Commission. What is it all about? All of us – citizens, in the field of social media, in the area of search engine use, industry, the use of data storage, data centers, digital infrastructures – need trust – trust against industrial espionage, against hacking, against disruption and destruction of digital infrastructures and their data. Confidence only returns if you create security, security through technology, hardware and software, and through the corresponding specifications that you develop in industry and which the policy can then determine accordingly. That is what we are doing here. Our mission as a digital union, the creation of a digital single market, needs confidence – in cloud computing services, in search engines, in online platforms. With today's consultation, we are building trust, we are creating a European standard, a European culture for cybersecurity. We have established a partnership with the industry in recent weeks. Today, many companies and many associations and many scientific institutions have been here in Strasbourg to develop a cyber PPP, which will be endowed with Parliament's money from Horizon 2020 with EUR 450 million. The industry adds three times the amount. The European Cybersecurity Organisation (ECSO) is the platform on which industry can be found. By also involving Europeans, we are making start-ups and large people, also industrial policy, and creating for them the opportunity with their hardware, with their software for cybersecurity orders of tomorrow and thus customers of tomorrow and thus jobs for tomorrow. The NIS Directive focuses first and foremost on sensitive infrastructures: energy, transport, banks, financial markets, health. It also dictates to The Member States what to do at national level, i.e. platforms with industry at national level, security requirements, appropriate authorities – a cybersecurity authority at Member State level. With ENISA, the European Union has a body that coordinates, moderates and advises everyone accordingly. I think that this is a major step forward for Europe on the road to the highest level of digital security. We are currently considering whether certification makes sense, i.e. whether we should certify companies that offer hardware, cybersecurity software, so that an energy company, a bank with the certificate, can broadcast trust to customers, can guarantee security.

And that's why cyberattacks need to be controlled and they have to have immediate answers and answers provided. Let me tell you that this is a magnificent example of the value of acting together, of the value of the European Union as a space in which different countries act together. This is the kind of added value — directives like this — that Europeans want to see, answers to today's problems and tomorrow's problems.

It is precisely the chronicles of recent years and months that remind us how much Europe needs to make up for lost time on the road to creating an area of security, intelligence and threat prevention. The online environment is now a new playing field where terrorist groups and new forms of organised crime challenge our freedoms and rights and put our economic and social relations at risk.  This directive is the first ever attempt to establish Cooperation at European level in the field of cybersecurity and to ensure the security of strategic infrastructures and major digital service providers. The text that I hope we will adopt tomorrow is a distance from the position voted on by Parliament at first reading. We would have liked more, but once again national self-interest and the reluctance of many Member States to cede powers where national sovereignty is maximum has certainly reduced the initial level of ambition of this proposal. However, I am truly convinced that the compromise reached provides a good basis for gradually shaping new common rules and strategies.  The creation of obligations for national authorities and strategic operators and the definition of two levels of cooperation between Member States, one strategic and one operational, based on the Community method, will make it possible to have an ever-increasing level of integration.  And finally, a point, which Commissioner Oettinger has already made: the European response to the issue of cybersecurity will finally give an important boost to the establishment of the digital single market, which is a strategic objective of this Commission and which is based on public and consumer confidence in an online environment, and safety is therefore an essential factor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1689, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Vicky Ford", "mepid": "96949", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, cyber-security is a real issue.

Beyond the damage in terms of data sensitivity, the damage caused by cyber-attacks around the world is estimated by the Commission at EUR 500 billion.  Cybersecurity is a key issue for European governments and peoples. It is therefore equally important to organise voluntary cooperation of nations based on information exchanges and best practices. I stress heavily that this cooperation is voluntary. Cooperation between European neighbours is essential and natural. The ENF group supports the strengthening of national security and defence capabilities for networks and information systems. On the other hand, I deplore, in Chapter 3 of the well-named report, the failure to withdraw the desire to establish a binding supranational system of coordinated declarations and operational responses in response to cyber security incidents. The text also provides regular evaluations of national policies in this area. This far goes beyond the reasonable framework of cooperation, which no longer becomes voluntary, but regulatory and binding. Once again, the text sins by dogmatism.

Unfortunately, as you know, Commissioner Crețu, cannot be with us today, but she asked me to speak on behalf of both. Although synergies have been under discussion and debated in this House for many years, Horizon 2020 is the first research and innovation framework programme that clearly and explicitly refers to synergies with the European structural and investment funds. Indeed, the regulation that set up those funds converted synergies from ‘nice to have’ in past programmes into a ‘must have’ in the current programmes and in the smart specialisation strategies. From wishful thinking, synergies are now on the ground. I do not feel I have to remind you why synergies are so fundamental. The more synergies we can achieve between structural funds and Horizon 2020, the more impact we can expect for jobs, growth and investment from funding at all levels, be it national, regional or European. Recently our services published and distributed to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) and the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) Members a brochure entitled ‘EU funds working together for jobs and growth’. The brochure showcases many concrete examples of synergies and also highlights initiatives with high potential for synergies, talking about the Romanian competitiveness operational programme or the innovation projects in North Rhine-Westphalia, or the joint Portugal-Spain nanotechnology laboratory, or the flagship Extreme Light Infrastructure in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, or the BONUS programme in the Baltic Sea. Another practical manifestation of synergies on the ground is of course provided by a new successful instrument. We called it the Seal of Excellence. The Seal is a quality label granted to projects submitted to the SME Instrument and Horizon 2020 which succeeded in the highly competitive evaluation but could not, unfortunately, be funded under the available budget. These high-quality projects can then look at alternative funding at national or regional level, and since the launch of the initiative in November, all the expectations were exceeded. My colleague Corina Crețu and I have signed more than 3 200 Seals of Excellence, originating basically from all Member States, and at the same time, we got more than 100 funding authorities representing both the cohesion side and the research side to actually be mobilised and work together on designing and implementing measures to support the Seal of Excellence proposals. So let me also inform you that we realised huge efforts to sort out some discrepancies between the Seal of Excellence and the state aid rules that are now almost solved and will not be creating any more bottlenecks. They are helped in this Community of Practices, which is a platform that was set up by the Commission to facilitate the exchange of experiences and mutual learning to identify and target specific needs and possible obstacles for smooth implementation. I consider the Seal of Excellence to be one of the major achievements of this year, and it is really a big success that was unexpected. But the question is: have we actually done it? Do we have more to do? I think we have a lot more to do. Synergies are a little bit like the simplification process. It is ongoing work. We will have to keep going. We will have to keep on trying more and different. That is why, turning now to the future, we will of course improve and continue to expand the existing synergies – like, for example, expanding the Seal to other areas of Horizon 2020, like widening or the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions. In the future we also want to involve our JTIs in that process to explore more synergies based on the excellent work that has already been undertaking by the Clean Sky, that maximise the impact of their projects through tailor-made synergies with regional interests in aeronautics. In that respect, I think that Clean Sky is a model to be followed by other JTIs. But let me touch now on a number of points that Commissioner Crețu intended to draw to your attention, starting with the smart specialisation strategies. These strategies were required to combine from the outset ERDF- funded projects in initiatives with Horizon 2020 in order to actively include actors that, with Horizon 2020 projects in management in entrepreneurial discovery processes, could do much better, and ultimately it was just shaping the research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation. The Commission is continuously assisting Member States and regions in the development of their smart specialisation strategies, notably through the Smart Specialisation Platform based in Seville in Spain. The aim is threefold: to accelerate the implementation of smart specialisation strategies; to facilitate transnational cooperation among the regions; and third, to set up a series of thematic smart specialisation platforms. So far we have in place three of those platforms: one on energy innovation, a second one on industrial modernisation, and the third one on agri-food. These platforms and others in the future will help in ensuring effective use of available structural funds and leverage additional resources from Horizon 2020, but also private funding and EFSI. This thematic smart specialisation platforms approach follows a good example that was developed by the Vanguard Initiative, which succeeded actually to move cooperation between 30 regional governments around innovation in concrete value chains to matchmaking with businesses and research actors. We are also setting up a European strategic closer partnership for smart specialisation investment in support of the thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on modernisation ensuring real participation from business. Finally, a very quick word on the Stairway to Excellence: the initiative here in Parliament with a pilot project that identifies potential for synergies in certain Member States, including the adoption of Horizon 2020 management tools. The need for an ongoing entrepreneurial discovery process involving businesses and research and exploiting transnational cooperation between all the countries. A series of 11 national events dedicated to the project have already taken place. This project is going to be widened soon to other Member States to deepen the synergies there. I shall leave you with a quote from Stephen Covey, who used to say that synergy is really about better than my way or your way – it is actually our way.

In this respect, I think that this discussion is important for the understanding that we cannot solve certain problems – for example, the EU13, where we can talk for years about the distribution of innovation funds – if we do not address fundamental structural issues, if we do not also use the Structural Funds to reshape the old Academia system to a certain extent, so that the successful and excellent researchers also have the structural conditions. to get financial resources.

We believe that some new denial of funds to Horizon would be extremely damaging and would drastically affect the results expected of this programme.  The European Union must set its priorities, and long-term programmes to foster scientific excellence and innovation for the stable economy of the future should be ahead of short-term grandiose policy plans that stand on shaky feet from day one.

This leads to economic growth, but also to new jobs.  But the fact is that Europe is lagging behind other parts of the world when it comes to spending on research and development. This means that we must make every euro invested in the European budget pay off as much as possible. That was also the message from President Juncker when he took office. In his State of the Union address last year, he promised us to increase the impact of European investment in research and innovation. Subsequently, the Commissioners, together with Commissioner Creţu, announced a quality mark of excellence to improve the quality of research funding, the seal of excellence.  Unfortunately, in my view, it has been too much for a Juncker promise, a quality mark and a handbook, and in practice we see too little of the promised enlarged impact. Companies and knowledge institutions are presented with great opportunities on paper, but the implementation in practice remains very difficult. For example, it remains difficult to combine the use of Horizon 2020 and the European structural and investment funds to finance one large ambitious project.  I would very much like to see concrete measures from the European Commission to simplify this. As far as I am concerned, these measures should not be concocted in a Brussels office this night, but they must be formulated together with practical experts. A little less from above, a little more from the bottom. More synergy between Horizon 2020 and other funds is not an end in itself, but it is important to use the available money as best as possible in the case of a tight budget.

Research programmes seek excellence, justifiably, and cohesion policy, on the other hand, has often become caught up in an attempt to fix real social problems, but with little responsibility and real result. Even today we see instead how high-speed trains are financed without passengers or airports without travellers, too, and we see how FEIE still today continues to finance projects such as high-speed motorways, mobile vehicle motorways in Germany and other countries. It is very good that the Commission wants to overcome this silo division and wants to promote cooperation and synergy between programmes, such as the pilot I promoted two years ago, with the concept of economic convergence between regions, which is in the implementation phase and which is behind some of the proposals and comments you made to us today. But we must also be clear about the risks that lie behind that policy, in that action. We must prevent the EIE Funds from taking risks that do not belong to it and, moreover, we must prevent this legitimate search for synergies from being the gateway to a policy which the Commission is, it seems, considering, that of a simple change of instruments, of grants allowance.

The Structural Funds are aimed at capacity building, responding to the needs of the regions that need them most, with shared management at national and regional levels. Horizon 2020 is aimed at achieving excellence at EU level. The crucial difference between the different funds is that, while the amount of structural funds is in one region, it is to be expected, as it receives 7-year support, horizon 2020 funding is provided on the basis of competitive criteria. So the fact that a given project receives support is far from certain.  From a practical point of view, synergies make sense to allocate unused resources in an operational programme, to allocate them to a project of excellence that has failed to receive funding with Horizon. Ladies and gentlemen, however, we must point out that the hypocrisy of a European Union which, on the one hand, calls for investment in research and innovation and, on the other hand, takes a good EUR 2.2 billion away from Horizon and allocates it to projects of the Juncker Plan, which are of dubious use, are sometimes incompatible with the objectives enshrined in cohesion policy.

Thirteen new EU countries received only 5% of the total budget spent in Horizon 2020.

Low success rates are worrying – at 13.9% throughout the programme and up to 6% in some parts of the programme. Hundreds of innovative projects are therefore in a vacuum! To counter this, the European Commission has created a Seal of Excellence. Projects that have not received funding due to a limited budget receive the certificate for the highest rated projects in Horizon 2020. The \"seal\" is intended to be a pass for structural measures for them. But it's now a check without coverage. The Structural Funds distributed at national level have state aid rigours that are not available in Horizon 2020. The authors of a project with a 'seal of excellence' must therefore prepare a new proposal, taking into account extremely different requirements and criteria. The project budget is very often rebuilt, as the Structural Funds offer a different level of support than Horizon 2020. Creating a new proposal and reassessing it is a long and costly process.

Madam President, thank you also to the Commission for being here. Ladies and gentlemen, the vote in my report on the cooperation of coastguard functions is simply a victory. Since 2011, I have been calling for the cooperation of the coastguard to make the European Union more effective in dealing with crises at sea. Crises at sea can be multiple: marine pollution, illegal fishing, influx of refugees on dangerous boats. In all these cases, when I first proposed European coastguard cooperation, my aim was not only to prevent disasters, but also to enable the European Union to act in a coordinated and effective manner. We have identified 316 civilian and military coastguard authorities. Until now, this fragmentation has prevented joint actions and the exchange of information. Now the three European agencies - the European Fisheries Control Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency and the European Border and Coast Guard Corps - have complementary mandates that obviously increase the European Union's response capabilities at sea. The agencies will coordinate the 316 authorities responsible for coastguard functions. We will improve the European Union's capacity for action, and I believe that is what European citizens want today. Agencies are now pooling their capacity for action and information systems and are working in a coordinated way to rescue at sea and prevent illegal immigration. Their mandates are expanded; they support all national or local authorities responsible for coastguard functions through the sharing of human resources and operational resources. Through this decision, we create real synergies between agencies to provide more efficient services, also in terms of costs. In 2015 and 2016, the European Union came under intense pressure at its external borders. Over the past two years, it has become clear that the Schengen area without internal borders is only viable if external borders are effectively protected and guaranteed. This is only possible with joint, solidarity and accountable action by all Member States. Thanks to the cooperation of the three agencies to support the Member States in the protection of our borders, we are building a Europe that is more united because it is more responsive, more efficient and safer. I would also like to point out that we are just expanding the mandate of the European Fisheries Control Agency. This Agency retains its primary, of course, fisheries control missions in Europe in order to ensure a common fisheries policy that effectively fights illegal fishing. On the other hand, the Agency can also be mobilized in the case of other crises at sea. Europe is becoming faster, more efficient and more coordinated in border control.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1737, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission welcomes the revised proposal on the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) that we will be discussing today. We are very grateful to the Chairs of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Cramer and Mr Cadec, for their excellent work. In good understanding with the Dutch Presidency, the European Parliament has managed to negotiate this text in record time. I understand that it was sometimes a procedural headache. I am therefore very glad that the co-legislators succeeded in retaining an identical text on coastguard cooperation for all three agencies involved: EMSA, EFCA and also Frontex, as the Commission had proposed. This is an important achievement. The three agencies will now be mandated to cooperate on an equal footing, as has been stressed by the Chairs. They will be provided with a firm legal basis and additional resources to implement operational activities with great European value added. This cross-sectoral approach will allow synergies between the agencies, and in particular it will allow jointly planned surveillance operations, streamlined sharing of information and coordinated capacity building, as well as enhanced surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, such as remotely piloted aircraft systems. The agencies will now be equipped to make a decisive contribution to reinforcing European capability for maritime security and surveillance, including the protection of EU external borders. As was extensively discussed earlier this afternoon, the refugee crisis is one of the biggest challenges for the Union. Our agencies will do their part in addressing this challenge, contributing to the new European Border and Coast Guard and saving lives. In his latest State of the Union speech, before this plenary, Commission President Juncker stressed the importance of developing a fully operational European Border and Coast Guard system. Last April, Parliament adopted a report on how the EU should respond to the current migration challenges. The report discussed the search and rescue operations at sea and praised the contribution of merchant shipping. It also acknowledged the responsibilities of Member States and of the EU for organising a permanent response. At this point I would emphasise that the enhanced services to be provided by the agencies will also serve fully other objectives: maritime transport safety, security and environmental protection, as well as fisheries control, which are the respective missions of EMSA and EFCA.

The European Fisheries Control Agency comes up in this context.

However, the political conditions for this have not been met until today. The wave of migration destined for Europe was the pretext they found. From a seated one, they realize an old aspiration and deepen a security and militaristic vision at the internal level, consolidating in the external level the deplorable concept of Europe-Fortress.

We see that one of the objectives of this Agency is to tackle pollution at sea, caused either by ships or by gas installations, as well as to tackle large-scale oil spills. I wonder, however, how it is possible to carry out this task when it does not have the means to do so, when it does not have ships to be able to intervene and supervise.  It is also said that it will be working with the Coast Guard-Border Agency to address the risks that arise in the maritime sector, and I wonder, what risks are posed to Europe's seas and by whom?

They help people in distress at sea even though vessels are neither built nor equipped for these large-scale search and rescue operations; and even though staff are not trained for this, and both the migrants and ship’s crew are at risk during these operations. It was this House that first sponsored this idea of European cooperation on coastguard functions in the area of maritime safety and ship pollution prevention, and we are not starting from scratch. For instance, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) is already working with national coastguard bodies in its area of competences. Its ship reporting systems have become today the main European platform for digital maritime services. And it already supports Member States and Frontex to address their maritime surveillance needs, to support intervention and search and rescue operations. EMSA, Frontex and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) are already working together and now their collaboration will be much improved. Thanks to the pilot project proposed by Parliament for 2016, the agencies are engaging in very concrete work to test the future common activities of coastguard cooperation. I am convinced that they will prove their work is well-prepared, and they will deliver at the highest possible level. As of July there will be a multipurpose mission of Frontex and EFCA, supported by EMSA, for border and fishery control in the central Mediterranean Sea. In the autumn, demonstration projects will be organised by EMSA and Frontex to test drone capabilities for multipurpose surveillance missions and to compare them with the use of manned aircraft. Regarding drones, the agencies are also working closely with Eurocontrol and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on technical and regulatory aspects. I hope that your vote tomorrow will support these two proposals which, as I have explained, will contribute greatly to addressing both the refugee crisis and the need to protect our borders.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her This small revision of the OLAF regulation, which we are dealing with this evening, shows that the institutions in Brussels are capable of acting. Only 12 weeks after the presentation of the Commission's proposal, the amendment is fully negotiated on the table. I would ask you to vote in favour of this tomorrow. I would like to thank the Commission, but above all the Council and the Dutch Presidency, which has demonstrated its efficiency impressively – a great achievement and recommended for imitation in the Council! The revision makes a specific but very important change to the OLAF Regulation in force since October 2013. The eight-staff secretariat of the Supervisory Committee, which was previously part of OLAF, is now removed from office and transferred to the Commission's organisation chart. So far, we have had the situation where those EU officials who worked for the five high-ranking members of the Supervisory Committee were subordinate to the Director-General of OLAF, that is to say, the very person whose management of the Supervisory Committee is supposed to be supervised. It is easy to imagine that this posed the risk of conflicts of loyalty and conflicts of interest. This shortcoming has now been rectified and it is to be hoped that this will strengthen the independence of the Supervisory Committee. This should ultimately lead to the supervisory committee being able to carry out its supervisory function more effectively in the future. In order for us to achieve an improvement in the end, it is now important that the committee is not put further and other obstacles in the way. The secretariat must therefore continue to be housed in OLAF's premises, so that it can continue to have access to OLAF's specially secured documents and to the IT system. Existing staffing and resources must also be maintained and arrangements must be made to protect officials working in the Secretariat from conflicts of interest and disadvantages in the wider career path. Tomorrow, the Commission will also make a statement pledging all these points, and we will ensure that this happens in practice. I do not want to hide the fact that this revision is also proof of a huge failure, because the fact that this revision was necessary shows that the power and omnipotence of the Director-General of OLAF had to be limited. It is sad that this revision with this content was necessary after 17 years of OLAF's existence. I consider this revision to be impressive and sad evidence of the lack of professionalism, a lack of management and the lack of fairness of this Director-General towards his staff and his supervisory body. There have always been problems with this monitoring in OLAF, but as urgent and acute as in the last 24 months, this is new. This revision responds to this, and I am very attached to everyone that they have joined in this line-up. We will therefore have to keep an eye on whether the OLAF regulation will continue to be undermined and whether the rights of the Supervisory Committee will be undermined. The fact that we have to carry out this revision is a bad sign. The pressing problems in OLAF and for the Director-General actually require immediate action by the Commission, regardless of the complaints about the immunity procedure and the Belgian investigation. After the reform is before the reform. We will have to deal with further revisions of the OLAF Regulation – not only on this point, but also on other points – namely a much-needed strengthening of the rights of the parties to the proceedings, in order to obtain greater fairness and also greater clarity on the nature of OLAF's investigations and administrative investigations with their criminal content, and also to take account of the fact that the distribution of arms so far is very unequal.

I was with the Supervisory Committee yesterday, and I would like to convey the gratitude of the Chair of the Supervisory Committee and all its members for the action that is being taken with regard to the objective of this proposal, and it will strengthen the independence of OLAF’s Supervisory Committee by very clearly separating the secretariat of the Committee and its budget from the service that they have a mandate to supervise.  I want to stress that the Supervisory Committee has been very active, and the Chair and the members of the Supervisory Committee have been exercising their authority.

We have listened very carefully to the Members of Parliament and to the members of the Supervisory Committee to make sure that we are coming with a clear solution to what has been perceived as a potential restriction of their independence.  We have already placed the budget of the Supervisory Committee with the Commission’s payment office (PMO), and what we are proposing, to put it in very practical terms, is that we are now attaching the secretariat to the PMO as of the date of application of the amended regulation.

It will not affect the independent functioning of the secretariat, or of the committee, nor their current budget and staffing.

The important role of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) Supervisory Committee is to regularly monitor the implementation of OLAF’s investigative function. In order to fulfil this responsibility, the Supervisory Committee needs a well-functioning Secretariat. And as the Committee, also its Secretariat must be independent from OLAF; therefore, appropriate financing should be guaranteed directly by the Commission, separately from OLAF’s budget. All this is rather clear to me – and it is good that the Commission thinks alike on this matter. But as regards the issue of whether the Secretariat should be physically in or out of the same building where the Supervisory Committee and OLAF itself are located, let me be as clear as possible: what we are dealing with here is a very serious matter inside the Union. To move the Secretariat out of the building, using artificial argumentation, is another worrying signal of the state of affairs at OLAF. OLAF is supposed to be – and only to be – concentrating on activities investigating fraud inside the European Union or in the use of the Union resources. It should not be concentrating on issues like this. The effective functioning of the Committee requires constant contacts with the offices of OLAF.

Although an oversight committee, composed of five independent personalities, is responsible for monitoring OLAF, it has so far been unable to exercise its role for two reasons: firstly because it is dependent on OLAF, which manages its budget, and secondly because the Director of OLAF refuses to let it access its data, which is scandalous. I am therefore pleased that a text today proposes to improve the independence of the oversight committee, but I believe that more needs to be done. OLAF has lost all credibility by increasing persecution and abuse of power. As a result, it would have to be abolished, even if it were to be replaced by a new body, in order to get back on a sound footing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1763, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Janusz Korwin-Mikke (NI).", "mepid": "124879", "text": "   – The Honourable Commissioner is probably joking.

We have a situation where OLAF's work is paralyzed, where the head of OLAF has accusations and has had his immunity removed – at the moment it is not known whether he has been removed or not – in which the OLAF Commissioner accuses three Commissioners, a strange hit of just non-socialists, but apparently also keeps accusations against others. And you say that you took control of this situation in March. We are dealing with the issue of whether the secretariat is to be in the same building or not.

That is why it is extremely important that we have independent supervisory bodies to ensure an objective investigation into potential suspicions of fraud and corruption. It is OLAF that is such an authority, and in order to ensure its maximum impartiality, it must be ensured that its supervisory body is truly independent and able to intervene when any suspicion is raised in OLAF itself.  That is why the function of olaf's supervisory committee and its secretariat is important to us.

This is evident where the supervisory authority is financially and humanly linked to the supervised institution. This has often raised doubts as to whether members of the Supervisory Committee can carry out their duties properly. An amendment to the Regulation was therefore urgently needed to avoid suspicions that OLAF might adversely affect the functioning of the Supervisory Committee.

Madam President, OLAF is a critical service for the European Union and should therefore operate in full transparency. Thus, OLAF's Supervisory Committee and its Secretariat must finally gain increased independence in order to avoid any conflict of interest. At the same time, OLAF as a special European Anti-Fraud Office should combine transparency with efficiency in the fight against tax evasion.  Moreover, the total number of irregularities reported for 2014 amounts to around EUR 3.24 billion, while the financial impact of the irregularities reported is 36% higher than in 2013, which shows that OLAF has done nothing to help combat tax evasion by multinational companies. Therefore, in addition to the independence of the Supervisory Committee and its Secretariat, it is important for OLAF to play a more active role in combating multinational tax evasion, as well as any illegal activity taking place in the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1768, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you very much for the comments and views expressed. There have been questions directed to the Commission. First on the Secretariat, whether it will continue to be located in the OLAF building: I want to confirm that, yes, the Secretariat will be located within the buildings that are hosting OLAF and there would be full access to information provided. Secondly, there was a question, or rather a concern expressed, that maybe the Secretariat will be absorbed in the Commission, and I just want to be very clear that we have taken seriously the question of proper allocation. We have looked at a number of possibilities from our human resources services to the Secretariat General to the PMO, and we have chosen the Paymaster’s Office because it is an office with no policy obligations whatsoever. It is a very good home for the administrative purpose of providing an assignment for the Secretariat where the budget line can be apostate and where people can be accommodated without any interference in the work of the Secretariat. The head of the Secretariat is in charge, and when we looked across the services we thought that this is the most neutral, non-interfering place we can possibly find, and this is why we have decided on it. There was a comment made that the location of the Secretariat is important, but much more important is the composition of the Supervisory Committee, and there was a call that there has to be renewal or replacement in the Supervisory Committee. Just to share, as Mrs Grässle knows very well, that we have taken this task of identifying the future members of the Supervisory Committee very seriously from the three institutions. We have recently assembled to agree on five new members that would step into their functions as the mandate of the current members expires, plus a reserve list of seven – all very qualified individuals. So we feel that now we are in a very good place institutionally to have a supervisory committee that is fully competent to carry out the job that is trusted to them. We have not been much concerned on this question of how this transition is going to take place because we have the confidence that the people that are being put immediately on the list of five and on the reserve list can, each and every one of them, dutifully serve, and in the next days this process of selection should be finalised with the good contribution of all three institutions. COMMISSION'S STATEMENT \"The Commission is fully committed to the independent functioning of the Secretariat of the OLAF Supervisory Committee. The main purpose of the proposed amendment to the OLAF Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 is to add further guarantees to the independence of the Secretariat. The implementation of the amended Regulation will be guided by this aim. As confirmed by Vice-President Georgieva to the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee by letter of 20 May 2016, the Commission intends to attach the Secretariat of that Committee, as of the date of application of the amended Regulation, to PMO. This attachment will be of a purely administrative nature, with a view to facilitating certain organisational and budgetary aspects. It will not affect the independent functioning of the Secretariat. As also mentioned in that letter, the administrative attachment of the Secretariat to PMO will have no impact on its current staffing and budgetary means. The Head of the Secretariat will be in charge of the management and appraisal of his staff. The appraisal of the Head of the Secretariat will be based on a report of the Supervisory Committee. The Commission will consider, after consulting the Supervisory Committee, putting in place appropriate internal rules on mobility limiting the duration of the postings of the Secretariat, while ensuring continuity in order to render their independence effective, and avoid risks of conflicts of interests or of revolving doors issues with OLAF. The modification of the Regulation does not affect the access of the Supervisory Committee to information such as that contained in OLAF's IT systems, databases and documents. The offices of the staff of the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee will be maintained within the building currently housing OLAF, protecting the independence of the Supervisory Committee and of OLAF while ensuring ease of contact.\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1769, "date": "2016-07-05.json", "name": "Ingeborg Gräßle", "mepid": "28220", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I would also like to thank all the Members who have made comments. You are all so right. In fact, this is a complex problem, and Madam Vice-President, you are the first Commissioner who has really solved a problem now, at least trying to solve it. We have tried to resolve it, and we must not forget that today is an important new start in relations, in the possibilities of the Supervisory Committee, and this relaunch will, with everything we have done in addition, hopefully also go the right way and bring the right solutions. I would like to take up what Mrs Ayala said: who is responsible for the Supervisory Committee? Yes, us! We are his stakeholders, we are the ones who, of course, also have to see that he can work and that he is doing the right thing. That is why a good and trusting relationship with Parliament, the Council and the Commission will always be necessary.  One could well fall into philosophical reflection, if one sees the difficulties. I believe that we must now move on to the question of how we set up the office well and how we fill existing legal loopholes. This legal loophole certainly includes the Supervisory Committee's access to the documents and certainly the handing over of the final report to persons under OLAF investigations. They have to get the final report because it is an aberration under the rule of law that accusations have been made that people cannot defend themselves against. I have really learned something about this in the last few years. I believe that we really must take up some of the experience that we have now had for the forthcoming reform of the OLAF regulation, the great opportunity now also with the European Public Prosecutor and a reorganisation, and hopefully also an institutional reorganisation of OLAF in connection with the European Public Prosecutor. I do not hope that some of the shortcomings will be self-sastillated.
