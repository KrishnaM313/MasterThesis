Let us focus on three matters. Firstly, the European Council condemned Turkey’s unilateral military action in North East Syria. No one is fooled by the so‑called ceasefire. Turkey needs to end its military action permanently, withdraw its forces and respect international humanitarian law. Any other course means unacceptable human suffering, a victory for Daesh and a serious threat to European security. The European Council also reconfirmed its full solidarity with Cyprus, faced with Turkey’s illegal drillings off its coast. When it comes to Brexit, the European Council endorsed the deal reached by our negotiator and Prime Minister Johnson’s Government. As you know, it is based on the deal that we agreed with the previous Government. The changes concern the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, formerly known as the backstop. Prime Minister Johnson’s acceptance to have customs checks at the points of entry into Northern Ireland will allow us to avoid border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and will ensure the integrity of the single market. The revised deal was possible and acceptable to the EU because: firstly, it had the support of Ireland; secondly, it had the support of the Commission, ensuring that all our negotiating objectives were met; and, thirdly, because it avoids a chaotic no-deal Brexit. On the Council side, we have just finalised the necessary steps for the EU’s approval, and the legal texts are now with you. The European Parliament has a role to play, and it is an important one. The situation is quite complex following events over the weekend in the UK and the British request for an extension of the Article 50 process. I am consulting the leaders on how to react, and will decide in the coming days. It is obvious that the result of these consultations will very much depend on what the British Parliament decides, or doesn’t decide. We should be ready for every scenario. But one thing must be clear: as I said to Prime Minister Johnson on Saturday, a no-deal Brexit will never be our decision. (Applause) Finally, the leaders held a difficult debate on enlargement. Following the clear recommendation by the Commission, an overwhelming majority of Member States wanted to open accession talks with North Macedonia and Albania. Despite this, the required unanimity was not possible last week. In my opinion, this was a mistake, as I have said to the leaders ...  (Applause) and I was a bit more direct then. Now I can only hope that the leaders draw the right conclusions when they discuss the accession process before the Zagreb summit in May 2020. Together with Commission President-elect von der Leyen, the leaders also discussed the future of the European Union in terms of its strategic agenda, the future EU budget and the incoming Commission’s priorities. We are determined that the EU leads the way in fighting the climate crisis. A socially just transition to a green economy is not only a necessity but also an opportunity to improve our environment, while creating jobs. As this is my last appearance here with Jean-Claude Juncker, I would like to express my greatest appreciation of him and his work. These were a difficult five years for the Union, but we have always cooperated in good faith. Our respective roles and different perspectives sometimes meant political disagreements. But I can say without hesitation that Jean-Claude has always been devoted to Europe and served Europe well. And I am honoured to call you my friend, Jean-Claude. Thank you. (Applause) I also want to thank the European Parliament for five years of good cooperation. That does not mean that we have always agreed. Quite the contrary. But I have always respected you, honourable Members, knowing that we share the same goal: to protect our Union and our people. Thank you very much.

We are today debating the 147th European Council of my political career – the147th or 148th, I don’t know exactly. Today is the 105th time that I have addressed you in this plenary, the beating heart of European democracy. In many of these 105 debates, I have had to discuss the UK’s departure from the European Union with you. In truth, it has pained me to spend so much of this term of office dealing with Brexit, when I have been thinking of nothing else than how this Union could do better for its citizens. A waste of time and a waste of energy! The Commission has worked tirelessly to negotiate and renegotiate an agreement with the United Kingdom to respect the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. We now have a new agreement, which again creates the legal certainty for an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. It took a huge amount of work to arrive at this point. I listened to Prime Minister Johnson in the same way as I listened to Prime Minister May. Our negotiators, mainly Michel Barnier, have once again worked around the clock and once again they have shown creativity and determination. The agreement we have reached with the United Kingdom Government addresses this Parliament’s demands – all Parliament’s demands. I will always regret the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the Union, but at least we can look ourselves in the eye and say that we have done all in our power to make sure that this departure is orderly. In this same spirit, we have done everything in our power to prepare the European Union for all eventualities, irrespective of what is happening on the other side of the channel. We need now to watch events in Westminster very closely, but it’s not possible – not imaginable – that this Parliament would ratify the agreement before Westminster has ratified it. First London, then Brussels and Strasbourg. (Applause) Wir haben uns, Herr Präsident, anlässlich des Europäischen Rates auch ausführlich mit dem finanziellen Rahmen für die nächste Siebenjahresperiode beschäftigt. Ich möchte hier noch einmal zu Protokoll geben, dass ich der Auffassung bin, dass die Zeit abläuft, die gebraucht werden wird, um zu einer Einigung im Rat und später anderswo zu kommen. Wenn wir weiter Zeit verlieren, werden wir in den ersten zwei Jahren des finanziellen Rahmens in finanzielle Engpässe kommen. Wichtig ist aber, dass die Mitgliedstaaten und andere Akteure wissen, welcher Finanzrahmen für die nächste Siebenjahresperiode gilt. Das brauchen junge Erasmus-Studenten, das brauchen Forscher, das brauchen viele andere, und wir haben eigentlich nicht das Recht, diese für das Gelingen des europäischen Projekts wichtigen Partner vor den Kopf zu stoßen, nur weil wir unfähig sind, uns zu einigen. Aber ich möchte ganz klar sagen: Das von der Kommission vorgeschlagene Haushaltsvolumen ist ein Minimum – ein Minimum! Die Vorschläge, die jetzt auf dem Tisch liegen – auch die jüngsten Vorschläge des finnischen Ratsvorsitzes –, sind nicht akzeptabel! Man kann Europa und seine Zukunft nicht mit einem Prozent des Bruttosozialprodukts gestalten. Dies wird nicht möglich sein. (Beifall) Et puis, Monsieur le président, nous avons parlé de l’élargissement.  Je suis très déçu de la décision ou de la non-décision du Conseil européen. La Macédoine du Nord et l’Albanie étaient en droit d’attendre qu’on ouvre les négociations avec ces pays qui ont fait de grands efforts. C’est une lourde erreur de ne pas avoir ouvert les négociations avec ces deux pays. C’est une lourde erreur parce qu’elle frappe deux pays au cœur. C’est une lourde erreur parce que, si l’Union européenne donne l’impression de faire des promesses et de ne pas les respecter, personne ne nous respectera à travers le monde.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the I would like to begin by thanking Donald Tusk for his five years of work for the common House of Europe. It has held together the difficult European Council, has contributed to the progress made at this difficult level as well. You pointed out that we all stand for the common idea. I think it can be said that it is easier here in this House to defend this common idea than in your body, in the European Council. Therefore, thank you for your work, also on behalf of the entire Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Unfortunately, the last European Council did not take the decisions we wanted on Turkey. We are dealing with an incursion into Syria that is contrary to international law. The Kurds were our partners in the fight against Islamist terror. More than 11,000 Kurds have been killed in the fighting. There are 12,000 IS fighters in the camps there, which we do not now know whether or not they will be released. That is why it is a pity that the European Council has not been able to get its way to take further measures. The list of events in Turkey is now long. We have the illegal drilling in Cyprus, we have the restriction of the freedom of the press, the threats against refugees and now the invasion of Syria, which is contrary to international law. That is why many people are already asking themselves the question: where is Europe's clear signal? Where is this signal that we condemn this accordingly? We are talking – and this was also the case in the Council – of concern, we are concerned – but that is not enough in these times. There would be plenty of possibilities. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believe that as long as Turkey is behaving aggressively, we must also talk about consequences, including economic consequences. It is not acceptable for Turkey to benefit permanently from the customs union, from economic access to the European internal market and, on the other hand, to behave aggressively. The second thing that moves us, of course, is the MFF – the financial issues. The Finnish proposal is simply a provocation to the European Parliament. Jean-Claude Juncker has said that this is not enough to answer the issues of the future. And I would like to make it clear that the European Parliament also has a role to play in the MFF in the end. The Council should not risk the proposals for the future failing in the European Parliament at the end. That is why I am campaigning for the European Union to be properly equipped. New tasks also mean new funds that need to be made available. And the 2020 budget, which will be on the table in a few days' time, is a prelude to this. It is not acceptable for us to cut back on the future, in research, in the case of young people, in Erasmus. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will not support this. And then, ladies and gentlemen, we have the historic mistake of the Council last week: Northern Macedonia and Albania are denied the prospect of accession. We are faced with the question of whether we are exporting stability to the Balkans or whether we are importing instability from the Balkans to Europe. That is the question we are facing. In this respect, there was a serious failure by the European Council on this historic issue last week. We have demanded a great deal from the countries: Northern Macedonia even had to change the name of the country in order to get a prospect of accession. They have tried, they have made an effort, and now the door is being slammed shut. It is a serious loss of credibility that we are witnessing and which the Heads of State or Government are responsible for. (Applause) I am very much in favour of us examining structures. It is now being discussed whether we will manage enlargement processes differently in the future. This can be heard mainly from Paris. I am very much in favour of that. But has Northern Macedonia been said before, has Albania been said before? No, they didn't say it. And that is why we must not confuse issues that were not directly linked. I would like to comment on a partisan political aspect. The EPP representatives in the European Council have all united in their support for the accession prospects of Northern Macedonia and Albania. It was mainly two Renew representatives, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Rutte, who have strongly opposed the two countries. I am campaigning for us, as parties, to be able to give these countries a perspective. A last word on Brexit for this week. We can simply say: let's wait and let's have a cup of coffee for what will happen in the next hours in London – a coffee, yes, a tea, you're right. Sorry for this. It was a more European perspective. It is positive that we have a compromise – that Michel and the negotiator in London, and finally, Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker, found a compromise: no hard border, but on the other hand, no backstop. So I think for both sides it's a good compromise. Now the procedure is in our hands. The House of Commons, the upper house (the Lords) will decide, and then we have finally to see the outcome – whether the amendments will be accepted or not. So we are still in the hands of London. We are waiting for London, and for us as the European Parliament, I would say we have the same right to do a proper assessment about the text which is on our table. There is no need to rush. There is no need to hurry up. We have the same rights to discuss it at the level of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO), and then finally here in the plenary, after the discussions at group level. But that's why I see no chance that this week we will have any kind of decision. So the European Parliament is the last (let me say) institution who has to make the final assessment, and that is not only a technical assessment – we do a political assessment on the Treaty. But the last days gave us the opportunity that we finally managed a good development on Brexit in this negative case of Brexit, and a good chance that we keep friendship between Europe and Great Britain, to look for a good development so in the future.

It is true that there have been many moments of uncovering between the Council and this European Parliament, but it is also important to recognise the effort that you have often put into working on at the personal level to ensure that there are common objectives to work for.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this European Council has, on the other hand, special relevance at the time when we are: on the one hand, pending Brexit and, on the other hand, the beginning of the legislature, which will be crucial and for which we do not yet have a budget. Brexit is being a difficult and painful process for everyone. The Social Democrats have always wanted the UK to remain in the Union, and in this process every step is important. So was the step taken by the UK Parliament on Saturday, adopting an amendment that avoids the precipice of an un agreed Brexit. It is now up to the House of Commons to continue the proceedings and to rule on the agreement. Only then, as soon as we know what That Parliament's decision is, will this - the European Parliament - take responsibility and act accordingly.  From here I want to thank Michel Barnier for the work and efforts and unity shown by the Twenty-Seven, because we know that union makes strength. This same determination and coherence, which the Council has been able to maintain during the Brexit negotiations, we should now show it to set the course we need in the European Union for the next five years. If we want to be credible, it's time to move from words to action.  In recent elections, citizens have asked us for a new, greener, stronger Europe in defending the rule of law, more committed to social rights and equality, and more transparent in its decision-making. That is why we hope that the European Council will show more leadership and commitment to the challenges they face right now.  In the spring, the European Commission bet on a climate-neutral Europe in 2050. Unfortunately, this proposal does not yet have the unanimous support of the heads of government and yet the Social Democrats have made the so-called 'New Green Deal' an absolute priority for the future Commission. But it will only succeed if we put all the necessary resources. We will not accept that it is workers, small businesses or families who pay the green transition bill. We must agree on an investment plan that finances this transition fairly, and we can only achieve this with an ambitious financial framework.  The European Parliament set its targets for the budget in November 2018, and we have been waiting for the Council ever since. Our position remains strong: we will only support a budget with new own resources that reflect the Union's priorities and thus we will be able to promote new instruments, without reducing the financing of policies that are fundamental to the European Union: agriculture, cohesion, fisheries... We must ensure sufficient resources to address new challenges, such as migration, external action and defence, and we also need to respond to the economic difficulties faced by many citizens. We have succeeded in including European unemployment insurance, measures to combat child poverty and the Youth Guarantee as priorities of the next Commission. In short, we will only support an ambitious budget for Europe to grow. That is the goal: for Europe to grow. For that reason, we will not accept anything below 1.3% of gross national income. Without adequate funding, which European Government will assume its responsibility when the Commission is unable to comply with its programme?  The European Union also loses credibility when it calls for reforms from its neighbours and then leaves them waiting at the door once they have complied. We will therefore continue to support the start of accession negotiations with Northern Macedonia and Albania. Of course much remains to be done and negotiations are a long way off, but their completion must be completed as a lifeguard for the European Union.  Completing the accession of the Western Balkans not only contributes to the stability of the region, but also ensures the security of the whole Union.  And we also expect more ambition in the international sphere. We support the Council's condemnation of Turkey for its military intervention, although we regret the lack of concrete measures. And at this point I do not want to miss the opportunity to send a message of solidarity and support to Cyprus: we will not allow Turkey to continue its illegal drilling in the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus and we call for its sovereignty to be respected. Colleagues, there's a lot of work to be done. Ambition is necessary and the commitment to work shared by all is essential. This European Parliament will live up to the circumstances. I hope that the Council will also be aware of the great responsibility it currently has in its hands.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Dacian Cioloş", "mepid": "197631", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Mr President, first of all, I will address Donald: you are nearing the end of your mandate, I have had the opportunity to work with you, on the Commission's side, on the Council side and now on the side of Parliament. I would like to tell you that I have always appreciated your righteousness, your sense of Europe and your contribution to European unity, as the first President of the Council from Eastern Europe. So I thank you for what you have done for Europe.  With regard to the Council's conclusions on Brexit, we are now getting used to it: we think we have seen the end of the tunnel and then, finally, systematically, our British friends are showing a lot of imagination to prolong and delay a final decision. British newspapers have always criticised our European institutions for their excessive creativity. We now see that they are capable of doing the same. But good if it's for a good cause.  In any case, on the part of Parliament, we welcome the fact that we now have an agreement. I would like to thank Michel Barnier and his team once again for their work. It was essential for us that the UK's exit be done with an agreement. We are now waiting for the British Parliament to do its job to the end and, quite clearly, we cannot take a decision in the European Parliament until we have a final decision, a final ratification of this agreement in the British Parliament. We will assume our responsibilities but, as Manfred said, it is not the European Parliament that should be in a hurry to do its job. That probably won't happen this week.  With regard to the other points raised in the Council, I will focus on two points, namely the budget and the enlargement process. As far as the budget is concerned, our group has been involved in drafting Parliament's resolution which clearly calls for the ambition for Europe to be reflected in the budget. Parliament will assume its responsibility not only to demand a strong budget, but also to show that Europe is not only built with negotiations of figures, but also with ambition. The budget cannot be limited to the sharing of financial contributions from Member States. If we have a genuine European ambition, we must now work seriously on own resources and show that Europe can build a truly European budget.  With regard to the question of enlargement, I will tell you, as a Romanian citizen, and therefore from a country which has enjoyed so many benefits from this enlargement process, that I am deeply convinced that enlargement policy must remain at the heart of European policy. We cannot imagine a strong Europe without remaining open to our neighbours, and in particular those who still believe in Europe, perhaps even stronger than some countries that are within the European Union. Therefore, the doors of the European Union must remain open and Europe must always remain an extraordinary engine for democratic reforms. These countries cannot be asked to carry out reforms without giving them a clear ambition and a clear idea of a European perspective.  I also fully understand the concerns and the will to deepen the European project within its current scope, to reform the European institutions, and that is why we strongly support the conference for the future of Europe, but this must not affect the European ambition to continue the enlargement process. So our doors must remain clearly open.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Philippe Lamberts", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group. Mr President, this gives me a feeling of déjà vu. Even the Brits use French to describe this situation. We've been here before. That was in November 2018. We had a European Council celebrating an agreement with the then British Prime Minister. We know what the British Parliament failed to do with that Agreement.  So we are back in the same place with a variant of that Agreement. Now everything is in the hands of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The British Parliament must make up its mind. Either it ratifies - and I insist it ratifies, not express broad agreement - this Agreement and then indeed our Parliament will do its job. I cannot imagine, Mr President of the Council, that the Council will not allow this Parliament to have the time needed to complete the ratification. I know that the Heads of State and Government have a lot of respect for this Parliament. Even if we have frictions sometimes, I know that there's mutual respect and I want to keep it that way.  (Applause) Now, it can also be that the British Parliament refuses to ratify this Agreement, and in that case I would just say one thing: If you are unable or unwilling to do it, dear colleagues of the British Parliament, then you must have the guts to put either this Agreement or the Agreement concluded between the European Union and Theresa May to a popular vote and let the people decide. (Applause) And I would say that actually this is the only certain way to get to a decision because we know that, either way, we will have a British choice, and we will respect this choice. We will fight for the United Kingdom to remain, but if a majority accepts the Agreement, we will respect that and part ways in a friendly way. I would like to say a few words on the issue of enlargement. For us, it is absolutely clear that the Western Balkans are destined to join the European Union. I do not think it is in the interest of anyone, the citizens of these countries, or the citizens of the European Union, to leave these countries in limbo, which we know are the best way for these countries to fall outside the zone of democracy and the rule of law. Their vocation to join the European Union is indisputable to us.  The decision taken by the Council - and, Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker, I am pleased to have heard you say this - the refusal to honour our commitments, because it was a matter of respecting our commitments by opening negotiations with Northern Macedonia and Albania, is a reseed, is a fault. This is a serious fault on the part of the European Council, which obviously needed unanimity. I know that the majority of the members of the Council wanted to move forward, but indeed, and Manfred Weber was right to say, it was in particular two heads of state or government who made the decision to block this.  I stress that it was a matter of opening negotiations, not concluding negotiations. The whole argument that the Union must be deepened first is obviously completely misleading, since we know that these accession negotiations will last a long time and leave us plenty of time to deepen the Union, provided of course that there is the political will to do so.  Remember, when Emmanuel Macron was elected, we were celebrating the great European. Perhaps, over the years, the passing of time makes us realize that it may not be that big and not so European.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Nicolas Bay", "mepid": "124760", "text": "  on behalf of the ID Group. - Mr President, Turkey has largely occupied the debates at the last Council meeting. For the past 45 years, it has occupied a part of Cyprus, a Member State which is not defended in the face of the permanent aggression it is subjected to by Turkey, which is increasing illegal drilling in Cypriot territorial waters.  Turkey has carried out illegal military action in recent weeks, in violation of all the rules of international law, in northern Syria. This military action obviously leads to the strengthening of jihadist groups, whether Daesh or Al-Nusra. Yet the European Union has paid out 5.6 billion euros in recent years for migration policy, even as Turkey is mishandled in this control of migration flows and Mr Erdogan is escalating his blackmail by constantly threatening European countries to dump migrant flows.  We have paid out almost EUR 9 billion in the pre-accession funds and today, instead of issuing a few protests, instead of temporarily suspending the process of Turkey's accession to the European Union, it is time, it is urgent to put a definitive end to this accession process. Turkey is not European by its history, culture or geography, and today it demonstrates that it defends interests that are at odds with all our interests of European nations.  The debate in the Council also, of course, focused on the multi-year financial framework. We talked about own resources and obviously talked about taxes as solutions to their own resources: carbon tax, plastic tax. Today, taxation is always heavier with the same pretext: the ecological pretext. But what is the coherence, on the one hand, in having trade agreements lowering tariffs, in multiplying free trade agreements with the whole world with countries that do not meet any of our environmental standards and, at the same time, in adding an extra layer on the tax millefeuille, which will undermine both the global competitiveness of our European companies and deal a severe blow to the purchasing power of our compatriots?  With regard to the European Union budget, we could sum it up this way: to pay more and more to get less and less. My country, France, has contributed almost 100 billion euros over the last twenty years, and for what result today? A reduction in CAP allocations, which will complete or, in any case, seriously weaken French agriculture. A French farmer commits suicide every other day.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The results of the Council last week not only leave many questions unanswered, but also have obviously failed to solve some problems and, quite the contrary, have even worsened the status quo ante on some issues. The discussion on the accession of Northern Macedonia and Albania to the European Union triggered a state and government crisis in northern Macedonia in the Council. In the debate on the multiannual financial framework, figures are being pushed back and forth, and some of the Heads of State or Government obviously do not know how to achieve the ambitious climate targets themselves. However, I am glad that the Council has accepted my group's political assessment and now shares this position that Turkey's military intervention in northern Syria and the war against the Kurds are not covered by international law and are therefore contrary to international law. But if the Council and the Commission already have the same analysis, then I wonder: why do they stop there, why do they not also accept our political demands? Some of them have actually already been mentioned from a political spectrum on which I would not have expected it. We are committed to an immediate halt to arms exports to Turkey and, more importantly, to the recognition of Kurdish self-government! This economic and political pressure on Turkey will protect not only the democratic opposition, but also the Kurds.  And now to Brexit: my group has made a constructive contribution in recent years to finding a solution to this crisis. We will continue to do so. Our priority has always been to secure the peace process in Northern Ireland and protect the social rights of the millions of people affected, and yes, there is now a new deal that is obviously having its difficulties in passing through the House of Commons at the moment. We are waiting for the final negotiation and ratified text from London, and with that, if it comes at all, we will deal thoroughly with the time we need and the time it takes to do so. I can assure you of that on behalf of my group. And if there is no text coming from London, and that could happen in the next few days, I would like to give them the following advice for the decision of the Heads of State and Government on an extension, which is likely to be forthcoming: if you agree to the extension, allow the British people to make another decision.

I think Mr Juncker was correct when he said that no extension should be granted. Regardless of whether there is an agreement or no agreement, the UK should leave, and I also think that it is in the best interest of Europe to let the UK go. The decision that the British people made three years ago was not an enormous surprise. British Euroscepticism has a very long tradition. Since Henry VIII, I think, this has been at the heart of British geopolitical thinking and, since this is a 500—year tradition, I respect it. But Europe and the European Union must also be very clear about the challenges it is facing and must be very clear about its priorities. Europe must face migration, wage inequalities, economic disparities and climate change, and it must come up with a solution. If Europe wants to be successful, it has to get rid of all the obstacles and the post—Brexit fatigue, be very clear about terms and conditions when it comes to new candidate Member States, and it must also be very clear with internal or external saboteurs who are trying to slow the process. So, as far as the UK is concerned, the decision to divorce was taken.

We will have to cope with unpredictable outcomes of the complex process of voting in the British parliament, but it is clear that we will only give consent once the process of ratification in the UK has been finalised. This all has indeed a sense of déjà vu as we do not know today what majorities will emerge during various votes in the House of Commons, and what final result they might produce, and in particular it is difficult to judge today what can come out of the vote on the timetable motion.  It is regrettable indeed that once again we have to cope with a huge dose of uncertainty at this stage of this long journey. My hope is that, unlike the two extensions, the second of which is now coming to an end, the transition period which an orderly withdrawal will offer will be efficiently used to give us, as future close partners, the best possible agreement on unprecedented close future relationship.  Let me finish by underlining that negative coverage of EU citizens’ rights in media, confusing announcements on freedom of movement, use of a secondary level legislation, also what we learned during our hearings with citizens, all that signals the risk that those rights might not be respected in the future.

I want to thank the Conference of Presidents that they have confirmed that the consent procedure in this House will only start after the full ratification by the side of the United Kingdom and that’s important, that was in our resolutions. I think we need to use the time between now and the consent vote to solve the last problems that still exist today which are the rights of the EU citizens that are living in the UK. There are still a number of problems to be solved. There is the vulnerable citizens – 200 000 of them who are in need of assistance. There is those who will miss the deadline, and there one of the members of the UK government has said, oh, we’re going to do deportation. Well, I can tell you this problem needs to be solved in all clarity before, that there is no deportation of these people. There is the difference between a settled status and pre-settled status. What is, in my opinion, not always clear why people are in pre-settled stages are not in settled status with full rights. And there is the Independent Monitoring Authority. It’s not clear in the withdrawal bill how independent the Independent Monitoring Authority will be and we have to be sure that it is a real Independent Monitoring Authority.

Defending Europe is also defending the United Kingdom. And finally, a word from someone who comes from the farwest of Europe for the decision made about the Balkans.

In any case, it is preferable to postpone the output, than a hard Brexit.  But this debate cannot distract us from other priorities. We need an ambitious multiannual financial framework that goes well beyond one per cent of gross national income, as some heads of state and government have pointed out at the summit, including mine. We need to address the challenges associated with migration, climate change and the Digital Agenda.

Given this, I would like to know why Messrs Juncker, Tusk and Barnier feel that it’s okay to meet UK opposition leaders and the likes of Tony Blair in a blatant attempt to interfere in British politics.

But the hourglass has become a time bomb. The succession of postponements of the final decision abysms us to Brexit without agreement and its economic and social and, above all, political effects. There is a political battle against reactionary nationalism based on bulos, misinformation and poisoning, which seeks to make local and regional identities incompatible with state ones and that national identities are incompatible with European ones.  Europe has to give that battle, but that takes resources, and with a budget of 1% of GDP it will not succeed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission, Mr President and with That of President Juncker, I would like to say a word to all those, many of whom have spoken on this difficult issue of Brexit, and thank in particular for their confidence President Weber but also Mrs Garcia Pérez, Dacian Ciolos , Philippe Lamberts and Martin Schirdewan for their support and confidence throughout the last months and years. We have, as President Tusk and President Juncker have said, a great deal of respect for your Parliament. This Parliament must be respected in the serious and important moment we are at in the Brexit process. We have always respected it and it is your Parliament that will have the final say. It is therefore normal for the British Parliament to now take its responsibilities and commit itself first on the basis of the agreement we have negotiated with the British Government and not against it or without it to get what we all want, if it is Brexit, an orderly withdrawal. I repeat and repeat that if the United Kingdom wants an orderly withdrawal that is much better than a disorderly withdrawal, then that agreement is the only way. We think it is legitimate for your Parliament, when it gives its consent, to know unequivocally what the United Kingdom wants, what it wants, what it decides for its own future. We are at a serious and important phase, I repeat, of this long process. Since I have the opportunity, I would like to say to President Donald Tusk but also to his team, to President Jean-Claude Juncker, to all the Commissioners and to President Verhofstadt, to the members of Brexit, my thanks for their confidence.  The mission that Jean-Claude Juncker gave me at the very beginning was to work on a treaty organising the orderly withdrawal, and not anything else. That is what we have accomplished. But this difficult, complex mission - I was not surprised by its complexity - remains a mission for a negotiation that is negative. Brexit is lose-lose. No one, not even Mr Farage, has been able to prove to me or give me any proof of the added value of Brexit. We therefore conducted this negative negotiation by taking it very seriously to respect the British vote, even though we regretted it.  Throughout these three years, we have worked objectively, patiently seeking operational, legally valid solutions to each of the problems posed by Brexit everywhere and for many people.  We have worked with respect for our British partners because, ladies and gentlemen, we have respect and even admiration for the United Kingdom.  We have also worked without being influenced by the turbulence and internal political discussions in the United Kingdom. I have always said that we work without emotion, without passion on this issue, from the facts, the legal bases and the problems created by Brexit to find solutions.  Finally, we have worked with this negotiation in perspective. Brexit is not the end of the story. It is not a destination. We have therefore put this negotiation into perspective, first of all taking into account the peace in Ireland. Every day, every day, we had this demand to do everything to preserve the fragile peace on the island of Ireland. Then we also put into perspective what we were doing in relation to what is our foundation, our foundation, namely the internal market, which is much more than a free trade area, which is an economic and social living space in common and which must be consolidated and strengthened.  We have put this negotiation into perspective, taking into account what has always been the european Parliament's priority and our priority, the security of citizens' rights. Four and a half million people, including one and a half million British citizens living here and at least three and a half million EU citizens living and working in the UK. Mr Verhofstadt, Mrs Hunner, Mrs Fritzson and many others, I have heard your concern. I would remind you that if this agreement is voted on by the British Parliament and by you, the four and a half million people I am talking about will see their rights secure in a sustainable way for themselves and their families. This is the best guarantee for citizens. The United Kingdom is committed to implementing this agreement in a practical way and we must ensure that this will be the case. That is why the concerns you are expressing are important, and there is a need to keep up the pressure with the Member States to ensure that COMMITMENTs made by the United Kingdom are being met.  Then we have always put this negotiation in perspective - since Brexit is not the end of the story - of what we need to rebuild with the United Kingdom. Here we unravel 44 years of integration and cooperation. The British will leave more than 600 international agreements. We are not going to stop there. The United Kingdom remains where it is, our friend, our ally, our partner and therefore we must rebuild.  Mr Farage is no longer here, unfortunately, but I was surprised by what he said earlier, explaining that this agreement paved the way for three more years of negotiations. But, of course, we're going to have to negotiate! Beyond Brexit and separation or divorce, we will have to renegotiate for a year, two years, three years, maybe more, in some areas, to rebuild everything that has been decoupled by the will of those who supported Brexit. We will have to rebuild a balanced trade agreement with so-called rules of the game to avoid the risks that exist from tax, social, environmental or consumer dumping. We will have to rebuild a relationship in terms of university cooperation, Erasmus, research, police and judicial cooperation, security, defence, foreign policy, all these areas where we need to work with the United Kingdom in a new context and in a new political framework.  This is what lies ahead and what the European Commission, as President Juncker and The President-elect, Mrs von der Leyen, intended, is preparing by organising its own services. I would like to conclude with a note earlier from Mr van Orden, who said: 'There are the lessons of Brexit'. Of course, here we are talking about the consequences of Brexit. They are innumerable, they have often been underestimated, particularly in the United Kingdom, and we are dealing with them. But there are the lessons of Brexit. Why did 52% of Britons vote against Europe? I have always recommended, as a politician, that we take some time to think about this issue because it concerns us in the 27 countries of the European Union. In these lessons, there is a lesson that Mr. Farage and his friends have sometimes forgotten. It is that we must tell the truth to the citizens before they vote. It is our responsibility to tell the truth to the citizens.  (Applause) But behind the Brexit vote, there is also a social anger that has been expressed, the feeling sometimes that Europe is not sufficiently protecting the rejection of this deindustrialization, the need for protection and reform. This is the positive agenda, which is far more important than Brexit. What I am saying, because I can testify to this, is that it is exactly the wish and commitment of Mrs von der Leyen and her new team to focus now on this new positive agenda.  But I also mean - having had the privilege and honour of being by his side during these three years and of remaining naturally his friend for a long time - that this is the commitment of President Juncker and his team of Commissioners. Today, when I say goodbye, I must say that for me it has been and remains a great privilege to have been by his side, and I want to say my thanks for his trust. I know that he and his team have begun to focus on what is more important than anything, beyond Brexit, which is to commit to a positive agenda for Europe and for European citizens.

I wanted to thank you whole and heart out because having the confidence of this House, being able to rely on the confidence of European elected representatives reflecting European democracy, is an honour for everyone that lasts.

Apart from the British Commissioner - I had two British Commissioners, one more excellent than the other - all the Commissioners were elected, either at the national level or at the European level. I wanted the Commissioners to be well-known faces, in their country or in Europe. I had invited them not to lock themselves in Brussels, not to wall up in the Berlaymont, but to circulate, to explain, to dialogue with other elected officials and with public opinion and therefore citizens. Over the course of these five years, we have organized 1,815 citizen dialogues. And the commissioners attended and visited national parliaments and regional parliaments 911 times. At the beginning of my mandate, I promised you that the Commission would focus on the essentials, 'to be big on big', and I wanted, we wanted, to put an end to the legislative inflation which, until then, characterized the Commission's action. We did so because we introduced 84% fewer legislative initiatives than previous Commissions. We withdrew 142 legislative proposals and modernized 162 existing laws. Who's doing better? We have done everything we can to achieve what we promised, but that does not prevent everyone from continuing the game of blaming the Commission for being too sprawling, taking care of everything. Prejudice has a tenacious life in Europe. Everything has changed, but we act as if nothing has changed. When I appeared before you, I had three watchwords which I wanted them to dictate the commission's conduct: growth, employment and investment. We are experiencing the 25th consecutive quarter of growth. We have had seven years of growth in the European Union. We have created 14 million jobs. Unemployment is the lowest since 2,000. 241 million Europeans are at work, representing an employment rate of 73.9%.  The Juncker plan has generated investments of around 432 billion euros. At first, when it was thought that this plan would remain a failure, there was some talk in the air about the Juncker plan. Now that it is a success, we are talking about the European Strategic Investment Fund. So goes the story! One million jobs have been created as a result of this plan. In addition, we gave another reading grid stability and growth pact by flexibilizing some of its provisions. We have done so against the will of many Member States, which have never formally approved the lines of flexibility from which we have enriched the Stability Pact. However, the result is there: deficits have increased from 6.6% to 0.7%. This wise, thoughtful and intelligent flexibilization of the Stability Pact allowed us to respond when Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece called for us to act on their behalf. I have experienced disappointments and successes in my mandate, my dear friends. Disappointments because, despite our efforts, we have failed to move the issue of Cypriot reunification forward. Again, time has been wasted. We have not been able to conclude a treaty with Switzerland, despite our efforts, which were numerous and intense. We have not been able to perfect the banking union. Not for lack of proposals from the Commission, but thanks to or because of the non-effort of the Member States. However, if we do not complete the banking union properly, by making the Economic and Monetary Union a banking union that characterizes monetary unions all over the world, we will not be prepared to react to the next shock, whether internal or from outside. One of the things that needs to be done is our strong obligation to put in place a deposit guarantee system. Without a deposit guarantee, no banking union and no perfect banking union, no more economic and monetary union. You have to be able to respond to these challenges. But we have also had success, despite the polycrise we have had over the past five years. I do not dare to say successes because I would not want to be complacent, although I do want to. But we have had successes. First, I want to mention the social dimension of the European Union. As an unloved child over the past decades, we have been able to adopt the European Social Rights Foundation. I remember that when I first appeared before this Parliament, as a young labour minister, during a Luxembourg presidency of the Council of the Union, this speech was already my speech at the time. Even before we approved the European Social Rights Foundation, we had put the Detachment of Workers Directive back on the job. And contrary to expectations, we have managed to bring Parliament and Council to an agreement. It seems to me, however, a success of this Commission in establishing in principle the fact that, for the same job and for the same job, one should have the same salary. The dignity of the workers was at that price. Moreover, if we think we can build Europe, make it prosper, without the assent of those who work, we are seriously mistaken. Europe must also be that of the workers. Another success, it seems to me: Greece. I talk about it because it has been very busy and concerned about me. We have restored Greece's dignity. Too often and too long the dignity of the Greek people has been trampled upon and I have wanted to restore order by giving back to this people all the titles of nobility they deserve. The wanted to prevent the Commission from acting on Greece's behalf. I remember the long nights with the Samaras, Tsipras and now Mitsotakis governments - he was not yet in business - where we tried to solve the Greek problem. Many governments did not want the Commission to deal with it. I will always remember the phone calls from several prime ministers who said, \"Take care of your business. It is the business of the states to deal with the Greek problem.\" I had this naïve, but fair, view that we should respect the treaty. And the treaty says that the Commission is in charge of the general interest of Europe. It was in the public interest to avoid the decomposition of the eurozone and so we were right to do what we did. Africa, yes. As Europeans, we cannot forget our first neighbours: they are African. It is a continent that needs our solidarity. But not just our charity. Charity is an ancient reflex of Europeans, whereas today it is a question of establishing a true partnership of equals between Africa and Europe. Investing in Africa, creating jobs in Africa, must be the \"leitmotif\" of our action, and we must not see Africa through the prism of the refugee crisis alone. It is to hurt Africans in their honour to consider relations with Africa only with refugees in mind. But let's do what we need to do on the spot so that the unfortunate don't throw themselves into the oceans. Refugees, yes - success or not? The balance sheet is better than we would think, but it could be even better if the Council, as Parliament has done, had followed all the proposals that the Commission had submitted to the co-legislator's meditation. A first part on relocation in March 2015 and another in April 2016 on the reform of the Dublin system. But let us not forget that, thanks to Europe, we have been able to save 760,000 lives in the Mediterranean. 760,000 fewer deaths as a result of the action that was that of Europe. I said in March 2015 what we were going to do about refugees. And Parliament applauded me standing up. I said at the time: today you applaud me, are you sure that in two years you will always applaud me? The applause was thinner years later, because in many countries domestic politics took over the elemental solidarity that should have been ours. I was very busy, whereas I didn't think about it when I became head of the Commission, international trade. A difficult subject, highly controversial in all our countries, with often good arguments against hasted trade agreements. But we have changed that. We have 15 international trade agreements. We now have trade agreements with 60 countries, which reflects 40% of the total wealth. Trade agreements help us to be present on the international stage at a time when the United States is turning its back on multilateralism and thus organized solidarity with others. Wir messen auch 'ber die Rolle Europas in der Welt reden. Der grete europeische Erfolg, die grete Leistung bleibt die Tatsache, dass wir den Frieden in Europa erhalten konnten. Das klingt alles so selbstverst-ndlich, ist es aber nicht. Es gibt heute, ich ich yesterday spreche, 60 Kriege weltweit. Kein einziger Konflikt kriegerischer Natur findet auf dem Territorium der European Union statt, dem Territorium, das der Schauplatz der blutigsten kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen in den vergangenen Jahrhunderten, sogar noch im letzten Jahrhundert war. Frieden ist nicht selbstverst-ndlich, und wir sollten stolz darauf sein! (Beifall) Nun ist mir bewusst, dass man junge Menschen nicht mit dem Thema begeistern kann, dass Europa den Frieden erh-lt - denken wir. Aber man muss, wenn man mit jungen Leuten redet, auch 'ber dieses ewige europeische kontinentale Dilemma zwischen Krieg und Frieden reden. Man braucht nur in die direkte Nachbarschaft der European Union zu blicken, um zu sehen, wie gef-hrlich die international Lage ist, und damit auch, wie fragil die Lage der European Union ist. Jungen Menschen muss man von Krieg und Frieden erz-hlen. In 20 Jahren wird es keine Europàer mehr geben, deren Groevàter oder Urgroevàter den Krieg gekannt haben. Also muss man dar-ber reden, sonst geret in Vergessenheit, was Krieg bedeutet. Und deshalb rede ich auch mit jungen Menschen immer wieder über das Thema Krieg und Frieden. Aber es reicht nicht als Erklurung. Jungen Menschen muss man Europa auch perspektivisch, von der Zukunft her erklàren. Was ist denn die Zukunft Europas? Wir sind der kleinste Kontinent. Die meisten Europeer wissen das berhaupt nicht. Wir sind sehr klein als Europeischer Kontinent. Politik - das ist der Stoff, mit dem Demografie und Geografie zusammengebracht werden messen. Es gibt keine Politik, die Geografie und Demografie nicht in den Blick nimmt. Wir sterben aus, wir werden nicht verschwinden, aber wir werden immer weniger. Am Anfang of 20. Jahrhunderts waren 20% der Weltbev-lkerung Europàer, am Ende dieses Jahrhunderts wird es nur 4% European von zehn Milliarden Menschen geben. Wir werden wirtschaftlich an Kraft einbàen, massiv an Kraft einbàen. In einigen Jahren wird kein einziger EU-Mitgliedstaat noch Mitglied der G7-Gruppe sein, die sowieso verschwinden sollte, weil G20 wichtiger als G7 ist. Wer angesichts dieser nicht umkehrbaren Entwicklung noch denkt, jetzt wre der Moment gekommen, um weniger Europa auf die Tagesordnung zu setzen, um uns wieder in national Einzelteile zur-ckzuverlegen, der irrt sich fundamental. Europa bedeutet Frieden, Europa bedeutet aber auch Scharke angesichts des sinkenden Einflusses, den wir in der Welt haben. Deshalb messen wir auch in Fragen der Auenpolitik zu belastbareren Regelungen und Entscheidungsfindungswegen kommen. Ich plediere noch einmal dafar, dass wir auch in Fragen der Auenpolitik mit qualifizierter Mehrheit im Rat entscheiden - nicht in allen Fragen, aber doch sleeps, wo es darauf ankommt, dass Europa Farbe bekennt. (Beifall) Ich habe ein Erlebnis der besonderen Art in Washington gehabt. Ich war am 25. Juli letzten Jahres bei President Trump, um 'ber die Vermeidung des sich anbahnenden Handelskrieges zu reden, was uns auch gelungen ist. Wieso ist uns das gelungen? Trump hat mir in einer langen Einf-hrung - das mag er - geschildert, wer alles schon in diesem saa und was er denen gesagt hat: Kanzler - es gibt mehrere davon, Premierminister, Presidenten, und er hat gesagt, dass er denen doch schon alles erklart habe. Ich sage, das reiche nicht, er msse Europa das auch erklàren. Und dann sagt er: Wieso? Ich wise: weil die Kommission allein zust-ndig ist fer Handelsfragen. Alles, was die anderen sagen, so tàchtig sie auch sein màgen, zàhlt nicht. Es zehlt yesterday, was der President der Kommission im Namen der European Union vorbringt. Das hat ihn sehr beeindruckt und mich noch mehr. Denn wenn man als Luxemburger in Washington sitzt und sagt: \"I am the man\" - it's unheard of. Schlussfolgerung: Ich scheide aus dem Amt - nicht betr-bt, auch nicht 'berm-ig gl'cklich, aber in dem Gef-hl, mich redlich bem-ht zu haben. Und wenn sich alle redlich bem-hen wurden, wre einiges besser. Ich war stolz darauf, w-hrend langer Zeit, vor allem in den letzten fenf Jahren, ein kleines Teilchen eines gràeren Ganzen zu sein, das wichtiger ist als wir. Take care of Europe and fight with all your might stupid and narrow-minded nationalisms. Long live Europe!

Today is the time to say goodbye. A great European will leave the European stage in the coming weeks. It is Jean-Claude Juncker. We, as Christian Democrats, bow. We would like to thank you, dear Jean-Claude, for your life achievement. And when I talk about life achievement, it's not just these five years. As a 36-year-old finance minister, you had already discussed the fundamentals of monetary union. You had negotiated the Dublin compromise between Germany and France. I do not know how many times you, as a Luxembourger, have had to negotiate compromises between Germany and France, and you were the one who brought the Treaty of Lisbon to life, especially the democratisation of Europe. Whatever the way forward with democratic Europe, together with Martin Schulz, you remain the founder of this democratic Europe. You can be proud of that. Your central talent is finding compromise. In your political career, you have settled thousands of disputes and reconciled countless people with each other. And you described it: Even Donald Trump couldn't escape your way of compromise. You called your commission \"the Commission of last chance.\" Five years ago, you faced many crises, and during your tenure, unfortunately, God's more were added: Brexit, the migration crisis – you have touched some. Unfortunately, we cannot choose the tasks we have to perform ourselves, we can only tackle them with courage. And you, together with the entire quorum, seized and seized the opportunity. Your Commission was faced with tasks that could well have been completed five terms, and you answered them together. The 'Commission of Last Chance' has seized this opportunity. Europe is doing better today than it was five years ago: twelve million unemployed, trade agreements, we have achieved a great deal in the fight against terror, we have made significant progress in the migration crisis, we have stretched out Africa's hand, we have now put Brexit on the right track. Thanks to you, Europe is a safer, more prosperous and fairer continent than it was five years ago. Personally, I would like to single out three points that have remained in my mind: firstly, texts, laws are one thing, and people's lives and reality are the other. For example, when we talk about the application of the Stability Pact – you referred to Greece, you referred to Italy and other states: here in recent years we have been able to learn with your way of applying the texts that behind every text there are people, life achievement. To respect that, to take that seriously, to take that up, you have set in motion. (Applause) The second thing that remains in my mind is that many people still describe Europe today as the Europe of money, of the euro, of the market and so on. You have always pointed out that we Europeans do not stand for the market, but for the social market economy. You are the child of a miner. You can probably sing the Steigerlied just as easily as you can talk to business bosses about the future in Davos, and bringing that together is your success. You have put social issues on the agenda for the last five years. Thank you very much for that. Thirdly, you have not compromised on the fundamental values of Europe. Europe, the continent of democracy, of the rule of law. Europe, the continent of equality between men and women, of the protection of minorities – simply a Europe of freedom. You fought for this Europe, you stood up, and you made no compromises both internally and externally. Thank you also for this accent. You have given the idea of Europe a new lease of life, and you have resolutely opposed the populists from left and right. The enormous increase in voter turnout and the growing enthusiasm for Europe in Europe is also your merit. The 'Last Chance Commission' has taken advantage of it, the whole College has taken advantage of it, and we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would like to say thank you for that. Last but not least, Dear Jean-Claude, your Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is proud of your term of office. You saved Europe from great damage in stormy times and made our continent a better place. We are happy to know you in our ranks. The great Christian Democrats such as Helmut Kohl and Wilfried Martens have valued you enormously. They knew that you were standing with Alcide de Gasperi, Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer in the line of the very great Christian Democrats who shaped Europe. In many of your speeches you used to say: Europe is a love affair, so you had described it. I would like to go a step further: it is not just a love affair, because an affair is only very short, meanwhile a real covenant for life has grown between you and Europe. You have a significant part to play in the success of the European Union, in the success of the idea you are fighting for and for which you are burning. As a Christian Democrat, I would like to express my sincere thanks on behalf of your group.

It hasn't been an easy road and you know it well, Mr Juncker. Five years ago, you proposed to us a new agenda: it was called 'A New Beginning for Europe', but that 'new beginning' was halfway there. We are aware that you have tried, you tried to distance yourself from the policy of austerity and rigour imposed on us by Mr Barroso, and that attempt has always had the support of our political family.  The effects of the crisis have weighed heavily and today we have to recognize that we have not been able to make the radical decisions we needed to set a new course. I hope that now, before the new legislature, we will be able to do so.  When you arrived at the Commission, you proposed a battery of measures. It managed to file more than 90% of them, but only half have been approved. The others have stayed in the inkwell and some were fundamental. In many cases, failure is not due to the Commission, but to the lack of cooperation and ambition of governments in the Council.  He promised us a new agenda to create jobs, growth, equality, social justice. It is true that the task was ambitious and not easy. You inherited the effects of Europe's most severe economic crisis since the post-war period, and to that we add an unprecedented migration crisis, which the Member States have managed with a profound lack of solidarity. And the unpleasant surprise of the Brexit... It's not much.  But now the important thing is to know what has failed not to make the same mistakes. You will recognise that you have always kept us by the side in defending the values and interests of the Union. The Social Democrats have acted with responsibility, defending at all times the European project, democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Frans Timmermans' tireless work for common values and principles, his fight against populism and extremism have certainly contributed to the strength of this Commission, and we will continue to demand the same commitment for the next one.  He has also kept us by his side in seeking a solution to the serious migration crisis. We thank you for your efforts to find a proposal based on solidarity and the responsibility of the Member States. It is a pity that we have not succeeded in getting the Council to move a token, but we will continue to work to unlock the Dublin Regulation.  We have been at your side to resist the envites of multilateralism, to defend greater international cooperation, to fairer trade, and to make Europe speak with one voice. You have also had an extraordinary ally on the international stage, with High Representative Federica Mogherini. Not only has it cemented a much-needed new partnership between Africa and the European Union, but it has also delved into a historic agreement with Iran.  What we have not made enough progress on is the reform of the euro area and the economic transformation of the Union. As we demanded five years ago, you launched the European investment plan which has been the seed of the European Green Deal and the sustainable investment plan to be implemented by the next Commission. And in this we strive, if possible, with more energy.  Pierre Moscovici's work has been instrumental in introducing flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact, in response to irrational austerity and absolute rigidity imposed by the right. Mr Moscovici, thank you for your efforts to combat tax evasion and money laundering. It is unacceptable that the Council has rejected so many proposals to improve tax justice, so that large companies pay their taxes, and not just families, workers and small businesses.  Your Commission, Mr Juncker, responded to our demands for a European social pillar, but this is only a starting point: we want this pillar to translate into concrete measures. We want universal access to social protection, strengthen collective bargaining, living wages, eradicate child poverty and reconcile personal and work life.  It is true that improvements have been achieved in equality and today, following the announcement that your Commission has achieved the goal of reaching 40% of women in management positions within the European Commission, which is excellent news, I believe that your Commission could not say goodbye in a better way, because Europe will not be if it is not with its women , with equal opportunities between men and women. This is a very important issue for our political group, and for me personally, and we have to acknowledge and thank the work that has been done on this.  Unfortunately, the conservative forces of the Parliament and the Council have blocked further progress. We don't blame you, Mr Juncker; we praise your European enthusiasm, we thank you for your dedication and your good humour. And I keep the last sentence you have given in this speech: Europe must fight nationalism, because Europe is a project of coexistence, Europe is a project of peace. And today we have to thank him for his efforts; you have our total respect and admiration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Dacian Cioloş", "mepid": "197631", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Mr President of the Commission, dear Jean-Claude, I would like to take this important opportunity to thank you, not only for your work at the head of the Commission, but also for your career as a convinced European. You have given many lessons about what it means to be a true European and I want to thank you for that. Under your mandate, we had to turn the page on the financial crisis, deal with Brexit and the migrant crisis. You have kept European unity and I believe that everyone here, unanimously, thanks you because this unity is the most precious common good. Some had called your Commission the Last Chance Commission. Another Commission is now in place and the anti-Europeans have not achieved the score they had hoped for. The desire to build a Europe that is useful to our citizens remains at the heart of this Parliament.  I hope that we will now have a New Chance Commission. No doubt, not everything has been successful, but much has been accomplished in the years in which you have been head of the Commission. I could cite many concrete examples, but I will focus, in particular, on the Juncker plan, which I do not think we have talked about enough. Initially, it was decried and criticised and yet it made a concrete impact and it showed many small and medium-sized enterprises the face of useful Europe and an efficient Europe, which makes innovative projects possible. You also want a more political Commission, as you said in your speech. I believe that you have paved the way for the following, which will have to be even more political, because it is through politics that we will find European solutions to the concrete problems of Europeans.  We must continue on this path of a strengthened dialogue between the institutions and between the pro-European forces to build step by step this Europe which is at the heart of your commitment.

Mr President, dear Jean-Claude, it is up to me, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to do you justice here after five years in office. Five years ago, like a number of my colleagues, I voted for you as President of the European Commission. I did so when you were the one under whose aegis your country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, had become an opaque financial centre and a tax haven. Perhaps, I thought to myself, that in fact, it is poachers who are made the best gamekeepers.  Between the hard work of Margrethe Vestager and Pierre Moscovici - and let us not forget the hard work and pressure of our Parliament - we can recognise that, during your Parliament, the cause of tax justice has advanced, but it has remained confronted with a major obstacle: the stubbornness of the Member States to refuse any tax harmonisation. You could have circumvented that obstacle by using Article 116 of the treaty, but you did not have that audacity. To be frank, your concern for social justice has often led me to see you as a social democrat who is lost in the EPP group. In this respect, between the revision of the directive on seconded workers, the establishment of a European labour authority or the adoption - although, at this stage, essentially declaratory - of a European base of social rights, all this has been undeniable successes to be put on your own and that of your Commission. Similarly, as colleagues have said, you have adopted a less ideologically narrow application of European rules of economic governance, thus mitigating, somewhat, an austerity that has become deaf and blind to the demand for human dignity. It is undoubtedly this same demand for human dignity that has led your Commission to spare no effort for Europeans to provide a collective and united response to the challenges of asylum and migration, but, in this respect, the Council has blocked any progress - and I regret Mr Tusk's absence - bowing to his obsessive bias of a fortress Europe.  But if your social fibre is undeniable, your environmental conscience still seems to me to be largely built. Our common house is burning. It is burning with a dying climate, collapsing biodiversity and depleted resources. At the heart of this fire, a globalization whose free trade treaties, in their current form, are the driving force behind, treaties that favour capital holders, often improperly called investors, and reduce democratic social, environmental and fiscal norms to the status of decorative accessories, of course non-binding. You would have liked to have concluded such a treaty with the United States, and you said it yourself, you have concluded about 15 with others. Similarly, you have defended a common agricultural policy that is essentially productive, against any climate ambition or for biodiversity.  Contrary to your promises, and here we very much regret it, because you made this promise when you came before our group five years ago, you blocked all progress towards the ban on endocrine disruptors and you did not democratize the authorization of GMOs.  Too often, your Commission has refused to oppose big business in front of it. This is evidenced, for example, by your eagerness to protect trade secrets and, by comparison, your shyness in protecting whistleblowers or confronting the automotive industry, not only with its responsibilities but with its cheating.  We therefore keep a mixed memory of your five years, that of a transitional European Commission which, in the final analysis, has probably failed to fully measure the existential challenges we face.  You told us you were taking over the last chance commission. The result of the European elections in May has fortunately denied you. Your work has contributed to this, but I also believe that the Greens/European Free Alliance have contributed their full part to this. The logic of national preference did not prevail. And, like you, we fight it. That said, the danger is not ruled out. It will be up to the woman who succeeds you, both the President and the new Commission that will succeed you, to take a decidedly different course if, as you want and we want, we want to reconcile all Europeans with the idea of European integration, which is, I recall, the world's first experience of transnational democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 88, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Marco Zanni", "mepid": "124780", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Juncker, five years ago, when you came to this House, I expressed strong doubts as to whether you might be the right person for this European renaissance, but we left you with the benefit of the doubt.

A divided Europe, a weak Europe, a sick Europe that is unable to respond to the modern challenges and the three main problems that european citizens had asked you to solve: the problem of managing migratory flows, the problem of economic growth and the problem of internal security.  Your Commission and your mandate in these five years have failed on all these three objectives and the causes are not to be found outside these institutions. The causes are internal. The causes are the wrong policies that you have pursued, repeating mistakes also made by the previous Commission.  You spoke of your Commission's supposed successes. He spoke of growth, but growth is asphyxiated and Europe is losing ground to the other great powers outside our borders. He didn't talk about deindustrialization. Today, large European companies have gone bankrupt, or no longer operating, and he spoke of his investment plan. He said – assuming they are true – that he has brought 140 billion more investments.

Instead, we had a politics that deepened the divisions and aggravated the problems. The outgoing Commission – your Commission, President Juncker – has embarked on the most sustained pursuit of democratically elected EU governments we have ever seen, and this was a policy of abysmal arrogance and arbitrariness which obviously must have resulted in shocking double standards.

Your climate record, Mr Juncker, is a real denial. You did not make a commitment on this five years ago, and since then the free trade treaties, which you still boast today, have been shovelled. Your record, Mr Juncker, it is not these lives saved, I am thinking first of all of those 16,000 dead in the Mediterranean Sea that are putting the seal of shame on a Europe that has been transformed into a fortress. Your record, Mr Juncker, is finally a democratic lockdown of Europe, still no right of initiative for Parliament, which I hope the next Commission will carry out. Your opponent, in the end, is a bit of a popular expression, and as you have said yourself, there can be no democratic choice against the European treaties. We think the exact opposite. There must be no European treaties without a democratic choice. At the end of your mandate, Mr Juncker, you have finally served the markets and you will not be missed by many of our European peoples and fellow citizens. But since we are committed to social rights, we wish you a great retirement and for that we have a small gift for you. To return to your tax haven, your friends, the multinationals you helped during the LuxLeaks, wish you a happy retirement with this gift.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 91, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Eleonora Evi (NI).", "mepid": "124779", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Juncker, your mandate and that of your Commission are coming to an end, and it is therefore time for budgets and reports.

It may seem like a lot, but it is only 1% of European wealth, and it is still a budget that allows us to finance the European policies which we have all decided and which, after reading this Parliament, will reinforce some of them which we have regarded as priorities. And we are going to strengthen them with 3 billion euros, as much as this narrow financial framework allows us.  And of these 3 billion, almost 2,000 will go towards strengthening the fight against climate change, demonstrating a clear commitment and commitment of this institution to what represents one of the biggest challenges we face. We have strengthened all budget lines related to climate change, from supporting infrastructure projects needed to achieve a decarbonization target to boosting research in future-oriented technologies. As I said, our biggest priority has been to give that impetus to programmes that have to do with climate change, but it has obviously not been the only one. And one more year, we call on unemployed young people to keep alive the Youth Guarantee programme, which neither the Council nor the Commission has deemed worthy of European funds. And we also continue to improve the Erasmus programme so that more students can benefit from it.   Nor have we forgotten our farmers and ranchers, who are victims of a meaningless trade war and are the target of tariffs which we will try to alleviate, if necessary, with the European budget.  And, of course, we also continue to demand more support for the reception of refugees on European territory, but also for countries which, despite their delicate situation, give us an example of daily solidarity with new refugees; and also for those who have been for sixty years, like the Palestinians, who need to survive from the United Nations Agency, UNRAW, which also needs European funding.  In short, we reinforce all the policies that help to design a modern Europe and which have a real impact on the lives of the citizens of the Union. But, as rapporteur on other institutions, I would like to take this time on the floor to value the work they do, because all the policies we put in place from the European Union are not done only because of the work of the Commission, the Council and Parliament. European construction has key allies in these other institutions so that all policies are planned rigorously, with control and taking into account the views of all sectors. It is therefore essential that all institutions have the necessary human, material and economic means, because we would do the European Union a weak favour if we were to defend that cutting its budgets is an example of good economic management, because nothing further from reality. We must continue to support the Committee of the Regions, where our municipalities and regions defend their interests and participate in the development of European legislation with a much closer look.  We need an Economic and Social Committee involved, so that workers' and employers' organisations continue to examine European policies from an economic and social point of view.  We need an agile and effective European Court of Justice, because in the end it is the guarantor of the European rule of law, having the task of interpreting Union legislation, ensuring its application and sanctioning in the event of non-compliance.  And we must continue to provide the necessary means to the European External Action Service, which is not only responsible for the European Union acting in a much more coherent way, but aims at consolidating peace in the world, combating climate change or policies of development and humanitarian aid. And I left the European Parliament for the end. This institution represents more than 500 million Europeans and Europeans and which is the institution with the greatest responsibility. Not only are we a House with legislative and budgetary powers, but we also have responsibility for the supervision and control of other institutions, the European budget and the implementation of Union legislation.  And all the work we do from these institutions is also not possible under the false slogan of \"doing more with less\". We cannot afford to jeopardize your work by cutting your operating budgets, and I will do my best in the forthcoming negotiations with the Council. I look forward to the cooperation of the Council and the Commission in achieving this objective and that it will not happen to us as a every year, we leave it for the last point and we no longer have room for manoeuvre.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 102, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her The Finnish Presidency has just been in the Conference of Committee Presidencies, so that we – both the chairman of the Committee on Budgets and I – were still firmly attached to it. I apologise for this and may now move on to the budget. The 2020 budget: the European Parliament will set clear priorities. Firstly, we want to tackle the issue of climate in an offensive and clear way. The budget proposal focuses on modern research, innovation and new technologies, particularly in the field of science and research, in order to meet challenges that we are still unable to cope with. At the same time, we want to create new jobs, to be competitive in this world and for others not simply to hang on to us or to develop things in a way that we may not want from our point of view either in terms of environmental, economic or social policy. Secondly, we want to give young people the security and support they need, throughout the European continent and throughout the European Union. In other words, support those who live in countries where there is up to 40%, 50% youth unemployment, and, as the European Union, send out a signal that we are not only continuing yEI – strengthening the youth employment initiative – but are formulating clear objectives. We also want to promote the exchange of young people with Erasmus+ and also with interrail tickets for 18-year-old san, because they can then learn from each other, benefit from each other and pursue education with each other. However, we also want to address important issues affecting small businesses that affect digitisation, which concern cancer research and research into the most serious diseases. As a consequence, this means that, in addition to major issues that are currently being formulated in public, we will not forget the issues that are essential for the people of the European Union and for the further development of our Member States. We remain focused on security. Safety is an important signal for people – as we have just seen again in the last two or three weeks. Security cannot be the home of individuals – whether they have money or not in order to be able to afford security. Security must be established by the Member States and by the European Union in cooperation between the Member States and through coordination in the field of cross-border crime. We want to strengthen the common protection of external borders. And what is particularly important to me is that the EEA should be properly equipped. In our view, the plans to set up the EEA to date are not sufficient and need to be significantly strengthened. If the EAA is really to tackle VAT fraud effectively, for example, it means that it must also have the means to do so, and Laura Kövesi should be given the means to finally put an end to the EUR 50 to 100 billion vat evasion or money laundering of a cross-border nature and at least greater successes than we are currently doing. Another item on the agenda is that you are asking us to be careful. I do not know where the Council's caution was when it cut EUR 200 million in AMIF. We must also address the issue of refugees and migrants in such a way that we have sufficient financial resources available in this budget, both within the European Union and outside. Development aid is a very important concern to us. We want to give people opportunities and perspectives. We want to have the opportunity to be able to provide humanitarian aid where it is necessary. If we now look again at the situation in northern Syria, it is imperative that we intervene in a stabilising and supportive manner. The resources you want to give us are not enough for this. And development aid consists not only of humanitarian aid or not only of humanitarian aspects, but also of the climate and the environment, and of the fact that people also want to have a reasonably perspective in their homeland in order to be able to survive. This means that there, too, the focus is on the fact that we care about the environment and the climate. Because people who have no chance to grow up in an orderly home will not stay there either. I would like to be very pleased, dear Advice, that you will finally start talking to us, dear Finnish Presidency: it does not help if we drink coffee with each other but do not actually exchange ideas in terms of content. My wish would be - I join Eider Gardiazabal Rubial as a matter of urgency: Please finally talk we have not yet seen that in terms of content with us. We will not be able to do all this until the last evening of the conciliation procedure, because the time is then far too short to go through things in a truly orderly and careful manner as the citizens of our countries expect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 103, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Kimmo Tiilikainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, it’s an honour for me to attend today the European Parliament’s debate on the draft budget of the European Union for 2020. We have already had an opportunity to exchange views on this important topic, on 18 September when I presented to you the Council’s position on the draft budget. On that occasion, I emphasised that we have to establish a budget that brings European added value and delivers tangible results for our citizens. But, at the same time, we need to prioritise the areas of expenditure that are pivotal for reaching our common goals. I am pleased to say that the European Parliament and the Council share the same priorities for next year’s budget. At the heart of these priorities are growth, employment and innovation, the need to rise to the climate challenge, to tackle the key areas of migration and security, and to help young people invest in their future. Where we differ is on what should be considered an appropriate level of funding for these important priorities. It is the art of budgeting to balance priorities. It’s true that citizens highly appreciate the public goods financed by the EU budget. However, we shouldn’t forget that these same citizens are also taxpayers, who want the budgetary authority to be careful with the global level of expenditure. In this context, I note that if the European Parliament’s amendments were to be integrated in the final budget for next year this would lead to an increase in the GNI contributions of 9.9% in relation to 2019. In its actions, the Council is always guided by considerations of prudence and strict budgetary discipline. Both from an internal and an international perspective, the times we are living in are challenging and uncertain. We are witnessing a number of climate challenges, disruptions in trade patterns, economic uncertainties, international tensions and technological changes. That is why the Council wants the budget for 2020 to be realistic but with sufficient margins to cater for unforeseen needs. Let me stress once again, however, that, according to the Council’s position, the budget for 2020 represents an increase of EUR 1 billion against the 2019 budget. Allow me now to make some preliminary remarks on the amendments to the Council’s position that Parliament intends to vote on tomorrow. In several headings, Parliament has proposed significant increases, which are meant to boost a number of programmes and projects. Some of these proposals go beyond not only the draft budget but also beyond the ceilings of the Multiannual Financial Framework. We should be careful to avoid over—budgeting. As co-legislators, we have to take into account actual needs and absorption capacities, and take decisions grounded in reality. This year, the overall gap between our respective positions is bigger than in previous years: EUR 4.2 billion in commitments and EUR 6 billion in payments. Nonetheless, I’m convinced that, working together, we will be able to bridge this gap and reach a balanced and reasonable agreement on the budget for 2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 104, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to begin by conveying to the two rapporteurs, Mrs Hohlmeier and Mrs Gardiazabal Rubial, the Commission's thanks for the valuable work done by hand and in terms of content, and also the respect for the quality of their work – as they have summarised here the various expectations from the political groups, from the committees in their report.  The priorities of the Council, Parliament and the Commission are the same. Firstly, growth for jobs and jobs and for the EU's competitiveness, strengthening the protection of our climate and environmental policy, promoting young people and managing migration with respect for human dignity. We have differences in the level of equipment of the programmes. While Parliament wants to deviate from the Commission's proposal by EUR 2.7 billion upwards, in other words, proposes a stronger budget, the Council wants to reduce the appropriations for commitments by EUR 1.5 billion. I could say now that I feel very comfortable in this centre, and I am happy to have a matter-of-fact discussion with you in the coming weeks about the usefulness of overspending or cuts along programmes and projects. We see ourselves here as a fair broker and service provider for the two budgetary authorities, the Council and Parliament. At EUR 4.2 billion, the difference is relatively large compared to previous years. It was lower in previous years. This does not necessarily have to lead to more difficulties in the conciliation phase, but it may be that it will be more difficult for you and us in November. It would be even more difficult if the UK were to go without an agreement. As of today, the probability of this is not too high. We are prepared for this, but only if there is agreement – which we all do not hope – if there is no orderly exit or an extension of membership, would it come immediately after parliament and the rapporteurs. I welcome the aforementioned willingness to compromise and cooperate, and we will all be ambitious in reaching an agreement as juncker commission in the phase by mid-November. It is a sign of European action. What could be the most difficult issues and points of contention? In some programmes and measures, Parliament goes well beyond the Commission's proposal. This can be fully understood in some programmes. Nevertheless, we should exercise a certain degree of caution, because if the margins are now fully exploited, there would not be enough flexibility in the implementation of the budget in the course of next year to respond financially appropriately to surprising, unforeseeable events – the new task of migration. We can certainly reduce the margins that we have proposed somewhat, but to make full use of them would mean that Parliament next year in particular does not have any current responsiveness in the budget. The Council has cut funding for programmes such as Horizon 2020, the Connecting Europe Facility and COSME, and I think there are good arguments against this. I would like to talk to you in the Council about whether, in these three programmes, cuts are appropriate in the first place, especially in the digital age, when we have a dip in the European economy, where a number of Member States are stagnating, where we tend to fall behind the United States and China in terms of innovation, where we should do more together in the field of research and development, especially in the digital age. The red pencil for research, infrastructure and SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – seems to me to be in the wrong place. We will analyse the proposed increases and then report back if we believe that increases are not feasible in implementation, so that they are basically more likely to remain theory and cannot be implemented in practice. A sensitive point could be the application of Article 15(3) of the Financial Regulation. We remember that, during the budget discussions, during the conciliation period as the Commission, we made the proposal – in order to realise some of Parliament's requests for additional expenditure – to allow for a moderate level of redeployment in the field of research. The Council was surprised at the time – true, it was surprising – this time we proposed it publicly back in May. I know from national and regional budgetary policy for many years the instrument of transferability of funds from the previous year to next year – that is, unused funds of the past for meaningful measures of the future. It is recognised in the Financial Regulation as an instrument, and the The legal basis for this was created a few years ago by the Council and Parliament. My request to the Council would be: let us argue about the amount that the instrument would generally reject, I believe, make it much more difficult this time to reach an agreement between the two Houses.  Parliament is proposing a significant increase of EUR 363 million in the Youth Employment Initiative. We will look into this; We can tell you that the measures to get young people into work are now running smoothly, our administrations have gained enough experience, have been successful. Nevertheless, we believe that this amount does not meet the necessary needs, but rather is set a little too high. We will then demonstrate this in the course of the discussions, Member State by Member State, on demand. Migration management is another priority: we must ensure that the Commission can continue to finance actions in the Member States at the external borders. The funds are therefore needed directly. Every artificial reserve makes us less able to act. It is precisely the difficult events of the last few days in Turkey and Syria that show that the EU should be able to act very, very quickly, even with budgetary resources. Another point of discussion will be pre-accession aid to Turkey. We all agree on what we are very critical of the Ankara government policy and the work and rhetoric of the President of Turkey. That is why I want to make a proposal to you once again: let us only discuss – but then finance – projects that fit the European order of values that are in civil society, those in non-governmental institutions that make sense for democracy and the rule of law. It would be good to implement the programmes, which are in our common sense – as far as they are still possible – with the people of Turkey – not with the government – next year also financially– no more and no less. This should be a strategic interest of the European Union. Again, if we put large amounts in reserve, this makes activation and rapid implementation much more difficult. I would like to mention once again that, in the context of conciliation, we must also respond to the letter of amendment to the 2020 draft adopted by the Commission last week. We are talking about an increase of EUR 16.4 million in commitment appropriations and a reduction of EUR 5.4 million in payment appropriations. It is a question of having a now-current condition for agricultural expenditure, which has taken account of market developments, but also of new legal decisions – laws – in the agricultural sector. Secondly, there are some adjustments following recent developments concerning the new Innovation Fund, Parliament's establishment plan, the security of the European External Action Service and the needs of the eu-LISA agency. I think that, in the current situation, with the likely withdrawal of the United Kingdom, in the last weeks of the Juncker Commission and with a new Parliament, it would be a shining sign if we could get along within the time provided for by law and present an agreement on a 2020 budget to our citizens in mid-November. This presupposes a willingness on the part of all sides, including the Commission – which I can offer you – but also the Council and Parliament. With this in mind, I look forward to the discussions in November, which I would have liked to have transferred to my colleague Mr Hahn, but now that we have to sit down, you must once again make do with me.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 105, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Kathleen Van Brempt", "mepid": "5729", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. – Mr President, when it comes to international trade, the implementation of trade agreements is key, and that goes in particular for the sustainable development chapter within the trade agreements.

When we think about these commitments, it’s about eradication of child labour, freedom of association, fighting climate change, commitments on gender equality and, of course, human rights. Sufficient funding is also needed to draft impact assessments on a regular basis.

If we have a problem with youth unemployment in our Member States, we must not only address this by creating a fund into which we will now permanently 'put' money into, but we must focus on starting to eliminate the causes of youth unemployment in individual Member States. We should also start using data more, because if, for example, 300 people take part in a 'fast-growing' project in Eurofund retraining projects, that does not mean that these people are employed. And practice shows us that they will not be employed, but will return to the oysters, for example. I am now talking about socially excluded Roma communities. And that's the last thing I want to say.

It is said everywhere that there is a climate emergency, that young people are mobilizing in the streets. However, the draft budget that you are proposing is below the commitment you made years ago.

Two billion euros for 500 million Europeans, that's four euros per European.

The amendments we put in were agreed across the FEMM Committee, and they deal with very important issues in relation to gender violence and particularly, for example, in relation to women in IT, because what we do know is that there is a huge gender gap emerging there, and we need to consider that very seriously.

My first question: do you think Horizon 2020, a research programme, is not important? Do you think this program has no absorption capacity? The Commission's figures benumber any difficulty in absorbing this programme. How is it acceptable to cut into the Connecting Europe Facility, cut into important funds for integration? How can you also cut back on a successful programme such as the Juncker Plan, EFSI? A posture you don't understand. Another question for the Council: there are EUR 280 million that have not been used, which has not been given authorisation and which can be used for research. It is flexibility, it is 15.3 and the question is: is the Council available to use this flexibility, to use the possibility that what has not been used could be used in the field of research?  The European Union budget has enormous added value. It's small, but it's very important. All citizens should know that only 7% is for operating expenses. 93% of this budget is for investment, an investment that is essential, where all Member States benefit from the budget.  I expect the Council's readiness for an agreement. But with this attitude, I see that there will be a great difficulty for Parliament to reach an agreement with the Council which it always seeks to reduce and which then says it needs margins.

Today, it is not a question of winning the moon, it is about saving the earth or saving humanity on earth. Why are we not more ambitious in our budget? We're talking about Green New Deal, in reference to Roosevelt's New Deal. Very well. But Roosevelt gave himself the means of his New Deal, which created millions of jobs. When he came to power, Roosevelt tripled the federal budget in four years. Then, a few years later, to win the war, he multiplied the U.S. budget fourfold. Roosevelt is old and paralyzed, but he will multiply the federal budget by 12 by financing it through fair taxation and intelligent use of central bank money. There was no disaster. Were Kennedy and Roosevelt crazy? Did Kennedy and Roosevelt ruin their country? No, of course not. We all remember that they were visionary and courageous leaders.  And we, Europe, what are we waiting for, my friends? What are we waiting for? Building a real budget is not that complicated. I remember what Jacques Delors said to find new resources. It is possible to have a more ambitious budget without asking member states for their efforts, without asking citizens for their efforts. When I was a kid, the income tax was 45%! Now, because of European tax competition, it has fallen to 20%. Jacques Delors said that a European tax on profits was needed. Even with a tax of only 5% on average, and without affecting small businesses, we could have an additional $100 billion budget to save the climate and create massive jobs in all of our territories.

And since I do not live in any bubble like some members of this Parliament who think that the European Parliament and the European institutions are detached from reality, but many of us, unlike them, travel and, unlike them, read, for example, the European Union budget and read the auditors' reports, then perhaps we know that there is a need to increase the programme or money for the GSA by EUR 2.43 million.

The Stability and Growth Pact is an impediment to investment in the future. I genuinely believe that the European Union budget is a small aspect of an overall challenge that we have to face.

This will form the basis for a letter of feasibility that we will present to you in a few days' time, which will then, as I said, include and evaluate both Parliament's amendments following your decision tomorrow in this House and the Amendments proposed by the Council, which we have already received.

I found Mr Wallace's speech very exciting and I will shortly mention it. The question is: is economic growth inherently bad for climate protection and environmental protection? I deny that. I can imagine growth in the European economy that cannot be achieved against climate protection, but even for climate protection or at least in a climate-neutral manner. I have only two thoughts on this: the entire service sector in which we care for people; if we strengthen education and training, if we strengthen child-rearing and care, this can create growth, but it has absolutely nothing to do with emissions, with chimneys, with CO2 greenhouse gases. That is why the question of where the economy and the world of work should grow is always important. Secondly, if we take the issue of energy and advocate more wind power – including in Ireland – and want even more: wind turbines need steel, aluminium, copper and concrete. The question now is how steel, copper, aluminium and concrete are produced: in modern steel mills, highly efficient, environmentally friendly or through imports from overseas from old steel mills, with price dumping and more emissions. I would therefore ask you to accept that economic growth, GDP growth, is not one-to-one with increases in CO2 emissions. Let me remind you that the European Union has grown significantly in recent decades, and yet CO2 emissions have fallen significantly – not enough, but have fallen significantly. The decoupling of emissions and the growth of the economy is possible. We can prove this. Finally, we must want growth, at least where regions of Europe are still significantly underdeveloped. I wish regions in the rural areas of Bulgaria, in the eastern part of Croatia, the same social prosperity as the citizens of Dublin or Stuttgart. Anything else would be unsolicited. That is why growth policy remains part of our cohesion, infrastructure and research policy. The decoupling of climate-damaging emissions is nevertheless associated and possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 186, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Kimmo Tiilikainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I listened carefully to the arguments raised during this lively debate and took note of our differing views.

First of all, I would like to refer to the words of Mr Krah, who has stressed national competence so much that Europe does nothing and that there is alienation from the citizen. Have you ever looked at the budget headings that we are strengthening? Have you ever looked at the fact that concrete cancer research of an interdisciplinary nature is involved with cross-border work by universities and corresponding higher education institutions? Have you ever looked at the research of fuel cells? Have you dealt with the interoperability of energy systems, with the steel industry, to which the Commissioner referred, which is now researching the fact that the CO2 emitted in the steel industry is used for the production of raw materials within the chemical industry, so that there can be a carbon-neutral steel industry? All this is concrete, and if you believe that the climate impacts are not then, then I can only tell you that if we carry out such research, then they will benefit others and then it will have an impact on the whole world and not just on Europe.  That is our goal, that we are modern, competitive, that we are climate-oriented, that we are environmentally friendly, that we carry out research with which we are globally competitive. That is the goal we want to achieve together, that we can combine things in a meaningful way. And, frankly, I would like to see a little less stoic response of an even nature, and I would like to see a joint commitment. Of course, we as a Parliament know that we must also be willing to compromise, but somehow the Council's movement must move a little more towards a forward movement of at least millimetres.

The first concerns under-spending on youth programmes and should be replaced in the future. After all, it is young people who will be responsible for our states and the Union in the future. The priority of each budget must be to increase funding for good education for young people and for the creation of new jobs. It's a pity that this is not always the case. Erasmus+, for example, remains highly valued and highly popular; the number of applications submitted under it far exceeds the available funds. This should be replaced by more funding so that more people can benefit from this programme. Another very important matter is the need to increase the funding of the European Labour Authority (EDI). This should become a priority for the Union, as the youth unemployment rate reached 14.2% in April 2019 and remains unacceptably high and is particularly serious in most of the new EU Member States.

We are today discussing the last discharges from that year.  The decentralised agencies are highly visible in the Member States and have a direct impact on the daily lives of the Union’s citizens. This is especially the case for the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The refugee crisis has shaken Europe from 2015 and even though, in the light of statistics, the crisis seems to be under control we still have to ensure the durability of our asylum system to avoid new crises from being born in the future.  That is exactly why the money spent from the EU budget has to be used efficiently and any fraud in the use of public money has to be prevented. Unfortunately, in the case of EASO, this was not the fact for the financial year 2017. The European Court of Auditors issued an unqualified audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts and on the legality and regularity of the revenue and the payments underlying the accounts for all agencies in 2017 except for the payments of EASO. We do regret that the Court issued an adverse opinion for EASO’s payments. The matters which led the Court to issue this opinion were mainly related to non-compliance of payments on public procurement and recruitment procedures. Therefore, in March 2019, the European Parliament decided to postpone granting discharge to the Executive Director of EASO for the financial year in question and to postpone the closure of the accounts for that year. As the discharge authority, the Committee on Budgetary Control proposes, after an almost unanimous vote, to finally refuse the discharge of EASO for the financial year 2017. The following issues were taken into consideration: first, the findings of OLAF regarding irregularities surrounding the breach of procurement procedures, misappropriation of union funds, mismanagement, abuse of position in human resources issues, breaches of data protection rules, harassment and inappropriate behaviour towards staff; second, the systematic nature of non—compliance has demonstrated an inadequate internal control system; and third, the combined error from non—compliant payments amounted to at least EUR 7.7 million, corresponding to 10.3% of the total payments made by EASO in 2017.  In addition, we must highlight that the budget for the financial year 2017 was implemented under the supervision of the Office’s previous management and that this report concerns the discharge procedure for that year. However, we do acknowledge EASO’s new management’s commitment to ambitious reforms. We recognise the progress made on the implementation of internal control systems. All in all, we cannot compromise good governance and sound financial management of the EU budget. I hope that this Parliament will not do that. With such grave findings as the case of EASO in 2017, refusing to grant discharge is the only way forward.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to begin by thanking Mr Sarvamaa, who was rapporteur, for his valuable work. I believe that he has fully examined and dealt with the EASO issue and the 2017 financial year. Firstly, EASO plays a key role in our European migration policy and in the area of advising Member States on their migration policy. EASO makes a very valuable contribution to the construction of a European asylum system. And we are in the middle of it and we want to take further steps in which EASO will play a more ascending role. And in doing so, we must rely on trust and solidarity on the ground. EASO is a partner of the Member States, supporting their asylum systems, which are faced with a high number of asylum applications. EASO is also an important service provider for the rapid relocation of migrants who voluntarily accept Member States. In order to ensure the convergence of national asylum systems, EASO has developed standards for reception conditions that should apply throughout Europe. Member States have the right and are also taking advantage of EASO's expertise, for example on the situation in the countries of origin, where EASO can provide comprehensive information. The importance of this agency's work is one of the reasons why the Commission takes the issue of EASO governance and past problems very seriously. It is about the authority of EASO, which is necessary. We, as the Commission, have been following eASO's situation very closely since 2016 and support efforts to improve the governance and functioning of the Agency, to learn from mistakes and to remedy them, with particular emphasis on recruitment, procurement, budgeting and auditing procedures, as well as on internal governance. We have actively supported and advised the management of EASO to address past shortcomings, in particular on the issue of the budget, budget implementation, procurement and recruitment. We will continue to do so. However, one thing must be clear to all of us: we have two types of agencies in the European Union. One is an executive agency, which is ultimately part of the Commission's role, where supervision is clarified. And we have decentralized agencies, which are exactly the same as european secondary law. The legal structure is just as wanted, and the Commission is only very, very limited in its responsibility here. The main responsibility is the Management Board, which includes representatives of all Member States – the Commission has only two seats in it – and the management itself is primarily responsible. Basically, these decentralised agencies are somewhere in the triangle between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, and there is no clear supervision, clear supervision, a clear supervisory role, a clear legal oversight. In view of my experience over the last ten years and just before I left the House, I also want to propose to the Council: I believe that we should learn from this case of a wrong development in these decentralised agencies – especially since they have become enormously important in recent years – and that we should come to clear technical supervision, clear supervision of the service, and clear legal supervision. Whether that will then have to be the Commission remains to be seen. But in case of doubt, you need an authority that operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and takes over this task, and thus also the guarantee of regularity and guarantee. If it is primarily the responsibility of the Agency itself to remedy shortcomings, then there is basically a certain bias. I think that thinking about this, detached from the individual case, should be our common mandate, ladies and gentlemen, as a lesson from this case. Back to the case, we welcome the fact that the joint work with the Management Board and the Interim Director has led to considerable progress. Forty-eight of the 61 measures foreseen in the Action Plan have already been completed in order to remedy the shortcomings identified by the European Court of Auditors. This is about strengthening procurement procedures, it is about internal controls, and it is also about speeding up recruitment. Progress was made in recruitment in 2019, with 100 out of 175 recruitments carried out this year and nine management posts filled, with only six remaining vacant. We trust that the new Executive Director, Nina Gregori, who took office a few months ago, will consolidate the work and complete the implementation of all recommendations and thus fully restore the credibility of EASO. The Commission will continue to monitor the implementation of all measures. Following the report by OLAF, our anti-fraud authority, the Commission supports the implementation of the recommendations relating to the competences of the Management Board as the appointing authority with regard to the Agency in this capacity. Our common objective must be to introduce measures to prevent incidents of this kind from reoccurring in the first place. The Commission is counting on the management of EASO in order to guarantee the proper functioning of the Agency. We are ready to continue to provide our expertise here. In order to help meet the challenges of asylum, three years ago we made a proposal to transform EASO into a fully-fledged European asylum agency so that the mandate can be better fulfilled. In this respect, we also call on Parliament and the Member States to deal with our proposed amendments as a matter of priority and as a matter of priority, so that this legislation can be adopted quickly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 195, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Tomáš Zdechovský", "mepid": "124713", "text": "  for the PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, let me also thank the rapporteur, Mr Sarvamaa, for the work he has done, because indeed today's presentation was excellent and that is where he described easo's problems.

What has happened at the Agency is scandalous and it must be said, it must be said here in plenary that we will never accept anything like this.

Unfortunately, it was not fully investigated due to the capacity of the people who worked on it.

Increasing instability at EU borders has made migration one of the most pressing political issues and unfortunately, much too often, a human tragedy. EASO’s assignment is a hefty one. It has to coordinate policies of EU Member States on asylum. It has to improve the implementation of the Common European Asylum System, and it has to support Member States under pressure, such as Greece and Italy. In order for EASO to perform all of these important tasks, it needs our support and, indeed, it has the support of the S&amp;D. But regrettably, from a budgetary control point of view, there have, during 2017 and previously, been a number of irregularities. Those irregularities occurred both in the management of staff and in the expenditure of payments, and they were such that S&amp;D tomorrow cannot vote in favour of granting discharge over 2017. That said, we also note the improvements made at EASO after the change of management in 2018, and the new director, Ms Gregori, has made considerable progress in tackling past problems, as well as presenting a coherent set of corrective actions for the future. She deserves all the support she can get in implementing those actions. Therefore, I’m pleased that the resolution, which will be put to the vote tomorrow, emphasises these positive developments. With the current pace of progress at EASO, it should be able to leave past problems behind and fully focus on the tough assignment that it has – that of supporting the EU’s asylum policies.

You only have to look at the role being played in Greece in order to verify that point: thousands of innocent people, desperate to just have a life, are crammed into facilities like the detention facility at Moria, already vastly overcapacity, in hellish conditions. It’s their fundamental right to apply for asylum, but instead many are given a pre-interview with EASO to see if they’re eligible for a fundamental human right.

We certainly agree: migration will remain a major challenge for Europe in the coming years and decades. That is why, on the one hand, we need a sustainable, common European asylum system for the future. Progress has been made here, but not all the proposals from the Commission and other competent services have yet to be implemented. The home affairs agencies that Europe has to deal with migration and refugee tasks were set up in a different context at a different time. Reforming them has therefore been our task for a number of years, and this includes, in a central role, the EASO agency, the Support Office EASO, which must be developed into an independent, efficient, full-fledged agency. EASO plays a key role in our European migration policy. Firstly, disciplinary action is being taken on the question of the further investigation of the specific case: on the basis of the reports by OLAF and the Court of Auditors, disciplinary measures are being taken. It is the responsibility of the supervisory authorities to take action against the director and against employees under the law of service law. That is what we are doing. Secondly, it concerns legal proceedings, be they administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, which must follow suit. Thirdly, it is a question of examining and exethecising possible financial recoveries. This, too, includes procedures. We are happy to report this to the House. As much as this case can be called a scandal in this agency, the good thing is that in a democracy where there are supervisory bodies such as OLAF, such as the Court of Auditors, like Parliament, the Commission, clarification is possible.

We are now looking forward to cooperation with the new EASO management with the aim to monitor closely how the ambitious 2019 EASO Governance Action Plan will be implemented.  Lastly, while recognising all efforts made to remedy the shortcomings of the past, we cannot assume political responsibility for approving the budgetary and financial management of the agency in 2017.

Since 2009, Parliament has been unable to approve the Council's budgetary management because of its lack of cooperation so that Parliament can carry out its work to control the management of the Union's accounts. In the 2017 account-closing procedure , which is the one at hand now, the Council did not respond to the questionnaires sent and did not appear at the hearing of the secretaries-general of the institutions organised by the Committee on Budgetary Control.  Consequently, on 26 March, parliament's plenary deferred the adoption of the Council's accounts until this October, giving it once again the opportunity to amend the situation.  Unfortunately, the Council has not moved a token to date; so, once again, in the face of this lack of cooperation, our committee has had to refuse the discharge of the Council by 2017.  All political groups voted unanimously in the Committee on Budgetary Control, thus supporting the position that Parliament has been having over the years, as we believe that our role is to confirm that the budget has been spent in a legal, regular and in accordance with the principle of good financial management, thus exercising fundamental competence in the interests of all citizens and taxpayers of the Union , by ensuring the transparency and democratic accountability of the entire European budget. Indeed, the report calls on the Council to react and value Parliament's democratic role in this area.  The Council should adapt and accept the democratic scrutiny of its accounts, as the other institutions and bodies of the Union have done, and moreover: even if they did not, the Council should be the first to set an example of transparency and submit to the discharge procedure, providing the information required of it.  It is true that over the years there have been several attempts by both institutions to bring together positions, which unfortunately have not yielded any positive results to date. But I am optimistic and confident that the Council will be prepared to agree on how to cooperate as soon as possible. In this regard, I hope that the Finnish Presidency will play an important role in achieving it.  In addition, the report includes a section on private sponsorships which many Member States use when assuming the rotating presidency of the Council. We believe that the private financing of the Presidency can give an inadequate picture of the Union's accounts and therefore poses a significant risk not only to the reputation of the Council itself, but also to the whole of the European Union, especially in a context in which the institutions need to protect and strengthen the trust that citizens place in them.  And finally, precisely in the name of that trust and for the sake of the responsible exercise of transparency and democratic oversight that our citizens deserve, I call on the Council to join our efforts in finding a solution to this disagreement as soon as possible.

In relation to the implementation of the 2017 budget, you know of course that the Court of Auditors in its annual report, I quote: ‘did not identify any issues concerning the Council’. This is worth underlining. As for the more general discussion between our two institutions, after several years of deadlock both sides made an endeavour in 2018 to reach an understanding which would ensure pragmatic cooperation while maintaining certain positions of principle on both sides. The Council has always underlined that Article 319 of the Treaty provides for a single discharge procedure for the entire EU budget. Parliament has adopted a political practice providing for separate procedures for each institution or body. In spite of this disagreement in principle, we found that there was still scope for identifying a common set of good practices to facilitate cooperation in the discharge procedure. The Council revised its 2011 draft memorandum of understanding on the basis of a proposal of the European Parliament and sent an amendment text back to Parliament in May 2018. Further contacts and exchanges took place in summer 2018 and the Council took note of subsequent suggestions by the then—Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT), Ms Grässle.  Last summer, after the transition period around the European elections, the Council received a letter from the new CONT Chair, Ms Hohlmeier, asking for feedback on her predecessor’s suggestions.  The Presidency can confirm that the Council’s competent preparatory bodies are currently examining the way forward. It is very important for the Council to know whether Parliament still stands behind our common approach of the last year, in particular the clear delimitation of the scope of the discharge procedure. Discharge is about the implementation of the budget. It cannot be used as a means to make the Council politically accountable to the European Parliament. Another very important element for the Council is the equal and mutual exchange of information between our two institutions. The draft memorandum says ‘notwithstanding the difference between their respective roles in the discharge procedure, the Parliament and the Council need a similar factual basis’.  This seemed to be the common ground last year. I hope it still is, but it will also have to be ensured in concrete terms. As you will understand, I cannot anticipate today the Council’s reaction to Ms Hohlmeier’s letter. The Council is in the process of defining its position on the best way forward. Let me reassure, nonetheless, that the Presidency is doing all it can to conclude this process and to find a solution which is acceptable to both institutions.

To sketch out the problem for you, Romania was sponsored by Coca Cola at a time when the Council was negotiating rules on foodstuff labelling. Finland accepted 100 BMW vehicles while it was reviewing emission norms for cars. The incoming Croatian Presidency has published a paper on how private companies can seize the business opportunities that come with their Presidency. Corporate sponsorships, in my opinion, discredit the EU. What is at stake here is not only conflicts of interest and transparency, but also trust. In the last European elections, more young people than ever cast their vote. They show trust in the European project and we should be cherishing that trust. These sponsorships undermine the trust that we were given and they show the EU at its worst. The EU, not for the many, but for the few, namely a few corporate sponsors. Instead of this, what we need is an EU that puts the public good first and curbs the power of vested interests.  So two weeks ago, I stood here and I asked the Council Presidency this very same question: what are you going to do about private sponsorships?

Throughout this debate, we have heard the key issue of transparency come round and round again, and I am not surprised, given that we are talking about EUR 562 million that has not been accounted for to this Parliament. The three things the European Parliament and the European Council really need to reflect on are the following. The first thing, there needs to be external accounting for these matters; at the moment, the internal accounting procedure is not working. The second thing is that the executive must appear before the committees. I cannot imagine a situation where the executive is refusing to appear before the committees of this Parliament. The third thing is conflicts of interest around sponsorship; those must be accounted for. Our voters need transparency.

I wish to highlight that the President of the Court of Auditors himself has declared in your Budgetary Control Committee that the Council is examined in the same way as any other institution. Furthermore, the Council provides the European Parliament with the complete financial documentation mentioned in the Treaty articles about discharge. In addition, for some years now Parliament has had access to the annual activity reports of the Council’s authorising officers by delegation and other documents which contain all relevant information about how the Council uses its resources and how it organises its work.  Honourable Members, I’d like to repeat here that the Finnish Presidency is committed to exploring all possibilities to reach a mutually acceptable arrangement. We have to aim for something that works, and that works for everyone. I want to emphasise that one of my predecessors as President of the Council once said that the EU institutions can gain the trust of the citizens in the Union only together, not against each other. Finally, just shortly on corporate sponsorship. I’d like to reiterate that corporate sponsorships are a matter falling within the remit of each Member State. Of course the Council is politically accountable to the Union’s citizens. This accountability operates through Member States’ governments that are being controlled democratically and legitimatised by national parliaments. It is fair to say that it does not operate through the European Parliament.  Thank you very much for this exchange of views, Mr President.

We all agree on the importance of the principle of equal treatment, as well as of the fight against all forms of discrimination. However, Member States choose different ways of combating discrimination. The vital importance of this Directive stems from the fact that it would fill in the existing gaps in the EU legislation concerning the development and the implementation of measures in the field of equal treatment across Europe. The proposal covers four grounds for discrimination: religion and belief, disability, age and sexual orientation. The aim of the proposal is to extend the protection against discrimination on these grounds beyond employment and also to other areas such as access to goods and services. After the proposal was tabled in 2008, the European Parliament quickly agreed on a legislative resolution which would feed, through the consultation process, into the decision—making. On the Council side, in the 11 years since the proposal was published, each Presidency has had this file on their agenda. Due to its legal basis, in order to adopt it, unanimity in the Council is required and, unfortunately, this requirement is difficult to achieve. Remaining challenges concern the division of competences, legal certainty and the financial implications of the proposal, among other things. Thus, for the time being, the Council common position seems to remain out of reach. A lot of effort was invested in the discussions so far, as testified by the successive progress reports. We have understood that discussing the text further at this point would not do much to remove the existing deadlock. This is why we, under our Presidency, decided to launch a broader exchange of views on non-discrimination at different levels, the culmination of which will be the policy debate at the next EPSCO meeting on 24 October, actually just two days from now. We expect a fruitful and constructive debate. We hope it will also inspire and feed into the work and the future commitments of the incoming Commission in this policy field. The aim of the debate is twofold. Firstly, we will take stock of the current situation and challenges in non-discrimination in the EU in general, and second, we will explore possible ways forward in this area. In other words, we want to identify the types of measures and actions needed for ensuring the effective implementation of the principle of equal treatment in order to efficiently advance the EU’s fight against discrimination beyond the field of employment. We hope that, as a result of the policy debate, we will get a better feel of Member States’ vision for the future of anti-discrimination in the EU. Hopefully, it will also provide motivation for Member States to look at the proposal again from the new perspective. We are optimistic and ambitious but, at the same time, as the Presidency, we want to respect different national views and listen carefully to the concerns of all Member States concerning this key proposal. We consider that the upcoming policy debate is important and timely. Its outcome might serve as a basis for devising new steps towards progress. I would still like to emphasise that equal treatment is a principle enshrined in our Treaties and reiterated in the European Pillar of Social Rights and in several UN conventions ratified by the Union. All European citizens have the right to be treated equally and be free of discrimination. Apart from this inherent right, it is also economically and socially beneficial if everyone is provided with the opportunity to fully participate in society. It is clear that our work is not yet done in this area, and we still have a long way to go. I do not think any Member of the Council would contest this. The question is rather about the way we move ahead. In this regard, I am confident that our debate among EPSCO Ministers will prove to be a fruitful exchange. We commend the Parliament in its committed work in the fight against discrimination and the promotion of equal treatment. It was with great interest that we took note of Parliament’s several valuable contributions concerning this issue, including your resolutions on fundamental rights, on protection of minorities, and more recently, on women’s rights and gender equality, to name just a few. I’m looking forward to hearing your views on this important matter.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 231, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, discrimination has no place in our Union, regardless of whether it takes place within or outside the employment sphere, and regardless of whether it is based on racial origin, sex, disability, religion or beliefs, age or sexual orientation. This is why the adoption of a Horizontal Equal Treatment Directive is so crucial. It would ensure that equality applies to everyone and in all aspects of life. For many years, the European Parliament has been expressing its support for the proposal and I want to use this opportunity to thank the Parliament for your determination and your sustained cooperation.  We have some new figures from the Eurobarometer on discrimination, which will be released in two days on 24 October. We notice very little progress at EU level when it comes to perceptions and attitudes on discrimination compared with the figures we have from 2015. According to the existing figures, 53% of Europeans say that discrimination is widespread on the ground of sexual orientation in their country. For people of Roma origin, the figure is even worse – 61% of Europeans say that there is discrimination on those grounds. For those who identify as gay, lesbians, bisexual, transgender or intersex, 58% say they have felt discriminated against in the last 12 months.  There is thus enough evidence of discrimination being widespread. This is not only harmful for the affected individuals and groups; it is also costly for our societies. A 2018 report shows that the gap in equality legislation leads to costs and losses in terms of GDP and tax revenue. To use a single example, individual impacts in the area of race and ethnicity include lost earnings of up to EUR 8 billion and demonstrably higher risks of economic hardship. To address this situation, the Commission has been striving since 2008 for the adoption of its proposal for a Horizontal Equal Treatment Directive, and we will not give up on it. We are working hard with the Council to overcome the political blockage and to start real work on the remaining technical issues. At the Social Affairs Council meeting on Thursday, we are going to hold a political debate on this issue and, as we heard from the Presidency, this file requires unanimity. However, we must not give up and we will try again and again. We will spare no effort to have the current proposal adopted and settle the issues in relation to its implementation and costs, in light of advances such as the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability and the adoption of the European Accessibility Act.  I want to thank the Finnish Presidency for organising a policy debate on enhancing non-discrimination. I will participate in the Council debate this Thursday, and the outputs of the Council will be key for our further efforts to overcome the current impasse. The debate will have a clear mission for me: to urge the Council for progress on the file and express my wish for an agreement to be reached.

It is incredibly important that both the Presidency and the Commission recognise the urgent need for movement on this directive. It is imperative that we come up with a roadmap, not only on how to get this file off the ground, but also on how to close the legislative gap against discrimination covered by the proposed directive. These gaps leave substantial numbers of our citizens vulnerable to discrimination based on inherently personal qualities like their age, their disability, sexual orientation or religious beliefs. In the past 11 years, the world has moved on. Many EU countries have adopted more progressive equality laws and improved non—discrimination protection for their citizens. EU legislation in this area is lagging behind – and hearing the previous speakers, I think we’re all in agreement of that. We cannot continue to be world leaders when it comes to the protection of human rights if we fail as an institution to enshrine these rights in this directive. The twin principles of equality and non—discrimination are the bedrock of the international human rights framework. The prohibition of discrimination is the only right set out in all nine core international human rights treaties. Discrimination is frequently identified by international and regional human rights bodies as one of the greatest human rights challenges facing EU Member States. We need to change that.

However, since that vote, nothing has really changed.  Ten years ago, I imagine that our predecessors thought that a progressive text like this, intended to find solutions, would reach a consensus in the Council and be adopted quickly. Naivety! The representatives of the Member States were unable to agree and, once again, for many of them, were camouflaged behind arguments of financial cost.  So, seriously, have conditions improved radically in the area of discrimination? Have attacks on certain minority groups stopped abruptly and their living conditions have improved? Can people with disabilities say that education, work, housing, transportation are open to them equally to able-bodied people? Seriously, of course not! And it is this kind of blocking behaviour that undermines the reputation of the European Union and its representatives, and gives the impression that we are not interested in the concrete and serious problems faced by democracies.  Because the European Union is the best level of action and has a framework to combat discrimination and protect those who are victims of discrimination, we need to get out of the way.

In these times we know fanatics organized with hate speeches to prevent others from thinking and living without being harassed. Freedom of conscience is the basis of democratic societies.  For example, in my country, in Catalonia, in order to build an identity state, discrimination practices have been reached from the government of the region. Families have been prevented from choosing that children be able to make their first letters in the family language, as Unesco advises, if the family language is Spanish. E later this year, a teacher injured a ten-year-old girl because she painted a flag that wasn't the one the teacher wanted: she didn't want a national flag. And there are children harassed by their parents' trade. It's ideological phobia discrimination. We have a lot to learn.  Discriminatory fanaticism is a risk of our time.

They are frustrated by you; they are confused by your objections. They understand non-discrimination with greater sophistication and greater urgency than any EU institution. We cannot accept for our people a hierarchy of discrimination, criteria, or the fact that the moment you leave the workplace, the law is no longer an ally.  What the public do need is for a self-evident fact to be enshrined in law. From the shores of Lampedusa to the Arctic Circle, from the coast of Portugal to the beaches of the Black Sea.

On this, the Parliament and the Commission have been united. If  the weight of unanimity from the European Council is for reducing Europeans citizens to second-class status, then – as the rapporteur for the European Parliament – I ask as firmly as is polite that the Council activists the passerelle clause provided in Article 48, paragraph 7, of the Treaty on European Union in order to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting.

Of these 21%, a third of respondents felt discriminated against because they were older than 55 or younger than 30. It was new to me that being younger than 30 was discriminatory. I would give a lot of reasons for being discriminated against for this reason. 2% of respondents felt discriminated against because of their sexual orientation, 1% because of transsexuality. Scientifically, values of 1 to 2% are at the limit of what can be determined statistically seriously. Contrary to all the talk of discrimination, it must therefore be said that sexual discrimination was no longer an issue in Europe in 2015, and anyone who has ever experienced Christopher Street Day or Love Parade will agree. This is a great development. There are therefore three fields of discrimination: religion, ethnicity and age. Discrimination against older workers in working life is often more of an employer's response to excessive rules on dismissal protection. If we start here, the alleged discrimination will also disappear. Religion and ethnicity remain: these discriminations are also a consequence of migration policy. It is known from Berlin and many other German cities that Muslim landlords do not rent to Christians, homosexuals or Jews, Muslim taxi operators do not hire people of color, Indian and Asian restaurant owners often do not hire Muslims. It is therefore quite simple: the multicultural society of open borders is the society of discrimination.

And this is what this is all about. We must stand up at some point against those who want to exclude, those who want to discriminate and oppress some of us. One way of doing this is by adopting the horizontal anti-discrimination directive. An anti-discrimination directive does not solve all injustices – it will not be equality with a brush stroke.

In her political guidelines, the President—elect, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, put unprecedented emphasis on promoting equality and assigned this new created portfolio to Ms Dalli, who was mentioned here several times. You heard in her recent hearing Ms Dalli making a strong personal commitment, in front of your institution, to do everything to advance key legislation in the equality area. Maybe you remember I also made a strong commitment and promise in 2014, when I started my mandate in this area. I didn’t expect that the legislation which was already proposed in 2008 would not be adopted over the whole time of my mandate. I regret that, and I find this a failure which is still to be solved. I only want to tell you that we did from the side of the Commission everything possible to unblock it, but with all that effort of course we could not guarantee adoption in the Council.  I heard from Member States over the Council meetings – of course it was in 2014 back then when we were discussing the progress, rather non-progress, reports in the next years – a lot of different arguments. It was the money, competences, subsidiarity – you mentioned some of them.  I remember in 2014 when we started to speak about the possibility to go through enhanced cooperation, which might be the solution, because this requires unanimity so this is an option. This is an option which is procedurally okay but this is an option which is morally absolutely wrong. I was happy that I heard this, also from the Member States who did not want to adopt the legislation, that this would be a wrong signal – that some of the Member States would be out of such a principle thing.  I had maybe hundreds of individual talks with the relevant ministers in the Member States. But the relevant minister is another issue, because not in all the Member States is there one minister who works for it, who works full—time against discrimination, because the competences are shared and the picture of who is responsible for what is rather blurred also at the Member States level.  Let’s be honest, it requires courage these days in many Member States to fight against discrimination and not all politicians are willing to undertake such a risk, because we live in an era of hate—speech online which is turning not only against discriminated people – and this is another fight we are running and we do a lot against hate—speech online – but this is also turning against politicians and journalists who have the courage to write about discrimination. So this is the Europe where we live now and we have to work on all these fronts.  You also mentioned the difficulty with the implementation of the anti—discrimination legislation because we have legislation in place already. I can give you the example of the gender pay gap. A big portion of the gender pay gap – meaning differences in salaries between men and women – is caused by direct discrimination. A man and a woman, same job, different money. It’s prohibited by the law. Where is the enforcement? In many cases, the women are not aware of the gap. So that’s why we wanted to strengthen the ability of the equality bodies in all the Member States to act, and to be the helping hand in the Member States for these kind of cases so that the victims of such discrimination can go and ask for support and use access to justice, because it’s not a privilege, it’s another guaranteed right which should be used here. The pension gap: we speak here about 40% of the difference, so it’s another shameful story and we have the legislation in place, so we have a gap in the implementation. On discrimination and what to do, I spoke about our efforts to decrease or eliminate hate—speech online, which is fuelling discrimination and vice—versa as these two phenomena are fertilising each other. We already started to work on artificial intelligence and there are still ethical rather than legislative, but still ethical rules, so that not to copy paste the discriminatory behaviour and attitudes to the artificial intelligence sphere.  So we are working on many different things, but the thing we speak about here today is a core one. Without the legislation we will always be weakened and we will have to find different ways how to achieve the possible and feasible results.  So in this context I have big expectations that on Thursday I will hear from the relevant ministers from the Member States whether the 11—year—old directive is still fit for purpose or whether they see some room for improvements. Let’s look at it freshly and newly, without damaging the main purpose. Maybe I will hear again the same arguments which I was listening to over the five years, but I am sure that this debate will be very useful and it will give fresh impulse for the new Commission and for the Council to continue working on it.

Unfortunately, national law tackles this problem in a variety of ways. Therefore, the Directive would harmonise anti-discrimination rules at an appropriate level of protection.  The lack of unanimity of the Member States somewhat compensates EU citizens for the Court of Justice, which has given the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of age the value of the principle of general EU law (Mangold) and confirmed its direct effect (Kücükdeveci). The entry into force of the Anti-Discrimination Directive would avoid many human dramas resulting, for example, from the arbitrary and collective deprivation of thousands of officers and soldiers serving Poland, even one day before 31 July 1990, pension rights resulting from seniority, as well as benefits related to taking up any other work after leaving the service. The absurdity and repressive nature of such a practice were recognised by the national courts, referring questions for a preliminary ruling to the CJEU or adjudicating in favour of the victims without a national rule.

This is an important topic indeed, and this proposal, presented by the Commission in 2016, is one of the numerous legislative proposals aimed at fighting base erosion and profit-shifting. We have had the opportunity on several occasions to exchange views on the progress the Council has made in the area of taxation, and indeed there has been significant progress. As far as this specific legislative proposal is concerned, the Council has worked a lot on the text of the proposal. The  competent working party has examined the proposal since April 2016 and further meetings are planned under our Presidency. I am very much aware of the importance of this file for the European Parliament, which adopted its first reading position in March this year. I am also aware that last year in February, Mr Svoboda and Mr Gualtieri inquired about the state of play of the Council’s deliberations and highlighted the Parliament’s willingness to progress swiftly on this file. However, there were – and still are – unsolved political issues which still prevent an agreement in the Council. I must emphasise that public disclosure of information does not automatically mean increased tax revenues. Solid tax laws and well-equipped tax authorities are key in this respect. Therefore, the Council continues its work in the area of base erosion and profit-shifting to further complement the toolbox of tax authorities. The toolbox already includes country-by-country reports by the largest multinational corporations, and these reports can be accessed by tax authorities. I would also like to recall the oral question put forward by Mr Svoboda last year regarding the legal basis of the proposal and Council’s answer in this context during an April 2018 plenary. Indeed, the question of the legal basis calls into question the very applicability of the ordinary legislative procedure in this file. Whereas the Parliament is in favour of keeping the legal basis proposed by the Commission, our legal service is of the opinion that the legal basis should be Article 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which is a taxation article and therefore requires unanimity, instead of Article 50, paragraph 1, which is a single-market article and requires qualified majority.  The Finnish Presidency is taking over the results of the technical work done so far. Work has advanced well under the successive Council presidencies that preceded us, and we intend to move forward as much as possible. Consultations with delegations are ongoing with a view to achieving further progress on this file, but you will understand that I’m not in a position to make any specific commitments today. On the Council side, we will probably still need more time in order to clarify our position. I commit to keeping you informed of any further developments and I hope that we’ll be able to find a way to reach a Council position.

This is another issue in the line where I think that a mirror could be of very good use to the Member States. One could ask why companies need to report income or expenditure in any way. Why does it matter for society? We have an overall understanding that it is a matter of public responsibility where you put your money, where you get your money, and whether you pay your taxes or not. This has not been, and is not, the case internationally. Therefore, we have a European legislation that concerns capital requirements, that concerns auditing, that concerns accounting, and that concerns reporting – how you report that information. And even though these reports are used for taxation purposes, they are normal legislation, and that is a clear issue of Article 50. And I’m afraid that the Council has a very fragile fig leaf under which it is trying to hide, claiming that this is a taxation issue when it is a reporting issue. This is the reason, even though we haven’t yet spent– and hopefully not – 11 years on sitting on the issue in the Council.

A few days after the Panama Papers came to light, the Commission acted very quickly. That has been a while now: in 2016, the Commission and the European Parliament knew immediately that the people of Europe have a right to be brought into the dark.  Employees pay their taxes nicely, many companies do this, huge corporations often do not tax their fat profits. They collude with national governments and create constructs that push down their tax contribution. So we in the European Parliament acted very quickly and decided that large corporations operating in the EU with more than EUR 750 million in turnover will have to publish in future where they make their profits, they tax how much they pay, and the big corporations simply owe it to the people that we know whether and how much tax they pay. The directive is on the table and what are the Member States doing? They are already taking an infinite amount of time, and the population is, of course, paying for it, because of course these funds are missing. For three years now, we in the European Parliament have been waiting for something to finally happen at Council level. Why is nothing more to do? Do the Member States want grass to grow over all the tax scandals, the scandals will fade and at some point tax goodies will once again be possible, as they have obviously always been possible? That is why I appeal to the Presidency to leap over its shadow here. Everyone is discussing the Sustainable Development Goals, stricter transparency obligations in the environmental field, in the area of human rights. Of course, we also need this in the case of tax transparency.

We have used the competition law tool – the Commission has used it effectively in the last mandate – but after the judgment of the Fiat and Starbucks cases we have also seen that this has a limit. And the only way to effectively combat circumvention is with new measures. And this measure of forcing large companies—I remember, only those that bill more than 750 million a year—is essential, to force them to tell us exactly what they produce, in which country and how many employees they have, in relation to their financial activity. It is essential to avoid tax avoidance. Moreover, the arguments when we negotiated this in Parliament, which were to tell us that this would create a disadvantage for competitive European companies... Look, nothing further from reality: banking has already been required to do so since that measure was introduced earlier in the Capital Requirements Directive. Therefore, that is not a valid argument. There is no reason not to take this measure forward.

Existing disclosure requirements for banks and country-by-country reporting will therefore be tightened up and extended to multinational companies. The Commission has presented an amended EU directive on this subject. Profits should be taxed where they arise – lofty goals, for sure. But, as is so often the case in the EU, nothing, it seems, is as it should be. Firstly, the problem of tax avoidance itself is a consequence of the EU's uninhibited internal market policy. Flimsy legal constructs allow multinational companies to move profits almost at will. Secondly, according to experts from the OECD and the Council of Europe, tax avoidance and money laundering are also a vice of NGOs. George Soros saves billions in tax through his Open Society Foundation, thus financing his politically-desired lobbying. With an open society fortune of more than 20 billion dollars, this is as damaging as corporate tax planning. So why not a country-by-country disclosure requirement for NGOs? Thirdly, the Commission mentions Article 50 TFEU on freedom of establishment as the legal basis for its draft. However, Article 50 concerns only obstacles to the establishment of self-employed persons or the establishment of group branches. In accordance with Article 114(2), measures against tax avoidance – and we are talking about this here – do not apply to the principle of majority voting, but to unanimity. The Commission's proposal would be a breach of the EU Treaties and is illegal. Fourth, the eurozone, along with Japan, has the lowest growth and the highest personal taxes in the developed world.

Finally, to get the answer, nothing simpler, we have this proposal of tax transparency: to force companies to publish key information about their actual activities and the payment of their taxes in order to finally be able to detect tax arrangements.

For example, from 2018, tax authorities now receive access to country-by-country reports on certain financial information of the largest multinational corporation. This is good. Second, from 2020, information on potentially aggressive cross-border tax planning arrangements with tax consultants will now be required to disclose to tax authorities. This is also good. However, I wish to stress that Finland’s Presidency would like to take this particular file forward and is working towards this aim. You can be assured that we share the same interest in moving forward on this file as quickly as possible. We are determined. As the Presidency we will certainly do our best to achieve as much progress as possible. At the same time, and as already mentioned, I will personally definitely keep you informed on the progress on the file on the Council’s side. Thank you very much again for this very timely and very important discussion.

However, I would like to draw attention to three of my concerns.  The first is that, in my opinion, the draft would cause an unjustified increase in administrative burden for the companies concerned. The information to be published under the draft must be sent by companies to the tax authorities of the Member States anyway, so this is just an extra obligation and we will not gain anything from it.  The second thing I would like to draw attention to is that the information to be published may include confidential data. It is therefore questionable to me whether the disclosure of such data will bring anything to the kitchen or whether it favours non-EU competition companies, since, of course, they will not be subject to this obligation. In other word, we're shooting ourselves in the foot again, we're hurting our own competitive.  The third thing I would like to point out is that the legal basis of the draft is also problematic. This is in line with the view of the Council Legal Service (CLS) that Article 50(1) of the TMS, as defined by the Commission, is not the correct legal basis and that the legal basis for the proposal can only be Article 115 TSI. Thus, the proposal should not be treated within the framework of company law, but should be seen as a tax proposal which requires unanimity. With the plan in its current form, we are therefore losing more on customs than we do on the ferry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 293, "date": "2019-10-22.json", "name": "Bettina Vollath (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "197678", "text": "  Writing. – The blockade of individual Member States in the directive on the publication of the acquisition tax information of large corporations must finally be brought to an end. We must ensure that we shed light on the tax constructs in order to achieve tax justice and fair competition. The aim of the directive is to increase the accountability of large companies with a turnover of EUR 750 million or more to the public. The European Parliament has also done its work in this area and adopted a position in April 2017. Unfortunately, progress in this important area is once again failing because of the negative attitude of individual Member States. We must not allow small and medium-sized enterprises to pay their taxes in good spirits, while large corporations, on the other hand, choose the way past the treasury through shifting tactics or letterbox companies. We must work to ensure that large companies also make a fair contribution to the prosperity of society through taxes, we must promote fair tax competition and increase transparency and accountability to the public. With the directive, we can play a part in drying up tax havens and tax swamps and getting a fairer and more transparent tax system in place. I therefore call on the Member States to abandon the blockade and to sit at the negotiating table with the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
