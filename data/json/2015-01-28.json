I will actually have to leave at 5 p.m. to catch my flight, and I would like to thank Vice-President Katainen for taking the floor if necessary, on behalf of the Commission, to conclude this debate. The brutal terrorist attacks in Paris were an attack on our fundamental rights. It has once again become clear that we face an increased and severe terrorist threat to Europe. We have seen that terrorism knows no borders. Terrorists’ travel, financing and access to weapons are, by definition, cross-border problems and they require a strong, united and coherent response from the entire Union. This is not a time for competition among the EU institutions to act and be seen to be acting – with the danger of announcing badly-thought-through ideas which cannot then be delivered, leaving citizens even more disillusioned with the Union. The Member States, as you know, remain primarily responsible for security, but Europe is part of the solution. There are a lot of relevant EU tools and measures already in place. The Commission is determined to take an approach that is comprehensive, result-oriented and realistically deliverable, with the focus on maximising the added value of existing EU measures and, where necessary, proposing new and complementary ones. The Commission can add value by looking at gaps in the effectiveness of existing operational law enforcement and cooperation tools. Security is essential for a functioning democratic society. It is a prerequisite for our citizens’ wellbeing and a prerequisite for citizens’ ability to exercise their own rights. Freedom and security are two sides of the same coin, and not conflicting goals. Developing such a response requires that we all work together. This Parliament is our strategic partner in developing an effective response that will respect our fundamental rights and values and be in line with the expectations of Europe’s citizens. That is why I am here to present and discuss our latest thinking and lines of action, with the aim of fighting terrorism and radicalisation, in the context of the preparation of the European Agenda on Security announced in our work programme. All the EU institutions will be examining further action on counter-terrorism in the context of the upcoming European Agenda on Security. Initial discussions on this are expected to take place at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in Riga and at the meeting of the European Council on 12 February. A new agenda for European security for the years 2015-2020 will be presented in the coming months, around May. This agenda should aim to ensure the highest level of protection for the fundamental rights of our citizens and those residing in or staying in or visiting the European Union. Upholding our democratic values and ensuring security are not only compatible: they are mutually reinforcing. It seems clear that there is a need to maximise the value of existing instruments and to deliver on pending proposals first, before developing further measures. Furthermore, we must make sure that the measures in place allow us to tackle the problems we face effectively. To maximise the value of existing EU measures we also need to make the best use of the Schengen Information System, under existing EU law, for checks on travel documents and on persons at the Union’s external borders and to assess any emerging need for improvement. The Commission is assisting and will further assist Member States in identifying common risk criteria for checks on persons. Europol, in particular, will play an important role in the implementation of the future agenda. We need to make sure that it receives all the requisite information from all Member States so that it can deliver its added value in terms of intelligence and threat assessments. The same goes for Eurojust. As long ago as 2005 it was decided that the Member States should provide counter-terrorism information to both agencies. On cybersecurity and the protection of critical infrastructures, we need to reassess whether additional action is needed. The Boston Marathon bombing highlighted the vulnerability of public events. We will work to protect such soft targets, and also critical infrastructure, more effectively. A number of initiatives and trials are ongoing, which will feed into our reflections for future proposals. With regard to delivering on pending proposals, that is where I believe this House can add value in responding to calls from citizens. One example is the EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) Directive. An EU PNR directive is necessary in order to enhance substantially the security of everyone living in Europe. We need to make sure that our law enforcement authorities have access to the data necessary for the prevention of terrorist acts and serious transnational crimes. No decision has been made, except that the Commission is committed to working with the co-legislators to achieve a legal instrument which is both effective and fully in line with fundamental rights. I am looking forward to seeing this, and I intend to help the European Parliament and the Council in moving forward quickly on this issue. I have read – we have all read – articles about what the position of the Commission might be. Let me be clear: the Commission has not come forward with a modified proposal or other initiative today. That was never planned. There has not even been a College of Commissioners discussion since the orientation debate on the EU security agenda. Everything that has been published allegedly reflecting a Commission official position or decision is therefore wrong. With regard to the data retention reform, and in particular the Law Enforcement Directive, I call on the co-legislators to work together towards quick adoption. This will be essential in providing a clear and predictable framework for the processing of personal data in Member States and the exchange of such data between law enforcement authorities. Furthermore, we need to optimise the sharing of information between law enforcement authorities. To that end, the adoption of the Europol and Eurojust legal frameworks and the pending proposal to improve cross-border law enforcement training will be crucial, but progress can already be achieved without waiting for this. We will very shortly organise a joint meeting with Europol and Eurojust to see how information sharing can be improved under the current legal framework. The Commission is seizing the opportunity, during the preparatory work before adoption of the agenda, to consider whether further measures are needed to address the evolving threat, including whether the existing EU legal framework needs reinforcement. We had our first discussion with my fellow Commissioners just last week. It is clear that the fight against terrorism will be a major focus of this agenda. Let me now put forward some preliminary reflections on the objectives that the European Agenda on Security should address, including how to continue to offer Member States comprehensive support in preventing and addressing radicalisation and other forms of extremism. The fight against arms trafficking is another building block. We need to review the implementation of the existing legislation and ensure a greater exchange of information both between Member States and with Europol, Eurojust and Interpol. At the same time, the fight against organised crime and the financing of terrorism needs to be stepped up. We must deprive terrorists of their sources of finance. The link with organised crime is striking. Ensuring the effective implementation of the fourth Anti-Money-Laundering Directive and the Funds Transfer Regulation agreed upon in December 2014 is crucial. The existing tools for the confiscation of criminal assets must be used. We must ensure the speedy execution of all confiscation orders. We also need to look carefully at reassessing the need for, and the added value of, possible EU solutions for data retention, respecting the principles set out by the Court of Justice last year. The Commission is monitoring and evaluating the situation in each Member State before discussing the way ahead with the co-legislators. We need to find sound solutions for the exchange of passenger record data with those third countries that are key to our security interests and to make sure that they are fully consistent with the solutions to be reached for EU PNR. Full implementation by Member States of existing legislative instruments on information exchange is therefore key. However, we also need to consider how to strengthen Europol’s intelligence analysis capabilities in relation to terrorism and radicalisation-related threats. We need to expand the use of existing EU policy-cycle tools to address serious and organised-crime-related threats as well as threats related to terrorism and radicalisation. On the external front, the EU is stepping up its assistance to neighbouring countries and regions. The particular focus is on law enforcement cooperation, information exchange, extending criminal law tools and anti-radicalisation efforts. Delivering rapidly and effectively on our response requires political will and the setting of clear priorities. The Commission has voiced its determination to take this up as a matter of priority. Working hand in hand with Parliament on developing a coherent response will be essential in defining and developing action to keep Europe both secure and open.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2015-01-28.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has The attacks in Paris, but also the attacks we have seen before, which took place in Brussels, in London, in Madrid, in various cities of the European Union and also outside the European Union, present us with enormous challenges. My wish for this European Parliament – and if it had been in the previous vote, incidentally – would have been for us to have agreed unanimously that we should also be allowed to discuss the issue of terrorism, that we should also have to discuss it in public and that a Community would have to show, just as those governments that are socialist, who are conservative, including Green interior ministers – have all set themselves a common agenda. Frankly, I would like to see a little more unity in this Parliament in order to show the public what we want and how we fight. That is why I would also like us to discuss openly and profoundly objectively the instruments that our law enforcement agencies need to combat the terrorists. Passenger data is one of them, and perhaps data retention is part of it, there are issues that are also controversial in our country, but it is precisely the discussion of prevention measures or what forms of de-radicalisation we can do, what we can do in our prisons.

Paris was also the great mass demonstration for us. Paris reminds us of the murderous madness but also of Lassana Bathily, the Muslim boy, of Malian origin, who protected the hostages of the shop and who a seventh ago became French and therefore our Fellow European.  We do not want to forget that jolt of dignity and we believe that from there, we must start again, in a unified spirit, Mr Hohlmeier. We will not fail to support concrete measures, but we will deny our support for measures that undermine freedom, which is an indispensable achievement of the European Union. We call ourselves the European Union because we are founded on freedom. For the rest, you will all have our support for measures that want to combat terrorism effectively. Europe – as the Commissioner mentioned – already has some instruments at its disposal: let us make them work! We need to strengthen Schengen, in its components relating to the exchange of information and the strengthening of security and external borders, without touching on the basic principle of mobility. We have no foreclosure with regard to PNR provided that the conditions relating to the length of data detention and other conditions are clarified. No preconditions, but be careful to deceive the citizens: it is not only with PNR that the problem is solved. PNR can be one of the factors in a multifactorial strategy that we need to put in place, starting with the strengthening of judicial cooperation.  The joint action and work of intelligence, the strengthening of the foreign policy, a common policy towards the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean and, finally, a policy aimed at inclusion and integration. Many terrorists, especially young people, come from pockets of poverty, poverty, abandonment, marginalisation and marginalisation: these are the phenomena we must combat: more education, more education, more funding for education, more dialogue to combat fanaticism and terrorism and no exploitation. We must be serious, because we talk and deal with a serious issue: we cannot say, as we sometimes do, that immigration brings terrorism.

I intend to apply the highest data protection standards and the judgment of the European Court of Justice to my proposals.

Europol says there are over 3 000 EU foreign fighters radicalised, military trained, returning to the EU and exploiting the gaps and deficiencies in law-enforcement information exchange across the EU. This directive would help to address that. At present there is no EU legal framework for citizens or the airlines and no clear legal or administrative redress in the use of data.

We have to work together in this Parliament and we cannot waste time. Two weeks after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo we must take a leap forward, and we must conclude in the European Union a broad and ambitious package to tackle terrorism. We have to do this as Parliament together with the Commission and together with the Council because it is a common task and there is a common goal to be achieved. In fact, what we have to do is to repeat what happened after 9/11. After 9/11, in 2001, alongside other measures we decided on a package and created the European Arrest Warrant, which at that time represented a dramatic change in Europe because previously it had taken years to secure the extradition of a suspect. Sometimes it took 10 years to bring someone back from the UK to France whereas since we have had the European Arrest Warrant it takes just days to transfer a suspect or a criminal from one country to another. We need the same level of ambition now: not to do the same things, because the threats have changed, but to have a similar package to strengthen our security in Europe – and two things are at stake here. First of all, we need a common capacity to analyse the information and the risk, because that is lacking in Europe. In all major terrorist attacks over the past 10 years, Mr Kirkhope, the perpetrators have been known to the services of the different countries. The problem today is not so much that we do not collect the info; the problem is that we do not share the info between our services in Europe. That is the main problem. We have to create what we are calling ‘euro-intel’ – a system for sharing information and for common analysis of risks. I have heard a number of people today saying that this is not possible under the terms of Article 4 of the Treaty. Well, I can tell you that in the last parliamentary term we changed the Treaty twice: once to have 18 more Members of Parliament and the second time to introduce the European Stability Mechanism to save the banks. If it is possible to change the Treaty on the fast-track procedure to save the banks, it has to be possible to change the Treaty to increase the security of European citizens here in this European Union. Secondly, we must not make the error of the nationalists and the populists, namely to say that the problem is Schengen. The problem is not Schengen. The problem is that we are not sufficiently solid among ourselves to strengthen the outside borders of the Schengen area instead of reinstating internal borders. Finally, on passenger name records (PNR) I want to say just one thing, since Mr Kirkhope has spoken about this. We are in favour of a European PNR system but it has to go together with guarantees and with the protection of data and privacy. It is clear that Mr Pittella is right: this is about safety and freedom at the same time. And one last sentence about the targets in this debate: you cannot abuse the death of Charlie Hebdo as some are doing here in this Parliament, Ms Le Pen, Mr Farage. This is not about a war between civilisations and religions: it is about a war against criminals and terrorists, and that makes all the difference.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2015-01-28.json", "name": "Cornelia Ernst", "mepid": "96852", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which When I went home yesterday, I ran to my apartment at police cars and I don't know how many heavily armed soldiers pass by. I wondered: are we doing more security? Are we really preventing next attacks, attacks like those in Paris and elsewhere with tighter border controls or five years of passenger data retention? Do you really believe that we are creating more security? We are running after a phantom again, we are running after a fiction that really does us no good! We must fight terrorism where it arises. It originates, for example, in countries such as Iraq. Why? Because the Sunni population there has been humiliated and there is no reconciliation. Terrorism is promoted by Saudi Arabia, whose kings have been handed over by the West, even though they are funding terrorists around the world. The first demand must be: arms exports to such regions do not belong! With europe in mind, terrorism always arises where inclusion fails, and it fails in every Member State. For example, in Germany, where people watch young people run towards jihadists. We must understand that fire cannot be extinguished with fire. This won't do. We need an honest debate on anti-Islamism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, exclusion in the midst of our society.

I agree with all those who say we need to deliver whatever is necessary and proportionate to get a higher level of security. But what is proposed now, the proposed blanket mass surveillance of citizens, is exactly the opposite of that. It does not deliver that. Instead, you are delivering a symbolic measure at the cost of effective security and the civil liberties of EU citizens. Even before the Paris attacks it was possible to know who was on which plane. We already know that. We have advance passenger information: it is there, we can access it and we know who is on which plane. In the case of known suspects, we can follow them. So why do we not focus on the suspects? Why do we not focus on the risk? That is what you need to do in your directive, Mr Avramopoulos, because that would be a focused approach on security. We need to strengthen the capacity of police officers and security personnel – locally, regionally and at European level – to analyse this information. They need to be able to join the dots. That is exactly what has been missing in the past and what has led to the insecure situation we have today. But the problem is that we spend all our money on blanket surveillance measures like data retention and other issues. It is proposed to invest hundreds of millions of euros in the blanket retention of personal name records. This money is very much needed by the police everywhere in Europe, and needed for the coordination of European security and police authorities. Europol has just a small amount of money for the setting up of joint investigation teams. We need to invest the money there. That is what we need. So, Mr Avramopoulos, I am not convinced by your proposals, and I am not the only one. The Court of Justice has said very clearly that it is not legal and not in line with the fundamental right of data protection to put everybody under surveillance. You have to choose where you are shooting. You have to choose who you are going after. You have to create some determining criteria to indicate where there is risk or suspicion.

I agree with Guy Verhofstadt's intervention on the need to act quickly, because we are really at war with barbaric criminals and terrorists. Commissioner, I listen to you, we come to your speeches, you make presentations all day long without ever determining a timetable, never. Today, there is an emergency, which is that of the safety of European citizens.

Yesterday, the Commission said in the Committee on Home Affairs that, in the wake of the Paris attacks, we need action, not actionism. Right! Because one of the terrorists' aim is to spread fear so that we restrict democracy and freedoms, and this strategy must not work, even and especially after the Paris attacks. And that is precisely why the proposals currently circulating are worrying in their many ways: monitoring the Internet, collecting passenger data, tightening up the rules for the Schengen area, preventing encrypted communications, perhaps even new data retention and more. I would like to remind the Commission and the Council that, in its judgment on the abolition of the Data Retention Directive, the European Court of Justice has drawn up a fundamental rights check for all surveillance measures. In other words, they must all meet the comprehensive criteria laid down by the European Court of Justice. And in the case of passenger data, this means not only checking storage periods, access rights or effective controls, but also restricting it to the occasional use of data.  Do we have a problem getting data? It was not only in the case of the Paris attacks that the perpetrators were known to the national authorities! However, the Member States are making far too few use of existing instruments and, in particular, the exchange of information seems to be taking place far too little. We therefore need a comprehensive evaluation of existing measures before we always propose new instruments, and we should not forget that this will not eliminate the root causes of terrorism in our midst, such as discrimination and exclusion of young people. The bottom line is that instead of dismantling civil rights, we must defend the rule of law, safeguard freedom and fundamental rights right now.

According to the Jamestown Foundation (An American think tank), most counter-terrorism operations in Europe after the attacks in Early January in Paris targeted Chechens. According to the BBC, Russian citizens of Chechen origin with explosives have been arrested in France. In Germany, one of those arrested, according to Deutsche Welle, is a Turkish man suspected of directing what he described as \"an organization of Islamic extremists from Turkey and Russian Chechnya and Dagestan\", while two terrorists were killed and a third Chechen was captured after a police mansle in Belgium. Does the police profiling of Chechen expatriates from Russia show that the authorities of the Member States are taking into account the eastern inspirations of the current wave of terrorism?

But our response to their fear should not be just symbolism or fake security. We should do what it takes and not just play to the gallery. First of all, we already have an extensive toolkit. We have the tools but we need to evaluate whether we have all the tools that we need and whether we have the right tools or we need bigger or smaller tools. Maybe some tools are superfluous. We also need to assess whether all those measures being decided by Parliament, and also by the government leaders when they meet in Brussels, are subsequently implemented in the Member States. They make a lot of grand statements but I would like to know what the state of implementation of the measures is. I think we should have a scoreboard as in the internal market. On specific topics: regarding PNR, my group, as we signalled two weeks ago by letter, is open to discussion on an EU PNR, but there are two simple and clear conditions. One is that whatever proposal we discuss, it must meet the test of necessity and proportionality. That is a legal requirement, not a political one. Secondly, the Council needs to adopt the directive on data protection. It has been on their table for a year and a half. It is not that difficult. Parliament has voted; it will take them 30 seconds to pass it.  On encryption: I hear a lot of scary and worrying proposals about a ban on encryption or the obligation to hand over encryption keys. They are dangerous proposals. What is next? Will it become a criminal offence if you have a lock on the front door of your house? Because that too would be very useful in the fight against terrorism. We are on a slippery slope. Finally, I am glad to see that we are all united in our determination to fight people who want to destroy our democracy through violent means.

In this panel of actions, the social and cultural dimension of the fight against terrorism must not be cosmetic or declarative, but generate concrete actions on the ground.

In the area of asylum, it must be made clear that asylum care must take place on the continent of those who seek protection and help, as the German Minister of the Interior, Mr de Maiziére, has also called for.

Because, for example, in my country a foreign minister first says that there is the possibility of infiltration through immigration, then he denies it; but then comes – as Marine Le Pen also mentioned – the alarm from Libya. We know that Libya, the territory from which that tide of desperate people starts, is increasingly in the hands of Isis and we cannot tolerate our citizens – and I am speaking to you in particular on behalf of my fellow citizens who are the Italians – feeling in the trenches, feeling at the forefront and seeing that we continue to get lost in chatter, we continue to filter reality through more or less ideological visions while they absolutely need us to speed up the concrete measures that exist. and above all that we overcome that lack of trust that exists between States and, sometimes, between different bodies of law enforcement, that we also overcome those jealousies and envies that are blocking a system already in place, to which we must give breath and strength because I believe that security is one of the main rights of a citizen and certainly one of the main duties.

This issue has been a priority for all three EU institutions, which in itself is a very good starting point for further discussions. I am grateful for this opportunity to share my views on it. The Parliament has been instrumental in bringing the issue of investment to the forefront of the European agenda. Hence, I am particularly pleased to stand here today as we start working on the first concrete deliverable of the investment plan. The EU fund for strategic investments is a top priority for the Latvian Presidency and for the Council. It is essential that we strengthen economic growth and reduce unemployment in the EU. The investment package is designed to deliver on this dual goal, and it is of the utmost importance that the co-legislators work closely together and as quickly as possible. I find it useful to recall that President Juncker and the European Council have set an ambitious deadline. We count on Parliament’s support in achieving it. The current investment situation requires resolute and swift action. We want to see the first projects in place this year. The Council has already started examining the proposal in an ad hoc working party which is meeting very frequently. Two meetings took place last week and the next one is scheduled for tomorrow. We aim to produce a general approach by March to allow sufficient time to agree with Parliament well before the summer deadline. The Ecofin Council will keep a close eye on progress with this proposal, which will feature prominently on our agenda. In fact, the first intensive exchange of views on the proposal at ministerial level took place yesterday. I am confident that Parliament is willing to match our ambitions and I look forward to constructive cooperation. This is going to test our mutual commitment to boost Europe’s economic recovery. While the importance of the EU fund for strategic investments cannot be overestimated, it is only one part of the Commission’s investment plan – the so-called liquidity pillar, designed to mobilise finance for investment. The second pillar of the Commission’s plan, the project pipeline and the setting up of a European investment advisory hub, is also part of the current legislative proposal. By helping to identify well structured, reliable and viable projects, we ensure that the private sector participates and that the money is channelled to the real economy. So we must pay due attention to these measures accompanying the setting-up of the fund, as they will be key to the successful delivery of strategic projects across Europe. However, it is perhaps the third pillar – improving the investment environment – that will ultimately be the most important in terms of fostering private investments. This is a much broader issue that needs to be tackled at many different levels. From an EU perspective, it is a question of completing the single market. A number of measures have already been announced by the Commission, for instance under the banner of the capital market union. The Council stands ready to work together with Parliament and the Commission on all initiatives designed to enhance the single market and to improve the EU’s competitiveness. At the same time, action is also needed at national level to remove any barriers to investments and unlock the growth potential throughout the EU. We therefore look forward to the Commission’s proposals and initiatives in these areas. The investment plan is fully in line with the priorities of the Latvian Presidency in the field of economic policy and competitiveness. As you know, the plan is not designed to solve every single problem in the euro area or the European Union – from macroeconomic shocks to deflation, energy security and local authorities’ debt problems – but it is a step in the right direction and, most importantly, it has been designed in the most flexible way so that it can grow. Structural reforms, fiscal responsibility and investment are the three keys to restoring growth and creating jobs. In other words, investment is only one ingredient in the mix. We should not forget the others: structural reforms and fiscal prudence. To tackle the challenges ahead, we – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – must work together quickly and efficiently to ensure that the legislative package delivers the needed boost in the economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2015-01-28.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, it is always a pleasure to be in the European Parliament to talk about big issues, as we are doing today. I would also like to thank the Latvian Presidency for the excellent job it is doing in putting the investment plan very high on the agenda. Less than two months after announcing its ambitious strategy to boost jobs and growth, the Commission has presented a draft law to set up the European fund for strategic investments (EFSI). We are delivering quite fast. This fund goes to the heart of the EU investment offensive: the drive to get funds flowing back into the parts of our economy where they are needed most and to stimulate job creation. We have also proposed creating a transparent pipeline for projects and setting up a European investment advisory hub to make sure public and private promoters get the technical assistance they need to develop viable projects that can benefit from this funding.  In line with the objectives of our plan, each of these measures will remove uncertainty in order to mobilise much-needed private investment. For Member States we are providing certainty by clarifying how the new entity will be governed, how Member States’ contributions will be treated under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and how projects can best be developed to have a tangible impact on growth and jobs. For private entities we are providing certainty with a legal text explaining the legal form and governance of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, with enhanced technical assistance, and by establishing transparency in relation to the project pipeline. We are moving fast and I am counting on you for very strong political support so that we can have the European Fund for Strategic Investments up and running in the first half of this year. The timetable is very ambitious. Council negotiations kicked off on 19 January 2015 in an ad hoc working group established for the investment plan for Europe. It is important that work in Parliament should start as soon as possible too. We count on the co-legislators to agree on the text by June so that the EFSI can be operational by mid-2015. Since we are moving very fast it is important to take the time to explain very clearly what we are doing. I want to look in particular at SGP treatment, governance and some other details. Regarding SGP treatment, the Commission will treat favourably Member States’ contributions to EFSI investment under the SGP. The EFSI will be open to contributions from Member States directly or through national promotional banks. Member States can also contribute at the level of different projects. Contributions in the form of capital and guarantees to the EFSI will not be counted when assessing the fiscal adjustment. Co-financing with EFSI projects or investment platforms will be eligible under the revamped investment clause. Regarding governance, we foresee a two-tier governance structure. This governance structure has been specifically designed to allow the fund to remove more uncertainty for investors taking on project tranches that present a higher risk than those covered by normal EIB instruments. This is a key point because, to add value, the EFSI must be able to support projects with a higher risk profile in order to get investment flowing in the countries and sectors of our economy where it is needed most. In practice, a Steering Board will define the EFSI investment guidelines. These guidelines will set out the risk profile of the fund and the criteria for the selection of projects. The Steering Board will consist of representatives from the EFSI partners, i.e. the Commission and the EIB, and, in the future, any third-party entity that might participate in the EFSI capital, subject to the agreement of its partners. As long as the only contributors to the EFSI are the European Union and the EIB, all decisions in the Steering Board shall be taken by consensus. An investment committee made up of six independent experts will take the decisions on project selection. Projects will be selected on the basis of merit and the investment guidelines laid down by the steering committee. Investors tell us that this independent selection of projects based on merit is critical if we want private sector financing to come in. The investment guidelines defining the criteria for project selection will be adopted by the EFSI Steering Board once the EFSI regulation has been adopted, but the basic criteria are already clear now. Projects under this initiative will need firstly to be economically viable with the support of the initiative, secondly to be sufficiently mature to be appraised on a global or local basis, and thirdly to be of European added value and/or consistent with EU policy priorities such as the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, inclusive and sustainable growth, the 2030 Climate and Energy Package and other long-term EU strategic priorities. The proposal states that the EFSI should target projects with a higher risk-return profile than existing EIB and Union instruments in order to ensure additionality with existing operations. The EFSI should be used only where financing is not available from other sources on reasonable terms. The EFSI will be fully accountable to Parliament. The monitoring is structured around two key principles of which the first is reporting. The EIB will report semi-annually to the Commission and annually to Parliament and the Council on EIB financing and investment operations under the regulation. The reports will be made public. The Commission will also report to Parliament on the application of the regulation. On accountability, Parliament will have the right to organise, at any time, hearings with the managing director of the EFSI on the performance of the fund. The managing director will also have a legal obligation to reply swiftly, orally or in writing, to questions from Parliament. In addition, Parliament can request reporting by the Commission. The proposal presented today must be complemented by a series of measures to remove barriers to investment and to create a true single market. To me this is the most important part of the investment plan. It is the way to change Europe structurally and permanently in the right direction and to open up new investment opportunities. On this, a set of actions is outlined in the Commission’s 2015 work programme. The Commission will come forward with further proposals on the energy union, the digital single market, the capital market union and an internal market strategy for goods and services in the course of this year. We look forward to working with you on this matter. Finally, I want to signal that, while there are a lot of technical details in the plans presented today – and we rightly need to discuss those and get them right – it is important never to lose sight of the big picture and of what it is all for. The crisis of confidence is holding back the investment flows that are the lifeblood of the European economy. Taken as a whole, these new measures should restore investor confidence and get investment flowing into the regions and sectors of our economy where job creation is needed most. The urgency is very real at political level because the needs are very great on the ground. I look forward to working hand in hand with this House so that we adopt these proposals as soon as possible and have a meaningful impact on Europe’s investment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 101, "date": "2015-01-28.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr Vice-President, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. Thank you for the presentation of Jyrki Katainen. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes the European Commission's proposal for the Growth Pact, for the investment package at European level. I also believe that the framework conditions are set in the right way: not debt-financed investments, but money raised in the private market to create jobs in Europe. That is the right way to go. That is why I would like to thank you for the speed with which we have worked on and also for the good proposals. My fellow Members will discuss the details from the PPE-DE's point of view later. I would like to combine this proposal today with a second development which will characterise the economic situation in the European Union and will also mark the next debates politically, namely what we saw on Sunday with the Greek elections. First of all, I would like to point out that, in our view, the relaunch of Europe initiated by the new Greek Prime Minister will certainly not be achieved by him, but is made through proposals such as those presented today by Jyrki Katainen, namely the investment package. The ILO, the International Labour Organisation, today published figures that this investment fund can create more than 2.1 million new jobs in the European Union. A huge boost for the European Union is expected from experts who stand out in this area. I mentioned Greece because I believe that much of what we want to do is in danger for investment, for economic power in Europe, for this vote and for the formation of a government last Sunday. For example, if the new Greek Prime Minister, Tsipras, now announces that he wants a bail-out, in other words, that debts should not be repaid, then I ask you: how are we to get private investors to join the fund when, at the same time, European politicians say: we are not paying back our debts? What does this have to do with solidarity? What does it have to do with solidarity if, with a bail-out, that is, with a debt cut in Greece, countries such as Cyprus would have to pay EUR 100 million, countries such as Italy would have to pay EUR 10 billion, countries such as Spain would have to pay EUR 6.6 billion and Ireland would have to pay EUR 347 million? A bail-out means that all other European states would have to pay for the Greek debt. Is it in solidarity that Spain, Italy and Cyprus are liable for Greek debts? Does this lead to stability? I do not believe that this will lead to stability; I believe that it will lead to instability in Europe. The election promises made, with more than 11 billion euros of new spending in Greece, do not lead to investors gaining confidence in that country. We have the hope, and even the request, that the successes – that Greece today has a balanced budget, that Greece has growth today, also a difficult situation, but growth – that these successes will not be risked now. I do not want to talk about radical left forces gathering in the government with right-wing forces, of making common cause with right-wing populists. I would also like to remind our Socialist friends that not a single woman has been hired as a minister in the new government; only men are active in the new government. What this has to do with gender balance is something that surprises me a lot. I am referring to this in this discussion on the investment fund, because such political developments are the far greater danger to the question of whether we are getting economic development. Anyone who looks at developments in Europe today will find that we have growth of 3.6% in Ireland, 2.6% in Latvia, we created a million new jobs in Spain last year – in all the countries where we have PPE-DE governments, where there is sensible governance and where investments are being made in the future, we have growth and positive development prospects. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will continue along this path.

This is the right answer to be provided. But for that we need investment, and that is why our debate today is relevant and we have a full sense of urgency. That is why I need to say to you, Commissioner, on behalf of our group, that we are really worried by the very slow build-up of the European Fund for Strategic Investment. We are, in fact, very worried that Member States are not so far making capital pledges for the Fund and we know very well that this stronger capital base for the Fund is fundamental to enable the Fund to increase its lending capacity; so this is a critical point, and this is not going well. We know very well that the EU budget guarantee and the EU contribution is not enough, and we are also worried in particular that Minister Schäuble recently dismissed Germanyʼs intention to make a national contribution, so this is a bad signal. I would say that we need to overcome this obstacle.

But I often speak to investors who have money to invest, but are scared off by red tape and see other parts of the world as far more attractive. So I think we need to recognise that this Fund will not be a silver bullet. In fact probably the most important part of the proposal is not the Fund itself but a so-called third pillar. What we need to do is cut red tape and bring down those barriers to investment.  Let me give you one example. I currently lend to entrepreneurs around the world via a successful American peer-to-peer lending platform. This platform tells me that they want to come to Europe but they are worried that EU legislation would not allow their business to succeed. So the true test of success here is not how many roads are built or how many pipelines are laid, but it is how many entrepreneurs will get financing and create sustainable jobs. And once they start their businesses, we need to make sure that EU legislation does not shut them down. Since the beginning of the year, digital businesses now have to pay VAT in the country of the customer rather than the country of sale. Now we know that this law was aimed at the big businesses such as Amazon which sell via low tax countries, but this one-size-fits-all legislation is also shutting down microenterprises selling digital products such as eBooks, online designs, or online knitting patterns for example. They cannot afford to check on customers in 28 Member States. There is no VAT threshold and if they refuse to sell to customers in other EU countries they are now being told that they may be breaking EU anti-discrimination laws. So they are damned if they do and they are damned if they don’t. So what do they do? They close down.  So by all means let us speak in this House about helping SMEs, by all means let us talk about a digital single market, by all means let us talk about these investment programmes, but, if we are at all serious, let us rip away the red tape that is harming businesses today, here and now. Until we do that, no amount of investment will close the gap. The songwriter Bob Dylan once asked, ‘How roads must a man walk down?’ but let me ask how many investors have to leave the EU before we remove the barriers? How many microbusinesses have to close down before we solve the VAT MOSS problem? How many people have to be unemployed before we open the markets?

In fact I would even say, Vice-President Katainen, Madam Minister, that you are partly or already on the road for one reason: I think that you are raising expectations in the correct way because the three pillars on which the plan is based are exactly the pillars that businesses are expecting. It is a question of regaining confidence. It is a question of confidence that the EU institutions are able to address the real issues with real instruments in a proper way. We are raising expectations. We are not halfway but we are on the way and I think it makes it even more important to deliver. Vice-President Katainen has mentioned that he considers the pillar on the internal market to be even more important. I would tend to agree. I think that this is really the case. You will remember, Mr Katainen, the interaction we had in our group on one issue on which we partly disagree. I was looking for a conditionality in terms of structural reforms. You explained that you found it perhaps burdensome, that it has to be simple. I would say that maybe there are ways to make it simple, not only in concrete projects but in general vis-à-vis that specific Member State. But let us leave that to one side. I understand this has not been taken on board.  I would make a different point alongside what you have just said. If the EU is coming with an investment plan, I would expect the Commission to try at least to impose on the individual Member States their own national investment plans. You are now getting a certain amount of input. Different projects are being proposed. I have seen some of the lists. Some are more encouraging, some are less so. I have confidence that people who know what economic viability is will make the right choice. But I would be much more confident if, in the framework of these submissions, we were to see concrete issues addressed by the national administrations in terms of completing their own bit of the internal market. Enforcing the legislation: the Commission knows very well where and on what issues individual Member States are failing. Better regulation, administrative burden. As Mr Kamall is a true liberal I can agree with him that cutting red tape is an important issue. I have been in business for the last nine years and when I speak to business people they name it number one. Once again, I can imagine that, in the framework of the national investment plan or whatever this document will be called, you can demand concrete steps be taken. Two remarks to finish with. First, I would have expected somewhat more from the Latvian Presidency in terms of what we were presented with today. I would have expected you to say not only that there were meetings – there was a meeting on Monday – but what happened at the meetings. What is the commitment of the Member States? What is the message? What do you want to leave with us here in Parliament? Otherwise we know it is important and we know that meetings are taking place. Second, I wish you the best of luck.

I would like to talk again about the investment plan and perhaps keep the discussion on Greece until later. First of all, I would like to thank the Commission very much for the investment plan. Now there is finally room for investment after years of continued focus on austerity and further cuts. However, if we look at the investment plan now, we do have three fundamental objections and problems with the current proposals and we would like a response from the Commission, from Commissioner Katainen on that. First of all, too little democratic control. However, the plans state that this investment plan should also contribute to the EU's overall objectives. But that's far too unclear. If we now look at where the money is being taken from, namely part of the European budget, does that mean that an investment plan with a new steering board will be put in place? But the big question is: what exactly are these plans going to look like? As far as we are concerned, it is crucial that the European Parliament is fully involved in the co-legislation, that we can decide on the rules of expenditure. Secondly, too little regard for the public interest. If you look at the list that the various Member States have submitted, it goes in all directions, but millions are certainly going to coal-fired power stations, millions to nuclear power stations. The Antwerp ring is being taken off again, while we know how much that is a problem in Belgium, in Flanders. I see my Flemish colleague agreeing. So, how are we going to make sure that this kind of spending is really there for the public interest and not just private spending? Thirdly, briefly, it is too little to get the European economy going. Not enough thought has been given to new revenues, such as lost revenue from tax avoidance.

In the Commissioner's proposals, I note that it is important that Parliament has a place in monitoring the management of this Fund. We agree with the priorities that are expressed on this future Fund, we also agree on the establishment of a governance mode, a process of project selection, which is meant to be transparent, and it is necessary if we want to bring in investors.

A good signal would be to do everything possible to keep our technological progress, which would otherwise be extremely dangerous, because it would jeopardise European industry and our chance for growth.

I wanted to tell you that I do not agree with those who denounce a trick of Mr Juncker's prestidigitator that would take 315 billion out of his hat, but I still think that if we called a spade a spade, we would gain clarity and credibility, because this plan is the recognition of the indispensable public investment in Europe. , this guarantee on the UNION budget is the basis of a Community loan that does not say its name. It is a pity, because it is this fund based on public action that will restore confidence to private investors. The Commission is therefore making a first step towards what we socialists and democrats have been calling for since the beginning of the crisis, namely the intervention of public investment. Unfortunately, it is not 300 billion over three years that Europe needs, but 300 billion euros of additional investment each year, and to achieve this, Member States will have to mobilise and seize this new instrument through projects, of course, but above all by contributing to this Fund. And to encourage them to do so, the Commission has presented a new interpretation of the flexibility of the Stability Pact.

How will very long-term investment projects, which are the seeds of a sustainable and socially inclusive model, be evaluated? How will the employment objective be taken into account when choosing projects? For if the Council and the Commission swear by the independence of the EIB in the selection of projects, how will the experts on the investment committee take macroeconomic issues into account?

The euro should speed up this process. Today we are facing a strategic shambles. The eurozone is not competitive internationally. There is no growth, but there is mass unemployment. Investment activity is paralysed. And what is the Commission doing? It presents a new plan: A new European Fund for Strategic Investments.

The first question is that public-private partnership has many advantages, that the private sector takes the risk, and if it succeeds, more capital can be mobilised.

Investment is the most powerful tool available to Europe to reform and modernize our economy. This means that it is not only quantity that is important, because also the quality of the projects and the added value that we will contribute is essential. That is why we need a structured investment plan around the Europe we want to build. We need a much broader future strategy, an agenda in which sustainable development is our real goal.

This plan perhaps gives them an alibi, because in the election campaign so many voters were deceived by the policies that some socialist parties promised, precisely, to fight against austerity.

The problem is that many countries are also behind in development because they have not had these innovative approaches and approaches to mobilise private capital for development before.

Therefore I welcome this legislative proposal for a strategic fund that is in front of us, but the onus is on all of us to make it work and ensure that we have implementation forthwith. To get it right we need to do a lot of work. The main points that I think some of the other colleagues have raised are that the selection of the right projects is essential and that they do add EU added value and are not just projects that would have been funded in any case. And Member States have to inject some more money into the fund, in a flexible way, in their national budgets.

I just want to underline the basic nature of the investment plan. First of all I want to recall what I have said before. This investment plan alone will not change everything. We need structural reforms, we need confidence-building fiscal policy, we need the right monetary policy and then we need Europe-wide action in order to encourage the private sector in particular to invest in Europe. That is why the investment plan is not a one-off stimulus measure. Instead, it is a structural European answer which has three angles. The first one is the risk fund, in order to encourage the private sector to invest in riskier countries, riskier regions, riskier projects, and especially in small and medium-sized companies. The second angle is a transparent project pipeline for which we would like to collect economically viable, reliable, well-structured projects so that private money can easily find projects from various parts of Europe. This has been wished for by institutional investors and private sector investors. They say that our everyday job is to invest in Europe, but unfortunately there are not enough viable and reliable well-structured projects. That is why they asked us to build a transparent project pipeline and we are going to do it. We want to help not only the private sector but also the public sector to structure those projects. We are enhancing technical assistance in order to make sure that the whole of Europe, all parts of Europe, can benefit from new opportunities. The third part, which in my mind is the most important part of the plan, is the single market part because it is a European structural reform which can create new markets, new opportunities for small but also for bigger companies in Europe, and there the sky is the limit for new job creation. That is why we all need to put our focus on the single market, and not to forget it – even though money is always more attractive – but the single market part is more powerful. We can get much more out of it than the other parts of the plan can bring. For those of us who are interested in helping SMEs and are interested in increased public resources for SME lending, I would encourage you to look at what the Spanish Government has done. It is a very good example to all of us. I would encourage every country to do the same. It is using structural funds as a financial instrument, providing more liquidity, more loans, to SMEs. This is the best way to use structural funds if you want to provide more loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. This is an untouched opportunity in most of our Member States. I wish you could help the Commission to pass this message to your own respective Member States. We should not forget that the original EIB will also continue to work. It will lend EUR 60 to 70 billion a year whereas the new risk fund, which is concentrating on riskier projects and SME lending to a greater extent than the EIB, will provide some EUR 60 billion liquidity without any Member State contributions, but in three years’ time. The reason why the new fund is smaller is that it is focusing on high-risk projects and nobody knows how much demand there is for this kind of money. I want us to work closely with each other. When we are taking money out of the European budget it means that we are using the same amount or a bigger amount of money but in a different way. For instance I expect research will receive more when we use the leverage effect of the new fund. We have to work very closely with each other; we have to work very fast together in order to open new opportunities for our companies and for our citizens to get jobs, because job creation and new jobs is the only reason why we have established the new fund and new investment plan.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 144, "date": "2015-01-28.json", "name": "Zanda Kalniņa-Lukaševica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this debate which demonstrates the importance we attach to kick-starting investment in Europe after years of stagnation. It bears witness to the common determination of all three EU institutions to deliver promptly to European citizens on the ambitious investment plan, a plan that should promote sustainable growth and job creation. During this debate I took note of five blocks of questions on themes we discussed today. First of all we touched upon so-called red tape and the role of structural reforms, then we came to questions on sources of finance for investment and jobs in Member States, and to relations between public and private investment. Then, and very importantly, we heard the call for attention to be paid to the question of jobs: stimulating new jobs and fighting unemployment. Of course we talked about investments for the benefit not of private investors, but for our citizens’ jobs and the welfare. There were also questions about the use of the finance and the role of smart investments and sustainable projects and – importantly – horizontal questions about democratic legitimacy, the role of Parliament and the responsibility of Member States. So, coming to these five blocks of questions, I would like to recognise, in particular, the importance of what Mr Weber, Ms Rodrigues and Mr Kamall said. It is for this reason that we look forward to the Commission’s proposal and to initiatives under the third pillar of the investment plan. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe that the third pillar may ultimately be the most important in terms of fostering private investment. We believe that, by proposing the three-pillar approach, the Commission has made the right choice because raising the level of investments is a rewarding exercise in the long term but a very complex one in the short term. The Presidency is ready to act not only on the proposal to establish the fund but also in the area of removing barriers and bottlenecks in the internal market, most notably in the fields of energy union, the digital economy and, indeed, the capital markets union. A lot can also be done at national level. With regard to the possible contributions of Member States to the fund, the details will need to be worked out in the legislative proposal, which we have just started to examine, but it is essential to ensure that, at whatever level Member States intervene, new investments can be mobilised. It is true that Member States or their national promotional banks will be able to contribute to the fund. But let me stress that this is just one of the ways in which Member States can support investment with the EFSI. They will also be able to contribute directly at project level or throughout investment platforms. As it stands, the Commission and the European Investment Bank have estimated that the level of funding envisaged will have to mobilise up to EUR 315 billion of new investments. Most of this will come from the private sector, where there is plenty of liquidity. This is real money and it needs to be used as soon as possible. That is without any additional contributions from Member States: when the additional contributions come, the amount will increase. When we talk about the added value of the fund, I would stress that the role of the new fund is to mobilise new investment, and additionality is a very important criterion which will ensure that the fund ‘crowds in’, rather than crowding out, private investment. We have only just started our examination of the proposal and, like the Parliament, we in the Council need some time to come to a position. However, it is already clear that the additionality of this instrument will be essential. The goal will be to support projects which are not currently being funded, for example because they are perceived as too risky. The fund should bear some of the risk, so as to make the projects more attractive to private investors. With regard to your comment, Mr Bullmann, you have raised a number of very valid points to which we will have to find answers during our internal and interinstitutional discussions. We agree that the money should come to where it is most needed, and we will have to work towards ensuring more certainty in the criteria. Of course the fund needs to address unemployment, inequality and growing poverty. That is the main goal. It is clear that an ambitious investment plan will help support demand in the short term and improve Europe’s growth potential in the longer term. It is an essential condition that it should underpin higher levels of employment. A significant increase in investment activity will bring a higher level of employment to the EU as a whole. The Commission proposal also envisages stepping up support for SME financing through the European Investment Fund. SMEs make a vital contribution to employment in Europe, and this part of the plan should not be underestimated as it will provide a significant boost to SME activity throughout the EU. With regard to the content of the debate in the Council – we had a question on that – I would draw your attention to the fact that yesterday’s Ecofin debate was public. However, since interest has been shown, I will provide a short insight into yesterday’s discussion. The Ministers showed their resolve to make this plan a success. They agreed on the necessity of ensuring that those projects which deliver the most significant contribution will succeed – those projects which create jobs and which enhance knowledge and technology transfer throughout the EU, be it in the developed regions or those which are still catching up. The principle of additionality was emphasised as one of the key criteria, and there are many questions that need to be clarified in order to get this right. Of course discussions will continue and the Council will work very hard and will deliver the best possible results. With regard to the role of the European Parliament, we very much look forward to starting negotiations with Parliament on the proposal to establish the fund, with a view to reaching an agreement as soon as possible in order to enable the flow of real money to our economies. But, in order for the private money to flow, some key principles are important, such as depoliticising the decision-making process at fund level and ensuring full independence in the selection of projects. In the Council we are also under heavy time constraints in examining the proposal. However, as the Presidency, we believe we can deliver on the ambitious deadline set by the European Council without compromising on the quality of the legislation. As long as we work constructively together, we can achieve this ambitious goal. Citizens expect us to deliver promptly. There is no time to spare when it comes to boosting investment in Europe. Let us work together constructively to make sure that the investment plan works. Let us put the economic crisis behind us. Let us jointly put in place the conditions for creating jobs and improving the welfare of European citizens. Let us make this work – honestly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 145, "date": "2015-01-28.json", "name": "Der Präsident. -", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The public guarantee that is the basis of the recovery plan must be, this is the least of the things, a lever for improving the well-being of European citizens. Moreover, the principle of flexibility, which is gradually making its way, would like to see public investment through the EFSI excluded from the calculation of deficits for the States concerned.

It will also focus on education, research and innovation and renewable energy and energy efficiency. There are plans to focus more on small and medium-sized enterprises.

We must be able to correct the anomaly where that today, with a greater availability of wealth, there is still no increase in investment in the so-called 'real economy'. In order to reverse this trend and stimulate private participation in the plan that decrees its success, the theme of project selection is fundamental. I would like to draw attention to two aspects that I consider to be central. There is a need for selection to take place on the strategic nature of the projects, which is the only way to reassure private investors and involve them in the effort. Another essential point will be to consider the added value of the employment impact that the projects chosen will be able to guarantee, given the current unemployment figures in Europe.

Here I would like to remind you that the European Union is still moving at two speeds, and even by three already, as many of the poorer regions in the European Union, instead of catching up, are significantly behind others. The standard of living and the economy of new member states such as Bulgaria are still far from the level of western member states, and the EU's cohesion policy does not yield a visible result.

We must not lose sight of our common objective of creating good jobs. Mr Juncker and Mr Katainen have also announced this with their 'Triple Social A'. We will judge them against that promise. Confidence in Europe has been shaken by the crisis and the resulting high unemployment rate of 9.7%. This is used to capitalise on anti-democratic movements throughout Europe and offer supposedly simple solutions in times of complex problems. We must show people that Europe is more than competitiveness at all costs. Jobs must not be created for the purpose of lower unemployment rates in the short term, but must be under the guiding principle of sustainability.

This new agreement should be universal and capable of keeping us on track to limit the average global temperature increase to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has indicated in its latest synthesis report that the target of 2°C and global emissions reduction of 40-70% compared to 2010 are needed by 2015, and that emission levels should be near zero or below in 2100. We have less than 10 months and we need to use this time efficiently. The results of the Lima Climate Change Conference, and a sense of urgency expressed by world leaders at the UN climate summit in September, provide a necessary impetus for the work this year. The Lima call for climate action, adopted in December, contains two main outcomes. The first is guidance for the communication of proposed emission-reduction targets, the so-called ‘intended nationally determined contributions’, and the second is the preparation of elements for the draft negotiating text for the Paris agreement. In the Paris agreement, all parties should have legally binding mitigation commitments, but levels of ambition and commitment types will differ. Intended nationally determined contributions should therefore allow each party to choose its contribution type and define its level of ambition, in accordance with its national circumstances and capabilities. In October last year, EU leaders endorsed a target to reduce the EU’s domestic emissions by at least 40% in 2030 compared to 1990, in line with its long-term objective of reducing emissions by 80-95% by 2050. The strategic framework is now to be translated into an EU intended contribution. The Presidency of the Council is determined to ensure that the EU intended contribution is submitted to the secretariat of the UN Framework Climate Change Conference within the first quarter of 2015. We expect other major economies to come forward promptly with their contributions as well. The Paris agreement should go well beyond mitigation targets capable of delivering on the below-2°C objective. It should also be dynamic, with inbuilt flexibility and capacity to respond to evolving circumstances, responsibilities and capabilities. It should provide a long-term vision of the need for transformation towards a lower-emission and climate-resilient economy and it should enable broad and effective participation. Let me underscore that, despite the significant progress, there are still important issues on which a shared global vision has yet to emerge, in particular on differentiation between countries’ obligations on the legal form and force of the Paris agreement.  Intensive negotiations will be needed in order to find common ground on these outstanding core issues. The Presidency of the Council will make all possible efforts to ensure effective European Union participation at the international negotiation sessions. Outreach activities planned to take place throughout 2015 will be a crucial element in this process. They will contribute to the ongoing discussions. We have to talk to our partners all around the world to try to find common ground. Moreover, in order to ensure an appropriate background for negotiations, we need to make sure that the EU’s efforts on emissions reduction and support for developing countries are adequately recognised. The Presidency of the Council will also stimulate EU-internal political debate on climate change with a view to the Paris conference. The Environmental Council in March will be the first opportunity to discuss the EU’s expectations and strategy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 189, "date": "2015-01-28.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my satisfaction to have this opportunity to exchange views on the European Union's climate action plans and activities on the conclusion of a comprehensive climate agreement which we want to reach in just over ten months at the United Nations Summit in Paris. First of all, I would like to share with you my assessment of the Lima Conference. I have already had the opportunity to do so with the representatives of this House during that Conference, in the context of the daily meetings we held during the last COP. That is why many of you know that I believe that the Lima COP was an important step in our efforts to reach a comprehensive agreement in Paris. It would highlight three conclusions of the Lima Conference. First, the decision to reiterate the need for all countries to submit their respective national emission reduction contributions at the end of March, known in English as intended nationally determined contributions. Secondly, agreement was reached on information requirements, which should clearly, transparently and understandably describe these contributions. Finally, the decision mandated the United Nations to prepare a synthesis report once all the respective contributions have been submitted. This report should allow us to assess the progress we are willing to make collectively to keep the increase in global warming below two degrees Celsius. Lima has also been a palpable demonstration of the unity of the European Union. There was great collaboration between ministers and with the European Parliament. We were able to react to changing circumstances satisfactorily and hope that this collaboration will continue throughout this year. However, much remains to be done this year. The draft of the final text elements of the agreement is too long and contains excessive options. Very important issues remain to be resolved, such as the legal form of the future agreement, climate finance and differentiation in national emission reduction contributions. In order to clearly articulate our vision of the objectives to be achieved by the Paris agreement, in the coming weeks I will present to the College of Commissioners a Communication entitled 'The Paris Protocol, a project to combat climate change beyond 2020'. This Communication has two main objectives: first, to describe how we intend the Paris Protocol to be dynamic, transparent and legally binding and, as such, capable of responding to economic and geopolitical realities; and, secondly, to translate the objectives of the European Union's climate and energy strategy by 2030 into our emission reduction contribution, in accordance with the information transparency requirements agreed in Lima. The Communication will reiterate that we must work hard to reach an agreement in Paris that applies to all. The United States and China are committed to action and, together with the European Union, would account for nearly half of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. But all countries that can submit their national emission reduction contributions this year, as we agreed in Warsaw. All G20 countries and other major economies are certainly in a position to do so. But, in parallel, and throughout 2015, we will need to mobilize our energies in the area of climate diplomacy, we will need to continue to dialogue with our partners and friends about our vision for the new agreement and encourage them to present their national emission reduction targets. Of course, the Commission is committed to working to maintain the European Union's leadership on climate action and, together with Commission Vice-President Federica Mogherini, we will work to raise awareness among all international actors this year. Next week I will be in Washington to meet with my counterparts from the State Department, the Department of Energy and the White House and on February 4th we will hold a meeting with Chinese Minister Xie Zhenhua and the Secretary-General of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Last week the Vice-President and High Representative and myself presented a climate diplomacy plan at the Foreign Affairs Council which was supported by the Foreign Ministers. Implementing this plan together will contribute very positively to raising awareness of large numbers of countries, both in bilateral meetings and within the framework of the G7 and G20. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the climate finance, an essential issue not only for the Paris agreement, but also for the credibility of the European Union as an international player. In 2013 the European Union and its Member States contributed EUR 9.5 billion in climate finance, but there is no doubt that the European Union and the Member States have to continue their efforts. Together with the Ministers of Finance and Development Cooperation, we must be able to engage with our partners on this fundamental issue, in order to complete an ambitious agreement in Paris. In addition to the climate negotiations we are also negotiating the post-2015 sustainable development goals. On this issue, Commissioners Vella and Mimica are leading the work within the Commission, and we will work together to ensure that our action is coherent. At the same time we will continue to work together with the private sector and other international institutions, such as the World Bank, to mobilize more resources. Ladies and gentlemen, success for the European Union is to be able to speak with one voice Parliament, the Commission and the Member States. I will therefore continue to work closely with this House and the Council to reach an ambitious, legally binding and applicable agreement in Paris for all countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 190, "date": "2015-01-28.json", "name": "Ivo Belet", "mepid": "28257", "text": "   on behalf of the PPE Group. I think we can say that the European Union still has the most ambitious climate policy in the world: a 40% reduction by 2030. I don't think anyone's doing any better. Meanwhile, while things are moving slowly in India and China, there is some cause for optimism towards Paris. In Canada and Australia, on the other hand, political leaders have yet to see the light. So be it. We hope that something will happen there. But first and foremost, we have to look at ourselves, finish our own homework. That means we want to follow a double track. On the one hand, as the Commissioner said, pursue an ambitious climate policy and, on the other hand, a strong economy. We are convinced that this can go hand in hand.  This does indeed require a balanced reform of our unique ETS system. With that market stability reserve system in the first place, we need to make that ETS a stable system in the short term. And also a system that is shock proof, that is, it is resistant to shocks and that we need to have a good solution for the back loaded allowances, which is balanced at the same time. By this I mean such an ETS reform with market stability reform that industrial companies that invest in sustainable technology also get all the opportunities and remain encouraged. To ensure that we do not find ing a situation where sustainable production is moving away from Europe to just across the border, outside the European Union, where there is no ETS system. It is therefore a matter of trying to achieve those 2030 targets with all sectors, ETS and non-ETS.

We might be pessimistic, but the good thing is: we have an agreement, let us build on that. It has already been said that it is very important that we look at ourselves in the coming months and lead by example. We have a responsibility in the world to do that. Climate diplomacy has already been discussed. Very well, Commissioner, we fully support this. We think it's incredibly important.  But looking at one's own responsibility also means looking at the funding. Mr Belet, who has a particular responsibility in that dossier, has already spoken about it. I think it will be symbolic for the next few weeks if Europe will effectively succeed in taking its responsibility. I make a gesture, which I do not often do, to the PPE Group: let us make a good agreement together, not as it did in Itteren.

The problem is that our plan that we want to implement, which is to reduce emissions by 40%, is a plan that is basically not accepted by the rest of the world – let's call it by name – which will make the European economy much less competitive in this perspective.

So we must leave behind some of those disappointments in Lima and cast our eyes towards what we can finally achieve in Paris. On hearing some of the questions from colleagues, even in my own group, I realise this is going to be a challenge – not just a global challenge but a challenge for Europe itself.

The climate situation has not only been worsening, but this has been happening at a higher rate than expected. There is no doubt about what is going on, we now have solid data and a strong consensus on the part of the scientific community on global climate change.  It is now the turn of policy makers to take responsibility. What we've been doing isn't enough. The commitments we have reached with our global partners are insufficient. We cannot turn a blind eye to this reality and we must act now before it is too late for the planet. As Mr Cañete said here today, many difficult aspects remained unresolved at the Lima Conference. There are many parties involved and many interests concerned and experience shows that they can only be resolved at the highest level by the Heads of Government and State. An example of this is the requirements and financial contributions to the Green Climate Fund. Without the consolidation of this instrument, we will hardly be able to achieve the crucial goal of a global, ambitious and legally binding agreement to limit CO2 emissions. Time is short until the Paris Conference, which will take place later this year. I therefore believe that concerted action by the Member States and the European Commission is essential, and this should be a whole as a diplomatic offensive coordinated by the High Representative of the European Union, Federica Mogherini, with the main international partners, as Mr Cañete also said here in his initial speech.

A genuine solution must be found in Paris, a climate agreement must be reached. Peru, where the climate conference took place, suffers the fourth most from climate change in the world. The visit to Peru was eye-opening. Changes can be seen in everything, food production, the fastest of all. There will be a battle for clean drinking water and edible food. The poorest everywhere suffer the most, and women suffer the most from the poor. Cold, heat, drought, famine and land corrosion are increasing all the time.

I invite you to reread in particular the Commission's paper on job-generating growth: the first sector that will create jobs in Europe is the energy transition sector. But we also need to do it for climate negotiations. Europe, too, is not doing enough. If we purge part of the ETS system, Europe could have a target of 25% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by the end of spring by 2020.

Both the distribution of reduction efforts and technical and financial assistance have yet to be defined, obstacles which, if not removed before the next Paris Agreement, risk failing to negotiate on their own, as happened in Copenhagen in 2009.

Many of them concentrated on the need for climate finance. Climate finance will be a key part of our work in 2015 because public finance will determine in part our credibility in the negotiations. The European Union already has a good story to tell because in 2013 alone, as I said, the Union and its Member States provided EUR 9.5 million in climate finance, including grants and loans from development banks and financial institutions in the Member States. The EU Member States also made almost half of the pledges for the Green Climate Fund. We need more credit for the efforts already being made in what is a difficult economic situation. However, we also need to maintain our efforts to scale up further, in order to provide the reassurances that are needed. We have to use public funding in a smart way. Public grant finance should be used to support the poorest and most vulnerable countries but it must also be used to leverage private investment in low-emission and climate-resilient technologies. Here too the European Union has an impressive story to tell. Some Members asked how we are going to coordinate with the sustainable development goals process. Financing for development and climate finance must go hand in hand. We can be successful only if we integrate climate objectives into national development and into our development and cooperation portfolios. We work closely with our colleagues in development cooperation and with developing countries to ensure that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the climate processes recognise and make use of the synergies between development and climate action. Inside the European Union we have been doing our homework. The Union has made a commitment that at least 20% of its entire budget for 2014-2020 should be spent on climate-relevant projects, and this provision applies not only to the Union’s internal spending but also to our development cooperation budget. I would also repeat that it will be very important to involve the finance ministers in the run-up to Paris. It is planned that the finance ministers will discuss climate finance in the Ecofin Council, and we expect Ecofin Council conclusions on climate finance in the second half of 2015. There was a specific question on how we were going to handle land use with regard to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDC). I can tell Members that land use will be part of the European Union INDC because the INDC will be a translation of the October European Council conclusions on the 2030 climate and energy framework, and they are clear that LULUCF (Land use, Land Use Change and Forestry) LULUCF is covered in the EU target of domestic in-house emissions reduction of at least 40%. The question is not ‘if’ but ‘how’ to do it, because we have to design good accounting rules, building on and streamlining existing approaches, and they have to ensure environmental integrity and foster ambitious climate action in the land sector. We are working intensively on this but the issue will not be resolved by the time the EU INDC is presented. Many Polish Members have expressed concern about whether our climate ambitions could hamper the development of industry. I have to tell them that the agreement reached at the October Council was unanimous and, specifically in relation to that point, when we were discussing the conditions of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) the policy situation was taken into account. There are very specific measures that we will have to take account of when we draw up our ETS proposal: we will have to take into account the different situations. There are still many things that we have to tackle ahead of Paris. There are the problems of differentiation between countries’ obligations depending on their responsibilities and capabilities. There are also the questions of climate finance and the legal form and force of the future agreement. Still to be determined, too, are the extent to which, and how, the 2015 agreement will address controversial issues such as adaptation to the impacts of climate change, and dealing with loss and damage when those impacts occur, promoting or regulating international carbon markets and establishing how we are going to save them. That is why it is important that this Parliament is able to deliver soon on the carbon market and the stability reserve, so that we will arrive in Paris with a credible proposal on the basis that we have put into action an efficient carbon market and have given clear signals to industry to move in the direction of a low-carbon economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 226, "date": "2015-01-28.json", "name": "Zanda Kalniņa-Lukaševica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for this debate which confirms the importance and urgency of the international negotiations in 2015 towards reaching an agreement on the post-2020 climate regime in Paris. We recognise that the Lima negotiations have been difficult. However, we should not give up when confronted by difficult situations and the work on finding agreement should continue, as there is no alternative to the Paris conference. When it comes to announcements by the United States and China, I would like to stress that the US-China announcement was very important in that it is the first time that the two biggest emitters, representing 43% of global emissions, jointly announced future mitigation commitments, and in that they did so more than a year before the Paris conference. Of course we will need to have more information in order to analyse the pledge and wait for the others to come forward in order to assess how big a gap separates us from the below-2°C objective. Therefore, we need to see how these announcements will be translated into intended nationally determined contributions. You also mentioned the Climate and Energy Policy Framework 2013. The long-awaited agreement on the 2013 climate and energy framework shows the EU’s determination to respond to climate change with ambitious targets and effective measures. The conclusions of the October 2014 European Council provide essential guidance and building blocks for further work. The ETS market stability reserve proposal, which was issued together with the 2030 framework package a year ago, is a priority file for the Latvian Presidency. We are keen to make very rapid progress on it and hope that informal discussions with the European Parliament can start soon. The roadmap towards Paris will show our obligations and intentions in the international context, and the forthcoming proposals on the Energy Union will be more focused on internal EU processes. Still, I would like to use this opportunity to share with you a few points on the Energy Union. The establishment of the Energy Union is one of the priorities of the Latvian Presidency, as was also made clear by our Prime Minister at the European Parliament’s plenary session two weeks ago. We need an energy policy that is based on solidarity, trust and security, a better-integrated energy infrastructure, more efficient governance and sustainability. As you know, the European Council in December called on the Commission to present a comprehensive energy union proposal before the March European Council, and the Presidency will lead the discussions in the Council to prepare the endorsement of a strategy by the European Council in March. 2015 is a crucial year in the international climate domain and is important for international negotiations on sustainable development. The global agreement on combating climate change has to be achieved in Paris. Successful international negotiations on climate change will be one of the priorities of the Latvian Presidency. We will do everything possible to ensure effective European Union representation at international negotiating sessions, and we understand that on the way to an agreement we must be prepared for very intensive work. This will also be an important year for setting the international sustainable development agenda. On the way a to post-2015 framework development the European Union must convey a strong and united position. This is also highlighted in the resolution of the European Parliament. In order to be fully prepared, the Latvian Presidency intends to organise a discussion at the March Environmental Council on better integration of the environmental dimension in the post-2015 process. I would also like to thank Ms McAvan for bringing the development dimension to today’s discussion, and I would like to recall that 2015 has been marked as European Union Year of Development. We will have the third Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa, the UN post-2015 Summit in New York, and the Paris Conference as a culminating event. Therefore this year will be important, not only to the climate process. We will also have to work hard to agree on the new post-2015 development agenda. The Latvian Presidency stands ready to assist in steering discussions towards a common EU position. The run-up to Paris will see very intensive negotiations and meetings at different levels and in various formats. As on previous occasions, your support in outreach efforts to our partners worldwide is very much appreciated.

The new agreement must be ambitious, legally binding and applicable to all. The fight against climate change is a common cause of nations, it is the responsibility of all of us, and we all bear the consequences.

Hungary has always been committed to combating climate change. It has largely outperformed its previous emission reduction targets. As a member of the European Union, hungary is still part of the most ambitious emission reduction commitment in the international community. It is well known that the EU climate and energy framework adopted last October has set a target of 40% emission reductions by 2030.

In Germany, from 1 January this year, the Minimum Wage Act applies, which must also be subject to carriers, often from eastern European countries. The law requires paying a minimum wage of €8.5 per hour. This, by the way, is four times the Czech minimum wage! I believe that, in this situation, we can boldly say that the minimum wage is aimed at distorting the single market, that it is distorting the wage systems of individual Member States, and that it is essentially creating an indirect obstacle to the freedom to provide services. I think it is a violation of one of the fundamental principles of the European Union, that we cannot accept this and that the Commission must do something about it.

The activity of Russian military planes has increased considerably in European airspace, especially in the Baltic Sea region.

Hence our question is: have we taken the necessary commitments for all kinds of aid to Ukraine, because we could not foresee the events during our discussions about the Multiannual Financial Framework? I am fully aware that there are also other crises going on around the European Union, for instance the Palestinian authorities receiving EUR 500 million each year.
