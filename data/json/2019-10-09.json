We are starting a very important debate. For communications, please ask for the floor earlier, but not when I have already begun to discuss an agenda. I would also ask those Members who are leaving perhaps to stay for a moment because this debate is really important. We are talking about the preparations for the European Council meeting of 17 and 18 October. I would like to thank Mr Juncker, Mr Barnier and Minister Tuppurainen for being with us today. However, I also need to make a few comments, at the very beginning of this debate. As you know, I was invited yesterday by Prime Minister Johnson to London for talks with him. I would like to inform the House because I have taken to Prime Minister Johnson the position that the European Parliament voted on in the last plenary session on the issue of Brexit. Despite some confidence and hope, I have seen that there is not much progress at the moment. As you know, any agreement reached between the Eu ropean Union and the United Kingdom must obtain not only a vote in the House of Commons but also the approval of the European Parliament. Therefore, it is crucial for the Prime Minister to know our position.  Our approach is very simple: we think that an orderly Brexit, a UK exit with a deal, is by far the best outcome. As I explained to Prime Minister Johnson, however, the European Parliament will not accept an agreement at all costs. We will not accept anything that would undermine the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process or undermine the integrity of our single market, as was made abundantly clear in our resolution last September.  We have looked at the proposals put forward by the UNITED Kingdom recently as an alternative to the original back stop. Our assessment of Prime Minister Johnson was that they do not, at the moment, constitute a basis for reaching an agreement. These are ideas, but they are not proposals that are feasible, immediately feasible. There are two alternatives to an agreement at the moment: extension or no agreement. Parliament is, of course, open to the possibility of an extension if there are valid reasons or precise objectives. But requesting an extension is the UK's responsibility and prerogative.  With regard to the possibility of no agreement, I was very clear that this would be a very negative result, which would have serious economic consequences for both sides, but particularly for the United Kingdom and its citizens. A failure to reach agreement would clearly, however, be the responsibility of the British Government. As for the citizens, I reiterated to Prime Minister Johnson that the European Parliament will continue to ensure that their rights are protected, whatever the scenario. I also had a fruitful meeting this morning with House of Commons Speaker John Bercow. I have expressed to him my view that any request by the UK institutions to extend the withdrawal period should serve to give the british people the floor again – as this House has said – by means of referendums or general elections. With John Bercow there has been full consonance about the importance of the role of our parliaments in managing Brexit and there is a common awareness that a disorderly UK exit from the European Union would be against the interests of british and European citizens. I very much hope that a no-deal exit will eventually be avoided, even though in that case the European Union has taken all the necessary measures to prepare for and deal with the consequences.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Tytti Tuppurainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Grazie President, honourable Members of the Parliament, next week’s Council comes at a crucial point. At the upcoming European Council meeting, leaders will be discussing some of the most pressing issues for the Union. Let me start with the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) on which the leaders will have the first substantial discussion. You will recall that the June European Council conclusions expressed the ambition to aim for an agreement before the end of the year. The Presidency has pursued work in line with that ambition. During the past months we have consulted and had extensive discussions with Member States in order to identify their priorities and where the so—called room for negotiation lies. We have now prepared a presidency paper to frame discussions at the October European Council. I believe it will be a good starting point for the leaders to provide further strategic guidance and indications for the Presidency’s MFF work.  The European Council will also discuss the strategic agenda, which leaders adopted in June. After four months they are keen to know how it’s been implemented within the Council, but also, crucially, how it is reflected in the future work of the other institutions, particularly in the Commission work programme. This is why Commission President—elect Ursula von der Leyen will attend the European Council and expand on this point with leaders. It is reassuring to see the largely similar objectives of the strategic agenda and Ms von der Leyen’s political guidelines. Of course, the exchange of views between the leaders and the President of the European Parliament will also be the perfect opportunity to hear the views of the Parliament. Beyond the discussion on the strategic agenda, leaders on this occasion will also formally appoint Christine Lagarde as the President of the European Central Bank. Now, the next topical issue on the agenda is climate change, an existential threat that has been, and still is, at the centre of attention, not least after the discussions in New York. We, as a Union, need to help raise global ambition and continue to lead the way on climate action. This is because we may soon reach a tipping point where we can only mitigate the effects of climate change instead of reversing them. But it is only with concerted global efforts that we can successfully tackle this global phenomenon. So, at the meeting in October, leaders will focus on the international aspects of climate change. They will discuss the outcome of the United Nations’ efforts at the climate summit in New York and they will prepare for the upcoming COP25 in Santiago de Chile in December. I cannot exclude, however, that during the discussion leaders may touch upon the EU’s climate objectives, too. Under external relations, it is likely that the leaders will discuss Turkey in light of its continued drilling activities in the eastern Mediterranean and take into account also broader EU—Turkey relations, including cooperation in migration. The recent developments related to Syria are likely to come up in this context as well and we have just received very worrisome news today. Leaders will also discuss enlargement where the General Affairs Council discussions on the 15th October will be crucial in relation to Albania and North Macedonia. And, honourable Members, finally, Brexit is an issue that is likely to steal the limelight. As you know, on 2nd October the UK submitted proposals to overcome the extremely thorny backstop issue. These proposals do not yet provide a basis for concluding an agreement, but the EU remains fully committed to work with the UK and avoid a no—deal Brexit. Although we are prepared to face it, it would be irresponsible for both sides to ever claim that a no—deal scenario is an attractive option. This would have serious consequences on our borders, our customs, our trade, on our citizens’ rights, all fundamental issues for both the EU and the UK. And yet, the UK crashing out is a dangerously realistic scenario, given the constantly evolving situation, leaders will have to take stock of the very latest developments and decide how best to proceed. So, thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to our discussions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President der Kommission. Herr President, Frau Ratspresidentin, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! Ich fasse mich kurz, weil wir heute Nachmittag relativ spàt in die Gànge gekommen sind und die Frau Ratspràsidentin Wesentliches zu der Tagesordnung des Europeischen Rates gesagt hat, deshalb macht es keinen Sinn, sich hier in 'berflàssigen Wiederholungen zu. Als ich vor fenf Jahren hier antrat, habe ich ein Versprechen abgegeben, und das Versprechen war, dass die Kommission bis zum letzten Moment versuchen wird, konkrete Ergebnisse im Interesse der europeischen Bàrger vorzulegen. Ich stehe zu diesem Versprechen und hoffe, dass der Europ-ische Rat und der Ministerrat dies auch tun, denn die beiden haben ein 'hnliches ' wenn nicht sogar dasselbe - Versprechen abgegeben, das auf dem Tisch das Hauses liegt - Wir messen jetzt die Grundlagen fàr ein stabiles, handlungsf-higes Europa der kommenden Jahre schaffen, und dies setzt voraus, dass wir dringend die Verhandlungen zum mehrj-hrigen Finanzrahmen voranbringen bzw. abschlieen. Dies setzt voraus, dass wir uns mit aller Entschlossenheit im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel bew-hren, und dies setzt voraus, dass wir uns fàr die Stabilitet unser Region und dar-ber hinaus einsetzen. Sehr wichtig ist eine Einigung 'ber den mehrj-hrigen Finanzrahmen. Der Gipfel nechste Woche muss yesterday wirklich wesentliche Fortschritte erzielen, weil sich die Menschen in Europa auf die politische Fàhrung in der European Union verlassen kunnnen messen. Ich bin missvergn-gt, wenn ich dieses Gepl-nkel zwischen Mitgliedstaaten, zwischen Mitgliedstaaten und Kommission, zwischen Mitgliedstaaten, Kommission und Parlament beobachte. Wir sind nicht auf der Hàhe unserer Aufgabe. Wir sollten jetzt weniger reden und endlich zu Beschlàssen kommen, weil es sehr darauf ankommt, dass wir sicherstellen, dass europeische Forscher ihre Projekte fortsetzen kunnnen, es kommt darauf an, dass junge Menschen ihr Erasmus und es kommt darauf an, dass die geplanten Infrastrukturprojekte vorankommen. Deshalb messen wir das Budget - den budget-ren Rahmen - schnell beschlieen. Die Kommission hat relativ fràh - meiner Erinnerung nach im Murz, April, May 2018 - ihre Vorschl-ge zur mehrj-hrigen Finanzplanung vorgelegt. Anderthalb Jahre Debatte ohne erkennbare Fortschritte! Wir haben nicht noch einmal anderthalb Jahre Zeit. Wenn wir nicht zu Potte kommen vor Ende dieses Jahres, spàtestens Anfang nechsten Jahres, wird es nicht meglich sein, die Projekte, die Programme, die Absichten, die Initiativen, die geplant sind, in die Tat umzusetzen. Machen wir nicht noch einmal den Fehler, den wir bei der letzten mehrj-hrigen Finanzplanung gemacht haben, bei der wir uns erst einen Monat vor Inkrafttreten des Finanzrahmens geeinigt haben, was zur Folge hatte, dass wir zwei wertvolle Jahre verloren haben - von 2014 bis 2016 Es reicht jetzt! Wir messen uns beeilen, denn es geht nicht um uns, es geht nicht um die Institutionen, sondern es geht um die Menschen in Europa. Ohnliches gilt fer die Herausforderungen, die im direkten Zusammenhang mit der Migrationsproblematik stehen. Auch hier hatte die Kommission im Frahjahr 2015 Vorschl-ge vorgelegt. Die wurden mit qualifierzierter Mehrheit im Rat angenommen, die werden aber nicht umgesetzt. Ich hette gerne, dass der Europeische Rat sich diesem Thema wieder voll zuwendet und dafar sorgt, dass hier Fortschritte erzielt werden. Migration ist wichtig, der Haushaltsrahmen ist auch wichtig. Ich wise yesterday, was ich gestern gesagt habe und was ich 'bermorgen wiederholen werde' - also solange ich hier noch herumspuken kann: Wer denkt, dass europeische Aufgaben der Zukunft innerhalb eines Finanzrahmens von 1% of the kollektiven Reichtums der Europeischen Union Ich sage dies dem Parlament, ich sage dies dem Ratsvorsitz, und ich werde dies auch dem Europeischen Rat noch einmal eindringlich in den H-rkanal einflie-en lassen.  Mr President, it is clear that climate change is one of the major challenges ahead. We were the first major economy in the world to commit to the Paris Agreement, which would not have been possible without the European Union. A legislative framework, rules and not just words must now be put in place in order to achieve all the objectives of this agreement, by stimulating investment and social justice, which is not the least of the problems in the sectors in transition. It is clear that climate neutrality must be achieved by 2050 at the latest. It is no less clear that the global transition to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement must accelerate. It is in this spirit that the multiple trade agreements of the European Union, which we have concluded in recent years and which are legally binding, will continue to contain specific commitments on the implementation of the Paris Agreement, as will our agreement with Japan and also the agreement signed with Mercosur, which does not betray the objectives of the Paris agreement. And while we can doubt the goodwill of those who are supposed to implement them, the fact remains that, for the first time in the history of the European Union, and therefore for the first time in the history of trade agreements, we have insisted on environmental standards AND social standards. So we have an instrument that we can use to get the most recalcitrant, the most reluctant to do what they have promised to do. I will say, Mr President, one or two words about enlargement. I said at the beginning of my mandate that there would be no further enlargement or membership in the legislature. Some of you have been saddened by this and this has also caused outrage in the Western Balkans region. But it is clear that to be responsible, one had to be sincere. It was absolutely clear that there would be no enlargement between 2014 and 2019. But if it is right and justified to be sincere, we must also be sincere towards those who want to join. Northern Macedonia and Albania have made substantial progress. That is why President Sassoli, President Tusk, President-elect von der Leyen and I have written a letter to the Member States urging them to keep the promises that had been made to the countries of the Western Balkans, including Northern Macedonia and Albania.  When Europe has a strong will, there is always a way to achieve the commonly accepted objectives. I take as an example the Prespa agreement between Northern Macedonia and Greece. The European framework and the European perspective have helped to resolve a conflict that has lasted for decades. The reforms that Albania has undertaken with courage allow us to envisage, not generously but favourably, the opening of negotiations with Albania and Northern Macedonia. But enlargement is not an end in itself. It is not enough to expand. It's not enough to expand galore: no! It is also a question of deepening the european construction by building on the values that are common to us, and which should not be abandoned when joining the European Union.  I would like to add some words on Turkey, which is characterised by relations with the European Union which are as complex and as important as ever. Turkey is, of course, a key partner for the European Union, not least when it comes to cooperation on migration. My full commitment, and that of the Commission - and, hopefully, that of our Union - to the implementation of the EU-Turkish statements of 2016 remains clear. The facility for refugees in Turkey continues to deliver concrete results on the ground, and this should not be forgotten. There are other issues on which I cannot be so complimentary when it comes to Turkey's illegal drilling operations in the eastern Mediterranean. I have to repeat that in this respect (in others too, but mainly in this respect), I'm a Cypriot, and I will remain in full solidarity with Cyprus. Turkey has security concerns at its border with Syria. However, I call on Turkey, as well as on the other actors, to act with restraint and to stop operations - already, as we are speaking, on their way. This military action is not leading to a good result, and we have to bring this to the attention of our Turkish friends. And I have to say, if the Turkish plan involves the creation of a so-called safe zone, don't expect the European Union to pay for any of it. A sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict and only be reached through a genuine political transition. President, dear honourable Members, as the European Union moves forward, we must also deal with the departure of a Member State. That was the choice of the British people, not a choice of a few European Union - although we are respecting that choice. As it stands, we remain in discussions with the United Kingdom on the terms of its departure. And personally, I don't exclude a deal. Michel and myself are working on a deal, and we are not accepting this blame game which started in London. We should not be blamed. But we'll see in the coming days how things will develop. My friend Michel Barnier will elaborate on this. I would like to repeat, for the attention of our British friends, that there is not only a parliament in Westminster that has to agree; there is a Parliament here. Without the agreement of the European Parliament, nothing will be possible.  I promised to be brief. As always, I didn't keep my promises.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 24, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Michel Barnier", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Chief Negotiator. Mr President, Madam Minister, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission, Mr President, a few words in addition to what President Juncker has just said. So the British negotiators have given us their proposals and with their own team, which is a competent and professional team - I want to say this - they are trying to explain to us, to clarify , we ourselves are asking a lot of questions in all the technical meetings that have taken place in the last few days.  And to put it simply and frankly, objectively, as I speak to you, we are not at the point of considering and reaching an agreement, as you yourself have, Mr President Sassoli, reminded Prime Minister Johnson with great clarity, a great deal of strength - and I thank you on behalf of Parliament - yesterday.  And yet time is running out, ladies and gentlemen. We are now one week away from the European Council and a few days away from that date of 31 October, which was agreed with the previous government for the UK's exit from the European Union in an orderly form which, as you said, is much better than a disorderly exit. Why aren't we there? Because the British proposals raise three major problems. First on the issue of the border and control over property on the island of Ireland. Prime Minister Johnson rejected the backstop, which is a kind of insurance or safety net that we had agreed on with Theresa May's government, as soon as he arrived. At the same time, Prime Minister Johnson recognises that regulatory alignment for goods is essential between Northern Ireland and the European Union and we obviously agree on this point.  On the other hand, in order to solve the problem of customs controls, the United Kingdom simply proposes that we make a legal commitment in the international treaty that binds us to avoid, in all circumstances, customs or regulatory controls and any physical infrastructure on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Of course, we share this objective, which is one of the objectives of the backstop: that there be no borders, no infrastructure. But what we are really asked to do is to accept a system that is not developed, that is not tested, of controls scattered on the island of Ireland and this would be largely based on exemptions, derogations from the European customs code, technologies that have yet to be developed, changes to international law which is provided for by the common transit Convention and finally a new compliance system but without the guarantees that are provided for by the protocol.  Ladies and gentlemen, we need at every limit of the single market and our customs union, we need at each of these limits of customs controls, serious and rigorous regulatory controls everywhere, outside, at the external border of this single market. In Ireland, as everywhere else, we need operational controls, real controls, credible controls. It is the credibility of the single market that is at stake and therefore the credibility towards consumers, businesses and also, we do not forget, the third countries with which we negotiate agreements. That is the first point of disagreement. The second point concerns the requirement that we believe is legitimate to find legally operational solutions. With the protocol, we have established a safety net that clarifies the applicable regime on the island of Ireland and this safety net is legally operational as it would apply until we find until and unless an alternative solution. By proposing to remove this safety net, to remove the backstop and to look for alternative solutions during the transition period, that is to say later, the British proposal does not give us the security of the protocol. An example: there is no real solution for small and medium-sized enterprises in these British proposals, except to propose a general exemption. Second example: what would happen if the joint committee, to which the British want to return all the unanswered questions at this time, did not reach an agreement during the transition? According to British projections, the solution would then depend on the adoption of unilateral measures to be taken by the United Kingdom or by the European Union. There would then, of course, be a significant risk to the integrity of the single market, since the British proposals would at the same time commit us to never providing for control at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will become two different jurisdictions. The third point of disagreement, as I speak to you, is obviously that of the British proposal on consent. We have always regretted Stormont's absence for two and a half years to give a strong and strong Northern Irish voice in our negotiations. In the existing protocol, we have mechanisms with the British that allow the representation of Northern Ireland. We are ready to re-examine new ideas for a greater role for the Northern Irish institutions in implementing the protocol in accordance with the Good Friday Belfast Agreement.  But today, the British proposal, as it is on the table, is simply to condition the implementation of the protocol on a unilateral decision by the institutions of Northern Ireland, which could then unilaterally decide, from the outset, the day after the ratification by your House and the House of Commons of the withdrawal agreement, not to activate at all the solution proposed for Northern Ireland. And then, if it were still activated, the Northern Irish authorities could decide every four years to challenge it. Ladies and gentlemen, the British Government's proposal today as it is - and we cannot accept - would replace an operational, practical, legal solution with a hypothetical and temporary solution. Finally, there is a fourth point which really causes us problems, which is not about the withdrawal agreement but about the political declaration, which is next to the withdrawal agreement and which is very important, because it describes what will happen after Brexit, with an agreement, I hope, and even without agreement, it is not a destination , everything that has been unravelled - 44 years of integration and cooperation - will have to be rebuilt with the United Kingdom, and a relationship will have to be rebuilt in all areas: trade, security, universities, fishing, aviation, police and judicial cooperation, defence and security. And we describe with the British government the framework of this future relationship in this political statement.  Today, Mr. Johnson is asking us to focus on the future of our economic relationship only on a basic free trade agreement and not on other options, which we had left open in the political declaration. It also asks us to remove the agreed references with Theresa May on a very important point which is the level playing field, that is, a basic rule of the game, a foundation of loyalty and rules of the game in tax matters, state aid, social rights, environmental rights, consumer rights. That is it, and so we are facing this demand. (Applause) We are faced with this demand, which suggests the risk for us, with a basic free trade agreement, of having to face regulatory competition, or even a risk of tax, social or environmental dumping, which we will not accept. That is why I say, on this point, that the ambition and level of our future free trade agreement with the United Kingdom - because there will be a free trade agreement - will be proportional to the level of commitments made by the British authorities for a sustainable rule of the common game. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, no one in London or elsewhere should be surprised that the European Union is committed to achieving legally sound and sustainable operational solutions in this withdrawal agreement. What for? For an extremely simple reason, Brexit, when it happens, will be sustainable. Because Brexit today creates - as we know and I have said for the last three years - concrete, precise, serious problems, in particular, and first in Ireland and in relation to the concrete, precise, serious, immediate problems created by Brexit, we need today and not tomorrow operational solutions that are legally binding for both sides and that are precise. In the serious and important moment we are at, we will remain, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have always been, calm, vigilant and constructive at the same time as we remain respectful of the United Kingdom and those who run it. It is in this attitude and with this attitude on both sides that we can have the ambition to reach an agreement that works for both sides.  We will therefore remain with our team, which is your team, in constant cooperation with the European Parliament, with the Brexit steering group - and I thank its members and in particular Guy Verhofstadt - with all the Member States, we will remain available 24 hours a day, in the days to reach an agreement. It is in this spirit that I will meet again tomorrow with the British Minister Steve Barclay.  I just want to say that, in the scrupulous respect of the mandate given to us by the European Council, in accordance with the resolutions - you yourself have spoken of your last resolution, Mr President - those of the European Parliament, which are very important to me, we will continue to work. I think I can say today that, although it is very difficult , for the reasons I have just indicated, if there is goodwill on both sides, an agreement is still possible with the British.

I would like to begin by thanking you for the solidarity you have expressed today with the victims of Halle. Mr President, there has been an attack on Jewish life on German soil, and that is a shock to everyone, especially me as a German. That is why Thank you for that. This horrific crime that has taken place must be condemned. I would also like to thank the police. Anti-Semites and all those who question the freedom of faith are not only our opponents, they are our enemies. We are all called upon to stand up and say 'no' to anti-Semitism. (Applause) Mr President, we are preparing the European Council, and I would like to begin by following on from the important basic messages of Jean-Claude Juncker. People now expect clear answers from us to the tasks of our time. In these hours, these days, there are many mayors, regional ministers in Brussels, because the Committee of the Regions meets. And they are waiting for answers: what will happen to the financing of regional support, with the MFF? Can we continue to finance our projects on the ground, yes or no? Many people are attached to these MFF plans and that is why we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats expect progress to finally be made at this summit. I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency for the progress made on the matter, but the bosses must now also take care of it. I would like to make one thing clear to us, namely that the MFF discussion is not, first of all, a discussion about percentages, but about the political projects that we want to implement. And if certain countries in the European Union continue to insist on having only percentage discussions, then we must counter that these announced percentages will not be able to cope with the very tasks that lie ahead. We will not be able to make a master plan for Africa. We will not be able to strengthen Frontex. We will not be able to tackle the research work in the fight against cancer and, ladies and gentlemen, we will also have to make concessions on how we promote our regions. With all these tasks, we now need clarity, and that is why I hope that the Council will achieve results here. Secondly, of course, I would like to address the likely top issue– Brexit. First of all, I am less concerned with the content, because we fully support Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier and we thank them for the work we have done to keep Europe together and to describe clear negotiating lines. It is well known that he can count on our support in this. What drives us more, what drives me more, is the style that has now moved into the debate. If there is a phone call yesterday between Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel and then this is exactly what is happening, that we accuse each other of not making progress in the talks, then we have to ask ourselves what happened. What is actually happening in the foundations when, unfortunately, God's party politics are obviously more important than the interest of the country that these negotiations are supposed to be about? For me, it is a sign that Boris Johnson's ideas were not presented at a plenary debate in the House of Commons, nor in talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, but that Boris Johnson's initiatives on the future of Brexit negotiations were presented at the Tory party conference. This shows very clearly that it is obviously not a question of reliable, sensible negotiations, but of party politics, and this must also be branded, it must also be said that for a serious politician, for sensible politics, it is important to bring together interests and not to divide a country. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she Trade policy is one of the things that still concerns us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I would just like to mention that we now have WTO decisions, and I hope that we will now bewise to act wisely between the United States and Europe, namely to find a common path that does not lead to a trade war. A trade war would bring joy to others, but not to Europe, nor to America, and that is why we need the outstretched hand to the Americans in order to resolve these conflicts now. Finally, i.e. a thought on the question of Turkey, which will also move us. The list is now long: illegal migration is increasing again, and it does not appear to be stopped by the Turkish authorities. We have drilling in Cypriot waters, obviously illegal activities. We have the fact that a kind of backstop solution is now being practised via the Turkish-occupied territories in Cyprus, unregulated products are coming onto the European market. We have the military activities, which are very worrying, where we know that the Kurds were partners in the fight against ISIS and helped us there, and the general question of the values of freedom of the press in Turkey. That is why I hope that Turkey, as a partner, will continue to take the European Union's partnership approach seriously. On the other hand, we should also ask whether the good economic relations between the European Union and Turkey can be maintained in the long term if, unfortunately, we have a partner with Turkey who is more aggressive than a partnership. We are ready for partnership in all these areas, but Turkey must also know that if the partnership is not practised, it will have consequences.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Iratxe García Pérez", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the next European Council debate on 17 and 18 October plans to discuss a set of key challenges for the future of the European Union: the budgetary framework for 2021-2027, the Union's priorities for the next five years, Brexit and climate change. Our aspiration for a tightly united Peoples' Europe will only come true if we are able to agree on a strong budget. With the Resolution to be voted on tomorrow by this House, we reaffirm our firm commitment to the priorities and items included in the interim report on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027, which we will adopt in November 2019. Additional financial support is essential to carry out the commitments made by the President-elect of the European Commission and, in particular, for a fair ecological transition. We have been waiting since November to be able to enter into negotiations with the Council, which means that we have wasted almost a year. We therefore call on the Council to begin negotiations for the next budgetary framework and remind it, moreover, that this budgetary framework is decided by codecision; that is to say, we will not tolerate any attempt on the part of the Council to undermine the prerogatives of this Parliament. Just as we will not approve the next multiannual budget if agreement on the reform of the European Union's own resources system is not reached first. Because only with an ambitious budget will the Union be able to meet the priorities of the Strategic Agenda for the years 2019—2024. Within the framework of the Strategic Agenda, heads of state and government have a responsibility to urgently fulfil the following priorities: the development of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which is an absolute priority in order to move forward in a fairer Europe; reform of Dublin's asylum and immigration system; the mainstreaming of the Sustainable Development Goals in the European Semester, and the objective of a climate-neutral Europe by 2050; the combination of banking and tax union and the fight against tax evasion to ensure a fair contribution to the strengthening of the Europe of well-being. Only by responding to these priorities can we eradicate the populist discourse that fiercely plagues our continent; a discourse that only understands patriotism as a weapon against the other and not as the defense of a common good. This is the same speech that arrincona to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and which leads to his country, which has been a beacon of democracy and enlightenment, to the darkness of ignorance and inscrace. For this reason, we will not accept your government's proposal to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol with a new protocol that does not envisage the so-called backstop. Let us be clear: the Social Democrats will only support a proposal to prevent a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Any solution should avoid putting the peace process at risk and protect the integrity of our single market, in defence of consumers and businesses. Our political family is strong, as we have done in the past Plenary in which we adopted the Resolution. We are prepared to support an extension of Article 50 to avoid a Brexit without agreement because it would harm us all - let us be clear - to all, to Europe, to the United Kingdom, to citizenship as a whole. And we are also talking about issues that are currently fundamental on the Agenda: the fight against climate change. In this context, the recent New York Climate Action Summit has shown that only the European Union can exercise the leadership needed in this area. The fight against climate change and compliance with the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals are of vital importance for the European Union and developing countries to face the devastating economic, social and environmental consequences caused by human activity. Consistent implementation of the Union's different external and internal policies and a robust financial framework for the implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures are key to reducing the impact of global warming. On 17 and 18 October, a window of opportunity to solve the problems of citizens opens before the leaders of the European Council. This Parliament is ready.

Mr President, the Council will have the Brexit issue on the agenda again. I welcome the fact that the UK Government finally produced some proposals last week, but I am also very concerned about their content. We have always been open to workable and legally operable solutions, but let's be clear: as they currently stand, they cannot be the basis of an agreement. As they currently stand, we will not and cannot support them. Any new UK proposals need to respect the Good Friday Agreement, protecting our citizens and the integrity of the single market. We have grave concerns about the UK proposal, not least fuelled by the latest recriminations arriving from London. This is not and should never be a blame game. We still have time to avoid a no-deal situation that would be catastrophic.  Speaking now of the budget, which is also on the agenda of the Council's debates, we must have a clear perspective on the direction we want to give Europe. The European budget is linked to the political direction we give to Europe, it is not just numbers. Let us not forget that our constituents and citizens expect us to implement the program we committed to in July. We need political perspectives, but we also need fiscal perspectives. The European budget is not just about numbers, it is also a political vision, a vision of the added value of Europe. This is the time to prove that we are, in fact, assuming this European project. A real European budget should have its own resources. We must have the courage to address this subject, not to avoid it, and to find a way to share the burden of this budget between the contribution of the Member States and the own resources, in order to have a clear vision on these budgetary perspectives.

But he is confronted with a hostile and antagonistic, inflexible European Union, conspiring with traitors back home, concentrated in the British Parliament and the judiciary, whose sole aim would be to frustrate the will of the people and surrender to the enemy. This is the story that Prime Minister Johnson wants to tell.  The reality is that Prime Minister Johnson does not want a deal. Listen, if we were to sign the British proposals, we would commit – forever – to keeping a 500 km stretch of EU external border, with no controls – forever – without any firm guarantee that goods crossing that border would meet EU regulatory standards – notably, safety and security standards – and with no guarantee that customs tariffs would be paid. That is the kind of blank cheque that Prime Minister Johnson wants us to sign. No jurisdiction in the world would ever accept this, especially from a neighbour whose stated intention, as has been repeatedly said, is to undercut the European Union’s social and environmental taxation standards. No one would accept this.  But you understand: these proposals are not there to be accepted. They are meant to lead the country to a no—deal Brexit for which the EU27 could be blamed. It’s not hard to read into Prime Minister Johnson’s game. And it now depends on all responsible women and men within the British Parliament to prevent this from happening and to muster their collective strength to put the interests of the country front and centre. Now, dear friends, I will just say one thing. We are all Members of Parliament here and we are proud of this. I listened to Prime Minister Johnson’s speech at the Tory Party Conference the other day. A few days after having illegally attempted to close down his Parliament, that Prime Minister was openly mocking, humiliating and deriding Parliament – the Parliament from which his own legitimacy derives. Dear friends, when chiefs of the executive – in any country – trample like this on parliaments, what is at stake is democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Nicolas Bay", "mepid": "124760", "text": "  On behalf of the ID Group. - Mr President, Mr Juncker, Mr Barnier, on Brexit, you say both no to Boris Johnson's proposal, not to an exit without a deal.  You reject the British government's proposal, when it is clearly a balanced position in that it allows both Britain's exit from the European Union and the customs union, which is the democratic will expressed by the British more than three years ago, and that it respects the Good Friday agreements.  You present the backstop negotiated between you and Theresa May (but against the advice of the British) as a 'safety net'. But you know very well that it is much more than that. In reality, it is about keeping Britain in all the european Union's arrangements, with the same financial contribution, and this situation could last until the thorny problem of the Irish border is resolved. You are well aware that the position you are defending is unacceptable to the British, unacceptable to the majority in the House of Commons, and that it results in a situation of total deadlock for which you will bear responsibility. With regard to the multi-year financial framework, which will be at the heart of the debates of the next Council, there are two pitfalls on which we will be very vigilant. The first is the inflation of expenditure, the increase in the budget, the ever-increasing expenditure of the European Union, which is also always further removed from the concerns of the citizens and in particular from what they have expressed to the last Europeans. The other pitfall, of course, is the idea of own resources: a European tax system that would not replace national taxation but would be added to it, making the tax burden in our states ever greater.  And, finally, I saw Mr Macron among the Heads of State, Mr Timmermans among the European Commissioners, speaking recently to condition the European Union's Structural Funds on respect for the so-called rule of law, obviously targeting Poland, Hungary and a number of other countries.  They should still remember that in the last European elections, the Law and Justice party in Poland, Viktor Orban's Fidesz in Hungary, were the parties that, in all countries, all political parties combined, achieved the best results. They are the ones with the greatest democratic legitimacy.  This should encourage the European Commission to respect them, because the Commission will never have the legitimate democracy that these heads of state and government have. Even though the European Union refuses to condition the financial aid granted to African countries to control their migration flows, it would at the same time want, within the European Union, to ban countries and deprive them of the financial resources to which they can legitimately claim on the pretext that they would not respect an alleged rule of law which has in fact become a political weapon against them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Raffaele Fitto", "mepid": "4465", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to the speeches of previous speakers, including Mr Juncker and the other representatives.  I'd start with a figure. I hope that, important as it is, there will be very little talk of enlargement and much more of the concrete and real issues that concern us, among which I believe there are very serious emergencies and urgencies. I have listened to political positions, including lessons in style and behaviour from a Parliament in which, for example, during the last parliamentary term and in the Steering Group, which refers to itself as the balancing act for a joint proposal by Parliament, there are parliamentary groups that have been deliberately and unjustififully excluded without there being a reason for them, in order to be able to build positions that are artfully party-political. So I think that, before we give lessons, we should try to start from this attitude and, above all, start from a given. Apart from the positions, the negotiations are difficult, as Mr Barnier specifically explained, but there is certainly a fact that cannot be ignored, which is that of the need to reach an agreement because we will have to continue to have a fundamental relationship with the United Kingdom from an economic, commercial and relationship point of view. That is why the idea that we can continue to insult what we may not like is unacceptable, but it is the Prime Minister of a country. You may not agree with your position, you will have to find agreement with difficulty, but agreement must be reached, because the theme is that that country has a government, which may not please certain political groups in this House, but it is a government which, until proven otherwise, when there are new elections, is entitled to deal with its positions and also deserves the respect of this Parliament and the members of this Parliament. With regard to the Multiannual Financial Framework, I would like to say very clearly that we need a strong acceleration and, above all, it would also be important to try to put in place and on the timetable solutions that do not have an idea of an increase in the tax burden, but that can also give answers on the general issues that will affect the future of the new Commission.  There has also been a lot of talk here, and there has been a lot of talk at this time, about climate battles and policies. I believe that it is essential to start not with the extremism of position, but on the basis of the need to change and adapt the productive, economic and commercial system of our continent to needs that are indisputable.  Finally, I would like to mention the subject of immigration, since it has not been mentioned in any way. In the last few days, the Interior Ministers in Malta have announced many things, and I will not dwell on them, and a few days later, just yesterday, we checked that words, as usual, were not followed in any way by deeds.

I think this Parliament will send a clear signal against Turkey's war of aggression against the Kurds in northern Syria, which has just begun, contrary to international law. But now let me come to the other political issue that is currently pressing – Brexit. The Left Group very much appreciates the Council's signalled willingness to agree to an extension, if requested, under Article 50. We expect the UK Government to comply with existing UK law and make such a request if no agreement is reached in the coming days. And we do not expect this for our own sake, we expect it because a crash out, a hard Brexit, would have the worst political consequences for all concerned, and because the political issues that are crucial to us, namely the protection of the peace process in Northern Ireland and the protection of the social rights of millions of Europeans, have not yet been adequately answered. Moreover, perhaps the question of Irish reunification could answer one or the other question that has now been raised.  But, ladies and gentlemen, there are also pleasing things happening in British politics: almost an export hit is taking hold. Before you torment yourself and let me put you on the torture, I'll tell you what it is: Extinction Rebellion. We are currently witnessing their climate protests in Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Paris and many other European cities. In the run-up to COP25, which is taking place in Santiago de Chile, I can tell you that we, as the left here in the European Parliament, believe that a policy that decisively combats the climate emergency is necessary. Our task for the Commission and the Council is to align EU policy with the United Nations And the Paris Climate Change Agreement from now on and in the future, without any ifs or buts.  And a small change of theme: the Council will also deal with the multiannual financial framework. In short, money must be made so that it can be spent on meaningful projects. Mr Juncker, I may now be giving you a crazy presumptuous or suggestive idea: let us close the tax loopholes! With the money raised, we increase the EU budget and invest in social-ecological conversion.

We regret the lack of transparency at this stage of the negotiations on the British side in a moment when the third Brexit deadline is around the corner. The negotiating team has shown an enormous amount of flexibility over the last few years and is prepared to work around the clock to find a deal, so there is still a chance, but a significant movement from our British friends is needed. But I’m not convinced anymore, as many of us here are not, that the UK Government wants a deal. Let me finish by underlining that this unprecedented political process of Brexit continues to have a massive negative impact on citizens’ lives and, in this context, let me say that negotiating the future relationship should not be allowed to start before citizens’ rights are legally guaranteed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 34, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Simona Bonafè (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124814", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said about Brexit, as it should be, but I would like to point out that among the items under discussion at the next European Council will also be the issue of climate change, precisely in the context of international agreements, which I would like to focus on. Following the recent United Nations Summit in New York, we are approaching COP25 in a few months' time, in December, in Santiago. We have successfully welcomed the Paris Agreement, with a global commitment to keep the rise in temperature well below the critical threshold of two degrees. However, today, it is good to say, we are far from getting there. It is the Environment Council itself that has said that, with the current commitments and the current evolution of greenhouse gas emissions, we will not be able to deliver on the commitments we made in Paris. So, on the one hand, we are well aware that the fight against climate change in order to be effective must be coordinated at international level and, alas, the picture is not exactly reassuring. The already well-known attitude of the Trump administration was followed by President Bolsonaro's worrying stance on the phenomenon of deforestation in the Amazon.  On the other hand, however, we must confirm and strengthen our leadership, the European leadership exercised in recent years to deal with the climate emergency. The data clearly show that economic growth and falling emissions can go hand in hand. This is an important and demanding change that we can achieve and that we must achieve in a fair, inclusive, sustainable way and, I have to say, also by adapting our production systems.

So who is more democratic, do you think? Who is more democratic? In your own country, neither in UKIP before Brexit has one representative in the British parliament and here you have more than, I don’t know, too many representatives. You’re saying that we are not democratic. This is crazy.  But that said, I will be less diplomatic than Mr Michel Barnier. I think that the proposal that Boris Johnson put forward exactly one week ago, was not serious at all. Not serious at all because it was, in fact, I call it a virtual proposal. It was not a real proposal. It gives a veto to the DUP in a number of issues. It is putting custom facilities, not on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, but in all the other parts of the island of Ireland that we don’t know yet. And finally, the proposal is to downgrade the political declaration and the future relationship by undercutting, in fact by making a sort of Singapore at the sea, at the North Sea – these 20 behind me like that – , but by in fact destroying the ecological, social and labour standards. I have to tell that to Mr Richard Corbett because he’s a Labour representative. I can never understand that today there are 20 or so Labour MPs thinking to vote together with the government of the UK for such a deal. That’s the contrary of all the things that Labour has always defended in the past. I hope that this is not happening.  The real reason why this is all happening is very simple. It’s a blame-game. A blame-game against everybody, a blame-game against the Union, against Ireland, against Ms Merkel, against the British judiciary system, against Labour, against the Lib Dems, even against Mrs May. The only person who has not been blamed is Mr Johnson himself, apparently, but all the rest are the source of our problems. That is what is happening today. All those who are not playing his game are traitors or a collaborator or have surrendered. Well in my opinion, the real traitor is he or she who will risk bringing disaster upon his country, its economy and its citizens by pushing Britain out of the European Union.

Let me shed light on another aspect. I am appalled by what is being reported about the phone call between Mrs Merkel and British Prime Minister Johnson. Let me start with the best: Merkel probably said that Germany could leave the EU without any problems. After all, an option, though not a nice one. But the Chancellor believes that the RULES for the UK are different. The UK, she says, can go if it leaves Northern Ireland in the customs union with the EU – forever. Mrs Merkel apparently wants to divide Britain in the event of Brexit. What an arrogance of power! The United Kingdom is therefore to become a divided kingdom. I find this incomprehensible to Mrs Merkel, who herself grew up in a divided country. How dare you! Or in British: \"How dare you!\". They would have to know what that means. Basically, Mrs Merkel has said that a deal is impossible without touching Britain's sovereignty. If you are looking at the future border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, take a look at the border between Norway and Sweden. That is also possible. Under these conditions, we can safely dispense with further negotiations, such as a further extension under Article 50. Let me finally be honest here in this House and admit that the EU institutions are doing everything they can to prevent and prevent the United Kingdom from leaving in an orderly manner. And you are always doing the same politically, namely to give the United Kingdom the buck. Britain should now pull the strings, there will be no orderly Brexit on EU terms, the earth will continue to spin, the economic damage will be smaller than predicted.

The British Prime Minister wants a deal, he’s put very reasonable proposals on the table and he has shown great flexibility. I’m not sure we’ve seen the same flexibility from Dublin or indeed from the EU and it’s not too late. Michel Barnier tells me, there is a way. I hope and trust that this involves new thinking by the European Union. Unfortunately, over many months, the European Union has been distracted by noises offstage, unhelpful voices, often coming from the UK, and we’ve heard some of that this afternoon.

The UK Government’s proposals do none of that. Instead of avoiding a border, they create two. Instead of protecting business, it creates more barriers to trade and places business in ‘Brex-eternity’: an unending four—year cycle of uncertainty as to their position in the single market. Instead of protecting the Good Friday Agreement, it places the future of the Northern Ireland Assembly – already suspended for three years – in further jeopardy. These are not serious proposals.

My heart is with the Jewish community. Today is the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur, and so my heart is with those that are victims of that horrendous attack. I’m here representing my colleague, the Vice-President, Valdis Dombrovskis, in this debate about greening the European Investment Bank. During the past years the Commission has interacted a lot with the EIB, notably in the context of the Investment Plan for Europe, and in particular in the context of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, as a core part of the plan. The cooperation with the European Commission and the EIB under the Investment Plan has been a great success, and as a Commissioner for Research and Science, I am the witness to that. In particular, I’m so happy to see that 25% of the projects funded are related to research and innovation. The European Fund for Strategic Investment is a dedicated investment support instrument with an EU budget guarantee, and it allows the Bank to move to more risky investments in areas such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, but also innovation and to support smaller companies. It was one of the flagship priorities of our Commission. So now, five years later, it is clear that the Investment Plan for Europe and our cooperation with the EIB is delivering, and the question is: why was it such a success? And I think that, first, because we are close to reaching our goal: 500 billion of investment mobilised by the Fund. Second, because we were helping more than one million SMEs across Europe that benefited from the financing, that created jobs, that strengthened our economy. And third, because we have helped 30 million people to get better health services, and then we helped seven million households to get renewable energy. Therefore the EIB is instrumental in mobilising financing for our common political priorities. Honourable President, Members, we have achieved a lot, but a lot more has to be done to achieve the 2030 climate and energy targets and our long-term goal of carbon-neutral Europe by 2050. Our investments in climate and environmental projects in the next decade will need to grow considerably. We need up to 290 billion of additional investments per year, from energy efficiency to cleaner transport in the infrastructure. Those investments are to a large extent of private nature, and we need to mobilise private finance for those investments. So on the one hand we need to create a supportive framework, but on the other hand, we can also use our EU budget to mobilise private capital. So we will continue doing it with the future InvestEU programme, maintaining our crucial partnership with the European Investment Bank. President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, in her speech in this House back in July, proposed a sustainable Europe investment plan under the European Green Deal, aiming to mobilise one trillion of investment over the next decade. This plan will aim to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent in 2050 and will broaden our strategic environmental agenda beyond climate. Furthermore, the two EU-ETS funds, the Innovation Fund and the Modernisation Fund, will also contribute to the much needed mobilisation of climate investments. Support to investments will go hand in hand with our strategy for green and sustainable financing, to ensure complementarity between the Commission’s regulatory and investment actions. So, honourable President and Members, today the EIB is the largest multilateral provider of climate finance worldwide, committing at least 25% of its investment to climate change mitigation. Already in 2007, the EIB issued the first World Green Bond, labelled the Climate Awareness Bond, and in September 2018, the first sustainable awareness bond. The EIB, the largest issuer of Green Bonds, has raised 23 billion across 11 countries, of which 4 billion was raised last year alone. So what am I saying? I’m saying that de facto, Mr President, you are the European Union’s climate bank. You are already that. The Commission welcomes the EIB announcement to achieve full alignment with the Paris Agreement by 2020. Scaling up investments in climate action and environmental sustainability will have to go hand in hand with building up capacity and expertise of project developers, for which technical assistance and advisory services will be warranted to build up a robust pipeline of sustainable investment projects. The Commission will need to discuss with the EIB and with Member States, as the EIB shareholders, how such an increasing financing for climate and environmental investments could be made in the most effective and efficient way, also to serve the objective of a just transition. The Commission takes the view that this increased focus on the climate and environment does not require a major institutional change. The EIB mandate is broad enough to accommodate a more ambitious, sustainable focus within the statutory mandate, combining eventually its own resources operations and operations under the backing of the EU budget. I look forward to hearing your views.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 97, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Werner Hoyer", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President EIB. – Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, let me, first of all, thank you very much for this opportunity to, together with Commissioner Moedas, address the issue of greening the EU bank. The cooperation between the European Parliament and the EIB has always been very close and the EP has been crucial in guiding our financing activities as the EU bank. So, discussing the future steps is a very welcome opportunity, for which I thank Mr President and the Members of the European Parliament. Humanity is at a crossroads. We must act immediately and swiftly if we want to ensure a sustainable transition to a net—zero emissions economy, and if we have listened to the European voters in the election to the European Parliament this spring, we have seen that European citizens are sometimes ahead of the public sphere. According to the special Eurobarometer on climate change published last month, 93% of respondents think climate change is a serious problem and 79% think it is a very serious problem. We would not have achieved these results even one year ago; now it’s there. A majority of respondents in 19 countries think climate change is one of the most serious problems facing the world today. These numbers speak for themselves. Citizens in the EU and beyond are asking us to stand up to the challenge.  The accumulation of greenhouse gases has caused average temperatures to rise by almost 1 °C globally above pre—industrial levels. Two thirds of this increase has occurred since 1975. If business continues as usual, we will have stoked a rise in global average temperatures of 4 °C by the end of this century. That might not sound too much, and in a city like Brussels today, you might think 4 degrees more isn’t such a bad idea, but our climate is fragile, very fragile, and small changes in surface temperature have a significant impact. For instance, the last time average temperatures lay 4 °C below pre—industrial levels, Brussels lay buried beneath several kilometres of ice. You can imagine, then, what 4 degrees hotter might mean. Under such a scenario, heatwaves would become the norm. An average July day in Europe would see temperatures in excess of 40°C, so drought, forest fires, crop failures, food shortages and disease pandemics would become commonplace events, potentially displacing millions of people.  We should remember that the past – or present – wave of migration in the Middle East, marked as it has been by human suffering and death, had its origins in drought and other climate—related problems. Since 2012, we have provided EUR 150 billion of finance, supporting EUR 550 billion of investment in climate action and environmental sustainability, making the EU bank group one of the world’s largest multilateral providers of finance for climate and environment projects – as a matter of fact, the largest one. Since we first set ourselves a climate action finance target in 2010, our ambition has been increasing. In 2015, we were the driving force behind the multilateral development banks (MDB) in the Paris process and at the United Nations Summit on the Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, we pledged to provide USD 100 billion for climate action projects in the five—year period to 2020. We’re delivering on that target. Indeed, since 2016, we have invested approximately USD 71 billion into climate action projects and last year alone, USD 16 billion again.  Having said that, the EIB can and is ready to become even greener. We have listened to the conclusions of the European Council in June, which requested the EU bank to step up its climate action activities. We have listened to the very clear message by President—elect Ursula von der Leyen in her address to you at the European Parliament and we have listened to you, the European Parliament, and your very vocal international calls for action.  The EIB is expected to be ambitious, and this is the reason why I believe we should not disappoint and make proposals to our shareholders which are ambitious. We are presently finalising our increased ambition for 2030 climate action and environmental sustainability, and our approach builds around three pillars: one, an increase in our own financing. Last year, nearly 30% of the EIB’s new commitments worldwide were dedicated to climate and environmental goals. I would like the EIB to be much bolder and aim for 50% for these activities by 2025. Secondly, a commitment to growing sustainable finance from billions to trillions. By working with our public and private partners, we aim to help unlock at least EUR one trillion of investment by 2030. This would include a marked increase in support for climate adaptation and resilience. But, as the Commissioner just said, Mr President, these objectives are never achievable with taxpayers’ money alone. We need to leverage the possibilities that the European Union is giving us by drawing in the private sector into the financing of these projects. That’s what we are there for. Thirdly, building on our 2015 climate strategy, we will align all the EIB group’s financing activities with the Paris principles and goals by the end of 2020. This is extremely important because it would be counterproductive if we finance 50% not in greenwashing but in real climate projects, and then with the rest of our projects, the other 50%, we destroy exactly what we have just achieved by financing dirty stuff. This will not happen. Alignment with the Paris Agreement will determine a change in the EIB Group’s policies and actions, starting with a pledge to phase out energy projects that depend on fossil fuels. This is my proposal. It is difficult. The new EIB energy lending policy, which is currently under discussion by the EIB Board, will be an important step in this regard. With a very strong focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy, power grids and research and development, the EIB believes the proposed energy lending policy is well aligned with EU priorities and funding. We will, again, achieve this only if another condition is being met beyond attracting the private sector – and that is via strengthening innovation. This builds on our 2015 climate strategy, which committed us to mainstreaming climate change considerations in everything we do. Science tells us that transitioning to a carbon—neutral economy entails ending the use of fossil fuels as soon as possible. Thanks to our emissions performance standard, we have not supported any coal—fired power projects for almost a decade: the first MDB to do so. In addition, we will position the EIB as an incubator for climate finance and expertise to mobilise others, helping our societies and economies transform to a low—carbon level.  But we must not forget that some countries are further advanced than others on the road to a low—carbon economy, and that some areas, communities and sectors will be more deeply affected than others by this transition. So, while stepping up our role as climate bank, we further commit to working closely with Member States, the Commission and Parliament to ensure a just and fair transition. We are fully aware that different Member States have different needs and we are committed to ensuring that no one is left behind. It is not just about energy efficiency, energy supply and energy security; it is also about jobs and growth. For instance, we note that 41 regions in the EU are mining coal, providing jobs to 250 000 people, most of whom have limited opportunities to find alternative employment. You cannot simply take a coal miner and turn her or him into an IT specialist overnight. We have seen the detrimental effects on communities and regions in the past when a transition is not fair and just. I’m confident that the EIB group can greatly contribute to implementing the ambitious vision of the European Green Deal, thanks to our proven ability to mobilise investment and support for EU priorities on climate action and environmental sustainability. And, as requested by Vice—President Timmermans yesterday before Parliament, you can count on the EIB to be a key partner in the implementation of the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan. We stand ready to work with you and develop new products and ideas to make this vision a reality. Despite overdrawing my time account, Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Commissioner, my friend Carlos Moedas, firstly, for the serious words he said at the beginning of his intervention, and I share the grief and the deep horror that went along with receiving this message this afternoon. And secondly, thank God on a more positive side, I would like to thank the Innovation Commissioner for outstanding cooperation with our institution.

We do have the technologies and yes, we do have the money, but a big part of the money is on sunk investments at the moment, on both public and private funding. This is what the sustainable finance initiative is trying to correct. The direction is right, but I would like to raise the bar much faster and much higher. Yes, of course, you could be very proud and you should be proud of the fact that over 20% – almost 30% – of the investments are climate-neutral and sustainable, but let’s take it the other way. That means that over 70% of the investments are not, and that is the ambition level. When we are using the public’s scarce resources, be it the EU budget, be investEU, be it the European Investment Bank, the finance should be only for sustainable, greening initiatives that turn our infrastructures in the lines of the Green Deal and that turn our economies to circular economy, climate-neutral and a future orientation on the logics of backcasting.

In any case, I believe that the whole Union, all the institutions must be perfectly aligned with regard to the objective of obviously meeting the Paris Agreement. But in that process, we have to pay particular attention to those regions that, as the EI president said, may suffer in the process of decarbonization, and therefore the transition has to be a fair transition. And, to be fair, we need the EI's effort to improve the financing of renewable projects, energy efficiency improvement projects.

Mr President, I campaigned in France with the President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, for the transformation of the European Investment Bank into a climate bank at European level. So I'm very pleased to see the commitments and decisions you're about to make. First of all, 50% of your climate activity means around 15 billion euros in loans, each year, in addition to green infrastructure, renewable energy, building insulation, very concrete things for European citizens and businesses. It also means the alignment - and you said this - of the bank's entire activity on the Paris Agreement. This does not mean \"I'm 50% green and for the rest of the time I'm not looking,\" it means that all of my business is compatible with the Paris agreement.  And by doing so, you may be the first bank not only to make that commitment, but to keep it. So you have the opportunity to write for all the other banking institutions - just as the EIB did a decade ago on Green bonds - the grammar of what it means for a bank to be aligned with the Paris agreement. And it is very good that the European Investment Bank plays this role of setting standards for the entire financial world. Now I emphasize the notion of just transition. We must be very careful that this commitment is compatible with taking the whole european continent. So it is very important that, in the commitments you are going to make, in the decisions you are going to make in the next few days, you can guarantee to the countries with the most transitional needs, especially in Central Europe, the fact that greening the EIB, making the EIB the European Climate Bank, does not mean more financing in the west and less financing in Central Europe. on the contrary, it may mean more funding in Central and Eastern Europe, because that is where the needs are most acute, and that is how we will take the whole continent for the good of Europeans and the planet.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 101, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Bas Eickhout", "mepid": "96725", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, first of all, the full support of the Greens to make from the EIB a climate bank.

And we want to see that no money from a public investment bank is going to fossil fuels. None. And the Commission is not on that line. For example, on gas, you are promoting an exception for low-carbon gas. Have you not learnt of CCS-ready coal? That was a joke. The coal came and the CCS-ready never worked.

Each Member State has different options, also because of its geographical location and traditions, and the consequence of this is that the energy mix is different.

If you look at the scale of the investment that is needed for the Sustainable Development Goals, for the Green Deal, the trillion investment fund that Ursula von der Leyen is speaking about, this is a very broad challenging issue for us here in the European Parliament and I really am glad to see it centre stage. I do think we have to focus on a just transition as well. We saw what happened in the economic crisis, how our citizens felt left behind. Most citizens cannot afford retrofitting at present. We need to be looking at practical issues, the kind of instruments that we can develop to make sure that we reach out to citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 112, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Aurore Lalucq (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "197697", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this debate.  In July 2019, through its first proposal, the EIB presented a very ambitious project, welcomed by all NGOs. Unfortunately, it must be noted that in its second proposal, it has backpedaled, presumably under pressure from the Commission, but also from the gas industries. From now on, these industries can be used as an investment vehicle to get out of coal, which is ecological nonsense. In view of the social emergency, the environmental emergency and the state of democratic debate, it seems to me urgent not to give in to pressure from lobbies and industries. That is why I ask you, and I ask my colleagues, to support the EIB's first proposal and not the second. I also call for more coherence in EIB investments and financing.

The four components of the EIB’s energy lending policy – unlocking energy efficiency, decarbonised energy supply, supporting innovation in new energy infrastructure and securing the enabling infrastructure – need a huge amount of investment to become everyday—life reality. For example, energy efficiency investments in building and industry represents approximately three quarters of the total investments required in the period 2021-2030, equal to EUR 281 billion per year. It is also of paramount importance to support the 41 regions dependent on coal – in Greece, we have Western Macedonia – by encouraging the transformation of their economy and also reskilling and upskilling workers.

As natural gas is a fossil fuel, logically natural gas, according to the original draft lending policy, would not be exempted. But the revised lending policy rewrites this subsection, so that it now states that to manage phasing-out of lending to fossil fuel energy projects smoothly, the Bank will continue to approve gas infrastructure projects already firmly under appraisal until the end of 2020. Now it means, for example, that the EIB will pump money into the planned liquid natural gas project on the Shannon Estuary.

I didn’t expect from the beginning that I would get support from everybody, but the overall feeling here in this Parliament seems to be that we better take climate change issues seriously, and this is exactly what we are going to do.  Sustainable finance is one of the key issues here because, as I said before, we will never achieve the Sustainable Development Goals nor the climate goals without mobilising private money. This requires – what has just been named – a taxonomy that requires more than just green principles, which we have developed over the last 10 years and we were the leader on that effort. But it is necessary to demonstrate also to investors, who trust us with their private money in order to achieve a green project. You cannot simply tell them, ‘I take a piece of white paper, paint it green and then it’s a green bond’. No, you need to have reliability and accountability for what you’re doing with the money that investors give you and the money that you give us. This is why we put a lot of emphasis on the sustainable finance issue and the activities of the European Commission to arrive at taxonomy in this context. I heard several Members of the European Parliament with great joy and listened to their enthusiasm about the 50% that we are targeting now. A very, very, very ambitious objective – I can tell you – because don’t make the other projects that the EIB is financing smaller than they are. It’s clear that we have said Paris alignment, so the climate must be in everything we do. We must not undermine our climate objectives by financing 50% green and the rest dirty. No, that’s not the idea. But I wonder what the Innovation Commissioner would say if our bank comes to a conclusion that says, ‘okay, the talks with Mr Gates today about malaria research and vaccines and different diseases cannot be continued anymore because it is not demonstratively a green project’. So we also have other issues and I’ll tell you: the European Union has huge climate challenges, but a few other challenges as well. Let me just take very, very few.  Number one, we are losing competitiveness day by day because we do not invest enough in innovation, research and technology. Therefore, we support wholeheartedly the activities of Commissioner Moedas to bring the European Union into first position when it comes to innovation and productivity growth.  Secondly, we have only just begun to think development big. If you look at what challenges are ahead in the next decades, when by the end of this century, Africa will have four billion citizens from now – a little bit over one and a half billion – and they will all need jobs. So we need to support leapfrog development in Africa and we need to think development big in order to produce economic perspectives. And then, of course, the climate issue. The climate issue is well spelled out, but the devil is in the detail as soon as we get to the regions where it’s going to be really, really difficult, and it’s better to get your people in these regions on board on this, and therefore we have to be very attentive there. Not by hiding behind the transition needs. Some people believe ‘let’s hide behind the transition needs and perpetuate the use of fossil fuels’. That is not the solution. But giving perspectives for jobs and growth in these regions via innovation: this is the right thing. By the way, it is also the reason why I believe we should overcome the dichotomy between innovation and cohesion. You can see clearly all around the European Union and beyond the European Union that those regions who are very open—minded on innovation are the best when it comes to cohesion policies. So, from that point of view, I’m quite optimistic.  There are many questions that have been posed that I cannot respond to right here now spontaneously. I promise we will all come back to this with our colleagues here in Brussels, so that from agriculture in Ireland to all kinds of other things, we will not shy away from responding to these questions.  The risk inclination of investors. That’s a real issue. We have many problems also in the context of climate policies where the risk situation is so difficult that the commercial markets will not service that and, therefore, we are so happy about the cooperation with the European Commission and the European Parliament and the Council – because only with the risk coverage by EU guarantees we can serve it. And you know we are going to come to the close of the Juncker Plan very soon. And I’ll tell you, in my view, this is the greatest legacy of President Juncker when he leaves his office – because that has been a smashing success and we need to celebrate that and learn from it for the financing of our ambitious projects for the future.

Let me start by reminding the honourable Members that this Commission that I’m proud to be part of has constantly striven to preserve and promote the highest standards with regard to ethics and integrity for its members.  First, the ethical frameworks for both the Members of the Commission and the staff that are solid and represent a strong set of ethical values, principles and rules. These include, notably, the prevention and handling of conflict of interests. A new financial regulation entered into force in 2018 and sets out strict rules on conflict of interest and financial matters. Amendments to the EU’s Staff Regulation in 2014 strengthened the rules on conflicts of interest for staff of all EU institutions. This Commission completely overhauled the Code of Conduct for its Members in January 2018. The new Code, as you know, sets the standard at the top of the class in Europe and makes it possible to address all possible situations. These rules are more comprehensive than the rules of most of our Member States. That’s the reality, and often stricter than the rules of other EU institutions. They contain, for the first time, a clear definition of conflict of interest and sets out a detailed procedure on how such a situation needs to be addressed. I’d like to stress, in this regard, that the Court of Auditors of the European Union has only recently largely confirmed that the ethical framework of the Commission is adequate. Second, the Commission is convinced of the importance of having a body that advises the Commission and its President independently on ethical issues of all kinds, and this is why the Commission has already set up an independent ethical body, the Independent Ethical Committee, which is composed of three independent external high-level personalities. A renowned former Vice-President of the European Parliament, Ms Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, a renowned former judge of the European Court of Justice, Mr Allan Rosas, and a widely recognised former Director-General of several Commission departments, Mr Heinz Zurek. This committee has delivered, for example, an opinion on the ethical guidelines for Commissioners who participate in the European elections. This opinion is public. Moreover, the committee is closely involved in the evaluation of the post—term of office activities of the Commissioners. So the Commission decisions on these activities and the related opinions of the Independent Ethical Committee will be public and, therefore, also be open to public scrutiny. Third, I would like to recall that there have been discussions in the past about a joint ethical body for all the institutions. The Commission already proposed the creation of an advisory group on standards in public life back in the year 2000. This proposal did not fail because of the Commission, but due to concerns of other institutions.  Lastly, you are aware that the President-elect, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, has called in her political guidelines for an independent ethics body common to all EU institutions. Ensuring trust in the European Union and its institutions with regard to ethics, transparency and their independence must remain a cornerstone of our actions.

I would like to say that the conflict of interest among politicians at local, national and European level is, of course, very risky, because it reduces citizens' confidence in democracy, in politics. Unfortunately, we have such a case at the highest level in the Czech Republic.  Of course, it is very difficult to face a conflict of interest in a situation where great political and economic power is combined, and therefore I can also say from our experience that it is very important that it is at European level that rules are being created that set a common standard. The Commissioner mentioned this here.  We all want European funds, our common resources, to be used as efficiently and transparently as possible.

Several committees will be involved in the ongoing reflection. We will be called upon to touch on this matter in several political and parliamentary forms: by improving and readapting our Rules of Procedure; by reopening interinstitutional negotiations; by asking for new and ambitious legislative files, like the Staff Regulations; and by enhancing the regulations on EU funds. A more pragmatic and flexible approach is also necessary, taking into account lessons from the recent past. We need to be firm in stressing again the ambitious EP proposals set in the transparency register negotiations, as well as in finally finding a way to achieve stronger transparency in all the EU institutions, notably in the Council. We, therefore, look with attention at the ethics body announced by President—elect von der Leyen.

Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, I would like to be concrete enough to explain to you why we have summoned you without much preparation for this debate and quite unanimously on the benches of this Chamber. Firstly, because this approach is the result of a feedback on the work carried out together by all the groups, the experience of the Committee on Legal Affairs which had to analyse the declarations of interest and the statements made by the Commissioners and then a perhaps personal conviction, which is also shared by my whole group and surely beyond the political groups.  First, if I read JURI's skills today, I see this. The Committee on Legal Affairs is responsible for verifying whether the content of the declaration is accurate - we do not know how to do it - if it is complete - we do not know how to do it - if conflicts of interest can be assumed - we do not have the means to verify it. The first observation is that parliamentarians today do not have the means to carry out their work, at least in terms of the JURI Committee and the work we are asked to do to analyse the Commissioners' declarations of interest. Second observation: perhaps an element of personal conviction, one walks backwards. We are parliamentarians, we legislate, but we have not legislated on the transparency and the degree of transparency that we want for the European institutions - I mean the European institutions because they are also senior officials, who are in contact with lobbies, who make decisions every day with interest groups. And of course we are being asked to do the work of an independent administration, that is, basically to evaluate - and we have absolutely no power to do so - if the statements are complete.  So we walk backwards. That is why this debate is interesting, Mr President, because it must enable us to succeed in the mandate to put things right and allow parliamentarians to legislate on transparency and, eventually, for an independent administrative authority to do the administrative work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Daniel Freund", "mepid": "106936", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which Corruption is a huge problem in the European Union. In several Member States, it has reached the highest level of policy. Viktor Orban has basically turned Hungary into a mafia state in which hundreds of millions of euros disappear from the central bank or from EU funds. Andrej Babic also enriches himself with EU funds. In Spain, in the 'belt' case, sham contracts were awarded in dozens of cases, thereby defrauding taxpayers. If the European Union wants to lead the fight against corruption in a credible manner, it must, of course, lead by example. That is why we urgently need institutions that are free from corruption, free from conflicts of interest, free from revolving doors, through which politicians move directly into well-paid lobbying jobs. 50% of the Barroso Commission's Commissioners now work for organisations registered in the EU Lobby Register. In the last five years, we have had 24 cases here in the European Parliament in which ethics rules have been violated. Not one of them has been sanctioned. And Transparency International has just shown that 48 Members of this House earn more money outside than through their salary here in the European Parliament. How can we be sure that they represent the interests of the citizens and not those of a company? I do not understand how this can be, and it cannot be explained to any citizen or a citizen outside.

I am surprised, too, that we have no way of verifying this information that we have to take for cash, even when those statements are completely empty. Finally, I am surprised that the same standards do not apply to everyone. Why didn't we ask Josep Borrell to sell his half a million shares in large multinational companies, such as Bayer, when we asked others to do so? Let us learn from this before citizens' confidence in the European institutions is finally shaken. We are making concrete proposals to you that are here in this document, and I would be happy to give you, Madam, so that this can be followed up.  Two concrete proposals. Let us first work together to create an independent authority in the image of the High Authority for the Transparency of Public Life in France. Let us give it sufficient time and resources to carry out a real control of conflicts of interest, before, during and after the mandate of the commissioners. Let us also allow this committee to evaluate cases such as that of Sylvie Goulard, who was paid more than 10,000 euros per month by an American think tank in addition to her allowances as an MP. And how can we accept that more than a third of the Members here are paid more than EUR 1,000 per month in addition to their allowances and that they are thus accountable to private interests rather than to voters alone?

The US decision follows the WTO arbitrators finding on the level of possible US countermeasures, establishing that level to be up to USD 7.5 billion, which is EUR 6.9 billion. The US tariffs will apply as of 18 October, after the WTO dispute settlement body has formally authorised the US to impose the countermeasures. The meeting of the DSB is scheduled for 14 October. Let’s be clear: we regret deeply the US decision to go ahead with the imposition of tariffs. While authorised by the WTO, it will only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic. The US product list mainly targets new civil aircraft produced by Airbus. The product list also includes a range of agricultural and industrial goods exported by different EU Member States. The additional duties are at rates of 10% on civil aircraft and 25% on a range of agricultural and industrial products. The US will impose 25% duties on a number of agricultural and manufactured goods. Some EUR 4.3 billion in exports to the US will be affected. So we’re talking about 60% of the total value of the list, including iconic EU products like French wine, Scotch whisky, Italian parmigiano, Irish butter, Spanish olive oil, German household machinery, Greek peaches and Dutch cheeses. The main burden of these additional duties will fall on products exported by the four Airbus Member States – France, Germany, UK and Spain. So that will be 87% of the total value of the list. Other Member States, like Italy and Ireland, will also be affected, although to a lesser degree. We’ve noted that the iconic products such as Italian wine or olive oil and pasta, as well as Irish whiskey, have been spared from tariffs. The published rates of 10% to 25% will allow trade to continue, even if in reduced quantities. But many companies and workers will be affected negatively. While we regret the US decision to go ahead with the imposition of tariffs, we have to remember that the US have followed all the steps prescribed by the WTO in a dispute that has been ongoing for 15 years. So we should avoid overreaction and respect our international obligations. An arbitrator will in some months decide, in the parallel Boeing case, what level of countermeasures the EU will be entitled to apply on US imports. The Commission made a serious offer to settle the aircraft disputes in July, and so we remain open to reach a negotiated outcome, in which we would notably agree on new rules on subsidies that could apply also to other plane-makers around the world. We must bear in mind that new highly-subsidised competitors from China and Russia are preparing to enter these market and may seriously disrupt it  if we don’t take urgent action. It remains to be seen whether, with the tariffs in place, the US will now start to give more positive signals about a negotiated solution to the dispute. In the press release accompanying the list, it explicitly said that it is ready to do so. We are ready to negotiate even with tariffs in place, provided that the US is ready to agree on a balanced solution, which will also need to end the subsidies provided to Boeing. There have been calls for a compensation mechanism for farmers, and I would only comment that we must try to settle this dispute in the next months and put an end to a self-defeating cycle of tariffs and countermeasures and counter-tariffs. This is the greatest service we could provide to those negatively affected by the US measures.

On behalf of my colleague, Cecilia Malmström, let me recall our position: we really regret the US decision to go ahead with the imposition of the tariffs, but we have to remember that this time is very different from the ‘232’ steel measures and other unilateral actions. The US has really followed all the steps of the WTO in this case, and as the Member said, it is paramount for the European Union to respect and to cherish multilateralism. Hopefully, the US announcement that they are willing to find a negotiated solution will be followed by deeds, and, as indicated before, both sides should have an interest in finally closing this long-standing dispute – also in the light of new entrants on the aircraft markets. Finally, let me conclude by stressing the words of Dolors Montserrat: the point here is unity. We have to be united. Without unity, we’re not strong – another proof of the importance of the European project. So the key to negotiating a good solution is really to be united.

The potential consequences of such military action are clear to everyone – at least are very clear to us. The repercussions can be extremely serious and far—reaching in humanitarian, military, political and strategic terms. For all these reasons, we call upon Turkey to immediately stop its unilateral military action. New armed hostilities in the north—east will first of all exacerbate civilian suffering and provoke further displacements. This new escalation adds yet another obstacle to the UN—led political process, after the positive news just a fortnight ago of an intra—Syrian agreement on constitutional committee. Turkey’s unilateral action also threatens the progress achieved by the Global Coalition to defeat Daesh, of which Turkey is a member. Military action will undermine the security of the Coalition’s local partners – namely the Kurdish forces – and risk protracted instability in north—east Syria, providing fertile ground for the resurgence of Daesh. Let us not forget that Daesh still remains a significant threat to regional, international and European security. We are also aware of Turkey’s intention, in the medium—term, of settling Syrian refugees along the border. It is highly unlikely that a so—called ‘safe zone’ in north—east Syria, as envisaged by Turkey, would satisfy international criteria for refugee return as laid down by the UNHCR. It is difficult to imagine how such returns could be either safe, voluntary or in any way dignified. Mass resettlement on the scale suggested by Turkey would also profoundly destabilise an already fragile area. Any attempt at demographic change would be unacceptable for us. We have always supported Turkey for hosting three million Syrian refugees, providing them with shelter, assistance and services. But as President Juncker made very clear just a few hours ago in this Chamber, there can be no question of the European Union financing the infrastructure to receive hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in north—east Syria. The European Union will not provide stabilisation or development assistance in areas where the rights of local populations are ignored – or even worse, violated. Beyond the serious humanitarian and security implications, the Turkish incursion might also prevent the constitutional committee from beginning its work. Just two weeks ago we were in New York at the General Assembly, where we received the encouraging announcement that the regime and the opposition in Syria had reached their first agreement since the beginning of the war, thanks to the UN mediation that we have supported over all these years. We made it clear back then and over all these days, that this is just the first step, but a very important one – a real first step to allow the whole country a potential political resolution of the conflict. We were looking forward to the first meeting of the committee in Geneva – and I would like to say that we are indeed looking forward to the first meeting of the committee in Geneva – possibly even before the end of October. We hope that the Turkish attack will not delay the first meeting of the constitutional committee, and yet we cannot exclude this eventuality. We ask Turkey to execute an immediate cessation of hostilities. A destabilised north—east Syria, with new ethnic tensions and a resurgent terrorist threat, is certainly not in Turkey’s interest. We have always shared the goal of ending violence, defeating Daesh and promoting peace and security in Syria and in the wider region. Turkey has always been in this a key partner for the European Union and a critically important actor in the Syrian crisis and in the region. But Turkey’s legitimate security concerns should be addressed through political and diplomatic means, not through military action, in accordance with international humanitarian law. We urge all to ensure always the protection of civilians and unhindered, safe and sustainable humanitarian access throughout Syria. Our goal remains to help the Syrian people build a united, sovereign, democratic and inclusive Syria. A sustainable solution to the Syrian crisis will not come through military means. I think this is very clear to all – at least this is very clear to us Europeans. The only way to achieve peace and security in Syria is full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2254 under UN auspices. So our immediate goal is now to avoid renewed armed hostilities in the north—east of Syria, to stop them, and to do everything in our power to support the UN—led political process. This is why I have invited the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Mr Pedersen, to join us at the next Foreign Affairs Council next Monday in Luxemburg to discuss together the way forward in this critical moment. The Syria conflict will not be ended by weapons. This war can only be ended by mediation and true reconciliation within Syrian society. The conflict can only be ended through a genuine political transition, negotiated by the Syrian parties under UN auspices. The whole European Union is united behind this goal, and today I have issued – more or less one hour ago – a clear declaration on behalf of all 28 Member States to confirm and make extremely clear our common position. The five EU Member States of the UN Security Council coordinating have now officially asked to bring the issue in front of the Security Council, and I understand that this will happen tomorrow. We will also continue to be in touch with our partners, and to update obviously the European Parliament on any relevant developments and to discuss together – and I am looking forward to our exchanges tonight – the way forward in this moment. I think our position has been clear from the very beginning – just a few days ago – of these developments and we must see how we can make this call effective and with impact on the ground.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 191, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Željana Zovko", "mepid": "185341", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, as we speak, Turkish forces are entering the north—east of Syria in an offensive against a reliable Western partner which played a crucial role in stabilising Syria. Yes, that partner – the Syrian Kurds – is being abandoned. The impulsive decision to leave this ally raises deep concerns. Due to the increased Turkish involvement in north—east Syria, we fear that ISIS will benefit and seize the opportunity to regroup. Furthermore, we share Kurdish fears of a massacre, as was already the case in the past in Afrin. Not only will the West lose its reliable partner in the fight against terrorism, but we may be a witness to human suffering and destruction.  The European Union is the biggest contributor to the UN multilateral system that establishes the instruments to prevent genocide, massacres and human catastrophes. Therefore, it is important that the Security Council take appropriate action as soon as possible. A possible displacement of people, no matter how small it is, calls for international resistance.

I see that this unites the Chamber, as it has united the European Union Member States. I am often asked here to make sure that the European Union speaks with one voice, and a clear voice and on time. In this case, I believe we have been speaking clearly – extremely clearly – and early. As I said, we first reacted immediately after the news of the telephone call between President Trump and President Erdoğan came out, during my visit to Jordan, and today we have reacted again with the clear and official position of the 28 Member States, which I stated just a few hours ago. So: first we are expressing a clear, united position in time for it to be effective at least as a call; and second, we are coordinating with partners – partners in the region, partners beyond the region and other international organisations including, obviously, the United Nations. I’m glad that we managed, on the initiative of the European Union Member States sitting on the Security Council, to have this point on the agenda there, because it is there that it should be addressed. Furthermore – something that has not been raised here so far and I am surprised about that – you might have seen that NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg intends to have contact with one of the NATO Allies, namely Turkey, on this issue. I believe that we need to at least exchange views and opinions with them as well, to try and avoid this military intervention going on. That is, I believe, the urgency at the moment, and I feel the same sense of frustration, urgency and sorrow that many of you have expressed about what is happening today: not only for the civilians who once again are victims, not only for the already internally displaced people in that area who are suffering again, but also for the Kurdish forces who have been fighting in the coalition against Daesh. I very much agree with what some of you have said: the priority today is to focus on the UN-listed terrorist organisations. That means Daesh, first and foremost, and definitely not the Kurdish forces. Turkey has a different reading on this. We have had discussions several times in a very open manner with Ankara about this. For the European Union, these forces are definitely not to be defined as terrorist organisations. The other thing that we will put in place is a discussion with the Foreign Ministers, on Monday. That is already being prepared now. Today we had preparatory meetings and in the coming days these will continue – to see what other actions or reactions we can take from now to then, and to prepare for the European Council that will take place just a couple of days later. Some of you have raised other issues and elements on which you have asked me to act. The honourable Members know very well that it is not in the hands of the High Representative to take decisions which ultimately lie, in some cases, with the European Parliament itself – on the allocation of funding, for example – and, in some cases, with individual Member States – on the export of arms, perhaps – or the Council, as with the possibility of introducing targeted measures or sanctions or stopping financial flows. I want to say one thing here though: I believe we have to be careful not to mix things up in a way that can be dangerous. Some of you referred to the controversial, but ongoing, support that we are giving to Turkey – and not only to Turkey but also to other countries that are hosting Syrian refugees in the region. I want to name here Jordan and Lebanon and also Iraq and Egypt. We are giving this financial support not to those countries but to international organisations, starting with the UN agencies that are helping the Syrians in those countries. I believe the Syrians would be the victims – not twice or three times but four times over – if we had to think about stopping that financial support, because it is thanks to the European Union financial support that the Syrian refugees are being helped. And the EU support is going to those international organisations in those hosting countries – among them Turkey, yes, but the money doesn’t go to Turkey. I’ve said that in this Chamber many times, but it was in a different parliamentary term so I will repeat it today. That money, the money that supports the Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as in other countries of the region, is not going to the Turkish authorities. It’s not going to Turkey. It’s going to international agencies, it’s going to international NGOs, and it’s going to the UN agencies for the Syrian people. I believe it would be a mistake to make them suffer – on top of what they’re suffering already – for the current situation as well. Having said that, you can count on my full determination not only to ensure we do everything we can to protect civilians at this time – and to join forces with those with whom we can join forces to protect civilians – but also, most importantly and beyond that, to stop this military intervention. It is a mistake from so many points of view, and most of you have said that: from a humanitarian perspective; from the perspective of our achievements against Daesh; and – I’m surprised none of you mentioned this but I want to insist on it – in terms of the possibility of it seriously undermining the relaunch of the political process under UN auspices. Two weeks ago we were hosting, as we do every year at the UN, the event on Syria. There, together with Geir Pedersen, we were saying that maybe this is the beginning of a new possibility for the political process to start, and it’s the first time in years that there has been a tiny step forward on the possibility of achieving a political solution. Now, two weeks later, we have this, which has also put at risk that very limited sign – but a sign nonetheless – of hope for the possibility of starting the political process. Obviously, it is also a mistake for all the other reasons that have been mentioned here, including with regard to regional balances. So I really hope that we will manage to join forces with others. I really hope that this issue can be addressed properly in the UN Security Council tomorrow. You can count on me personally and on the European Union’s institutions, the Council and Commission, to do what we can, and obviously I count on you, the Parliament, to try and use these hours to apply maximum pressure, and try to stop this intervention that is definitely not going to bring anything good.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 212, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Die Präsidentin. –", "mepid": "197433", "text": "  The debate is closed.

I say five years because, when I started as High Representative, Ukraine was almost the only issue on our foreign policy agenda.  In one sense I am worried that this is slipping away, as if problems were disappearing, and I am grateful to the European Parliament for putting this issue on the agenda. This will also be on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council next Monday, exactly because I want to make sure that the attention does not get lower at this moment on the situation in Ukraine.  The citizens of Ukraine in these five years have been calling for change in their country, they have been working for change in their country. They have asked for reforms that would improve their lives, with more transparency, more honesty and no corruption. They have asked for a fully sovereign country, free from war and from foreign interference. And they have asked for a strong and close partnership with the European Union. They have not only asked for these things, they have also worked for these things. Since our first debate on Ukraine five years ago, Ukraine has come a very long way. This has been possible first and foremost thanks to the determination of the citizens of Ukraine, their constant work for a better country. Throughout these years, the European Union has always stood at the side of the Ukrainian people. After 2014 we put together for Ukraine the biggest support package in the history of the European Union, with over EUR 15 billion. We have invested more in Ukraine than in any other country in the world. No other partner has invested in Ukraine as much as we have done. Our Association Agreement – which has now entered into force – is the most ambitious agreement that the European Union has ever developed with any other partner. It has already delivered an impressive increase, for instance, in our trade by almost 50%. Our support and our cooperation are having a very tangible impact on people’s lives. We have supported the creation of thousands of new jobs and helped deliver, through decentralisation, higher quality services for the citizens. We have accompanied the reform of the security sector. And two years ago, we made travelling to the European Union easier for the people of Ukraine, thanks to visa liberalisation. I have always believed that the best we could do for the people of Ukraine was to be there for them, was to accompany this quest for change, this quest for reform and this work that they have done themselves to change their country profoundly and to give our full support to this work for change. And I believe that the people of //!!Europe!! Ukraine// understand and appreciate and know very well how close we have become in these years. After his election, President Zelenskyy chose Brussels as the destination of his first foreign visit, and he hosted the EU-Ukraine Summit in Kyiv/Kiev? in July – I was honoured to be there for an excellent meeting that we had. I met Foreign Minister Prystaiko two weeks ago in New York and he will be with us at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday in Luxembourg.  The simple and powerful message that I will be proud to pass, I think I would say both of us, together, on Monday is this: the European Union and Ukraine have never been closer. This is something we say about other partners, but for Ukraine – if you look at five years ago – this was definitely not to be taken for granted. I believe this is an achievement that we can celebrate together.  The new government has taken a bold approach to reforms. Expectations in public opinion are very high. The number of legislative acts adopted since this summer is unprecedented, and we are ready and willing to support the government in ensuring that this wave of legislation truly delivers in practical terms. For instance, we are ready to work with the government as it seeks to review some of the reforms in the judicial field. The citizens of Ukraine expect to see the first results of this push to make their country more transparent and fair for all. Another extremely important area continues to be the fight against corruption. Improving the business and investment climate and tackling the oligarchic structures is also crucial to unleash Ukraine’s economic potential, but I would say for having a healthy environment in the country altogether. We also continue to engage on energy sector reform, and we look forward to the unbundling of gas transmission from production and supply, which should happen by the end of this year. We are also working with Ukraine and Russia through our dialogue to conclude a new gas transit contract. It is essential to use the current momentum in the best possible way, respecting all democratic procedures and in constant consultation with the country’s vibrant civil society. Thanks to these reforms and to our concrete support to these reforms – from the creation of the Anti-Corruption Court to security sector reform – Ukraine is today a much stronger country than it was five years ago. That is clearly visible today.   Our neighbours’ strength and resilience is obviously a core interest of the European Union. At the same time, we should never forget that Ukraine is still suffering a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Crimea is Ukraine, Donbas is Ukraine, and the European Union will continue to keep this position in the most unequivocal and united manner.   Through the years, we have never stopped working for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. We have always managed to keep our unity on this, and I can tell you that five years ago, there were many that were betting on this: in the first place for it not to be possible; and then for it not to be possible to keep it.   We have always managed to keep our unity on this, and I am proud of it because this was and still is the right thing to do, and I am sure that we will continue to keep our unity in the years to come.   In recent weeks, we have witnessed some important developments in the Normandy format and in the Trilateral Contact Group. The outcome of the Trilateral Contact Group meeting in Minsk on 1 October, on the so-called Steinmeier formula, is a step that could hopefully lead to some progress towards the full implementation of the Minsk agreements by all parties.   It should be clear that the Minsk agreements remain central to reaching a lasting peaceful solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, to end the fighting and the suffering of so many people. It is crucial to sustain the progress in disengagement and constructing the bridge in Stanytsia Luhanska. And we need a lasting ceasefire, towards the ultimate goal of restoring Ukraine’s control of its whole territory.   We have never stopped supporting the work of the Normandy format, the Trilateral Contact Group, and the OSCE. And we will continue to do so until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored.   In the meantime, we have welcomed and we welcome the recent exchange of prisoners between Ukraine and Russia. That included the crew of the Ukrainian vessels detained by Russia last November in the Kerch Strait – a situation that we have discussed with Parliament several times – and Oleh Sentsov, whom you have awarded with the Sakharov Price. This is good news, and we will always encourage any step that can bring us closer to a solution.   We continue to call on Russia to release all illegally detained Ukrainians, and to ensure free passage through the Kerch Strait in accordance with international law. We are also investing in the infrastructure and security of the south-eastern regions of Ukraine that are affected by the situation in the Kerch Strait. We should never forget or underestimate these immense challenges that Ukraine is still facing. And at the same, I believe we should always continue to believe in the immense potential of Ukraine and its people and invest in it. After five years of work, I am proud of the progress we have achieved together in these years, in extremely difficult circumstances. And I am sure that – with this Parliament’s support – we will continue to stand at Ukraine’s side, as the country’s closest friend.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 219, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Sandra Kalniete", "mepid": "96934", "text": "  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to thank the – Dear sitting leader!

The agreement does not however mention any military solution in Donbas. The proposal is in line with the Russian concept to federalise Ukraine, which may lead to autonomy of the regions, weakening of the central government and increased Russian influence.  I understand the search for a compromise solution. The democratic Ukrainian leadership has a full mandate to try to solve these terrible dilemmas in its own way.

People who are highlighting or voicing resistance to the deal made with Russia should ask: what do the Ukrainian people want?

There’s also opposition by people who have a vested interest in filling the place with arms still.

In many cases, the previous administration's reform of Ukraine was accomplished by abolishing or curtailing fundamental democratic human and minority rights.

This discussion is timely as tomorrow this House will vote on draft resolutions objecting to the authorisation of two new genetically modified maize varieties and the renewal of an authorisation for a genetically modified soya bean, all for food and feed use. First let me state clearly: the European Union authorisation system for authorisation of genetically modified organisms has been established by European Union law. Through such legislation the Commission has received from the Council and Parliament a delegation of power to implement the system, but with little or no margin for manoeuvre. The Commission is bound to apply the law and Parliament can only expect the Commission to respect European Union law. Respect for the rule of law is a guarantee of fundamental rights and freedom within the EU and no institution should be blamed for abiding by the law. This does not mean that the Commission does not hear or listen to concerns and it is important to understand all of them, as some are very important. This is why at the beginning of this mandate this Commission proposed to the Council and Parliament to change the legislation on GMOs, in particular in light of the numerous objections voted on by the European Parliament. Unfortunately the last Parliament rejected the Commission’s proposal, without suggesting any amendment. This was clearly a lost opportunity and at the same time a clear instruction to the Commission to continue applying the existing law. This is what we have done. Second, the existing European Union law establishes a system which is science-based and relies on a scientific assessment performed by the European Food Safety Authority, independently of the Commission. Both the quality and the independence of the European Food Safety Authority ensure that human and animal health and the environment are protected within the European Union at a high level with little equivalent worldwide.  The Commission only proposes to authorise genetically modified organisms when the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has confirmed their safety for humans, animals and the environment. In relation to the authorisations to be voted on tomorrow, EFSA has concluded that they are as safe as their non-genetically modified comparators with respect to the potential effects on human and animal health and the environment. As foreseen in European Union law, the Member States voted in these proposals for authorisation in the Standing Committee. However, the vote showed no qualified majority in favour of or against the approvals. In accordance with the rules on comitology, as adopted by the co-legislators, Parliament and the Council, and the Regulation on genetically modified food and feed, the Commission presented the draft decisions to the Appeal Committee, where again no opinion was reached.  I would like to make it clear here that, under European Union law, without such an opinion the Commission needs to take a decision alone. It does not have the luxury of having no opinion. It is not the Commission’s possibility. What is also sometimes frustrating is that Member States vote behind closed doors and the Commission is not entitled to disclose individual Member State’s vote. Here again, this Commission has considered the situation where Member States hide behind the Commission as very disappointing and unsatisfactory. For that reason, the Commission has proposed to both the Council and Parliament to modify European Union legislation on comitology, so as to ensure more transparency. Unfortunately, little progress has been made on this proposal and I regret this situation because making the Commission a scapegoat can be harmful to Europe. Overall, I hope I have demonstrated that the Commission has processed the applications for these GMOs in full compliance with the procedures set out by the co-legislators and that the Commission has fulfilled its duty.  Allow me to recall that the right of scrutiny of the European Parliament concerns the questions of whether the draft implementing act exceeds the implementing powers provided for in the basic acts. This is clearly not the case. The Commission has faithfully implemented the EU law, and therefore I fail to see the legal assessment that would justify the planned objectives. I would be interested to hear on which legal grounds the objection could be based.  Finally, let me conclude by stating the obvious. Genetically modified organisms are a sensitive issue. Citizens and Members of this Parliament have very strong and diverse views, not based solely on science. Some have concerns: there is a real and serious need to discuss which concerns can be considered as legitimate. Legitimate concerns are a very important area and it would be good to know from Parliament’s side, what does it mean by ‘legitimate concerns’. At the same time, European Union agriculture is highly dependent on imports of genetically modified feed and this is simply a fact that cannot be ignored or dismissed, and we know that Member States that always abstain, they know that. It is important, therefore, to move away from sterile fights. Blame-games between EU institutions can only fuel Euroscepticism. I would call for an open, honest and genuine discussion on our agricultural model, including its sustainability. I genuinely hope this can happen in the future, perhaps as part of the Green Deal and as a new Farm to Fork strategy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 252, "date": "2019-10-09.json", "name": "Jessica Polfjärd", "mepid": "197404", "text": "  On the other: Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr We all want this Parliament to reduce emissions and to protect the environment and the climate.

As you know, Jean—Claude Juncker’s promise was realised. The Commission proposed changes in GMO law to the European Parliament twice, and Parliament decided to reject it – not showing a willingness to cooperate and see which amendments would be better. Now you are once again repeating the situation on what was delivered by the Commission. The proposals offer the possibility to change the rules on standing committees – speaking about transparency and democracy and, of course, the rule of law.  We are all obliged under the rule of law. Now, I’m listening to Amazon issues, to different views. OK. But these are not about the substance and, concretely speaking, about the authorisation of cases which are under strict rule of law conditions. The Commission has no chance to deviate from the rule of law.  Thank you once again. I only want to reiterate a few important points of principle. EU institutions should look for common approaches and solutions, not fight each other. This will only help to fuel – as I mentioned before – conflicts in society, and Euroscepticism.

I fully regret the situation now, but this is Parliament’s responsibility, because Parliament decided to reject our proposal.  You cannot fully ignore science in our decisions on human health, environmental protection and food safety. We should base our decisions on science, not only on public opinion. I know – speaking about legitimate concerns – that it’s very important to discuss these issues, but we need to know what ‘legitimate concerns’ mean, and not only to put the blame on the Commission. I invite you all to reflect about a sustainable future for European Union agriculture in the light of concerns for the environment, but also on the importance of having fresh, nutritious and healthy food produced in Europe at affordable prices.  European Union food should not be reserved only for its wealthiest citizens. We need to understand, social, economic, and other consequences. We need to be very careful. I once again see only one way: to follow the law, to follow science and to really create a good environment in our debates about legitimate concerns, describing what legitimate concerns mean.

It has been 22 days since I last addressed the plenary about cancer. In that time, many people’s lives have been turned upside down by a cancer diagnosis. Hundreds have had cancer treatment, and many patients have walked out of hospital and returned to their daily lives with cancer in remission. Some have also sadly died. My point is that cancer affects nearly all of our lives. I know very well the physical and emotional consequences of this disease, not only as a medical doctor, but also as someone who lost three brothers to this disease.  So I’m happy to stand before you again to reiterate the importance of Europe coming together to beat cancer. We already know that 40% of cancer cases could be prevented by avoiding key risk factors like smoking, alcohol, physical inactivity and excess body weight.  I would like to highlight once again how important it is to grasp this fact and turn it into action. However, this is difficult to achieve when we are only spending three percent of health system resources on prevention. This is simply not enough; this is a drop in the ocean. If we want to succeed, we need to increase this amount and make sure that what we do spend is spent effectively. I will not go again through all that the EU has so far achieved on cancer, but I would like to proudly recall: EU legislation that has been upgraded on chemicals, pesticides and exposure to carcinogens, including at work. Tobacco consumption fell through legislation and anti-smoking campaigns. The European Code Against Cancer, which is spreading the word on prevention. The continuous improvement in coverage and quality of national screening programmes for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer. Twenty—four European Union reference networks, of which four are dealing specifically with rare and complex cancers, especially in children.  This list is not finished; they have more to do. Dear Members, we all agree that we should grasp technological and scientific developments when it comes to cancer prevention, treatment and care. It is essential that this innovation and these developments reach the patients who need them. As you know, investment in research and innovation has been a long-standing priority of the Commission, and this will continue. With its proposal for Horizon Europe, the Commission has introduced a mission approach, which would help to build a coalition to address the most pressing global and European challenges.  One of the first mission areas identified for Horizon Europe is action on cancer to mobilise a broad spectrum of actors, including citizens, patients and all those who care for them. It is a relentless disease, but science is also a relentless, and so is our collective determination to fight this disease. Thank you for your insistence, determination and commitment to put cancer on the EU agenda. I am pleased to see that my successor has been given the privilege to present a European plan against cancer with a holistic approach. This means it will look at prevention, diagnosis, treatment, palliative care and survivorship. I’m sure that, together with you and the Member States, the next Commission will be able to forge a strong alliance to prevent cancer, promote innovation and improve treatment and care in the interests of all.

We also need cooperation. We need the expertise from the research of the ITRE Committee, protection in the workplace, social rights also of cancer patients – this is what the EMPL Committee is doing.

First of all, it is the educational one, because from school we should learn those knowledge, skills, skills, healthy living rules, so that we adopt a healthy lifestyle and have the first signs that guide us to a diagnosis.  But the most important is the economic barrier, and we are talking about the money we invest in health, because many often do not have access to such innovative techniques, screening methods, early diagnosis and even less treatment. We are talking about money, which is why I told you that I am also unhappy with this year's budget, the multiannual budget, the budget allocated to these regional hospitals, for treatment methods and early diagnosis.

Let me start with positive information: in Poland there is no shortage of equipment for treatment. But there is a lack of staff who can handle this equipment. There is a shortage of doctors, as there are only 2.4 doctors per 1000 inhabitants of my country on average (the eu-wide average is 3.8). Many doctors have left or left the profession due to poor working conditions. Those who remained work after hours, many above their strength. There is a shortage of nurses (the average age of nurses in Poland is 52 years), laboratory specialists and technicians.  We need to educate or accept thousands of new skilled workers to work in this sector. There is a lack of psychological care for patients and their families. Psychological support needs to be built. The pool of research and therapy is insufficient. Often, patients cannot afford to wait in several months of queues for research and treatment. Therapies prescribed for their diseases are not reimbursed. They are forced to pay for research and treatment themselves. We need effective treatment programs.

However, this has not yet been decided at this level. The question now is, above all, whether Croatia is indeed technically qualified and flawless in securing the Union's external border.

Of course, the basic responsibility for the state of forests lies with the Member States, after all, the primary law does not actually speak of forestry at all.
