It is also an emotion for us to remember the attack two years ago, on 11 December 2018, that struck the city of Strasbourg and our institution. My thoughts with you go out to the victims, their families and their friends. Strasbourg and its region have suffered deeply from Covid-19, a virus that has killed so many of our fellow citizens. We will end this year with almost five hundred thousand dead. We are aware of the human, social and economic difficulties that the city is facing. Parliament wants to be at your side and we have been happy to be able to provide with some solidarity initiatives, to try to meet the difficulties of citizens of this city, to provide a solidarity canteen and screening center for Covid-19, because we have always thought that it is the task of the institutions to set a good example. It is our common wish to hold our plenary sessions again in this Chamber. Parliament has acted with determination and has quickly implemented the necessary steps to continue its work in the difficult circumstances that have imposed on us in recent months, but we can also be proud that Covid has not stopped the institutions and has not stopped the European Parliament and therefore has not stopped the development of European democracy and its institutions. Parliament can be proud to have exercised its prerogatives and to have kept European democracy open. After my opening, the session will, as you know, resume from Brussels in full compliance with the measures in force for the protection of public health. But we will soon return to Strasbourg, this is our home, as it is written in the Treaties, but that is what is written in the history of the European Union. The Covid-19 pandemic, as you know, is having very profound social and economic consequences for our citizens and businesses. We will emerge stronger and more united from this crisis, I am convinced. Just as I am convinced that the challenges we face in the future will be able to count on a Union that will be more resilient and more capable of meeting the challenges of the future, and the measures we have taken in recent months will enable future generations to respond better, to face more strongly the challenges that the global world will present to us. It is time for a truly European vision, and I believe that our public opinion and our citizens are also realising that a more efficient, stronger Europe is a guarantee of their response, that no one alone could do it. Let us remember at the moment a forward-thinking man, a man who gave a great deal to the European Union and its institutions, former President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. He left us on 2 December, we lost a friend and a passionate European.  In his \"Mémoires\" he wrote that for him it was \"a source of intense satisfaction [ ...] contribute to the construction of Europe.\" And its contribution is part of our reality: a European Parliament elected by universal suffrage; the creation in 1979 of the European Monetary System, which twenty years later gave birth to our single currency, the euro; the establishment of regular 'European Councils', such as the one that took place last week and which finally gave the green light to an important response to this crisis. His convictions have made him work tirelessly for a more democratic Europe, a Europe closer to its citizens, and led him to lead the Convention responsible for presenting the European Constitution. He believed a lot in a project that was as balanced as possible. And as Jean Monnet – who inspired him – observed, Europe seemed \"une étape naturelle\" to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. That is also why it is only natural that the European Parliament should pay tribute to the President who was a Member of this Parliament from 1989 to 1993.  We will be meeting in this Chamber, here in Strasbourg, on 2 February, his birthday, to honour him in a ceremony attended by President Macron and other Heads of State or Government. Please join me for a minute's silence in memory of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. (Parliament was standing and observing a minute's silence)  The time has come to maintain its fight and to work for a Europe that lives up to the expectations of our citizens. That is Parliament's commitment.  Last Saturday, five years ago, the Paris Agreement was signed. Since 2015, the European Union and many countries, parliaments and cities have declared a climate and environmental emergency. The citizens, especially our young people, have called for urgent action at global level.  Since then, we have imagined a more sustainable development model with environmental and social justice at its heart. The Green Deal is our new strategy, our new growth strategy and will be a turning point for decades to come. We want Europe to become the first climate-neutral continent in 2050. We want to be first in the class. Emission reduction targets are a measure of our ambition and, under European climate law, the European Parliament sees a 60 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as the key to achieving our targets.  Through the Paris Agreement, European nations have committed themselves to playing a leading role in achieving the green transition. It is our responsibility, as a Parliament, to ensure that the Eu ropean Union continues to be a pioneer in the fight against climate change. The European Parliament will work to ensure a green transition and a just transition. But policies need resources. Important votes await us, and I am particularly pleased that Parliament will vote at this session on the multiannual financial framework and own resources, as well as on the rule of law regulation after the Council has unblocked these dossiers. This money, these instruments are extremely necessary for our citizens and our businesses. Parliament has been a decisive player from day one, because we wanted to reach the best possible agreement. This debate is not just about money, it is about the lives of Europeans. Therefore, we will remain vigilant in the implementation phase. In conclusion, I would also like to remind you at this time that we are about to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Dayton Agreement. While it was important for the time when he stopped the war, it is certainly time to look beyond this agreement and into the future. A quarter of a century later, the wounds of war are still present.  Only through genuine and sincere reconciliation can the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their political leaders build an inclusive, prosperous and Europe-oriented society that offers a future to the younger generation. This is an important plenary session, it is a year that will enter the history books and we certainly do not want the consequences of this difficult year to stop us in our ambitions, in our projects and in our decisions, which will be so important, including next year, to ensure that the Union responds to the needs of our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Virginie JORON", "mepid": "197627", "text": "   Mr President, for a point of order, Article 155.

Mr President, I am satisfied that, in difficult circumstances, we were able to reach an agreement on the 2021 budget quite quickly.  It has indeed been a very special year with COVID-19, but also, of course, with very intense negotiations on the MFK and on the recovery plan. This has contributed to a great deal of pressure on the 2021 budget calendar. These circumstances have led to both Parliament and the Council and the Commission being required to adapt and work efficiently. I would therefore like to thank both Parliament's rapporteurs and Ambassador Clauss of the Council and Commissioner Hahn of the Commission for their remarkable adaptability and realism in these negotiations.  Parliament has shown itself to be constructive, but we remain vigilant. The transcripts of the agreements must be in accordance with the agreements. We have indicated both in the negotiations for the MFK and in the 2021 budget that we will continue to oppose misinterpretations.  Forward-looking programmes are being strengthened again, which is the message of the 2021 budget. The additional investments in, for example, trans-European transport networks and digital Europe meet the expectations of EU citizens. I am sure that the rapporteurs will certainly go into some other specific elements of the budgetary agreement. The focus on innovative and forward-looking programmes is also in line with the agreement on the multiannual budget.  Although I personally – and I really want this here – I think that this shift should have been more pronounced. Europe can really make a difference at global level, if it so wishes.  By thinking ahead, by focusing on education, on innovation, on research. Europe can distinguish itself here in areas where it can really offer added value. Above all, however, Europe would do itself a great service, because, of course, these expenditures and investments are so important for growth, job creation and competitiveness. After decades of – let me say – rather \"classic\" budgets, that shift in spending has been carefully deployed. As far as I am concerned, it should have been even more pronounced, but it is remarkable that this Parliament's negotiating team has had to fight to safeguard and strengthen forward-looking programmes. This means that there are still a number of stalled policy choices that continue to demand attention and resources. Just because we've always done it like this doesn't mean it should always be like this.   The European Union must constantly question itself and measure, objectively assess and adjust the efficiency of policy options where it is needed. I hope that in the next few years european policy actors – and certainly the Member States – will show courage to play real trump cards, for example, and not least in terms of research, development and infrastructure.  This brings me to a second observation. We can strengthen our innovative sectors by making the right policy choices and, of course, by linking the necessary budgets. However, it also calls for a comprehensive overall strategy. If, for example, we look at the position and attitude of the big tech companies, the conclusion is abundantly clear: the monopoly position of these giants is becoming increasingly problematic.  Honour who is honoured: Commissioner Vestager was one of the first to set a number of beacons and pushed boundaries, with varying degrees of success, but also with perseverance. For that, they and the Commission deserve all the credit for this. But the problem is clearly not off the table, far from it. When I read and see that the five major tech companies today have over EUR 500 billion – almost USD 600 billion – in cash, which is more than the GDP of my country, Belgium, where we are. That is huge, which is mind-boggling, and that proves that these companies – and this is, of course, euphemistically expressed – do not work in normal competitive conditions. Instead of staring blindly at how these big boys can be taxed – mind you, I have absolutely no problem with that, quite the contrary, although it sometimes seems like a battle for symbols and perception – this problem needs to be tackled on the ground. A digitaks is not going to change the landscape in that sector substantially. In fact, that levy will in any case be passed on to the user at least in part, directly or indirectly, to the consumer. I am convinced that there is an urgent need to develop levers to monitor the necessary balances in all innovative sectors. While we invest in our innovative start-ups and growers, they are in danger of being stifling by these giants because they are willingly driven into a trap.  That is cynical, it is undesirable, and that goes against the objectives of a future-oriented Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that we can join forces to work together towards a future-driven strategy for citizens and businesses.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Pierre LARROUTUROU", "mepid": "197698", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, dear friends, there has been a lot of talk about the 'post-cancer world': the world after coronavirus. And if we are not able to radically change policy, I fear that the next world will be like the world before, but worse.  In 2020, we avoided collapse. Thanks to Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and all the heads of state who supported the recovery plan. Thank you to all the diplomats, the commissioners, the senior officials who spent sleepless nights negotiating it. Without this plan, without the thousands of protected jobs, we would be very close to chaos. But we all know that nothing is settled. The mixture of the health crisis, the social crisis and the climate crisis can lead us very quickly to chaos. Everything remains to be done to build a new balance, a new model of prosperity. On Friday, all EU leaders agreed on a new target: to reduce CO2 emissions by 55% by 2030. Well done! But we all know that to achieve this result, everything remains to be done. If we take into account products imported from China, our CO2 emissions have never decreased. Our emissions, our carbon footprints have never decreased. So everything remains to be done. And 2020, despite the economic crisis, may be the worst year for CO2 developments, as forest fires have more than compensated for the decline in CO2 linked to the economic crisis.  My friends, in 2020, we avoided collapse. 2021 must be the year of renewal, a new beginning for Europe, a new social situation, a new ecological situation. And to finance this new situation, we need new financial resources. The European Commission itself says that to win the battle of climate and jobs, more than 600 billion euros of investment must be added each year. In its report voted on 13 November, Parliament provides concrete solutions to find the $600 billion, including five new own resources. He points out that the financial transaction tax alone can bring in $57 billion a year, despite Brexit and the economic crisis. $57 billion is more than the other four resources together. And to get out of the unanimity rule that blocks negotiations, Parliament calls for the immediate resumption of enhanced cooperation with a group of pioneering countries. The good news is that in the budget agreement that was approved by the 27 Member States on Thursday, the European Commission joins Parliament's proposal. It reiterates that negotiations with a group of pioneering countries on the financial transaction tax can be restarted, in enhanced cooperation, and that this negotiation can be completed by 2022. The Commission says that if the negotiations are completed by 2022, it will propose to make this financial transaction tax a clean resource for the whole of the Union. The Commission joins Parliament's proposals to unblock the negotiations. This time, if a country wants to block the negotiation, it will not be able to. No need for unanimity. And if the speculation tax at the same time allows the common debt of \"Next Generation EU\" to be repaid and the climate and employment plan financed, whoever blocks the negotiation will have to explain to his constituents that he would rather lower pensions or health spending than tax traders a little.  My friends, in 2021, Europe needs a historic turning point. In conscience, I think the 2021 budget is good, but it is not up to the challenge. I have said this for several months before you, in conscience: if there is not an additional $50 billion each year for the budget, I will not be able to vote for it. I will not vote against either, I will abstain. This is the first time in the history of Parliament that a budget has been supported by six groups, and I thank them. I believe that in the coming months, together with Angela Merkel, with Antonio Costa, we will be able to create a new Union. In 1950, it took Schuman and Adenauer two weeks to create the European Coal and Steel Community. I hope that in the next six months we will be creating the Union for Health, Climate and Employment.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today I am satisfied. Satisfied with the knowledge that European values have not been chipped to get Poland and Hungary vetoed the next multi-year financial framework. It is also pleased to see that all the EU institutions have carried high the European values of solidarity and responsibility. Finally, satisfied to see that all these months spent negotiating the first budget of this new budget cycle will enable the Union to start, from 1 January next, in optimal conditions to ensure recovery. This is the victory of a united European Parliament. It is the victory of a Europe that acts, listens to its citizens and does not want to leave anyone at the edge of the road. As I have said on many occasions, the budget is much more than numbers: they are political choices. These are not expenditures: they are investments in projects and programmes that serve citizens, in the service of a greener, more social, fairer Europe, which is concerned with sustainable economic development.  In this negotiation, we have therefore decided to strengthen some of the flagship programmes such as health, youth, digital and its artificial intelligence component, justice and the fight against violence against women, the environment and climate issues, transport infrastructure and research. We have also paid particular attention to the sectors most affected by the crisis, such as SMEs and tourism, in order to preserve workers and promote the creation of sustainable jobs. We have called for a strong and operational European Public Prosecutor's Office, capable of fully carrying out its tasks to protect the European budget. We also wanted, in these hectic times, to provide support to the younger generations, because the best investment we can make to avoid a generation COVID-19 is to invest in our youth.  The 2021 European budget also includes the budget of our institutions - Parliament and other European institutions. In this regard, it balances the economies of our health crisis-disrupted way of operating with the need to operate our institutions effectively. Colleagues, our institutions have shown courage, preferring creativity and ingenuity to business as usual for a massive, sustainable recovery.

Hence, I would like to congratulate the negotiators, in particular the two rapporteurs, Mr Larrouturou and Mr Chastel, and the German Presidency, who were forcefully and well versed in the art of the compromise and made it finally possible. The agreement for 2021 is a forward—looking compromise, fully in line with the larger framework of the long-term budget for 2021 to 2027 and Next Generation EU, which will provide an unprecedented EUR 1.8 trillion budget to help rebuild a post—COVID—19 Europe. The 2021 budget agreement not only fully respects the MFF political agreement but also reflects both the Parliament and Council positions fairly. This budget will allow the Union to mobilise significant funds for a continued EU response to the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences, to kick—start a sustainable recovery and to protect and create jobs. It ensures that we are able to invest in the future to achieve a greener, more digital and, finally, more resilient Europe. I will now briefly run through the main elements of our agreement. Overall commitments will be EUR 164 billion and the overall level of payment appropriations will be EUR 166 billion. It’s important that we also preserve flexibility in next year’s budget. Since the uncertainty doesn’t end at the end of this year, we can be sure that we will also need the flexibility next year. This budget agreement ensures that we have that room for manoeuvre to face whatever awaits us in 2021. The agreement includes the entire package of pilot projects and preparatory actions proposed by the Parliament, amounting to EUR 72 million. It maintains our ability to fully finance the funding costs of Next Generation EU whilst reinforcing shared priorities, partially by reallocating and partially by making additional money available from the unallocated margins of the MFF. Overall, we agreed to reinforce the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Transport, EUR 60 million, plus EUR 60 million in Digital Europe, plus EUR 26 million, which will benefit our green and digital transitions and our economic recovery alike. Additionally, we reconfirm our commitment to a greener Europe by the substantive reinforcement of the LIFE programme: an additional EUR 42 million. We will strengthen the Justice Programme, plus EUR 3 million in the Rights and Values Programme, plus EUR 7 million. We also agreed to further reinforce the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, thus strengthening the Union’s ability to investigate, prosecute and bring to justice crimes against the EU budget, such as fraud and corruption, and we hope it can finally become operational soon. We further agreed to strengthen the Fundamental Rights Agency, the European Institute for Gender Equality, Eurojust and eu-LISA. On the external policy side, we reinforced the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and we increased our strategic communications capacity, as well as humanitarian aid. Beyond the bare finances, five statements have been added. These highlight, amongst others, the priority to tackle child poverty and the urgent need to tackle the impact of the COVID—19 crisis, with particular attention to sectors that are severely hit by the crisis, such as tourism and SMEs, and the people that are the most affected by the crisis, such as children and young people. Additionally, we will also make the research commitment available again to the benefit of the new Horizon Europe programme. Therefore, the famous Article 50.3 of the financial regulations has been implemented, in line with the MFF agreement.

In this context, the first annual budget since the beginning of the pandemic and the first budget without the UK will be an important and necessary step towards Europe's recovery. We are expected to have concrete solidarity towards the most affected countries, economic sectors, but also generations. Unfortunately, it seems that young people will once again be most affected by the economic crisis.  That is why new lost years must not be allowed for generations of young Europeans and this was one of the principles we were guided by in drawing up this budget.  Recovery will only be possible with dynamic SMEs, which are the engine of the European economy, as well as with further investments in the modernisation of Europe - by investing in health, digitalisation and infrastructure.

So, dear friends, in less than three weeks we will start a new cycle for Europe: that of Europe of defence, that of Europe of health, that of green Europe and, hence, that of Europe which does not sell its values. 2021 will also be the year of the introduction of the first of a new set of own resources, the 'plastic contribution'. The first in 32 years. We owe this to the Commission's proposal, Commissioner, but also to pressure from the European Parliament. Without that, I doubt we would have made progress on the subject. These are collective victories, and we must stress that. One last point, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I note that the annual budget was passed without difficulty. That's great. But the multi-year budget once again rolled out the red carpet to national haggling and selfishness, because it was passed unanimously. A true path of the cross to find the common interest.

However, since it is the first in the new MFF and among the new challenges of the reconstruction plan, it would be important that it is reliable and can also be carried out in a stable manner. However, I have my doubts about this, even after the committee meeting this afternoon. After the overall package had already been voted on in July, it was amended at the instigation of Parliament at the beginning of November so that no party clearly knew what was now in place. Therefore, after last week's summit, everyone was able to declare themselves the winner. There is something wrong with that. How can this be explained? I am afraid that the negotiations for the overall package did not play with open cards. Yet it is one of our Christian values – and this is especially true in the present Advent season – that in preparation for the coming of the world judge, we \"speak truth with our neighbour\". Speaking truth is obviously the precondition of the prophet Zechariah, whom I have just quoted, that we can sing loudly and joyfully with the daughter of Zion the king's entry.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this is where we are: a 2021 budget which has made many advances - an additional EUR 180 million compared to the previous one. It is quite rare to see such an increase, particularly on environmental issues - the LIFE programme, the European Environment Agency - but also on transport. And also on an important subject: the issue of gender equality.  But, as we know, this first budget 2021 is the first in a new budget cycle. And on that point, there are still gaps that are too great in relation to the urgency to act that is ours. While the new stated target of a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 is an unprecedented effort, it is still largely insufficient. In this race of speed that is ours in relation to the climatic disorders, the fall of biodiversity, the devastation caused by our so-called \"development\" model, we must go harder and we have to go much faster.  From this point of view, it must be said at some point that this Parliament and the European Union can no longer accept to be the toy of conflicting interests of States and the Council, particularly in budgetary matters. If we want a federal Europe, a powerful Europe, a Europe that weighs in the concert of the world, we must have fiscal autonomy, budgetary independence.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has There are 50 million people living in the EU who are members of a minority. In addition to the 24 official languages, we have over 60 regional and minority languages. The members of these minorities are an integral part of Europe's cultural diversity. As a German Sinto, I am one of those 50 million. Dealing with minorities is a measure of the freedom and democracy of our society. The best guarantee for the free development of minorities is the establishment of their rights. It is about the rights as citizens of the EU, it is about the free development of cultural rights and the protection of their language. But it is precisely this protection that is patchy in the EU, as there are no common EU minimum standards or a legal framework that ensures the protection and promotion of minorities. The Minority SafePack initiative and its more than one million supporters want to improve this situation. Key issues are simplified access to cultural production and media in one's own language, the promotion of linguistic diversity and participation in support programmes in the cultural sector.  Last but not least, the decisive fight against statelessness is an important element, which still exists as a phenomenon in Europe and affects people with a Romani background in particular. It is unacceptable for people to be denied state protection and equal participation because of administrative harassment or racist reservations. In addition, we in the EU are constantly seeing cases of segregation, racism, hate speech and xenophobia against ethnic minorities. Discrimination takes place in education, in work or in access to the social system. In the Corona pandemic, this situation has worsened and minorities have been blamed for the spread of the virus. This dimension must also be taken into account when we talk about minority rights, because in a climate of fear and stigma, the unhindered exercise of cultural and civil rights is hardly conceivable. As representatives of European societies, we have a responsibility to work for the rights and equal participation of all people in the EU. I therefore hope that this important citizens' initiative will receive broad support in this House.

This European Parliament has no deficit of democratic legitimacy. It is the only directly elective institution of the Union's architecture. It has no competition deficit. It is a fully legislative Parliament, also in the field of fundamental rights, but it is a Parliament which has difficulties , let us say this , in connecting with the citizenship we represent and, therefore, here we find an initiative that has managed to overcome all the difficulties in which dozens of others have been directed who have tried, but have failed to reach this House.  There are at least seventy citizen initiatives that have been launched, but here we find one – one of which has one hand – that has managed to gather no less than 1 300 000 signatures, not in seven Member States – a quarter, article 11 of the Treaty on European Union – but eleven. Moreover, it does so in a matter which calls for the Commission's action because it is consistent with European values, with the value of minority protection, enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. And we have said many times that the European idea of democracy is neither confined to the rule of the majority, but requires the protection of minorities in accordance with the rule of law. And here we find the protection of cultural and linguistic minorities, consistent with the European Charter of Regional or Minority Languages, adopted by the Council of Europe, which aims to send the Commission to take those measures, legal or legal acts, which are required to do so in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity , of proportionality, but above all of the prohibition of discrimination, which is a fundamental right enshrined in Articles 21 and 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. We therefore have a great option to do this work, and I am happy to welcome this citizen initiative, which makes sense, which undoubtedly affects competences which are the responsibility of the Member States but which can receive added value from the European decision-making process. And that is what I hope will happen from now on with an observatory, with a centre for the promotion of linguistic diversity, which will watch over the prohibition of hate speech against linguistic minorities and therefore offer added value to the recognition of the status that linguistic diversity deserves in the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 28, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Tatjana ŽDANOKA", "mepid": "28619", "text": "  on behalf of the Committee on Petitions. – Madam President, according to the rules, the Committee on Petitions is automatically associated when a Citizens’ Initiative is published. Why so? Because our committee is a bridge between people and the European institutions. We receive individual petitions. We receive collective petitions, some of them signed by thousands or hundreds of thousands, but, of course, the European Citizens’ Initiative signed by one million people from many Member States is in the first round, in the first column, of that bridge. And of course the Minority SafePack is a special column since it had to go over the bridge two times. First it was thrown out, then it had to go to the European Court of Justice and is now reaching the institutions. And the Minority SafePack discussion was very active and this initiative received the support of the majority of those participating in the hearings two months ago. Therefore, Commissioner, we are waiting for very concrete steps from your side. We want you to legislate just on behalf of the Commission. We have no right to disappoint the 1.2 million people who signed this petition. And a few words about a particular group of signatories from my small state, Latvia: not all of those who wanted to send a petition could do it, since among minorities one quarter are those stateless non-citizens who have no rights to sign, who have no rights to take part in any elections and are deprived of many rights. I am very happy that one of the nine items included in this initiative is approximating equality for stateless minorities like the Roma. The solution for realising this proposal could be the following: the Member State makes a declaration that a person who does not hold the nationality of any country, but who resides in that Member State and holds a travel document issued by that Member State is to be in possession of the same rights that EU law grants to EU citizens. When amending the visa regulations in 2006, by my proposal, just these EU residents defined by this formula were exempted from the visa requirements. But it was, to my regret, the only essential approximation of the rights of stateless citizens. Now it is time to go further and to grant them the rights that EU citizens in all Member States other than their own have – the right to vote in local and European elections, the right to work, etc. So, such a good approach can be initiated by the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "   Qabel ma nagħti l-kelma lill-Kummissarju Hahn, niftaħ is-sessjoni ta' votazzjoni tal-lum.

Today’s plenary debate provides another opportunity to listen carefully to the contributions and interventions from various Members. This will further deepen our joint understanding of the different political considerations in support of the various proposals covered by these initiatives.  Today’s plenary debate on this initiative confirms that the European Citizens’ Initiative instrument offers a unique tool for citizens to engage in direct participatory democracy. Maybe even more important, it demonstrates that it is an agenda—setting tool for policy shaping at Union level. The Minority SafePack initiative is not the last initiative to have successfully collected the required one million signatures and to have been submitted to the Commission for examination. In October, the Commission received a sixth successful initiative called ‘End the Cage Age’.  At this point in time I am not able to go into the details of the Commission reply to the organisers of the Minority SafePack initiative. Today, we will listen to you and I will carefully reflect on the resolution once adopted. The exchange of views today will inspire the ongoing reflection process of the Commission. We will present our general conclusions, as well as the action that we intend to take, in a communication planned for January next year. In that respect I wish a further fruitful discussion.

A language is alive when it is spoken, and this requires educational institutions such as schools, such as kindergartens and, above all, native language teaching.

However, this will not be possible without support from European Union support programmes.  In Austria, where the Commissioner comes from and where I come from, the protection of minorities is of particular importance. Minority rights are enshrined in the State Treaty, and yet their enforcement has also been linked to conflict. And Austria, on the other hand, has fought for the rights of German-speaking South Tyroleans.  And therefore my conclusion: what we are asking for an ethnic group connected to us in another country should be at least as self-evident for ethnic groups in their own country. In this way, we can help to prevent and end conflicts and violence, and that is one of the founding ideas of the European Union. We may come from different cultures and countries and speak different languages, but we should use a common language, that of our common values and the rule of law that underpins this European Union.

The subject of this initiative is close to the heart of Renew Europe and to me personally. I am of Moroccan descent but was born and raised in Friesland, a province in the north of the Netherlands with its own identity and language. Being Frisian means being proud of the history and cultural heritage of this part of the Netherlands. Next to Dutch, I also learned the Frisian language at school, and it is important that we keep teaching it to preserve this part of our cultural wealth. And I believe it’s one of the core values of our Union that we have respect for cultural and linguistic diversity and protect the rights of minorities in the EU. More than 50 million Europeans belong to traditional minorities and language groups. It’s our duty as the European Union to play an active role in protecting and promoting, and celebrating the diversity in, traditions and languages throughout the European Union. So Commissioner, let me ask you: how will you give a follow-up to this initiative and its proposals? How are you going to promote, protect and celebrate the cultural and linguistic diversity of our Union? I hope we as the European Parliament will be behind this initiative and give full support to the one million signatures and all European citizens belonging to a traditional or language minority.

Similarly, the constitutional, historical and geopolitical aspects of each Member State have to be respected and taken into account. By promoting multilingualism throughout Europe we have to see the whole picture of the world languages, promotion instruments for ensuring linguistic plurality also need to support those official EU languages which have a relatively small, and falling, number of speakers. We cannot create a situation whereby promotion of a certain minority language within a country leads to the endangerment of the official state language or comes at the expense of other minority languages.

Without this, stateless Roma in Europe and EU candidate countries, really without a nationality, have no access to areas like education, health care, employment and so on. We need to resource the fact that endangered languages need to be kept alive. They need to be funded, planned, and we need positive discrimination in that.

But let me start by saying that for the Commission, inclusion and respect for the rich cultural diversity of Europe is one of its main priorities and objectives. ‘United in diversity’ is the motto of the European Union. The Commission confirms its commitment both to policy support and funding. Respect for the rights of persons belonging to minorities is part of the founding values of the European Union and its, if I may say so, DNA. The principle is explicitly mentioned in the Treaty on the European Union. It’s not only compatible but part of our European identity. Moreover, any discrimination on the basis of membership of a national minority is explicitly prohibited under Article 21 of the Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. The adoption of the EU Anti-racism Action Plan 2020-2025 is a clear example of the role the Commission aims to play in this regard. Another good example of concrete policy action involving minorities is the recently-adopted EU Roma framework. As I indicated, this debate is timely, as the College has another few weeks to finalise the Commission’s formal answer to the initiative.

It is important that the European Union finally effectively address the initiative involving more than 50 million indigenous citizens belonging to national minorities. In some European countries and regions, successful minority protection guarantees are already in place, which can serve as an example. The European Union has so far treated the protection of minorities as a subsidiarity issue, but unfortunately often it is the Member States that do not ensure equal rights for indigenous minorities, so the EU must lead by example and take on the role of rights defender. To this end, it is important for the European Union to develop a legal framework to promote the survival of national minorities in its territory and the preservation of their mother tongue, culture and national identity. By developing such a legal framework and applying an appropriate monitoring mechanism, the EU would demonstrate that it is indeed doing something about the protection of minorities' rights.

In this case, it is also best to reflect the added value of this instrument not only to strengthen the voice of citizens in formulating and guiding policies at EU level, thus reducing the sense of democratic deficit, but also to find topics on the agenda of the EU institutions that concern people's daily lives, but are politically sensitive and therefore not supported by individual Member States or (European) political groups.

At the same time, we want to initiate improvements this year in order to actually strengthen the railways. Without a shift to rail, we will not be able to achieve the climate targets set. Around one third of all CO2 emissions in the EU come from the transport sector. Since the 1990s, they have risen by twenty percent. The main causes are the internal combustion engine on the road and the aviation sector. There is no doubt about this: climate-friendly rail must be the backbone of the sustainable transport turnaround in the future. My personal motto for these negotiations was therefore: \"2021, a European year of rail - yes, please, but right!\" Rail policy must once again be a priority, because under the current framework conditions we will simply not be able to achieve this urgent shift to rail. A negative example is, for example, unfair competition between modes of transport at the expense of rail. Route charges are mandatory for each railway line; on the road, tolls are a voluntary matter for the Member States. However, there are positive signs of a change of policy. At the beginning of the legislature, I missed the word 'rail' in the mission letter to DG MOVE. Rail is now playing a prominent role in the Commission's new Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy – and that is important. Perhaps Corona was also a wake-up call here, because the railways have shown how important it is for our security of supply. Perhaps this pandemic has also shown us all that we are intertwined, that everything is intertwined. And we know that the climate crisis threatens to slip into even more uncertain times. We need to decarbonise our mobility. What do we want to achieve with this year of rail? The development of a connectivity index. The attractiveness of a connection can be derived primarily from the travel time from A to B. Such an index should help to identify connections in the European rail network that would have a disproportionate benefit for the entire network. This data will be valuable for targeted investments in future infrastructure development. Although billions have already flowed, as we know, the European rail network is still a patchwork today, and there is a lack of good cross-border connections – we need to do better. Here we call for the completion of the trans-European rail corridors.  But in the shadow of this, we must also think of the small so-called missing left. Many people live – and today we have had linguistic diversity – in internal border regions and have little access to good rail passenger transport. We need to improve that. A Green Rail Label is also to be developed to show at a glance how the goods were transported by rail and with which CO2 footprint. However, we must also make the railways themselves more attractive and do not want to leave the companies out of duty. It must be easier to book international train tickets and get information. We need a common booking platform, and good passenger rights are also included.  Society's interest in the European Year of Rail 2021 is huge, and that is why we are also pleased that contact points are now being set up in the Member States. I call for them to be set up quickly. We must dare to conduct a pan-European discourse on the railways this year. How much money does it take to invest in rail infrastructure – I'm just mentioning digitization and electrification? How do we deal with externalities? How do we tax kerosene in the future? How can toll systems help us achieve our goals, our climate goals and generate money for the rail sector? These are all questions that I hope to be able to kick-start in this lively year of the railways; also, of course, the question of the resources of the Recovery Fund. How can these funds be used as a priority for the development of the railways? Of course, if there is already debt for the future generation, it must also have added value for them, so that \"train instead of flight\" actually works. So now the rail sector is once again a source of hope, and we hope to achieve a real renaissance of rail this year. The announcement of new night train services also shows us that we are on the right track and that the young generation has understood many things. It is and seems perhaps paradoxical in these difficult, restrictive times, when we are all being called upon not to travel and to have as little contact as possible, to start the Year of the Railways with jubilation. But let us perhaps look at it in such a way that together we want to awaken the longing for a conscious journey – sustainable and climate-friendly. After the pandemic, firstly, we will be able to rejoice in our mobility and, secondly, we must decarbonise the sector.

Thank you, both the European Parliament and the Council, for the strong support for this initiative, especially to the rapporteur, Ms Deparnay-Grunenberg, and all shadow rapporteurs, for steering the debate towards this successful outcome. The Commission welcomes the political agreement reached by the co-legislators on 12 November, which was already endorsed by the Committee on Transport (TRAN) and COREPER, and I look forward to your final decision in this session. The designation of the European Year of Rail will be a unique opportunity to promote rail among our citizens and businesses, but also to reflect and discuss how to make it a more attractive option for transport and travel around Europe. Most importantly, we want to reach out beyond rail’s usual supporters and to young people in particular. We will also cover key themes such as tourism, regional connectivity, cultural heritage, accessibility, equality, education and employment and look at how rail contributes to all of them. The European Year of Rail underlines the importance that this Commission attaches to meeting the Green Deal objectives for transport, including a 90% reduction in transport emissions by 2050. Rail also features prominently in our new sustainable and smart mobility strategy. If the strategies are a recipe for a modern future-proof mobility system, rail is certainly one of its main ingredients. I want to stress three aspects. First, the debates and discussions during next year will drive our work to get more passengers and goods using rail. As you know, in 2021 we will present initiatives targeting both. We will also launch a study on the feasibility of creating a rail connectivity index that shows the potential of rail to compete with other transport modes. For the green label, on which I welcome your views, we’ll look at establishing an EU framework for the harmonised measurement of transport and logistics summations, as we have already announced in the sustainable and smart mobility strategy. The European label would promote the transport of goods via less polluting modes, allowing citizens and businesses to make informed choices.

Firstly, not all Member States have the necessary infrastructure to enable rail connections to the rest of Europe. As a consequence, territorial and social cohesion is slower and people and industries are missing out, including education, tourism and the cultural sector. Secondly, for the Year of Rail to be a success, it is also important to promote the historical and present role of trains, railway stations and rail infrastructure, which have been instrumental in shaping regional traditions and identities and are part of Europe’s cultural, and in particular architectural, heritage that must be protected and cherished.

The European Year of Rail, if I may say so, must be a party for everyone. I was pleased to note the intervention of a rapporteur on the connectivity index, which is obviously essential for developing rail throughout Europe, and therefore also in periurban areas and in rural areas. This index of connectivity is essential for the celebration of rail, the celebration of rail, to be a celebration for all Europeans, for all Europeans, and for concrete solutions to connect territories, with all the positive consequences for these territories in terms of economics, in terms of employment, in terms of tourism. That is obviously essential. The second element is taxation. I am obviously arguing that there should be a lower tax, that there should be no more value-added tax on rail, and also, as you know, that there should be a tax on kerosene in return. This is both a European and a global issue.  Finally, Commissioner, I very much hope that, as part of the recovery plans to be tabled by the various Member States, there will be very strong attention on the part of the various Commissioners and of course, of the general secretariat, so that these recovery plans are not simply projects that are recycled and taken out of the drawers. , but that they are fully within the framework set by the European Commission, in particular to support the Green Deal and to come up with new projects that support all rail all over Europe, for all Europeans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Johan DANIELSSON", "mepid": "38542", "text": "  On the other: And on the S&amp;D Group.

In order for the EU to succeed in becoming climate neutral by 2050, the transport sector must reduce its emissions by 90% – at the same time as freight transport is expected to increase by 80% and passenger transport by 50% by the same year. An important part of the strategy for green and sustainable transport must therefore be to create the conditions for a greater proportion of both freight and passenger transport to go by rail rather than by road and by air as it is today. If we are to succeed in this, we must give priority to a few things: firstly, we must ensure that we have proper investment so that we ensure that the trans-European transport network is completed on time.  Secondly, we must make it easier to travel by train in Europe – with good passenger rights, a better and simpler ticket booking system and a night train network.

But, ladies and gentlemen, I strongly hope that the year 2021 will not be limited only to being a mere campaign of dissemination; the year 2021 must be the turning point to get what many of us have been fighting for many years: the famous Mediterranean runners and Atlantic runners in Spain...

Very well. Yet it is indeed the European Union, through its repeated failures, in defiance of democratic opposition, that is responsible for the destruction of this public service. Total liberalisation and opening up to competition in the sector have drastically reduced the market share of our national companies, resulting in the closure of the lines, the acceleration of rural desertification and the breakdown of our territorial cohesion. You have imposed the end of the French public service of rail. You have prohibited favouring a national company for public service missions. You have imposed this destructive scheme, with the active complicity of the right, the left and the pseudo-greens, all globalists. You have chosen the year 2021, because it is marked by several events, including the anniversary of the very first rail link between Paris and Brussels and the 40th anniversary of the TGV. But in reality, 2021 marks above all the umpteenth year of disastrous management by the Brussels technocrats, with the abandonment of rural areas or the subcontracting that generates insecurity due to the non-control of radicalisation.

I have the impression that very, very many colleagues in this room are deusing their energy to look at how to make other modes of transport worse, rather than looking at how to make the railways better. I would therefore like to raise three points in the area of railways, which we must tackle. The first is the capacity problem. We have no capacity in many European countries. In order to increase this, we need investment in the structure of the railways – in France, for example, Mrs Lechanteux, this has been done, by the way, since Emmanuel Macron has been in government – and we need digitisation in ERTMS. Secondly, we need digital ticket booking, which is also mentioned in the paper, and thirdly, we need competition on the railways.  We see where there is competition, more people are using better services, more people are using the railways. Look to Italy, for example! I think that is what you should do.

The VISION of the EPP, taken up by the rest of the colleagues, emphasises the practical side of the programme, namely a more efficient spending of funds and the implementation of the rules in force.

It is a document that would also like to dispel the common place that all too often sees the entrepreneur only as the polluter or the one who evades taxes. On 10 March, the European Commission issued a communication entitled 'A strategy for SMEs for a sustainable and digital Europe', the next day – I have to say with mocking timing – the World Health Organisation declared Covid a pandemic. It was therefore necessary to set ourselves the objective of aligning the Union's priorities with the changed socio-economic framework.  Only a few days ago, President von der Leyen, in a way that we also support, rightly pointed out the role of SMEs in our economy. We are talking about realities that are capable of employing more than 100 million European citizens, generating more than half of the Union's GDP. It was the SMEs that were the ones that were the first to be affected, but they had the ability to give an answer first by managing to convert and giving a big hand to the citizens of Europe.  Let me give you a few examples: I am pleased to mention a company in my region, Veneto, which has been able to convert and move from graphic arts to the manufacture of masks; or a German supplier of the car industry, which I am very happy to cite, which has been able to develop new air filters; or think of the Irish or Italian distilleries that have converted to the production of disinfectants.  Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises must necessarily regain competitiveness, and that is why we will need the help of the credit sector, not least because we often talk about under-capitalised companies. It is necessary to simplify, in particular, if we are talking about accessibility to European funds.  On the subject of bureaucracy, according to a survey, around 80 % of European companies consider the amount of administrative procedures to which they are subject to be excessively onerous, and this report seeks to respond by setting challenging but binding targets for reducing the regulatory burden. Green Deal: the environmental issue, we must realise that sustainability must be environmental, but also economic and social, because no one – and I have said no one – should lose their jobs. With regard to innovation and digitalisation, we must be careful to avoid discrimination, also thinking of those realities that, objectively, struggle to innovate and are impossible, so that assistance and financial instruments must also be accessible to non-digital and non-innovative companies, including those of traditional social services crafts or the creative industry, which therefore need to update themselves digitally in order to maintain their competitiveness. Our companies must also necessarily be protected from unfair pressure from market giants and unfair competition.  I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this text, and i would like to thank Mr Giesecke, Mr Cutajar, Mrs Dlabajová, Mr Hahn, Mr Roos, Mr Pereira, Mr Corrao, for thanking my staff and, of course, the secretariat of the ITRE Committee. Despite the solid majority that supported this text in committee, there will also be some Members who will vote against it on Wednesday. I am sorry because, over and above a text that has had an inclusive approach that has tried to synthesise with the different sensitivities of the different groups, I believe that, in this historical phase, it is necessary to combat the pandemic by acting responsibly and therefore thinking about the solutions that the business world needs, thus thinking of those who work in everyday life in small business realities. I conclude with a wish, because I really would like us to understand, especially at this stage, that those who do business in the days of Covid are not someone who asks for the subsidy or ask for help, but on the contrary it is someone who only asks to be put in a position to be able to work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 94, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Adina-Ioana VĂLEAN", "mepid": "37324", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, it’s a pleasure for me to be part of this debate. Of course we agree with you that small and medium-sized companies are the motor of the European economy and the foundation of Europe’s societal welfare. They make up the majority of companies in all 14 strategic industrial ecosystems and many of them are great innovators. SMEs are front-runners in terms of transition and innovation but depend on an environment in which they can thrive. However, they are less equipped in terms of financial and human resources than large companies, and thus face additional challenges in complying with rules and accessing information, markets and finance. We agree that SMEs have been hit particularly hard by the COVID crisis. A recent study by a SMEunited indicates that more than 90% of SMEs have reported a decrease in turnover as a result of COVID and about two thirds have reported delayed investment decisions or downsized investments. This can have devastating effects on employment. As you know, the EU institutions have not been silent observers to the crisis. On the contrary, the Commission took decisive steps immediately and addressed liquidity problems of SMEs, provided practical advice and information via support services such as the Enterprise Europe Network and supported governments to exchange best practices via the SME Envoy network. Moving now from initial short-term relief to economic recovery, the SME strategy becomes the reference tool of support. A Eurobarometer survey released on 23 September confirmed the relevance of the three pillars of the strategy: capacity-building and support for the twin transition; reducing red tape and improving market access to the single market and beyond; and last but not least, improving access to finance. Adopted just before the pandemic hit the EU with full force, the SME strategy is flexible enough to adapt to the new reality. Implementation of most actions has started and many have been adjusted. Furthermore, the Commission is pushing the effectiveness of the Late Payment Directive to improve SMEs’ liquidity. Activities will focus in the short to medium term on particularly affected ecosystems such as tourism. Under the Enterprise Europe Network the Commission is helping SMEs respond to the crisis by creating partnerships among them. It is also providing information to SMEs and supporting innovation, including through the European Innovation Council. The Enterprise Europe Network will be enhanced to provide advice on sustainability to SMEs and it will work closely with digital innovation hubs to provide a seamless service of advice to SMEs at local and regional level. Our commitment to SMEs does not end with the SME strategy. Small businesses are mainstreamed into most EU policies – for example the Green Deal, the industrial strategy, the single market action plan – and will specifically consider SMEs’ needs when updating the industrial strategy. They are also firmly anchored in our better regulation agenda. We systematically screen our legislative proposals for their impact on SMEs. Such analysis is mandatory and carried out in a proportionate way for every new proposal. A similar systematic approach to reviewing the impact of amendments to legislative proposals on SMEs might be considered by the co-legislators. The EU’s crisis response and the SME strategy support European SMEs in a complementary way. This is why it is imperative that the recovery package and the SME strategy go hand in hand. SMEs must benefit from investment and reforms funded under the recovery and resilience facility, which is why the Commission is working with Member States to address their needs in their national recovery and resilience plans. The upcoming InvestEU Programme will provide crucial recovery-support to all types of companies, including traditional SMEs. It will place a strong focus on key policy priorities such as the Green Deal objectives and digitalisation. The overarching idea of InvestEU is to simplify today’s diverse landscape of financial instruments and to streamline operations. We agree that SMEs would benefit from a single digital entry point for all enquiries on EU financing opportunities for them. The access-to-finance.eu website already offers such a service. We recognise the essential role of banks in financing the European economy, notably small and medium-size enterprises. We have seen how banks have been part of the solution during the COVID crisis and we are building and reinforcing the various pillars of the banking union. At the same time, improving the possibilities for SMEs to tap into capital markets is also essential. The capital markets union initiative aims at widening SMEs’ access to alternative channels of funding such as equity. The Commission is also setting up the SME initial public offerings fund that will in particular seek to support SMEs’ access to public markets for financing. We welcome the Capital Markets Union recovery package as an important step to increase SMEs’ visibility towards investors. We share the call for more female entrepreneurship: InvestEU will help stimulate investment in female-led companies and funds to increase the talent pool and innovation. Global markets are already an important source of growth for SMEs. Small businesses represent 88% of all EU exporters, they account for one third of all EU exports supporting more than 30 million jobs. We will continue to focus on supporting SMEs in the recovery phase. The launch of the new Access2Markets portal is an important step forward to help them. In the medium term, the portal will work in synergy with other information portals and databases for businesses, notably the matchmaking portal of the Enterprise Europe Network and the single digital gateway which will provide integrated information sources and support for European businesses.

So the priorities at the moment are clear and are to ensure stability and continuity for the agri-food chain, which has been hit so hard and so badly in some of its sectors by this pandemic. But the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and farms in the agricultural sector go beyond the particular situation we are experiencing. And the European strategy will then be crucial to ensuring their productivity. In particular, European support should serve to improve their ability to market, to open up to exports, but also to diversify their products and services, with a view to the new 'producer-to-consumer' strategy which, I stress, must not turn into a further excessive administrative burden for our farmers.

We need a binding, improved SME test: all legislative proposals must be reviewed for the consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Honestly, we have been waiting too long here; we wait more than 13 months for this contact person. The business community needs this point of contact, and that must not be a toothless tiger.

Entrepreneurs have had a rough year, and the pandemic has brought to our attention what they have been calling for for years.  The new European budget and extraordinary recovery fund offer a huge amount of resources to rebuild the economy, as well as to finance research, innovation and industrial transformation. This is a huge opportunity and it is important that this information reaches SMEs. However, access to funding must not be limited in size and the possibility of applying for funding must not be complex or administratively demanding. Our report clearly states what the Member States should do – not add additional administrative burdens. But on the contrary, simplify procedures as much as possible and make the most of the possibilities of digitization. And most importantly, treat entrepreneurs fairly.  This year, European programmes have supported a large number of smaller businesses, which have been forced by the pandemic to re-awaken their entrepreneurial spirit and talent and present innovative solutions or to come to the market with something new, currently needed. Programmes such as Horizon Europe or Digital Europe must reflect this and give a helping hand to ambitious start-ups, but also to established firms. As shadow rapporteur, I had a clear vision when working on this report : to set specific and measurable targets and to evaluate regularly every year whether we are meeting them and whether the business environment is actually improving. I am therefore glad that the report contains my proposal for the annual 'State of the Union Address for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises'.

They account for more than 50% of internal eu imports. They are the main providers of jobs in THE EU countries. They have know-how that is often an ancient legacy passed down from generation to generation. They are also at the forefront of innovation, and French SMEs, in particular, are an extraordinary example.  This heritage of our SMEs must be conserved and protected and we must promote it. Unfortunately, these treasures of experience and creativity run up against the Commission's policy: unrelenting support for large groups, the permanent creation of ever more restrictive administrative and technical standards, absurd legal constraints, such as the prohibition on States having a proactive policy, or risk contradicting the sacrosanct rule of free and undistorted competition within the European market. Here are some of the countless obstacles these European forces face. The results of this policy are catastrophic.  Thus the example of Photonis, a French SME specializing in advanced military equipment, also innovative in the field of tests against the COVID epidemic we are facing, already sold to the Americans, without France being able to put in place a protectionist and national policy on these know-how yet essential to our sovereignty. A French-style Small Business Act to favour our companies over those abroad would have prevented such a drift. The crisis makes it more necessary. When we come to power in France, we will.  This crisis, driven by often incomprehensible restrictions on our governments, is severely affecting these companies. In France, the risk of SME failure is estimated at 10%. Europe is emptying itself of its living forces, preferring constant mobility to deep-rooted solidity, an above-ground world with national know-how.

The economic crisis triggered by the pandemic has brought a significant number of small and medium-sized enterprises, including micro-enterprises, to the brink of bankruptcy, including in the Slovak Republic. They must therefore be given due attention when supporting and using financial resources. Traditional bank loans are the most important or resource practised for small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union, but this is unacceptable or not acceptable at all to start-ups of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is therefore necessary to give priority to grants. Tax breaks are also not the best solution. The European Commission needs to urge nation states to recognise employment protection and the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises, micro-enterprises and the emergence of start-ups as the top political priority. When drawing on the financial resources of SMEs, they should be directly involved through their representatives, through regions, as is the case with friends in the Quartet in Poland, and assistance in digitising the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises is also essential.

Access to finance is crucial for them and, in particular, the situation in the gastro sector and throughout the chain of their suppliers is particularly difficult. These firms need an immediate solution based on financial assistance, or at least by remission of levy obligations. Let us therefore not allow this important part of our cultural heritage to disappear and be replaced by uniform multinational operations and fast food. Access to finance, reducing administrative burdens and completing the common market are important for the future of small business.

I consider it important to extend the possibilities for using capital market financing, including the cross-border dimension. After all, the forthcoming legislation in this area should focus on SMEs. Another important topic in this regard is the development of financial literacy. Secondly, digitalisation: this transformation, significantly accelerated by the pandemic, will bring new opportunities for companies to reach a wider range of investors and customers not only in Europe, but also in the world. Access to, processing and evaluation of data is a key factor here, as is the case with large technology players.

Many small and medium-sized enterprises have excelled with smart solutions and innovation to market their products or provide services in the face of a pandemic. This is a solid testament to the fact that European businesses are open and flexible to innovation. In all of this, they need more confidence and faith in the future. The European Union must instill hope, certainty and perspective with a new strategy for small and medium-sized enterprises. We must leave businesses more freedom of decision-making and action, reduce administrative burdens and depend on the various constraints and regulations that discourage entrepreneurship.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, it is nice that this is the first time we have to deal with each other. Once again, all the best for your term of office!  Ladies and gentlemen, this is about the European Union's ability to act. We all know that the trade situation has become more complicated, tougher and that we are increasingly dealing with unilateral measures in the area of trade. And we are now also in many areas where trading partners pass laws that ultimately have extraterritorial effects on our ability to trade. And that is a problem that is growing. We have an impact on financial service providers above all, on insurance companies, on quality certifiers, and sometimes also on public authorities. Sometimes there are bans on people from the European Union entering our partners – in other words, a whole series of indirect effects of sanctions, which have been adopted by means of laws in other partner countries. And then, of course, the question arises as to how we react, and the clear answer should be that we go to the WTO and see how we manage to do so within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. However, there is no rulebook for extraterritorial effects. In this respect, we have to look at what we have in our toolbox. And we have recently put a number of legislation in the toolbox to strengthen the capacity to act again. For example, we have renewed anti-dumping legislation, we have launched investment screening, and we have now recently adopted enforcement legislation – three pieces of legislation that strengthen the capacity to act.  But there is still a gap for these extraterritorial effects. We have a blocking statute from 1996. We set this in motion at the time when the United States imposed sanctions on Cuba and there were also fears of extraterritorial effects on European companies. With the adoption of the blocking statute alone, the danger was actually eliminated. The US then failed to impose sanctions on European companies.  That doesn't work anymore. With regard to Iran, we have seen the case that many companies that have fallen under this blocking statute – which actually requires that European companies should not be subject to extraterritorial effects and sanctions – have been granted exemptions from the blocking statute, because they were, of course, more economically in business with the US than with Iran. I have a whole stack of waivers in my office. So that doesn't work. And also what we have introduced in the case of Iran – Instex – in order to gain a transaction opportunity, a business opportunity between Iran and European companies, is not effective either. In this respect, I believe that we need a little more. And there are still some conflicts on the horizon: the discussion about digital taxes, how to deal with Internet companies, the question of 5G is included and, of course, the discussion about Nord Stream 2. In this respect, I believe we need to expand our toolbox.  And here we should – and I would also like to hear this from the Commission – see how we can actually shape our financial instruments in order to reduce dependence on American and other international banks and, of course, also to push back the dollar as a trading currency for European treaties in order to become more independent of the dollar and to establish the euro as our currency. I believe that we must also look at whether we can achieve this independence here with Eurobonds or other financial instruments, and perhaps also introduce financial instruments that are ultimately different from a normal bank and are more likely to take the foundation's approach. In addition, I believe that we must look at how we can also defend ourselves against coercive measures. In the area of the debate on enforcement legislation, we have discussed a new legislative proposal from the Commission, a law to avert coercive measures by third countries. And I would, of course, also be interested to know how far the Commission has come in its deliberations. So I believe that we must strengthen the toolbox so that we can regain the European Union's ability to act in the international context.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 140, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  Now it is my great pleasure to welcome Commissioner Mairead McGuinness.

This is a really serious issue. The chairman of the Committee, Bernd Lange, my former colleague, has outlined really well what the situation is, so I’m going to talk you through the past, the present and, potentially, the future. It’s very true, as you’ve outlined, that in recent years, sanctions by third countries have caused severe adverse economic effects on certain EU economic operators who are conducting legitimate activities, and this is the case in relation to US sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Russia, and these concerns have been raised at the very highest level, including with the statement of High Representative / Vice-President Borrell on 17 July. Outreach with the US administration and Congress has also increased. These developments have shown the need for action, and the European Union is taking steps to increase its resilience against extra-territorial sanctions. First, the EU has revived its instrument against the extra-territorial application of third-country sanctions. The blocking statute already referred to was adopted in 1996 and amended in 2018 after the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and currently applies to US sanctions against Cuba and Iran. It prevents the enforcement of respective US legislation, including US judgements or decisions based on these sanctions regimes, and furthermore it allows EU economic operators to recover resulting damages. The Commission published guidelines on the blocking statute in 2018, and further guidance will be published early next year. As regards Cuba, the Commission is monitoring closely the situation following the reactivation of Titles 3 and 4 of the Helms-Burton Act. It provides support to EU economic operators in coordination with Member States and issues guidance. In relation to Iran, the Commission is supportive of the instrument in support of trade exchanges (INSTEX), an initiative of three countries initially – Germany, France and the United Kingdom – and more recently joined by Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland and Sweden. Its objective is to facilitate payments for legitimate trade between the European Union and Iran. While not a new instrument, INSTEX is an important answer to the US sanctions which caters for the needs of EU financial operators. The Commission is studying the operations and progress of INSTEX to gauge whether it could serve as a blueprint for a similar initiative at Union level. The Commission is developing additional proposals to ensure that Europe is more resilient to third countries’ extra-territorial sanctions. We will in early 2021 have a communication on strengthening the Union’s open economic and financial autonomy. It will put forward measures to reinforce the EU’s toolbox against extra-territorial sanctions, including the blocking statute. It will also contain proposals to strengthen the resilience of key EU financial market infrastructures to extra-territorial sanctions. These measures are not directed against any third party; they are part of the Union’s larger efforts to promote its open strategic autonomy, which is understood as reducing dependencies and enhancing multilateralism and the EU’s resilience, including against the effects of extra-territorial sanctions on EU operators. Overall, the EU values close coordination on sanctions with international partners, including in the pursuit of shared objectives. Where differences exist, the EU is ready to engage through a frank and open dialogue, to avoid unintended consequences on EU operators. I look forward to listening to the debate here this evening. I want to thank you for having this on your agenda. It is a very serious issue for us, and I believe that next year we will make progress on addressing this in a wider framework.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 142, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Danuta Maria HÜBNER", "mepid": "96779", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to start by saying that the extraterritorial reach of third-country sanctions does not only affect EU businesses, but it also undermines the EU’s economic and financial autonomy, and we should indeed protect the EU’s financial infrastructure, economic operators and EU policies against extraterritorial sanctions. I also trust that wider global use of the euro will reduce the exposure to external financial institutions and regulatory actions taken by other jurisdictions. There is also evidence that the implementation of EU sanctions often proves to be incomplete and uneven across Member States. The EU can and should do more to both reduce its exposure to extraterritorial sanctions and strengthen its capability to counteract and ensure effective enforcement of the EU sanctions policy. For this, I believe the inter-institutional coordination of sanctions and countermeasures must be enhanced and we need a more systematic economic analysis of the effectiveness of sanctions.

And then it's an opportunity for us to send a clear message to our American partners as they change president, if they don't change trade policy. So, yes, let us repeat it together: it is not permissible for European companies, or even European leaders, to be prosecuted or punished on the grounds that they are legitimately and legally trading with other countries. There are examples of Iran, Cuba, but also Nord Stream - because Nord Stream is a project on European soil, whatever one thinks of the project.

Mr President, Commissioner, the EU’s exposure to US extraterritorial sanctions is indeed a major challenge.

EU businesses are seriously – and possibly even specifically – affected by these measures. The extraterritorial reach of sanctions does not only affect EU businesses but also puts into question the political independence and, ultimately, the sovereignty of the EU and its Member States. I am hopeful that a Biden administration will take a more measured and inclusive approach, instead of the confrontational and binary view of trade that has been US policy under President Trump.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European asylum policy is not working. The migration peak of 2015-2016 highlighted the major failures of the common asylum system. Five years later, we have still not been able to reform this common policy, in part because of a deadlock in the Council since 2016. In September 2019, President Ursula von der Leyen announced a new pact on asylum and migration. It is in this context that I have undertaken work to assess the implementation of Dublin III to assess the strengths and weaknesses of this regulation.  Dublin is a pillar of European asylum policy. It sets the criteria for determining the state responsible for reviewing an asylum claim. A few words about the method: this report is based on field data, feedback from asylum actors at local, national and European levels. Field missions to Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and France have been carried out. I have met many actors in the reception centres and asylum administrations of the Member States. A hearing in the LIBE committee with experts, representatives of states and NGOs, a study of the European Parliament's research department which provided a lot of information on the implementation of the various provisions. We draw an expected general conclusion: the Dublin III Regulation is ineffective and suffers from significant implementation gaps at Member State level. We make four observations. The first: Dublin places a disproportionate burden on the countries of first entry. They are under great pressure, with too little solidarity. The fire in Moria was a symbol of the absence of Europe and reforms. One third of the Member States receive 90% of asylum seekers: Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. Secondly, there are many obstacles to the determination of the responsible state: the failures in the registration on Eurodac, the biased application of the hierarchy of criteria, the weight of the procedures and their complexity for the applicants, but also for the actors of the asylum. As a result, procedures generate considerable human, financial and material costs. Yet only 11% of transfers are made. This is unacceptable for the thousands of public officials, for procedures that do not succeed. This is unacceptable especially for asylum seekers who are welcomed for far too long - months, years - before a decision is made.  Third, the migrant journey is an underestimated determinant. In particular, secondary movements are an enemy of the principle of a single asylum application in Europe. This phenomenon is on the rise. It stops the \"Dublin\" machine by drastically increasing the number of procedures. Fourth, Dublin's failure is above all a human failure. Dublin's inefficiency is weighing on migrants, who have already suffered trauma. The best interests of the child are poorly applied. The same is true of family reunification. Access to the law does not meet European standards. In the medium term, we need a reform of these rules. The common system must of course be changed, with solidarity, with the clarification of procedures.  But above all, we must act now. Let us not wait for a reform that will not take place for one or two years, perhaps longer. Let's improve the application of the rules today. There is a strong margin of progress on the part of states to ensure more attention to human, material and financial resources for asylum policy. There is a need for more dialogue between the asylum authorities of the Member States. There is a need to step up governance between states and with the European Union.  We will not all solve it by changing the rules. Some are flawed, others are poorly applied. We are no longer in a crisis situation. A more humane and effective European asylum policy is possible in the short term. We are also counting on the Commission to act now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 155, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Nicolas SCHMIT", "mepid": "197428", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Keller and the shadow rapporteurs for this constructive report, which constitutes an important contribution to the debate on migration. We share the same assessment of the current important shortcomings in the implementation of the Dublin III Regulation. This is an area where the Commission has proposed a fresh start, with a new pact on migration and asylum. I believe that the pack, notably the proposals for an asylum and migration management regulation, and for a new crisis and force majeure regulation, will allow to address many of the challenges identified in your report. Indeed, the pact rebalances solidarity and a fair sharing of responsibility between the Member States. The pact is based on the concept of compulsory solidarity, a solidarity that would be tailored to the needs of the Member States faced with a migratory pressure or risk of such pressure, as well as following search and rescue operations. A solidarity that would be effective in all times, including in times of crisis. With our proposals there is no flexibility on the principle that all Member States must contribute, only on how Member States can contribute. The main forms of solidarity contributions are relocation and return sponsorship, and there is also the possibility to contribute through capacity measures. A correction mechanism will ensure that there will be always a credible level of solidarity in the form of relocation or return sponsorship. But solidarity goes hand-in-hand with responsibility, and the new pact proposes new effective responsibility rules. As suggested in your report, our legislative proposals include targeted changes to make the system more efficient and to determine the Member State responsible to deal with an asylum application. This will discourage abuses and prevent unauthorised movements. While the responsibility criterion linked to first entry remains, these new rules would allow to make the other criteria more effective. For example, we propose to widen the definition of family members to include siblings and families formed in transit and to simplify the rules on evidence relating to family reunification. In line with your report, we also propose to prolong the periods of responsibility for Member States. For instance, a Member State would become responsible if an applicant makes an application within three years following the irregular entry, which is an extension from the current 12 months. Similarly, a Member State would be responsible to deal with an asylum application if the applicant holds a visa or residence permit that expired less than three years before instead of, respectively, six months and two years currently. Finally, it is important to stress that the first entry criterion goes hand—in—hand with a new approach on compulsory solidarity which will ensure that responsibilities are fairly shared amongst Member States. In addition, the pact presents several initiatives to make our return policy more credible and sustainable, as suggested in your report, such as the implementation of the Frontex mandate on returns, the system of return sponsorship, the forthcoming strategy on voluntary returns and reintegration, and the creation of a European returns coordinator. Mr President, Ms Keller, to reform our asylum and migration policy, we need to be pragmatic and find common ground to move forward, striking precisely a delicate balance between solidarity and responsibility. Keeping the middle ground and balance among all the elements of the pact is the best way forward. I would like to thank you again for the implementation of the report. We look forward to engaging with the European Parliament on the different legislative proposals presented together with a pact to reach an overall agreement on the comprehensive and sustainable reform of the European migration and asylum policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 156, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  This item on the agenda is closed.

Our common position is that we need a solid basis of facts and findings in order to draw conclusions on how Member States apply the directive and if this application meets the objectives of the directive.  The more salient a policy area is, the more we need an evidence-based policy. We therefore deplore the lack of a recent evaluation, which the Commission is obliged to undertake every three years, but its last report dates back to 2014. As we have to judge and negotiate on a recast proposal with fundamental amendments on the current Returns Directive, this omission is not responsible. This has led the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to decide to undertake a study ourselves on the implementation of the Return Directive, and that study has led to this report.  The objective of the Return Directive is twofold. On the one hand, it promotes the return of migrants who are not entitled to stay on our territory and, on the other hand, it ensures that this return goes hand in hand with legal safeguards in line with fundamental rights, and that enforcement measures are applied in a proportionate manner. This also means that implementation cannot be properly assessed by only looking at the return rates. We also need to see if the return is sustainable and if the legal safeguards have been complied with. I will just go through some highlights of the report. One is that voluntary returns should be prioritised over forced returns as they are more sustainable, less costly and less cumbersome for the states, and more apt to respect the fundamental rights of the person concerned. This requires that we have sufficient voluntary departure terms, but also sufficient assistance and return programmes. We found a big lack of this in many Member States. The directive requires that decisions concerning return are based on an individual assessment and are open to appeal. Legal safeguards imply that the return may never lead to refoulement and that the return is automatically suspended as long as an appeal is still under the examination of a judge. In many Member States, however, this is still not the case. Detention must remain a measure of last resort, meaning that it has to be necessary, proportionate and for the shortest time possible.  Longer detention does not automatically increase the chance of return. It is generally more costly than alternatives to detention. The report therefore calls on Member States, as a matter of urgency, to offer effective community—based alternatives to detention. Many Member States do have alternatives in their legislation, but they have often made it unavailable in practice. According to our Charter of Fundamental Rights, the best interests of the child should always be a primary consideration. A significant number of children, however, are still detained in the European Union as part of return procedures. This implementation report expresses agreement with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which has clarified that children should never be detained for immigration purposes and that detention can never be justified in a child’s best interest. As the report highlights several gaps in the implementation of the Return Directive, we call on the Member States to make sure that they do comply, and we call on the Commission to ensure timely and proper monitoring and support for its implementation, and to enforce compliance if necessary.

I first would like to thank you, Ms Strik, as well as the shadow rapporteurs for this implementation report on the Return Directive. I’m glad that the pact on migration and asylum presented by the Commission last September addresses many of the challenges identified in your reports. The pact takes a human approach, which builds on the principles of integrated policy-making, solidarity and the fair sharing of responsibility. It offers tools to cover all aspects of return, from the moment of first arrival in the EU and issuance of an obligation to return until the readmission and reintegration in the country of origin. The pact reinforces our legal framework, closing the loopholes between asylum and return procedures that are currently affecting the efficiency of our systems. The Return Directive will continue to be the cornerstone of our common EU framework. We are pleased that the work on that dossier has resumed. In this context, and in reply to your report, I would therefore like to make the following remarks: First, we agree that there is a strong need to improve relations with third countries in order to ensure cooperation for effective and sustainable returns. That is why strengthening our cooperation with third countries on all aspects of migration, in a spirit of trust and mutually beneficial partnership, is a priority of the pact. In the context of these partnerships, we need, firstly, to increase the effectiveness of the implementation of readmission cooperation and to develop new ones for a selected number of third countries. Effective cooperation on readmission and migration is developed through active engagement in a sustained dialogue with our partners, as well as mobilising the policies and tools at our disposal for incentivising and rewarding cooperation. Second, we agree on the primacy of voluntary returns. This is why we are working on a new strategy on voluntary return and reintegration that we will present next year. Reintegration is an important part of the EU’s support to third countries. We need to reinforce the consistency of national approaches with third countries, but also increase the ownership of the process by our partners. This strategy will also reinforce the effectiveness, attractiveness and accessibility of the voluntary return programmes set up in the Member States, and from third countries to countries of origin. Third, let me assure you that the pact fully respects the fundamental right to an effective remedy of the migrants subject to a return decision. To this end, the recast Return Directive and the amendments to the proposed asylum procedures regulation further harmonise the right to appeal in order to address the differences between Member States. We understand your concerns concerning the possible negative effects that indiscriminate and long entry bans can have on the willingness of irregular migrants to cooperate on return and depart voluntarily. Our intention remains to deter irregular reimmigration of those who did not respect EU rules while preserving the possibility of legal access to the EU. We agree that there is a significant discrepancy in the way in which Member States determine the risk that the migrant may flee while return procedures are ongoing. That is why we proposed a common list of criteria in the recast Return Directive to assess the risk of absconding, which is the main ground to place a person subject to a return decision in administrative detention.  Finally, let me stress that we attach great importance to the use of effective alternatives to detention. We agree that it remains an underexplored area that can bring positive results for both the migrants and the authorities concerned. In our view, the report confirms that there are matters of common interest on which we can work together.  I would like to thank you again for your report and we trust that, with this important report having been tabled, we can now advance in earnest to reach an agreement that would improve the return of irregular migrants.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 160, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  This item on the agenda is closed.

Mr President, it is precisely when things are difficult that we must focus on the future. We must make social progress possible for everyone. With higher minimum wages, so that no one has to make a choice between hot water or hot food at the end of the month. With a ban on zero-hours contracts so you can also make plans and be sure of your income. And with more affordable social rented housing, so that first-time buyers can really start their future. These are the challenges for the Netherlands and for Europe. Together, we first go through the crisis together, and we don't forget anyone: that should be the task. And we're going to deliver on this! With the report we are launching a more social Europe in the coming year. We are also laying the groundwork for the social action plan to be presented by Commissioner Schmit in January. It is important that we learn the lessons of the Lisbon Strategy and the previous crisis. Social progress was then thrown overboard and we cannot afford to do it again. We need the social goals that we need to achieve by 2030 at the latest, i.e. a new social agenda for Europe. At the Social Summit in Porto, all the Heads of Government and the European Commission must sign up for this, including our own Prime Minister Rutte! Together with my German Christian Democratic colleague Dennis Radtke and the shadow rapporteurs from left to right, we have come to an ambitious and balanced report. In EMPL it could count on broad support. If we want to make the sustainable and digital transition possible in a fair way, they must be accompanied by social progress. \"No one should be left behind\" should not just remain a hollow slogan, which is why we need to invest more in people. The recovery and resilience plan must have a strong social dimension with so many social progress plans that are on the same footing as the economic and sustainable goals. We must commit to good work if we want to reduce youth unemployment structurally. Young people are not waiting for the thousandth uncertain flex job, who want to be able to build their future. There are too many handy Harry's active in the temporary employment sector who make their money with sham constructions on the backs of workers and society. We need a level playing field between the employment agencies. And we need to protect the temps properly. This endless chain of subcontracting, in which everyone is shifting their responsibility, must end: these chains must be cut up. After all, we have all seen how in the last year migrant workers have become massively ill in, for example, the meat industry, the distribution centres and in agriculture and horticulture. I'd say enough is enough!

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to my co-rapporteur, Agnes Jongerius, and also to the shadow rapporteurs for extremely constructive and also trusting and consensus-oriented cooperation.  The result we received last month in the Committee on Social Affairs for our report is, I believe, a fruit of this constructive and consensus-oriented cooperation, because we have obtained a broad majority in favour of our report. A majority, of which I say, encourages the vote we have this week on this very difficult and ambitious report. This report is intended to build a bridge to what we have on the social agenda next year, as Agnes has pointed out. On the one hand, there will be Nicolas Schmit's action plan for the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, and we will have the Social Summit in Porto, as a follow-up to the Social Summit in Gothenburg. These are two very important events.  That is also the essence of this report, because Agnes Jongerius and I have said from the outset that we as a Parliament must send out a strong signal on this. We cannot just wait for the Commission to propose something, but we as a Parliament want to articulate and write down our own demands, and I think there are courageous things involved: that we stand up and say that we want a postage strategy – almost analogous to a Lisbon strategy – by saying: clear, measurable, ambitious objectives also in social policy. Let me be quite clear: if we set ourselves these objectives, it does not translate to the fact that in future we will demand central competences for the European Union in each of these policy areas. But we do not have that in other places, and yet we are setting ourselves ambitious targets. And if some of my colleagues have told me in recent days: Dennis, how can you, for example, set a target of a 50% reduction in youth unemployment by 2030, for which we have no competence, then I can only say that if we in this House confine ourselves to what is our core competence, then we can leave a great deal to be.  Just one question, such as the fight against youth unemployment, is that for me an engine, that is fuel in my political work, because I have no interest in a lost generation, because I do not want to accuse young Europeans of eating populists because of their lack of prospects. That is why we are standing here, that is why we are making policy, and that is why we have written these things into the report, among other things.  One final point: we have also dared to take a look at the issue of the minimum wage. The proposal is now on the table. We will soon be starting work on this, and we have committed ourselves to this issue. Here, too, it must be said that there is no centralised one-off wage proposal on the table, but a proposal that really touches on the heart of the treaty, namely the question of the social market economy, the question of collective bargaining.  We have gathered here in this Chamber to clap for the heroes of everyday life in the Corona crisis. Like silly. I did not take part in this because my drive is not to clap for people here in the Chamber, but to make everyday work better for people, to contribute to the organisation of participation, for people to be able to live off their work, for us to have fair and fair wages. I believe that the report that we have now launched here, which we are putting to the vote here, can be an important contribution to making Europe more social and for the debates on a more social Europe to arrive in the middle of European policy in the future.

The current times are calling for bold and strong social Europe and I’m very grateful that Parliament has taken the initiative to prepare a very comprehensive, ambitious and concrete resolution.  We are facing a crisis of unprecedented scale with massive social consequences. We could preserve jobs and income with our support for a short-time work-schemes culture, yet six million jobs have been lost and we are losing human capital and this impairs our potential for growth in the medium-term. Certain groups are hit disproportionately: women and young people, but also self—employed people. Many never thought they would one day fall into poverty. Now they are queuing up for food aid. Inequalities are deepening further. Low-skilled and low-paid workers, but also temporary workers, were the first ones laid off. We have millions of children and young people whose life prospects have worsened. Against this background, strong and coordinated action at European and national level is needed. The Commission has committed to presenting an action plan to implement the European pillar of social rights and its political guidelines, and we will do so early next year. Eleven months ago we launched a wide consultation reaching a great number of stakeholders across Europe and which delivered thousands of contributions. This shows how the pillar contains key political goals that citizens want to see implemented. With the current crisis, implementation of the social pillar is even more needed. If anything, the pandemic has shown the importance of resilient health and social protection systems. The European pillar of social rights is a key tool to accompany our recovery efforts in the short and medium-term. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated existing trends. This is why we need to take decisive action to tackle the socioeconomic consequences of this crisis, as well as to face long—term challenges.  We need to support people and our workforce through the green and digital transitions. We are simply not sufficiently equipped today for tomorrow’s labour market, economy and society. Employment is key. We have to support job creation, taking full advantage of the ongoing transitions and the renewed industrial strategy, ease job transitions based on skilling, re- and up—skilling, and enhance actively labour market policies and help young people enter the labour market. We have to create more convergence between and within Member States. Europe must be the same promise of equal opportunities and social progress for everyone. This means reassessing the value of work, a concept President von der Leyen mentioned in her first speech to this Parliament, and ensuring decent working and living conditions.  We have to adapt our social welfare states to the digital age. We have to find the right balance between an innovative economy, led by technological process, the key of our European social model, and modern, inclusive and sustainable social protection systems, and we have to invest in our social resilience. This virus painfully underlines the vulnerability of many sectors, like education and healthcare. Therefore our action plan should define shared objectives at EU level and put forward concrete actions delivering the priorities of the social pillar, ensuring equal opportunities and access to the labour market for all, supporting for working conditions and strengthening social protection and inclusion.  We are giving full consideration to your call, as to that of other stakeholders, for setting strategic, social and employment targets. We share a common understanding that the implementation of the social pillar and the resilience and recovery plans should complement each other. We have to build a future in a sustainable way, in an innovative way, but also in a fair and inclusive way. This is fundamental if we want to put people at the centre.  We are also looking at how to improve our monitoring of the implementation of the social pillar, including the social scoreboard, and how countries coordinate implementation of the pillar at national level. The Commission’s action plan must pave the way at European level, but we will only reach our common destination if Member States, regions and local authorities turn commitment into action. We will only get there if social partners and civil society organisations do their part, and Europe must be there to support them.  Finally, the adoption of the social pillar action plan will be a very important step in view of the social summit which will take place in Porto in May 2021. The Commission’s social agenda has only gained in importance. We have already come forward with ambitious proposals on youth employment, on skills, on fair minimum wages, and you can count on us to continue to deliver on our child guarantee, on platform workers, on the social economy. Your strategic resolution will be crucial to feed into the preparations of our action plan. This action plan will not land in a vacuum. It must give direction to our recovery strategy and it must be plugged into the Commission’s overarching 2030 growth strategy for a green and digital transformation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2020-12-14.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  This item on the agenda is closed.

Mr President, Commissioner, what better transition could we have to talk about sustainable governance and non-financial reporting than the report that has just been mentioned and your intervention and that of my colleagues on a more social Europe and social integration?  Because, in these issues that may appear technical, we are at the heart of what is eminently political - political in the noble sense of the word: because it touches on our vision, the vision we want to build for our European Union. The vision of whether we want to have our standards imposed on us externally, by the United States, by China or by whatever other power, or whether we want to remain masters in a logic of independence and sovereignty. Remaining masters of our economic, environmental and social model is the whole point of this extra-financial reporting, of this new corporate governance.  What is our ambition? What is our desire to actually build a world that is more sustainable, more sustainable, more livable for the entire population? Without going into detail, obviously too technical, we have to face the situation as it stands.  We are at a time when companies - for reasons that are not for us to develop here, but which are a reality - are faced with very short-term challenges. They find themselves in a logic of need to develop short-term profits, to try to compensate for the financialization of our society. They are forced to go ahead of a logic that is a logic that destroys a medium- and long-term vision of the company. We need to rebalance: that is what our standards are all about. It is not to harm the corporate world, on the contrary. It is to try to create real value and value that persists over time, a value that does not mean that dividends are, within 20 years, developed by 1 to 4%, while research and investment are falling almost equally. We have to think about this future and build it together. So we have objectives, the objectives that the Union has set itself, with taxonomy, with these environmental standards, these social standards which make it a model and an island on the whole planet. This balance between the environment, the social, the human and the economic, which we have always carried and which we must continue to defend, we must now integrate into the 21st century. So yes, we have goals. Mrs von der Leyen and this Parliament recalled the objectives of the Green Deal. Well, to get to make this green pact, we need everyone. We need investment, we need companies, we need employees, we need stakeholders. That's what we all have to achieve together. And for that, non-financial reporting must be clear. We have to have one standard, we have 1,500 to date, because those standards are not set in a legal framework. So I repeat, and I will finish on it, because it is really the heart: what do we want to build together? If we want a market, if we want to ensure that arbitrariness does not dominate and that it is not just the law of the strongest, then we must set standards that are extremely clear. We must have clear relationships, we must have independent audits, we must have governance that respects both employees, gender equality, the long term, which takes into account all the human, environmental and, I repeat, social conditions that arise in the 21st century.

The Commission shares the objective of fostering long-term corporate behaviour towards the sustainability transition. As announced in its 2021 work programme, the Commission intends to propose next year the revision of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and a legislative initiative on sustainable corporate governance.  To prepare this initiative, the Commission has commissioned studies which show that there is a trend in the last 30 years for listed companies within the EU to focus mainly on short-term benefits of shareholders rather than on the long-term interests of the company. This affects long-term resilience, sustainability and performance. Designing time horizons of corporate decision-making that are more long-term and promoting corporate governance that is more conducive to sustainability would contribute to companies’ resilience and performance. We welcome the fact that the report by Mr Durand targets exactly these matters.  The report calls on the Commission to ensure that directors’ duties should not focus mainly on the short-term maximisation of shareholder value. These duties must pay sufficient attention to the long-term interests of the company and wider society, as well as those of employees and other relevant stakeholders. Companies that integrate stakeholder interests outperform others in the current crisis. As shown by a wide number of studies, such companies have better performance in the long run.  The report by Mr Durand considers that company directors have a duty to address sustainability risks and impacts arising from their operations and supply chains. It also asks that sustainability strategies should include time-bound and science-based targets aligned with the EU’s international commitments. This includes in particular the Paris Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity and on deforestation.  The Commission will examine the possible impact of such rules as part of the impact assessment of the forthcoming legislative initiative on sustainable corporate governance. Furthermore, just as the report rightly pays attention to small and medium-sized enterprises, the Commission will also duly consider ways to cater for SMEs. We are looking into possible regulatory requirements which take into account the size of the company, as well as whether it is involved in a sector with a high sustainability risk. SMEs could also be supported with adequate tools and funding.  With regard to Parliament’s suggestions on the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, the Commission included the revision of these rules as part of its work programme for next year. We agree to the aim to be consistent with other relevant EU legislation, including the Taxonomy Regulation and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. We also agree that it will be necessary to bring additional categories of companies under the scope of the legislation, and that reported sustainability information should be subject to audits.  We believe it will be necessary to require companies to use mandatory European sustainability-reporting standards. That is why the Commission has given a mandate to the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group to carry out preparatory work for the development of such standards. Next to working on European standards, we will also try to ensure progress towards greater alignment of standards at the global level.  The Commission also looks forward to the European Parliament’s upcoming report by Ms Wolters on corporate due diligence and accountability. Resilient and sustainable supply chains are key for European companies’ long-term competitiveness and viability. Due diligence is also essential to mitigate the adverse impacts of European production in third countries, where the biggest bulk of adverse impacts materialise.  Let me conclude by reiterating that the Commission’s priorities are clear: we need to deliver on the sustainability transition and the recovery, which is a very good opportunity for that. It is therefore key to help businesses in the way they operate, towards a transformation to a more sustainable economy. Allow me just to quote Mark Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of England and now the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance.

That is why I think it is important to help businesses make the transition to a sustainable economy. It's time to create a new business culture. By promoting it, we will support the process that should lead businesses along the path of sustainable corporate governance. It brings additional value to society, but also to the companies themselves, as the companies that have taken the path of sustainable corporate governance are more productive and more solid. At the height of the COVID pandemic and the crisis that increased risks to business, our efforts to protect European businesses are of great importance, and of course this does not come at the expense of workers' and shareholders' rights. Pan-European action is needed in this regard. However, they should under no circumstances lead to the imposition of burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises. In case of changes in company law, we must apply a balanced approach taking into account both economic and social and environmental factors. This will stimulate the integration of sustainability policies into corporate decision-making.
