As you know, the new national security law came into force in Hong Kong last week.

One important subject that the report highlights is the link between human rights and the environment. I took part in December in the 21st EU-NGO Human Rights Forum, and I was struck by the testimonies of human rights defenders from across the world. In 2018, 77% of human rights defenders killed worldwide were working on environmental issues. These are very sensitive issues and economically very important. The protection of the rights of indigenous peoples against, among others, land-grabbing is of central concern. We must strengthen our efforts in this regard. The report equally highlights the link between the digital transformation of our societies and human rights and democracy. New technologies bring opportunities to promote human rights and democracy but also generate uncertainty and challenges. I therefore welcome the pioneering debate of the European Parliament on the need to regulate ethical aspects of artificial intelligence. This year will mark the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration on gender equality. Unfortunately, according to UN statistics on women, a third of women around the world continue to suffer from some kind of violence in their lives. Despite the fact that we rely so heavily on women to make up the much-needed workforce of carers, teachers and nurses, women are generally experiencing the biggest socio-economic consequences of the pandemic. There is also some good news and progress in human rights policy and democracy. For example, let’s highlight the decision by Chad to abolish the death penalty; the decision by Sierra Leone to overturn the ban on pregnant girls attending school; Sri Lanka brought child labour down to 1%, through the pioneering ‘Child Labour Free Zones’, concretely, more than 60 000 fewer children in child labour compared to 10 years ago. Slowly but firmly, we are advancing in this field. Some societies in Tunisia, Sri Lanka and Gambia made democratic improvements and, unhappily, autocracy has expanded in 2019. Resistance against dictators has also been growing. I would like to say more things about this report, but I have to turn – according to the agenda – to the second item that you have titled: ‘Stability and security in the Mediterranean and the negative role of Turkey’. That is how you titled the second point in the agenda. I have just returned from intensive discussions in Turkey and Malta. In the previous week, I visited Greece and Cyprus to demonstrate the European Union’s solidarity. It is clear that the stability and security in the Mediterranean requires our collective engagement. Years of conflict in Libya and in Syria have been impacting this region, directly affecting our interests and security in terms of uncontrolled migration, terrorism or political instability from the Sahel to the broader Middle East. Turkey is also affected by this situation and is active in conflicts both in Syria and in Libya. In fact it is one of the most important actors in both conflicts. We have had important discrepancies regarding Turkey’s action in north-west and north-east Syria. Last October, the Council firmly condemned Turkey’s military operation in north-east Syria, yet we must also acknowledge where our interests coincide. Turkey has been showing solidarity and generosity towards more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees and has supplied cross-border humanitarian assistance to those displaced by the recent brutal fighting in Idlib. By the way, I have to regret strongly the decision of the Security Council not to continue opening the border between Turkey and Idlib in order to bring humanitarian assistance. In Libya, we need to work better together to launch a real political process. I remembered it also yesterday in my intervention in front of the Security Council of the UN, stressing the importance of the Berlin Process and our commitment to implement the UN arms embargo through our means (inaudible). With Operation IRINI we will continue to monitor closely suspect trafficking, regardless of provenance or destination. In the Eastern Mediterranean, Turkey has been showing a worrying assertiveness, with an increased number of flights over Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, drilling operations in the Cypriot Exclusive Economic Zone and signature of the Maritime Memorandum of Understanding with Libya, which we do not recognise here in the European Union. On these issues, we have been sending clear messages to Turkey. We are determined to protect the principles, values, borders and sovereign rights of the Member States, and we will also continue working for a political solution in Syria and Libya. Turkey is an important partner, a candidate country and a NATO ally. The current negative trend in our relations – as I told our Turkish colleagues, the Foreign Affairs Minister and the Defence Minister a couple of days ago in Ankara – needs to be stopped and reversed. The dynamics of retaliation do not make the Mediterranean a more secure and stable zone. This will only be achieved through dialogue and negotiations where discrepancies exist, and they do. This is what I have been discussing with Turkish colleagues on my last trip, stressing that we have many common interests on which to build. On Monday, with the Foreign Affairs Ministers, we will examine a possible way forward. The third and last issue is Belarus. Let me start right out with the latest developments. I reassure you that we pay very close attention to the situation on the ground in the context of the 9 August presidential elections. We are concerned about the restrictions on freedom of assembly and speech, including the reported detention of peaceful protesters, bloggers and journalists. The harassment and persecution of the leading opposition candidates has to stop. Fundamental freedoms have to be respected, and each candidate and voter must be able to exercise their civil and political rights. We expect to be invited by Belarus as soon as possible to observe the upcoming presidential elections. We have reacted to recent developments, calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all arbitrarily-detained persons. We will follow closely these elections in order to reinforce the sovereignty, independence and freedom of Belarus, which is the only way to pave the future of prosperity for its citizens. Belarus has demonstrated an active participation in the Eastern Partnership. We have achieved tangible benefits for the Belarusian citizens, in particular the Visa Facilitation Agreement, which entered into force on 1 July. The EU is Belarus’s second-largest trade partner, and close economic cooperation is of mutual interest. Due to our geographic proximity, our ongoing dialogue, among others, on how to improve standards on environment and climate change is essential for all Europeans. In the absence of a legally-binding framework agreement, the conclusions of the EU-Belarus Partnership Priorities remains an important objective, and I believe that having an agreed set of political priorities, including on human rights and nuclear safety, would provide us with more transparency and accountability in our relations. We should remain open to further development of our relations with Belarus and continue supporting Belarus’s sovereignty and independence. However, this development can only be based on positive steps in the area of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. This brings me back to my initial words. The 9 August presidential elections will be very important in charting our way forward and in defining our relations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2020-07-09.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, High Representative Borrell, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Borrell, for the work he has all asked. I would like to refer to Turkey in today's debate. We have a lot in common with Turkey. We have common economic interests, we have a common history, Turkey's NATO membership, the solidarity there, many Turkish people live in Europe and also many Europeans in Turkey – and, of course, Turkey's commitment to the refugee issue. We have to keep that in mind, there is a lot of partnership.  But something is changing – obviously – and that is why the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested today's debate, because we are concerned, for example, the permanent attacks by the Turkish military against the Greek border, the illegal drilling, the activities now in Libya, where there have itself been conflicts with French warships, and, of course, also internally: freedom of the media, civil society, and on top of the abuse of migrants on the external border. Turkey is moving massively away from the values, from the ideas of the European Union, and that is why I would like to start by saying 'thank you' to Nikos Anastasiadis and Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who share responsibility for us Europeans on the external border, on the Turkish border. This became clear in February, particularly in the attacks carried out by the illegal immigration, and the message is: 'We will not be blackmailed by Erdogan'. That is the message behind it.  We must make it clear that the problems in the region are not Greek-Turkish, not Cypriot-Turkish problems, but EU-Turkish problems. We must not leave the two states there alone. The message we have for President Erdogan is that the European Union is ready for partnership, also ready to come back to the partnership, but we need a partner to participate. The European Union is not naive. We also have our ability to respond, and the customs union, which is of vital economic importance to Turkey, is one of those tools. I would also like to see honesty in relations. The accession talks we are having with Turkey have been a mistake. There has been too much disappointment on the Turkish side, and there is no willingness in Europe to take in Turkey in many areas. That is why we should end this chapter and open a new chapter in partnership. The accession talks should be brought to an end and we must enter into a new partnership with Turkey.

There are positive aspects, you mentioned them, but there are huge negative elements to this report. I would also like to point out that, in a positive way, climate change and biodiversity loss are recognised as a very important threat to human rights, and I think it paved a good way for us. But I would like to point out that 2019 stands out as a very bad year, because it has been a very good year for populism; a populism that advances, deteriorates democracies, makes them more fragile and therefore deteriorates human rights and freedoms. Increasingly, we are seeing the weakening of our democracies from within, using democratic institutions to generate autocratic regimes. And they do, we see it, we are seeing it, attacking the judiciary, attacking the press, fundamental freedom of the press. That is why, Mr High Representative, the Democrats cannot in any way allow insult, harassment, persecution of the press to be naturalized. We can only fight it firmly. That is why, in order for Europe to really be an assertive Europe, effective, consistent with human rights, we must work now more than ever for multilateralism, and that means defending international legality, because defending it defends the rights of all. We also have, high representative, to enable and accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, especially its objective 16.

My concern, however, is that these achievements are taking place in a political vacuum and often have little more than a fig leaf function. The greatest humanitarian catastrophe in the world today is taking place in Yemen: women and children are being targeted by militias. Since the total dissolution of social structures, there have been poor hygiene conditions, under which horrible diseases are rampant.  Meanwhile, the leaders of the various warring parties outside Yemen are resonating in security from the chaos they have wreaked. And yet we read so little on this subject. We have outsourced the problem to the UN, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It is not even mentioned in this Parliament or in the relevant committees. We have a whole section on religious freedom, but nothing specific about the appalling persecution of Christians in West Africa, the persecution of entire communities on the basis of their Christian faith. In the report, I noticed a section on strengthening the economic participation of Afghan women – in itself, of course, a good and highly laudable purpose. My problem with this, however, is that, while this support for Afghan women is necessary, we have done nothing about the political situation in which these women have to assert themselves. We do not say a word about the corrupt electoral process, the extrajudicial executions or the fact that large parts of society are being marginalised by the new government.

And now I’m standing here again: nothing happened. Even worse, when I asked the Commission about it this March, I received the following answer: the Commission is, and I quote, ‘not aware of systemic problems faced by human rights defenders fulfilling the necessary entry conditions in being granted short-stay visas’. Seriously? Özgür Gür was supposed to speak at a round table at Parliament on 15 October last year. He’s a 25-year-old LGBTI activist. He applied for a Schengen visa with the Belgian embassy. The MEP hosting the event even called the embassy. Still he didn’t receive a visa. Tomorrow, Özgür Gür is facing trial in Turkey for organising a non-violent protest for LGBTI rights. There are so many more people like Özgür Gür, because to get a visa, you should be married, have a proper job, a regular income, you should not have been in prison or in conflict with state authorities. Well, human rights defenders living in oppressive countries can rarely fulfil these criteria, precisely because of the work they do, because of the work we ask them to do and we encourage them to do. And then the Commission speaks of no systemic problems? Mr Borrell, you know this as much as I do. Human rights defenders are our partners. Without them, we can do nothing when it comes to promoting human rights globally, and their space is shrinking. And now our own visa policies are shrinking their space even more.

The Commission's initial intention not to extend the mandate of the EU Envoy for Religious Freedom, against the background of all these reports, raised a great deal of questions. I am therefore very pleased that the Commission has come back to this and is now having the EU envoy for religious freedom return. Unfortunately, such an envoy appears to be very much needed. In addition, it is very important that we provide this post with sufficient staff and budget. More than during the previous mandate, when the unit dealing with religious freedom was very, very small. I hope that the Commission will be reassured on this point as well.  Freedom of faith is not high enough on the European agenda. There is a lot of work to be done in this respect. The European Commission must exert pressure in concluding or renewing trade agreements with countries where there is too little freedom of faith. Trade is good, but faith is better and more important.

At all these meetings, it says in the annual report, the EU highlighted its policies on inclusive education, celebration of linguistic diversity and the rights of minorities.

The UN also considered it a right of minorities to learn in their mother tongue. As minority schools are being closed across Europe, was this issue brought up?

The exemption is frozen, with a brutal deterioration in human rights, in visa liberalization.

Yes, Turkey is a strategic partner, both for Europe and NATO. It’s a neighbour and I do believe in the necessity of a strong partnership, but Turkey continues to move further away from the EU.

European civilization has, as we know, an enemy at its doorstep. It is no longer skirmishes that Caliph Erdogan addresses us, but military aggressions. What is Erdogan's regime? It is a double bet: that of the union of all Muslims under the banner of political Islamism and the pre-eminence of Turkey in the Mediterranean. The Austrians, Hungarians, Serbs, Greeks, Cypriots, English, French and Russians and so many other European nations have constantly faced this dual project since the fall of Constantinople.

Worse, we are trying to speed up the accession process. In Libya, we reproduce the same mistakes that we made in Syria, looking kindly at these militias paid for by the Turks.

The title of this security debate gives the impression that we are dealing with one evil factor in the Mediterranean that is responsible for all security threats. Such a simple narrative is attractive but not very helpful, as it leads us nowhere. The situation near our borders is highly complex, and most worrying is the lack of influence that we have, both in Syria and in Libya, and this really should be reversed. But we will only gain more influence with a more regional and comprehensive approach. The people in Libya are overrun by many states who are competing for their own interests and influence, and the citizens of Libya really need our strong support for the establishment of a state where democracy, the rule of law and accountability prevail. Security threats will remain as long as Libya is a failed state. Turkey is one state interfering for its own interests over there, but so are Russia, France and Italy, and others. Compliance with the Berlin Process is of utmost importance, and it’s disappointing that even EU Member States don’t always respect the agreement. So I ask the High Representative which possibilities he sees for increasing the effectiveness and expanding the scope of Operation IRINI, despite the blockage by Russia in the Security Council. Apart from that, we should invest more in regional stability, and this starts with the region closest to us: Cyprus. We need to find a solution for the conflict that we have neglected for so long. But also in North Africa, involving Libya’s neighbouring countries would really contribute to a more sustainable solution. I agree with Mr Borrell that, despite Turkey’s bad track record, we share common interests, and the neighbouring countries are key to us. We cannot simply remain in a deadlock and act as if we do not need to cooperate or narrow it down to cooperation on the EU—Turkey Statement.

Colleagues, I have to ask, with friends like these who needs enemies? The past few months have shown that Turkey under Erdoğan cannot be a close and trusted ally of Europe. This is the behaviour of an autocrat and we cannot continue to entertain autocrats on Tuesday and then on Wednesday claim we are a continent based on democratic values. The time has come to admit that the current framework for our talks with Turkey, the membership framework, is completely out of touch with reality. It’s time for a fundamental strategic rethink of EU—Turkey relations. We can have a relationship that is built on trade, but we should not be naive to the fact that both our values and interests are not converging, they are diverging.

However, the regime failed to adequately assess the mood of the Belarusian people. Public dissatisfaction with government policies has exceeded people’s patience, and the appearance of new presidential hopefuls has ignited hope of change. The Belarusian regime is stuck in the past. In order to preserve power, it continues along the path of repression, intimidation, prosecution and mass arrests. Peaceful protesters and passers-by are beaten and kidnapped by the KGB, and also bullied and threatened by the state media. The main opposition contenders, Viktar Babaryka and Syarhei Tsikhanouski, remain imprisoned. The Belarusian regime has gone back to the time of prisoners of conscience. Three years after his release, former prisoner of conscience, Nikolai Statkevich, is back in jail. Another opposition leader, Pavel Sevyarynets, just had his sentence extended.

I think putting together three debates on such important issues disfigures the debate a little bit, because one takes attention away from the other. Only the report on human rights and democracy in the world would require a monographic debate, because the importance of this report is enormous, although of course it is no philosopher's stone that solves problems with its simple reading. But this report is more important than ever, and it is also important that we are aware that, apart from explaining what is happening— and many have said it — we must act on it. And that is why we have adopted a new action plan that will cover the period of the next four years, to try to make our activity not only rapporteur, explaining what happens, but of corrective, trying to influence events. We have a special envoy for human rights, who will play a very important role in the implementation of this plan. I understand all the limitations you have and I regret that some of you have diverted the debate on the objective of the report to what is happening within the European Union, which was not the subject of this report or this debate. Some concrete references have been made, for example, to our participation in the generation of a legally binding United Nations instrument in defence of human rights. Unfortunately, we do not have a mandate from the Council to participate in the development of this instrument. We consider it absolutely necessary and participate in consultations in an informal manner, such as the one that took place recently in May in Ecuador, and we will attend next in October. We continue to defend the need for this instrument, but unfortunately we do not have a mandate from the Council to participate in these negotiations. We have decided to renew the mandate of the special envoy to defend religious freedom, who will work in close contact with our special envoy for human rights, Mr Gilmore, and this is undoubtedly one of our priorities for the defence of human rights: religious freedom, which is threatened in many parts of the world and which in some cases affects European citizens and, in any case, affects many who profess the Christian religion. On the facilitation of visas to human rights defenders, which has been raised as an absolutely relevant issue, all I can tell you is that visas are not given by the European Union, given by the Member States; that our delegations in the territory are directly involved trying to get them granted. Yes, yes, visas are not given by the European Union, visas are given by the Member States, if they want to give them. And what we are doing from our delegations is to permanently contact the embassies of the Member States with human rights defenders who are at risk, to facilitate the provision of visas by Member States. I will investigate the response you tell me you have received from the Commission to see on what terms it has been expressed and to what extent it is consistent with our willingness to support human rights defenders as much as we can. Mr President, I would love to be able to extend myself on all the issues that this report raises. It is clear that I cannot do so, and I will move on to the next subject of our debate today, not without pointing out, not without making it clear that the issue of the defence of human rights and democracy in the world is an issue of virtually ineligible extension and depth. Because we are seeing a regression in respect for human rights and democratic practices. We are seeing a rebirth of authoritarianism or new autocrats in many parts of the world, sometimes in a democratic guise, which formally adopt democratic ways and procedures, but which, in essence, are not. And so I think it is essential that we continue to do what we do and do more with the support and help of parliamentarians. And that is why I believe that this report would have deserved a monographic debate. On the situation with Turkey, ladies and gentlemen, I understand the reasons put forward by many of you. But on this Hemiicle, today, a somewhat bellicose dimension has flown, almost at some point I had seemed to see Pope Pius V resurfaced calling the Holy Alliance against Turkey and mobilizing christianity's fleets to deal with the Ottoman invasion. I have no vocation from Chamberlain or Daladier, but neither do I have Don Juan's Austria. If you're looking for a John of Austria, don't look at me, because that belongs to another time in history. We're not looking for confrontation, we're looking to avoid it. And that is why I have expressed myself, on several occasions — the recent one, in Turkey itself, in Ankara — in the terms at the same time firm in defending the territorial integrity and rights of countries that are affected by activities, which we consider illegal, of Turkey in the field of hydrocarbon exploration, but at the same time pointing out that we are not going to change geography and that we need to have a constructive relationship with Turkey. And that this means avoiding an escalation of tension, which has unfortunately manifested itself in incidents, including naval ones, between warships from European and Turkish countries— all members of the same military alliance: NATO — and which are being investigated within the one who must do so— which is NATO itself— but which we must try to prevent them from reproducing.  I insist: here it is not a question of seeking a holy alliance against a new Ottoman invasion, as many of you seemed to propose, but, in more constructive terms, in the face of a complex reality, as some of the participants have also said — Sánchez Amor, Mrs Zovko - that we seek a process that encompasses a negotiation on all the issues that are now conflicting in the relationship between the European Union and some Member States and Turkey , because we have many problems to solve and we also need to do so. And I believe that this can only be achieved from negotiation and dialogue, firmly, but also by avoiding an escalation of tension, which I do not think will lead to solving the problem, but to aggravate it.  And that is what I am trying to do and what I will continue to try to do, with the support of my colleagues in the Foreign Affairs Council, that next Monday will have the issue of Turkey on your agenda. And precisely to prepare for this debate, I have travelled to Greece and Cyprus and also to Turkey.  And on the subject of Belarus, Mr President, I can only agree with the interventions that have been made.  We have pointed out, from the beginning of the electoral process, the number of circumstances that concern us and which we reject about repression and violation of human rights by the Belarusian authorities, and we have issued serious warning messages — they have a list of this, about what we have said, through the formal position procedures of the European Union. But at the same time we also have to maintain contact with civil society and we need to maintain contact with Belarus that allows us to act on reality and improve the situation of the citizens of Belarus with regard to the relationship with the European Union. And both are not incompatible.  It is not incompatible to defend and express our commitment to the civil rights of the citizens of Belarus, the independence and sovereignty of the country and, at the same time, to participate in contacts with civil society and to maintain open communication links.  Something similar might say about Russia. Many of you have referred to the question of why we continue to finance Turkey with pre-accession funds.  Well, you should know that, since 2017, pre-accession funds have been cut, reduced, by EUR 1.3 billion, and that the current allocation is only devoted to working in the areas of democracy, the development of the rule of law, human rights and support for civil society, along with an allocation of 160 million for rural development... no, sorry, 18 million for rural development.  But there are currently no pre-accession funds allocated to the economic areas, because these funds have been, as I say, sharply diminished as a result of Turkey's actions, which the Council has considered to be not compatible with that candidate country status which you have mentioned so many times.  Therefore, we have used the instruments we have, but do not mix everything. Do not mix pre-accession funds with the funds we allocate to support exiles— so to be called 'exiles', without 'migrants'—Syrians who are in Turkey.  Three and a half million people undoubtedly place a significant burden on the host country, and for us to spend money helping this reception by providing schools, providing health care, facilitating education, what's wrong with that? How are we going to stop doing that? We have to keep doing it.  It has recently been decided — and Parliament is there to allocate 500 million more support to Syrian refugees. That's not money for Turkey, as some have said. No, that money is going directly to help, via NGOs working in the united Nations agencies, to the desperate situation of Syrian exiles.  They can't criticize that; they can't say it's some kind of evil exchange with Turkey. It is an absolute need for us to contribute to the maintenance of the effort to help these people, as we do in Jordan and Lebanon. Exactly the same.  With Belarus, the situation, I share your concern, is and may be even more serious. And it is true that there we have limited instruments of action. I can assure you that we have used all those within our reach and that, depending on how events unfold, the Foreign Affairs Council will deal with the matter and take appropriate action.  But on this third item on the agenda, I do wish to express my absolute agreement with the honourable Members when they have expressed themselves, in the terms on which they have done so, on the situation in Belarus.  Ladies and gentlemen... Thank you very much, Mr President, for your generosity over time. And I would have liked to have had more, but I think it was the synthetic response to the many speeches you have made on three issues of the utmost importance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 79, "date": "2020-07-09.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  The joint debate is closed.

The Commission believes that the implementation of the EU-Turkey migration agreement has done a great deal to deal with the refugee problem. In reality, this gag treaty, with which the EU unconditionally surrenders itself to the whims and demands of Turkey, is a bad joke, because from 2015-2019, despite everything, more than 1.21 million cases of illegal border crossings were registered at the EU's eastern external borders. Between 2016 and 2019, more than 25,000 migrants from Turkish reception camps were resettled in the EU. This means that, under the 1:1 rule of the agreement, the same number of illegal immigrants should have been deported back to Turkey during the same period. In fact, there were only 1 954 people! The EU is very good at concealing its own inability to deal with it, but an absolute failure to solve the most elementary problems.

In other words, as a result of the Union's silence, they are free to continue their infringements, including against religious minorities. Europe must therefore be firm and consistent.

Chemicals are everywhere. They are in our food, in our water, in our clothes and in our cosmetics. They are in the air that we breathe. In other words, they affect all aspects of our daily life. Our first priority is to upgrade the level of protection of the consumer and the environment. For this reason, we are asking for the elimination of risk-hazardous substances and substitutions to safer alternatives when it’s feasible. We call on the Commission to take into account the risk posed by endocrine disrupters and the combination effect of different chemicals. Commissioner, we are focusing on a very ambitious target by aiming to set the chemical safety standard for the entire world. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) should support the EU’s international trade policy by defining provisions and fostering regulatory systems built upon EU standards for chemical safety. This would enhance protection beyond the EU borders and extend the level playing field. Chemicals are also the industry of industries. A size—based grouping approach will enable the industry, in complementarity with the ‘one substance, one assessment’ principle. This strategy must also grant sufficient time for the industry’s manufacturers in order to deliver safe and performing products and incentivise the EU industrial production and economy. In this regard, the strategy should secure adequate funding to accelerate the development of innovative and safe alternatives. The strategy should also ensure that unnecessary animal tests are avoided, incentivising the development of smart testing strategies and artificial intelligence methods. However, everything is not dependent on this House. Everything is not dependent on Brussels and on Brussels’ political will. That’s why we also have to increase the level of implementation of the existing EU legislation on chemicals, asking the Member States to fully implement the current legislative framework in order to provide a safe and sustainable environment as well as a competitive European market. In this strategy, we have three critical allies – the three agencies: ECHA, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Firstly we must avoid overlap between these three agencies. Secondly, we have to secure their adequate funding by providing additional resources. I would like to conclude with the need for the chemicals strategy for sustainability to be aligned with the two main aspects of the Green Deal. The first one is green and the second is digital. In this regard, we fully support  ECHA’s initiative to promote the establishment of a fully-connected and interoperable EU chemical safety database platform to facilitate the seamless sharing of data between authorities and to provide public access to researchers, regulators, industry and the citizens at large.

As announced in the Commission’s Work Programme for 2020 – we have updated recently to respond to the corona pandemic – the chemical strategy is planned for the third quarter and we are currently working towards an adoption at the end of the third quarter this year. Internal discussions and preparatory work are still ongoing, so I’m sure you will understand that the information I can provide today remains general and that I cannot yet go into any details of the upcoming strategy.  The chemical strategy for sustainability is one of the key deliverables of the Green Deal and one of the priorities, of course, within my portfolio this year. When we adopted the Green Deal last December we all agreed to ensure a toxic-free environment. The strategy had a twofold objective. First, it should help to protect citizens and the environment better against hazardous chemicals and it had to encourage innovation for the development of safe and sustainable alternatives. This twofold objective has guided our internal preparatory work from the very beginning and has also made it clear from the very start that to better combine health and environmental protection, and increase global competitiveness, all parties and stakeholders have to work closely together.  This also applies, of course, to the Commission, which is why my services, my team and I are preparing the strategy in a very close cooperation with many other DGs, Cabinets and Commissioners involved in this very horizontal, I would say, topic.  I appreciate that in the resolution that you will adopt tomorrow you equally acknowledge this horizontal character of chemicals. You highlight both the need to act towards a safe and sustainable use of chemicals, but also the essential role of the chemical sector in reaching the multiple targets of the Green Deal, such as the zero-pollution ambition, climate neutrality, energy transition, the promotion of energy efficiency and the circular economy.  Let me already thank you for the considerable work and effort you have put into this important resolution which, as I said, comes very timely. Once adopted, we will examine it very carefully and take it into account when finalising our chemical strategy over the next weeks. We will, of course, also take into account the over 400 comments and contributions we received from stakeholders and citizens on the roadmap for the chemical strategy, which was published for feedback from 9 May until 20 June of this year.  Let me now provide you with some more elements on our upcoming chemical strategy for sustainability. The strategy is based and will build on a number of policy evaluations and previous initiatives linked to the EU chemicals legislation and in particular the second REACH review from 2018, the fitness check of chemicals legislation from 2019, the Communication on endocrine disrupters from 2018 and the Communication on options to address the interface between chemical, product and waste legislation from 2018.  To reach our main objective, the strategy will particularly focus on the following five elements. First: strengthening legislation for higher health and environmental protection from hazardous chemicals. Despite the great achievements of EU chemicals legislation, we urgently need to step up action, in particular to better protect vulnerable groups, to address the combined effects of chemicals, to tackle endocrine disrupters and persistent substances. Second: boosting innovation and competitiveness. We need to incentivise the development of safe and sustainable production and use of chemicals. The transition to ‘safe and sustainable by design’ represents a major opportunity for the EU’s innovation and competitiveness. At the same time, a strong and sustainable EU industry is an important asset for the EU to contribute to global sustainability. We also need to support the recovery from the economic crisis, build resilience and ensure strategic autonomy in the supply of essential chemicals in Europe, for instance for health applications or technologies critical to achieve climate neutrality, digital transition, clean and safe material cycles and zero pollution.  Third: streamlining the existing framework. Our legislative framework is overall fit for purpose, but also complex, and in some cases inconsistent and slow. This is a challenge for both stakeholders and authorities. We have the opportunity to rationalise and simplify and make it more effective, including by moving towards a ‘one substance – one assessment’ process. Insufficient enforcement and poor compliance are also major bottlenecks, preventing existing legislation from attaining its full potential.  Fourth: intensifying research and knowledge on the impacts of chemicals on health and the environment, but also ways to better process and share this data and information for regulatory use, but also for consumer information or industrial use in the supply chain. One key area is the tracking of hazardous substances in articles to achieve non-toxic material cycles and ultimately a circular economy.  Finally, strengthening the global dimension. It is important that the EU becomes more and more an example worldwide of standards on sound management of chemicals to strengthen international standards and support third countries in the safe production and use of chemicals.  Once the final chemical strategy for sustainability has been adopted by the College, I will, of course, be happy to come back and present it to you and I already look forward to working very closely with you to implement it, because the work will, of course, not finish with the adoption of the strategy, quite the contrary. For now, let me thank you for your attention and I look forward to the views of the political groups.

In fact, the Commission itself mentioned this when you made your proposal for a European Green Pact last year, and we in the PPE Group have not forgotten that. That is why we are now giving you a resolution in which we invite you to present a chemistry strategy for sustainability as soon as possible. One of the main ingredients of this is to make the fast-track registration of low-risk pesticides a real fast-track. There's no point in it being just in the name. European companies are inventing more and more sustainable plant protection products for the benefit of the environment and public health in these years, but registration, it is lagging, and thus the new, environmentally friendly solutions do not reach farmers, either in Europe or in the rest of the world, and that is simply not working! Now turn the fast-track into a true fast-track! We owe this to the planet and to the mouths that need to be saturated, but also to our innovative farmers, who often get on the back foot for causing the stressful conditions of the environment. That is not fair, nor is it sensible!", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 94, "date": "2020-07-09.json", "name": "Maria ARENA", "mepid": "124936", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of President, in its communication on the Green Pact for Europe, the Commission announced its 'zero pollution' ambition for a toxic substance-free environment. In this context, reducing exposure to hazardous chemicals is of course a major issue and all the laws regulating chemicals must be the bulwark for citizens and the environment, in the face of the major risk posed by some of these substances. Through our resolution, Parliament is sending a clear and ambitious message, first of all for the full implementation of existing legislation, but also for an evolution of legislation on many aspects. Strong measures for health and the environment are needed and we must take responsibility for this. We want health to come before the economic interests of certain industries. What is sustainable chemistry? Specific criteria must be adopted to define it, otherwise sustainable chemistry will only be a concept that industries will use to \"greenwash\" their activities, to the detriment of the health of citizens. A more sustainable chemistry is not a chemistry that provides ever more revenue to shareholders of the chemical industry, it is a chemistry that fully integrates the objectives of public health and safeguarding biodiversity. This is primarily through reducing the dangers associated with chemicals, by replacing the most dangerous substances with safe alternatives, by increasing transparency in the authorisation process, which also incorporates social and environmental costs, especially for persistent chemicals. The cost of the chemical industry today in relation to health is 160 billion euros per year. If these costs were borne by the industry, I can assure you that replacement with alternative substances would go much faster.

So the Commission - because we have benefited from some leaks - wants to strengthen the regulatory framework, that is good news. It aims at REACH, of course, in particular, with a group approach for similar substances in order to speed up the risk assessment by our European Chemicals Agency. One small thing in this regard: this logic by family must also apply to the procedure of restriction for dangerous substances, phthalates, to name but one example, prohibited in children's toys, allowed elsewhere. We are also being considered by the Commission to see new criteria for risk management. European legislation must, of course, protect against endocrine disruptors, from neurotoxics. I am thinking here of the many workers who are exposed to solvents or heavy metals on a daily basis. Finally, it is essential to take action against PFAS, these perfluorated compounds found in foams, in Teflon stoves, not to mention them, in food packaging. PFAS, because mobile, because persistent, very persistent, are a real danger to our health. The European Union must move forward, Commissioner, with a phasing out of this class of almost 5,000 chemicals.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. When we talk today about the social situation of the Roma, we are talking about ten to twelve million people in Europe, then we are talking about about six million citizens of the European Union. Many, too many of them live in extreme poverty and are exposed to unimaginable hardships. It is almost ten years since we agreed on the Roma strategy. Some of you were already involved when the process was launched in 2011 with the great support of this Parliament. Almost ten years have passed since then and, unfortunately, we have to say that the results we have achieved so far are disappointing.  This is also reported by the Commission, and you, honourable Members, also emphasise this in its resolution last year. We have had to recognise that it takes too long to eradicate the great intergenerational poverty and to end the decades, if not centuries, of marginalisation of Gypsies. I say this also as a representative of a country that, decades ago, fell victim to fascism with around 500 000 Gypsies, innocent men, women and children. Yes, the road to full equality, inclusion and Roma participation is long. Yes, we should have already achieved more, and yes, there is no doubt that we can and must make much more effort in the future. But there is also good news. As reported by the European Commission, the greatest progress has been made in the field of education. For example, Member States are taking measures to ensure that fewer Roma children leave school early and that more Roma children have access to early childhood education and compulsory education. This is, of course, crucial. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. In the 21st century, discrimination, racist prejudice and hatred must be a thing of the past. Discrimination and anti-Gypsyism must be eradicated once and for all if we want to look ourselves in the eye and if we ourselves want to be perceived as a just and equal society.  But we also need a consistent political strategy to combat social inequality. Extreme poverty over several generations inevitably leads to an accumulation of serious disadvantages in health, education, housing and work. We finally need a concept that will look at all these areas at the same time. This is the only way to break the cycle of marginalisation. And, of course, representatives of the Roma must also be involved in this process. But not somewhere on the sidelines, but on an equal footing, in a dialogue of respect, without prejudice. If someone does not have access to health care or a mainstream school, if someone does not have a decent home or a job, how can that person ever realize his dreams? How can this person ever develop his talents in our society?  The health issue in times of the Corona pandemic weighs particularly heavily. Roma, like everyone else, must have equal access to basic health care and specialised health services. With regard to the new initiatives announced by our Commission for October, I would like to thank you, the European Parliament, for putting this issue on the agenda time and again. In doing so, you not only helped to launch the ten-year strategic framework back then, in 2011, but you have also regularly reminded us in recent years that this issue remains urgent. Honourable Members, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for her excellent work. Imagine a Roma child born in the year when the framework for the Roma strategy was first adopted, namely 2011, a year of hope, grand plans and brilliant promises for the Gypsy community.  Today, this child is nine years old. Unfortunately, it is likely that it has not been given the opportunities that most of us here take for granted, which we want for our children and for our granddaughters. Extreme poverty, racial discrimination and social exclusion are not just keywords, they are the sad reality in the middle of Europe, in the midst of us in all the Member States of the European Union.  They are made up of unfair obstacles that deprive many Roma of any chance of a decent life. So let us think of this one now nine-year-old child. Let us think of the six million citizens of the European Union, adults and children, girls and boys, women and men. What prospects will they have in the coming years? We must not abandon them.  The Council and the European Parliament are allies in the joint efforts to promote Roma inclusion at European level. I am very confident that this alliance will continue. Member States have the key competences. But we, as the institutions of the European Union, can help to ensure that this arduous and long road leads to a good end. Fortunately, we also have EU legislation prohibiting discrimination against all ethnic minorities, including the Roma. This year is a crucial year for Roma inclusion strategies. I fear that many of this community have heard this phrase too often. So it's about more than paying lip service. It is a question of concrete action. I am very excited, dear Helena Dalli, about the package that the Commission is currently preparing. I assure you that we will do everything in our power to ensure that this package is adopted under our chairmanship. Let us all draw strength from the European values of justice and solidarity for the future. Europe was, is and remains a dream of solidarity, a dream of freedom, dignity and equality, but also – and above all – for the Gypsies, to whom we are paying special tribute today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 4, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 106, "date": "2020-07-09.json", "name": "Helena Dalli", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I thank Mr Roth for this heartfelt introduction to this very important debate. Honourable Members, thank you for putting Roma inclusion on today’s agenda. I thank all of you here today, and the honourable Ms Lívia Járóka, Mr Romeo Franz and Mr Peter Pollák in particular, for the visibility that they provide for the Roma community, their commitment and their tireless work for Roma equality, inclusion and participation, including through the organisation of this debate. I equally reiterate my thanks to the Members present here today for the relentless support towards advancing the agenda on Roma inclusion and equality participation. I shall start by quoting Chancellor Merkel in her speech here in this Parliament yesterday. She said, ‘human and civil rights, the inviolability of human dignity, the freedom of individual, personal, political and social development, protection against discrimination and disregard, equality –equality that is not only claimed but also realised. These are the ethical and political foundations on which Europe rests ... These are the rights that apply to everyone. They do not apply to some more and others less. They do not apply to some always and to others only sometimes. They apply. This is the promise of Europe that we must guarantee: that citizens can truly be free to live their religious beliefs, their cultural or political beliefs, that they may adhere to their respective ideas of happiness, or good life.’ With this Chancellor Merkel quote in our minds and in our hearts, I shall now address the Roma reality, the subject of our debate today. As you know, Roma living in marginalised communities are some of the most vulnerable groups hit the hardest by the coronavirus pandemic. The already existing inequalities have been compounded; long—lasting inequalities, discrimination and exclusion have become more visible. The Commission is aware of this fact, not least through a series of targeted communications and we have done all possible to deliver prompt intervention. We will remain on alert and will continue to intervene, based on need, in line with our duty and responsibility. The Commission responded from the very beginning of the outbreak of the crisis. For instance, together with Commissioners Kyriakides and Schmit, I wrote to Member States emphasising the need for specific measures for the most vulnerable groups, including Roma, in the context of the coronavirus crisis. We also put forward several instruments as an immediate response to the crisis, which can offer support to vulnerable groups such as Roma. No one, and definitely not the most vulnerable, should carry more than the fair share of the burden of this epidemic. The Roma community has suffered not just the health and economic impact of this crisis. In some Member States, and I really regret to say, Roma persons have also been portrayed as a public health threat during the crisis. This is shameful. The pandemic brought to the fore and accentuated deep—rooted discrimination and hatred against these communities. The European Commission condemns strongly all forms of stigmatisation, ethnicisation and Roma scapegoating. All of these are contrary to EU values and go against the basic principles of our democracy. The European Union has the legally binding tools to combat discrimination, including those based on racial or ethnic origin. The Council Framework Decision on combating certain forms of racism and xenophobia is the tool to fight against hate crime, including anti—gypsyism, in speech or action. The Racial Equality Directive prohibits discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin in key aspects of life. Roma, as an ethnic minority, fall within the protected categories of people covered by these legal tools, and we have a duty to enforce them. But we also know that legislation is one thing and how effective this is on people’s lives is another. Legislation on its own is never enough, in any area, and thus we must do much more. We are closely monitoring Member States’ compliance with the directive. Three infringement procedures are ongoing against Member States. They relate to the segregation of Roma children in mainstream schools and their over—representation in schools for children with intellectual disabilities. I am actively working with the countries concerned to put an end to this situation, and will not shy away from opening further infringement proceedings where there is the need. Overcoming discrimination and exclusion of Roma requires a long—term commitment and a comprehensive approach. As I had announced, we are preparing an ambitious post—2020 initiative: the ‘strategic EU framework for equality, inclusion and participation of Roma up to 2030’. This will also reflect the new needs emerging from the coronavirus crisis among marginalised Roma communities. I plan to present the new initiative later this year. We aim to have a strong, ambitious and all—encompassing strategy. It is my firm belief that, building on the findings of the evaluation of the 2011-2020 framework, we need to put a stronger focus on promoting equality for Roma by fighting anti—Gypsyism and discrimination, hand in hand with promoting socioeconomic inclusion. We need to better reflect the diversity among Roma; ensure meaningful participation of and partnership with Roma communities, Roma civil society and all other stakeholders; promote a consistent focus on Roma equality and inclusion in all mainstream policies; and work towards improved data collection and monitoring of progress through indicators and clear targets to ensure effective progress and promote policy learning. The dire consequences of this pandemic on Roma communities have further accentuated the need for a renewed and strong commitment from all stakeholders to advance further together with the full involvement of Roma people themselves. Roma people need your and my and our indefatigable, relentless commitment and hard work. I trust that together, we can do a lot to change and improve our societies. Together, we can achieve more: more inclusion, more equality, more justice, more participation for our Roma communities in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 107, "date": "2020-07-09.json", "name": "Peter POLLÁK", "mepid": "197765", "text": "  for the PPE Group. – Commissioner, it is time to admit that, despite the abundant European financial resources, miserable progress has been made in Roma communities over the last ten years.

We need to see tangible results.  In order to focus on those Member States where, in the absence of political will, macroeconomic problems are occurring and regional disparities are wideling. We must focus on countries with a larger Roma population, where the Roma in the 21st century live in conditions that we know from the African continent, without water supply or sewerage.  Close monitoring and active participation of Roma in decision-making processes must become an essential part of all activities. The Roma are citizens of the European Union, they are an untapped potential, both human and economic. It must be acknowledged that the Roma in Europe also face institutional racism. Unfortunately, there are children among the victims.  Personally, as a Roma, I regret and it was, in fact, really disappointing for me to find out that some of the political factions of the European Parliament that have their mouths full on the human rights agenda have blocked the joint resolution that could have come out of this debate. So when it came to violating the law of African Americans in the United States, they did not hesitate there and adopted a similar resolution.

In fact, cohesion funds have not reduced the difference between people, but have increased them. The sad reality is that in many European countries the chances of roma children growing up in poverty have been reduced. They are the first to be sacrificed by the political elite when a crisis inges. In fact, this resignation is a loss for all of us. With segregated education and discrimination in the labour market, we are blocking the opportunity for thousands, hundreds of thousands of people, to take on high-value-added jobs. Yes, a cruel attitude towards the Roma makes society as a whole poorer and countries more uncompetitive. They spent money blindly, and they expected that this, and only that, would solve all the problems. All they've forgotten is that catching up can't be based solely on money. True catch-up can only be achieved through a humane and just policy. Therefore, we must implement the support policy for the next decade jointly with the Roma and take responsibility together. The last Hungarian EU Presidency has already presented a Roma strategy. Yet we are here today nine years later because various political forces, such as the Hungarian Prime Minister, can trample on anyone at any time just to get a vote. Now it's gypsy's turn.

Unfortunately, this is the case with the Roma, who have set up criminal networks in our country, avoiding the census, while we are all registered, and who exploit their children, who are obliged to beg, who are even denied the right to school.

COVID-19 has made the effects of anti-gypsyism visible to everyone. We are witnessing police violence against Romani people across Europe. In Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia, we could see how the people who are locked up in their neighbourhoods had little access to food, drinking water or healthcare. In Germany, too, we are witnessing police violence against Sinti and Roma, and in Berlin there is a debate about the dismantling of the Holocaust monument to the Sinti and Roma because of a tramline: a disgrace and insult to the victims of the Holocaust.  I am the rapporteur of the House on this subject. In my current report, we express clearly our demands on the future EU-Romani policy and identify the real barriers to the inclusion of Romani people. A new approach is needed. We must put the fight against anti-gypsism and social exclusion first. Equal participation of Romani people must be achieved at all levels of government through binding targets and legislation at national, regional and local level. An adequate budget must be dedicated to the implementation of the next Romani framework. I am a Sinto, the son of a Holocaust survivor who lost six aunts and uncles in the Holocaust.

Here, thanks to the creation and dissemination of Roma culture, this ethnic group enjoys due respect and recognition. I am convinced that the creative implementation of programmes on other areas of social activity, supported by a thorough knowledge of this ethnic group, is a platform for roma action in modern Europe.

Strengthening roma inclusion in Europe is not only a responsibility of countries and local communities, but must be a concern for the entire European Union.  The fact that 80% of the Roma in the European Union live below the poverty line and that there is no progress in ending structural discrimination confirms that we really need a harmonised framework, and this is European, for Roma inclusion. It has reached its own level so far and, in fact, has only raised this issue on the political agenda of individual countries, and now we need a different approach.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. I am very grateful to have taken part in this debate today, because it shows that we agree to a great extent and that we also know how difficult the task ahead is. But if we tackle this together with great courage and commitment, I am sure that by the end of this year we will have a strategy from which we will all emerge stronger.  We, as the Presidency, also want to make a concrete contribution to this. We want to organise a conference. I fear that this conference will only be able to take place virtually under the prevailing conditions, but it is another opportunity for exchanges, especially here in Parliament and in the other institutions, but above all with those directly affected. I am amazed at something I have not only heard here. Dealing with Roma is not about hospitality. The vast majority of Roma are citizens of our countries. (Applause) They enjoy the same rights and duties as all of us. They are not guests, and so it is already part of the discrimination that Roma and Sinti are subjected to if they are segregated or excluded from a society of free and equal. Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, it is not about privileges. It is about something very simple: it is about equal rights and equality with six million citizens of the European Union. And it must also become clear time and again that an attack on Roma is always also an attack on European values, on our principles. I am very grateful to the honourable Members who have once again stressed that we also need encouragement and role models, especially in this debate. Roma are not just problem factors. The opposite is true. Roma as part of our European societies enrich us. In Berlin, for example, we had very positive experiences with the European Roma Institute for Culture and Art, because we want to make it clear that Roma also make a very important essential contribution to the historical and cultural identity of our continent. I would like us, too, to be able to make it clear, within the framework of the strategy, that it is about something enriching and about many of the opportunities and strengths that we associate with Roma. Of course, it is not just about money. We are really not just talking about funding in the strategy. It is a question of an attitude. How do we deal with Europe's largest ethnic minority and the largest ethnic minority in the European Union? In this respect, I would like to see the phrase 'Roma lives matter' followed, also in view of the anti-racism debate that we are having around the world, but also in Europe.

Strategies for Roma integration have been numerous, particularly under European leadership. This includes the creation in 2004 of the European Roma and Travellers Forum, as well as in 2010 a European Commission communication complemented by a comprehensive strategy in 2011. In this context, the Eastern European States have undoubtedly made a number of efforts, particularly in the area of access to higher education. However, while the European framework of action set a first deadline in 2020, it is clear that the failure is obvious. Who's to blame? Rather than throwing anathema at the states concerned, let us recognize that there are many reasons.

The Commission finally recognises the importance of the points requested in the EP report, which has been voiced since 2004 and which won 97% support in 2010, as an essential condition for successful Roma integration. The failure in 2011 to fully support the main cornerstones of my report and the proposals of our government has greatly de-tripped successful Roma integration in our Member States.  The main areas of expertise, housing, health, education, work, digitalisation, green energy use, agriculture, subsidiarity and real Roma organisations, the priority of local initiatives, were an integral part of our proposals at the time. I am convinced that their absence, pointing to the unpreparedness of the Roma team of the commission at the time, is a major cause of the worse-than-expected results of today's Roma strategies.  I consider the right to equal education to be important, stressing the importance of exchanging existing good practices between countries. The number of segregated classes in Hungary has decreased from 1400 to 600 in the last ten years. Poverty decreased by 35%, which was contributed by kindergarten and crèche construction programmes, Safe Start Children's Homes in the poorest regions, family centres with one child, tax breaks for mothers with large families, housing and car purchase assistance. The fight against racism is very important, but improving living conditions is even more important.

Across Europe, Roma problems are similar in nature – m.in. low level of education, absence from the labour market, significantly shorter life expectancy, segregation in education, poor housing, difficult access to basic public services. The impact of intracultural factors on the situation of Roma (e.g. premature marriages and premature motherhood) which perpetuate the marginalisation of this community is often underestimated.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Perhaps, at the beginning of my speech, Let me say something and make it clear that seems to be self-evident in all our ears. The European Union is not primarily an internal market or a monetary community, we are, above all, and first and foremost, a community of law and values. These principles, which are based on our treaties and are written down in our treaties, bind us all. Thank you, honourable Members, for giving me the opportunity to inform you of the current state of play in the negotiations in the Council on the regulation on the protection of the Union's budget in the event of general shortcomings in the rule of law in the Member States. This proposal was an integral part of the political pact, the package that the Commission presented on 2 May 2018 on the next Multiannual Financial Framework. As such, it will be dealt with by the Council in the context of the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework. The in-depth examination of the proposal began in November 2018. It's been a long time coming. It quickly became apparent that two elements are particularly sensitive for delegations in the Council: firstly, the link with the rule of law and, secondly, the voting mode for approving the measures. In the Presidency's view, no progress could be made on these points without the political guidance of the Heads of State or Government in the Council. These issues were therefore included in the draft negotiating box drawn up by the Austrian Presidency. The Romanian Presidency continued its technical deliberations on other elements of the proposal. It presented a total of five Presidency compromise proposals, which were discussed at both technical and political level. A detailed overview of the process and the main elements of the consultation can be found in the progress report of the Romanian Presidency. The President of the European Council has set himself the task of obtaining a clear picture of the views of the Heads of State or Government as part of the discussions on the overall MFF package on the Commission proposal. To this end, in February 2020, it presented a draft European Council conclusions, and, as you know, this work is still ongoing. Without european Council guidance on the policy elements identified in the examination of the proposal, there is little scope for further work at technical level. As soon as these European Council policy guidelines are in place – and we hope that this will happen as soon as possible – the Presidency will immediately start work on the legislative text so that negotiations with the European Parliament can begin as soon as possible. In this context, President Michel informed you yesterday of preparations for the forthcoming European Council. As the proposals are part of the entire MFF package, it is necessary to ensure that the negotiations conducted under the ordinary legislative procedure do not delay the negotiations aimed at ensuring the European Parliament's approval of the MFF regulation. I would ask for leniency for the complicated remarks, but it is a difficult dossier and that is why I wanted to inform you with the greatest possible transparency about this procedure and about the discussions in the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 144, "date": "2020-07-09.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the summit next week marks an important moment for Europe and, as we have seen throughout Europe, as each of us has felt in his or her own country and constituency, corona has changed our way of life and the economy. This unprecedented challenge is the moment when Europe matters more than ever. The lives of millions of people, the future of hundreds of thousands of companies and the prospects of many regions depend on our recovery plan. This makes it even more important that every euro we invest via our common EU budget really adds value and becomes a true investment in our future. Europeans expect us to protect taxpayers’ money and interests. Rightly so. The rule of law regulation plays an important role here and I appreciate this debate right before the summit. So let me highlight three points. First, where there are cases of generalised rule of law deficiencies in a Member State, we need an effective instrument to protect taxpayers’ money. Our rule of law proposal creates a genuine budgetary protection mechanism. Second, it’s a targeted tool to protect the European Union budget. That means that it’s fully in line with the Treaties and it’s distinct from the mechanism under Article 7 of the Treaties.  Third, it’s an objective and transparent budgetary mechanism to protect sound financial management. Measures will be proportionate to the impact on the EU budget and the position of the Member State concerned will be duly considered. The burden of proof will be borne by the Commission and the Council. The measures will need to be based on concrete factual elements and on specific grounds. So I thank Parliament once again for its support for the Commission’s proposal through the legislative resolution of 4 April 2019. The points raised by Parliament were well noted, notably the need to ensure the protection of final recipients and beneficiaries. It’s important that they don’t pay the price for rule of law deficiencies. The Commission is committed to addressing these issues in the trilogues.  The scope of our proposal is clear. It establishes a genuine mechanism to protect the EU budget and ensure sound financial management. In November 2019, the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) and the Committee on Budgets (BUDG) already decided to enter into interinstitutional negotiations with the Council. I trust that trilogues can start swiftly under the German Presidency and I took note, with great pleasure, of the statement of the Council representative. I count on the continued support of Parliament to find an agreement that preserves the effectiveness and the ambition of this important proposal. Protecting our common budget is our common interest. The rule of law proposal is a key feature of the overall MFF negotiations and therefore time is of the essence. Only if you, honourable Members, and the European Council strive for an overall political MFF agreement in the summer will we have a chance of getting support to where it is needed. I know this is indeed very ambitious and would represent an unprecedented speed. Well, these are unprecedented times. I think that for citizens, companies and regions every day counts and we have to deliver. This is in all our interests.

You said it: we are a Union of rights and values.

The European Parliament has clearly expressed its position on the Commission's proposal. Not only is respect for the rule of law important, but we must ensure compliance with all aspects to which, in fact and in law, Member States commit themselves when they sign their accession to the European Union. That is why we are talking about equality, solidarity, combating tax evasion or unfair competition in tax matters.  Chancellor Merkel, yesterday in her speech, referred to the need to work with the European Parliament to protect the common Europe. \"Together, re-strengthen Europe,\" he said. And you've emphasized it, too. Well, here we are, ready to negotiate with the Council. And I would like to stress the 'negotiate' thing, because they have to negotiate this regulation with Parliament. We are not here to support any agreement that leaves the Council.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very good one. The Chancellor yesterday began her speech with a strong appeal to fundamental rights in the European Union. That was also good, and that was the right thing to do. But this also requires a consequence of the Chancellor to now also work for this rule of law and for this rule of law mechanism at the summit. Because the EU is indeed more than the internal market, it is a community of values. With every negotiation in the Council in which we do not make any progress at this point, the community of values is becoming more and more a phrase. Minister of State Roth, you have just presented the negotiations in the Council very well, and I will summarise this briefly. In principle, it can be said that the Member States do not agree on two elements on the rule of law mechanism: the rule of law and the mechanism. That is the situation in the Council today, and that is not enough. We finally need the consequence that EU funds are no longer simply taken away and EU values are subsequently trampled underfoot. It is not a question of punishing the citizens of the countries concerned, but of ensuring that EU money no longer sinks into the dark pockets of corruption or that it does not end up in the pockets of those who are Europe's greatest enemies and who fight Europe's values the most. We must ensure that this is the case, and today, as the European Parliament, we are sending a strong signal to the Council.

Monitoring through mandatory membership in the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, freezing funds in case of systemic breaches, and redirecting them to final beneficiaries, with direct control by the Commission. Let me add something to the political difficulties that are being discussed so often by the Council. There is a narrative that a conflict of interest exists between Member States, and I believe this is largely a misconception. Of course there is a conflict of interest, but it’s between the Heads of States and Governments, and they do not equal their Member States. Prime Minister Orbán does not equal Hungary. So I would be curious to hear who the Council chooses to represent, because I believe that the Council should be representing the people, the small businesses, the NGOs, the local governments, the people in need, and they should be the recipients of a direct EU funding from the Commission.

Je suis ravi d’entendre que nous sommes pleinement d’accord sur l’importance de protéger le budget de l’Union. Votre soutien à cet égard, vous le savez, est essentiel. Le respect de l’état de droit est une condition préalable fondamentale au respect du principe de bonne gestion financière. The reasoning of our proposal is simple. In order to control the use of EU funds and to protect the financial interests of the EU against corruption and fraud, we need in each Member State independent justice systems, effective investigation and prosecution services and an effective functioning of public authorities implementing the Union budget. If those functions are endangered by a generalised deficiency of the rule of law in a Member State, the Union would be empowered to suspend, reduce or restrict access to EU funding in a proportionate manner.  Let me also stress that the proposed mechanism ensures the fairness and objectivity of the process. It will give adequate consideration to the views of the Member States concerned and will guarantee the proportionality of the measures taken. Moreover, the measures adopted will be subject to the full judicial review of the Court of Justice.  Par ailleurs, le mécanisme doit rester rapide et efficace. Il est donc essentiel que les modalités de vote au sein du Conseil soient celles de la majorité qualifiée inversée, comme proposé par la Commission. Cela garantirait une adoption rapide des mesures proposées. There is currently no instrument to protect the EU budget against generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in a Member State. The creation of this mechanism would decidedly improve the protection of the EU budget. Filling this significant gap is more important than ever, given the increased funding and increased flexibility proposed by the Commission in reaction to the COVID-19 crisis. We need to protect this funding in the very interest of all taxpayers and all citizens of the Union. La Commission reste fermement déterminée à contribuer à la recherche d’un compromis et invite le Parlement et le Conseil à conclure rapidement un accord sur cette importante proposition ainsi que sur un nouveau cadre financier pluriannuel. Il est dans notre intérêt à tous de finaliser rapidement un accord pour que le nouveau budget pluripluriannuel soit opérationnel à partir du 1er janvier 2021. L’Union doit se donner les moyens d’une reprise durable pour soutenir les citoyens, les entreprises et les régions les plus touchés par la crise. Nous le devons également aux futures générations. Le plan de relance qui est sur la table est l’occasion pour l’Europe de devenir plus résiliente, plus verte et plus numérique, mais aussi plus ambitieuse dans la protection de ses valeurs. La Commission fera tout son possible pour ouvrir la voie à un accord rapide et ambitieux entre les colégislateurs. I want to say to the Council, to Minister Roth, that we are ready to engage in the discussions in the trilogue to make progress in the protection of the budget of the European Union and in the defence of our values.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Who is afraid of controversy? You do not, but I promise you, nor do the Council. You all know what it is all about. Europe is built not only on consensus, but also on controversy, and our constitutional mothers and constitutional fathers of a united Europe could not have imagined decades ago that we would ever find ourselves in a situation of having to seriously check whether the principles of the rule of law apply equally in all EU Member States. I would like to take up what Mrs Hohlmeier has said here: it is a question of equal treatment. The Council attaches the utmost importance to ensuring that all Member States are treated equally, that all Member States are reviewed. If Mr Freund doubts the integrity of the Presidency, I would like to remind you once again, not only what the Chancellor said yesterday for the Presidency, but what we have kindly already sent you, namely the Presidency programme. It contains a sentence which I am sure the Commissioner should also be pleased with: 'We therefore support the Commission's proposal to link EU budgets with compliance with the rule of law in the Member States'. That is what it is all about, and it is not enough for us. In this respect, I can only tell you, Mr Wolters, that the Council is not in a slumber, we are a sham. I can only tell you that, and when it comes to us – and this is the Presidency's proposal – we in the Council will deal with the situation of the rule of law in the European Union in almost every sitting in this Presidency. We will also use the European Commission's planned report on the rule of law as an opportunity to maintain an objective, but certainly not indisputable, exchange. I hope that we will succeed in this. In this respect, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to all of you for the encouragement you have given us. I see a high degree of agreement, but since it is embedded in the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework, you all know much better than I do that everything is somehow related to everything. We are not talking in isolation about one area, but you can still be sure that the Chancellor's words will also be heard up to the European Council, namely that it will be made clear: this is not just about money, but really about what holds us together at its core, and in this respect I can take the question from Mr Sarvamaa and also Mr Körner's question. , whether we have enough ambition to answer with a clear and explicit 'yes'. Political rebates are not granted to anyone, and so I look forward to future consultations with you. There is a great deal at stake, but it is also about the unity of the European Union, which is based on common values – and the rule of law is a very important one of them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 165, "date": "2020-07-09.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  Thank you, Mrs Roth, and I wish you every success in the negotiations.

So assessments remain quite dependent on subjective political criteria that are not – perhaps cannot – be applied uniformly and equally to all. What constitutes a breach of the rule of law is still open to interpretation that too often discriminates between Member States. Moreover, the implementation of rule of law provisions including decisions to apply sanctions can only be as objective as possible if the agency that applies them is independent of all other agencies in the Union, has a quasi-judicial status and the power to investigate cases of infringement as they arise. This does not seem to be the case as things stand at present. It is extremely doubtful whether such a role should be assigned to the European Commission (or its nominee) given its executive and political status.

In Poland, the PiS government has been constantly attacking the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, independent media, as well as individual social groups and minorities for five years, with the aim of specifically electing LGBTI people and migrants and migrant women. The situation in Hungary has also not improved. In recent years, the orbán-led government has cut funding for civic organisations, systematically marginalised the LGBTI community, abolished media pluralism and continued to fight academic freedom and freedom of expression. Nevertheless, neither Polish nor Hungary have faced any consequences for violations of the rule of law.  In 2018, we welcomed the Commission's proposal to link respect for the rule of law to EU funds.

Instead, EU actors call for the rule of law in a Member State by deciding on purely political aspects in their investigations, while the original recipients of the set of requirements, the functioning of the EU institutions, are not subject to any rule of law assessment at all. By enforcing the rule of law, the EU intends to have a say in member states' own democratic and sovereign decision-making.

The Union may act only within the limits of the powers delegated to it by the Member States in order to achieve the objectives of the Treaties (Article 5).

The proposal, which would punish Member States by suspending payments from the EU budget, reveals that such a vigorous separation is rather an illusion and is very difficult to implement in practice. This is especially true of the recovery package after the epidemic, which is increasingly proving to be political, not only reflecting the effects of the epidemic, but also other vested interests. Surely there can be no object to Parliament's supervisory function in protecting taxpayers' money from corruption and enrichment of politicians and their loved ones. However, there are reasonable doubts about the assessment of democracy and the rule of law in the countries concerned and their financial sanctioning.

As we are all aware, terrorism is still a serious threat today and the fight against these criminal acts is a top priority, not only for the European Union but for all the Member States. Too many victims have wept in recent years, fellow citizens who have fatally become the random object of unprecedented hatred and violence, and we owe our commitment to them. New Zealand's inclusion among the countries with which to engage in cooperation stems from the Christchurch attack in March 2019, also considering that the European Union and New Zealand are partners that share the same principles, vision and approaches on many global issues. To date, Europol and the New Zealand police have signed a working agreement providing a framework for structured cooperation, but there is still no legal basis, which is essential for detecting, preventing and prosecuting terrorist offences. In my report I set out a number of objectives that will have to be pursued during the negotiations in order to allow the use and transfer of personal data for security reasons, while at the same time guaranteeing the protection of people's fundamental rights.  From this point of view, I believe that the text that will be put to the vote represents the right combination of the two requirements, reminding us that the fight against terrorism and its international dimension deserve all our attention and our political and legislative commitment, and I hope that this House will be able to give concrete recognition to it tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ID", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 172, "date": "2020-07-09.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "  Voting time will be open from 6.30 p.m. until 7.45 p.m. The votes will take place in the same way as at the previous voting time.
