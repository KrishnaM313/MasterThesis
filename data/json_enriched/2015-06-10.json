Croatia's membership of the EU will be fulfilled by accession. The purpose of the Convention is to promote mutual criminal assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States, including police, customs or judicial services, in order to ensure more effective and faster criminal cooperation.  In a Union where there are no borders and persons, goods, services and capital can flow freely, there is no longer a national border for criminal offences. In this case, law enforcement cannot remain national. Only effective cooperation at European level can produce satisfactory results. This requires mutual trust, since law enforcement has so far been mainly a national competence and the competent authorities of each Member State are reluctant to share their information with the authorities of the other Member State. This is 100 points of the Convention, as it encourages and promotes mutual support and trust between Member States, which is one of the pillars of effective judicial cooperation. It also cover certain forms of mutual legal assistance, such as the establishment of joint investigation teams and covert investigations.

The purpose of this recommendation is to make adjustments that include the adoption of the convention in Croatian in order to ensure as effective cooperation as possible in the international fight against crime as well as the provision of criminal justice assistance. In globalisation flows in which modern forms of serious crime enter the big door, it is important to react decisively even at the earliest stage of committing the criminal part.  I believe that this recommendation fully respects the principle of subsidiarity and justifiably adds value to the segment of international prosecution, which could not be sufficiently or remotely achieved by the Member States on their own. Serious crimes of an organised and transnational character require more effective responses in which Member States will not limit their legislation and prosecutions to ensuring only their national security, but will, through cooperation, successfully contribute to the security of other states and the world community.

The report does not recall that, on the European side as well as on the Western side, relations have been gradually more established with Russia since the 1990s, but never open comparisons of their respective needs. Moscow has rightly called for respect for human rights, but it has not been pointed out that the same anti-Russian interlocutors, financed by the West, often do not comply with the requirements of the EU acquis.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 constitutes a clear violation of international law such as the UN Charter, the Paris Charter, the Helsinki Final Document, the Budapest Memorandum in 1994. The practice of human rights violations with widespread corruption is the daily routine of this space.  The Russian leadership uses controlled state and other domestic media to drum up public support for its actions, as well as to undermine any opposition. Russia's actions are internationally unacceptable and the EU must respond to instability in the region. Ukraine needs to ensure its independence and peace for its citizens and it must be released from the firm embrace of the Russian government. Also, the EU and its member states must work to reduce energy dependency on Russian energy.  I also believe that at the moment it is necessary to seek to improve rather than destroy very poor relations between the EU and Russia. Dialogue and a clear expression of the EU's position that the other side needs to hear is needed. EU procedures should also be measured to show Russia the right path.

Firstly, the resulting and deepening tensions between the EU and Russia send a strong signal to the EU as a whole to create a fully connected, integrated and shock-resistant Energy Union as soon as possible. However, such a union can only be achieved when the political will to make difficult decisions has been found. The use of energy resources as a powerful political pressure against the EU is breaking it down, putting internal tensions at its disposal and depressing the economy. Secondly, I miss a regional approach in terms of energy security. The Commission should make concrete proposals taking into account the energy specificities of individual EU regions and assessing optimal energy mixes. One of the main works is the synchronisation of the baltic region's electricity networks with continental European networks. Thirdly, to date, the Commission has not come forward with a strategic approach to the development of nuclear energy in the European Union.

The aim is to ensure security of supply, affordable energy prices and the achievement of our climate targets at the same time. This requires a number of measures: energy efficiency must be increased and energy consumption must be reduced overall. In addition, domestic energy production is to be expanded. To this end, further investment will be made in research. We also need a fully integrated internal energy market. Energy supply has so far been decided at national level, without taking full account of the interdependence of the Member States. This will limit the EU's ability to respond as a whole to supply bottlenecks and threats to energy security. A united approach to external energy policy would give individual countries a better negotiating position. Another essential point is the diversification of energy suppliers.

However, despite a difficult geopolitical situation between the European Union and Russia, I hope that we will remain open to dialogue with this major energy partner.

The Supervisory Committee tries to improve the quality of OLAF’s activities.

Moreover, there is an ongoing dispute about the question of individual cases: according to OLAF, information on individual cases cannot be shared with the SC, certainly not when investigations are still ongoing, but also when they have been closed, and it is difficult for the SC to obtain relevant information.

OLAF receives an increasing amount of information on possible fraud and irregularities through external and internal investigations, from a wide range of sources.

Given the role of the European Anti-Fraud Office, it is extremely important that the work of this office is monitored and analysed. The public must have a quality insight into the work and operations of that body. Olaf's latest work report raised some specific questions about potential illegal phone tapping.  The Supervisory Board has requested that an analysis of the legality of the use of such research funds be carried out.

There was room for an emotional response to the problems being discussed in Hungary, which Prime Minister Orbán explained in the EP at the May plenary session. In my opinion, the issue of migration discussed in Hungary has provoked a disproportionate debate in Parliament, even if it is a serious problem and is the subject of debates between Member States and in the new Member States in particular. The European Parliament should debate calmly, not put the head of one Member State on the ground under an inadequate pretext. This attitude is detrimental and reinforces populism at a time when the European Union needs to regain the trust of its voters.

Firstly in terms of other countries where the main language that people learn to speak first is English, so that there is a disproportionate number of people who want to come to the UK. Secondly, and in particular in the case of Turkey, we see that there is there is a disproportionate imbalance in terms of wages and the wages that can be commanded. That kind of freedom works when you have people of broadly similar living standards and where you have broadly similar mentalities and cultures.

There is a lack of freedom of the press and complete freedom of the Internet, and although Turkey has committed itself to reforms to join the EU, it has still not implemented them for the ninth year. As Turkey is a strategic partner for the EU, the EU should become a fundamental democratic pillar for building democracy in Turkey by promoting universal European values for the reform process, as without democratic values Turkey's accession to the EU will be unacceptable.

Such negotiations cannot continue as long as Turkey does not meet the basic requirement to recognize the Republic of Cyprus and to end its occupation.

Turkey must respect the rights of religious minorities, take effective action against corruption, and take tougher measures to combat irregular migration.

Turkey has been officially a candidate country since 1999, and accession negotiations began in 2005.

The Turkish election campaign of the Turkish parties in Germany runs without Turkey's EU membership.

Thus the Black Sea Area has become both economically relevant and politically contested, as witness the geopolitics of the various pipelines crossing it and the efforts by Russia and Turkey to oppose outside penetration. The breaking up of the former Soviet Union and the admission of Romania and Bulgaria to both NATO and the EU have markedly transformed the political landscape, specifically compelling the EU to come up with an integrative instrument, namely the Black Sea Synergy, back in 2007. Contrary to the bureaucratic view, the initiative has had little impact in terms of fostering a regional common identity among the countries in the area, and consequently on strengthening cooperation between them. In part that was so because almost all the countries involved had more important forms of collaboration with the EU, other than the Synergy. However, the relatively reduced efficiency of the initiative is geopolitical. The area was in flux in 2007 and it still is today. After the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia, the latter’s destabilisation of eastern Ukraine and the practical inclusion of both Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Russia’s military organisation, one could say that the Black Sea Area is moving back to what it looked like two decades ago, with Russia attempting to control its northern shores, as the Soviet Union did 24 years ago. The occupation of Crimea and the current efforts to cut two territorial corridors – one from Russia towards Crimea and another from Crimea towards Transnistria – are undeniable realities. The siege of Mariupol and the destabilisation of Odessa are testimony to that. The fact is that, since the illegal annexation, Crimea has become a launching pad towards Bosnia – and the area around and beyond – due to the transformation of the initially small, defensive Russian force stationed in Sevastopol into a significant strike force equipped with long-range force-projection systems, quite apart from an aggressive programme of modernisation of the Russian Black Sea fleet. In sum, Russia has thus provided itself with a southern Kaliningrad in support of its potential expansion. Consequently, in the last year-and-a-half the Black Sea has acquired important military relevance, in addition to its existing economic relevance, which could not leave the EU uninterested, especially when both the EU security and defence strategies are being revised, making all the Union’s other interests – environment for instance – inevitably mediated by the long—term militarisation process initiated in the area. Therefore, the aim of this report is to increase the EU’s awareness of the complex situation created in the Black Sea, which could not – and should not – be either ignored or left entirely to NATO to deal with. This reality calls for responsible management of the situation in the Black Sea, but a dialogue with Russia – provided it was not misinterpreted by the latter as an encouragement to dare more – should obligatorily be accompanied by the continuation of deterrence as part of a strategic reassurance to the eastern members of both NATO and the EU, who have lost faith in Russia’s real intentions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1481, "date": "2015-06-10.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to discuss the issues related to the Black Sea. I will focus on our regional cooperation efforts and perspectives in this area. I welcome the attention that the European Parliament is giving to the Black Sea Basin. The EU has interests and responsibilities in the Black Sea region. We take an active approach to the sea basins that surround us, and the Black Sea is one of them. There are several reasons – environmental, transport, maritime affairs, civil society – for the EU to play an active role in the Black Sea region. We welcome the report by Mr Paşcu, which underlines the significant opportunities and challenges in the Black Sea area that require coordinated action. As we have mentioned on previous occasions, while there are good reasons to call for a comprehensive EU strategy for the Black Sea region, we have to make sure it will be well received both within the EU as a whole and among the non-EU Black Sea states. It must therefore come when the ground has been well prepared. The report before us focuses on the strategic military situation in the Black Sea Basin following the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol to Russia. The EU stance on this remains clear. We will not recognise the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. We continue to condemn it and to fully implement our non-recognition policy, including a trade and investment ban. The EU is assessing the security risks arising from Moscow’s behaviour, for example in the fields of energy security, cyber security, the security of civil aviation and of our banking systems, the stability of our democracies, and ways of countering the Kremlin’s propaganda. We remain prepared for the long haul in the crisis with Russia and are very conscious of the need to preserve EU unity also in the long term. We must be ready to face Moscow’s confrontation as well as its cooperative behaviour. The current EU double-track approach as regards the Ukraine conflict should be applied to EU-Russia interaction as a whole: resilience and firmness, together with dialogue and engagement. On the one hand, the EU remains steadfast in its support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. It continues to support all diplomatic efforts and in particular those linked to the implementation of the Minsk agreements and those linked to UNSC Resolution 2202. Our current efforts focus on supporting the work of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. The EU has also continued its efforts in the trilateral processes with Ukraine and Russia on energy and on the implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area as part of the EU’s support for the broader comprehensive peace process. There is no doubt that Ukraine faces immense challenges in the security, political and economic areas all at the same time. The EU is committed to bolstering Ukraine’s ability to deal with these challenges and is therefore delivering unprecedented financial support. The implementation of the EUR 11 billion support package is under way and the EU has already committed through loans and grants, including through its banks, the EIB and EBRD, around EUR 6 billion. In parallel, the EU has adopted consecutive packages of restrictive measures, including those aimed at entities in Crimea. The European Council in March explicitly linked the duration of sanctions against Russia to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements. The EU remains deeply concerned at the continuous military build-up and deterioration of the human rights situation in the Crimean peninsula, including the denial of free speech and the persecution of persons belonging to minorities. The EU continues its cooperation initiatives under the Black Sea Synergy as and where possible. As you already know, the EU’s approach to the region is guided by the Black Sea Synergy. This communication, adopted in 2007, sets out goals and tasks across a range of economic sectors and thematic areas based on the notion of the complementarity of various actors and actions. In January 2015, the EEAS and Commission services reviewed the implementation of the Black Sea Synergy and issued a joint staff working document summarising the lessons learned. This document presents a snapshot of the progress in the main fields of cooperation in the Black Sea region during the last five years. The lessons learned highlighted in the document will inform the future development of the Synergy. Stronger partnerships between the EU institutions and Member States, increasing stakeholders’ participation, and better coordination with other regional and international organisations are among the lessons that we take on board as we move forward. The results of the Black Sea Synergy to date reveal the practical utility and the potential of this EU regional policy approach. The Black Sea Synergy should remain a bottom-up initiative geared towards strengthening regional cooperation via concrete projects, making the best possible use of the wide range of tools at the EU’s disposal. An important goal is to bring added value to the citizens of the region, while ensuring environmental sustainability. Also, we have a substantial programme of cross-border cooperation in the Black Sea region. There are projects underway to strengthen monitoring capacities of the Black Sea marine environment as well as in the areas of research, tourism and culture. We do all that while increasingly engaging with the civil society and other regional stakeholders. Last but not least, the EU’s recently-adopted Maritime Security Strategy and its associated action plan looks at maritime security in all the sea basins around us, including the Black Sea, in a cross-sectoral way. As called for by the report, this will help us to address maritime security challenges in an integrated manner, combining civil and military involvement at national and EU level across the numerous policy sectors concerned. The EU needs to remain closely attuned to its interests in the region, including strategic, political and economic interests, and to further discuss how best they can be achieved. On military issues as, very rightly, the report insists upon, we are maintaining and possibly even strengthening close contact with NATO at both political and working level. In its conclusions of 18 May, the Council welcomed ongoing efforts to strengthen strategic and practical cooperation between the EU and NATO, with the overall objective of building a true organisation-to-organisation relationship. In this endeavour, we count on the support of the European Parliament, and we look forward to views and ideas from the Members of this House.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1482, "date": "2015-06-10.json", "name": "Gabrielius LANDSBERGIS", "mepid": "124759", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, the situation in the Black Sea basin has fundamentally changed due to Russian aggression against Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea by Russia. The military balance has significantly shifted towards entrenchment of Russian military dominance in the Black Sea. There is a country in the region, a neighbour of the EU, which used to benefit from cooperation with European democracies but which, for many years, has been steadily preparing itself for military endeavours instead. We used to close our eyes to this tendency. Experts estimate that since 2009, Putin has increased defence spending in roubles more than 20 times over. We all know the economic and social challenges Russia now faces, but this does not stop Putin spending up to 34% of the national budget on defence and security. Too many European NATO member states do not manage even 2%. There are new realities for the countries of the region, and they are not the reflection of a greater peace. Russia is testing the boundaries of our security. It is up to the EU and NATO to make it clear to Russia that in the current world you cannot send tanks or amass military forces whenever you think things are not going your way. You cannot bully your neighbours or tear independent states apart. The annexation of Crimea will never be recognised, and the Minsk Agreement must be implemented. The EU must stay firm on this principle because, if the trend is not stopped in Ukraine, the limits of our security will be tested further. The military balance in the Black Sea region may be restored by strengthening our transatlantic link and by a bigger NATO presence and increased cooperation under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) but, in addition, we should help threatened countries to take more responsibility for security in their region. Countries that have the most direct security concerns, due to the changed realities, could combine their efforts by creating a joint military battalion for military exercises, increasing interoperability and furthering modernisation.

The second problem is that our group thinks that this Parliament's Security Committee is not really a NATO parliamentary assembly, and if the report too strongly emphasises NATO's role in restoring the strategic balance of the Black Sea, then we are perhaps wrong.

As a result, the EU is now deeply embroiled in a highly complex and dangerous standoff with Russia which it cannot hope to win. Due to the EU’s previous empire-building ambitions in Ukraine, this organisation now has little moral legitimacy to take any action, either diplomatically or militarily, without the risk of further stoking the fires of conflict in the region. This is why I am today calling for a strategy of intervention and the promotion of peace, to be developed and implemented by a non-state, non-partisan actor such as the UN in order to avoid a potentially catastrophic, multinational, military engagement. While I condemn the EU for its actions in Ukraine, I must also make it clear that I equally condemn Russia's President Putin for his own expansionist ambitions in the Black Sea region. I can only hope that through skilful negotiation and diplomacy, conducted by a competent independent arbiter, a multinational war can be averted. Ukraine needs the opportunity to take control of its own internal affairs to achieve its ambition of becoming a sustainable and united democracy. Given the opportunity, I am convinced Ukraine can develop into a strong, independent, politically free, and defendable nation that can freely trade on both sides of the current divide and with the rest of the world.

And to point out that if the European Commission does not update its Black Sea Synergy after this report, we will end up with neither security nor energy but just another piece of paper. In this context, I would like to welcome President Poroshenko's decision to denounce the five agreements between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on the transit of Ukrainian territory by Russian military forces in the breakaway region of Transnistria of the Republic of Moldova and to point out that these laws were adopted on 21 May. I would also like to mention that these agreements, although they did not apply in practice, the transports were carried out against the will of the Ukrainian State. As a result of this reality, 1,500 Russian special forces (Spetsnaz) are in Transnistria. Russia is likely to intend to build an air bridge. In the same context of the excellent Paşcu report, I raise the issue of the vulnerability of critical energy infrastructure in the Black Sea basin, now and in the future.

Moldova, which recently opted for rapprochement with Europe, is subject to a strong Russian embargo and is being torn apart internally as a result of an efficient Russian propaganda machine. In the southern region of Gagauzia, Russian speakers are pushing for an annexation by Russia. There are also Russian troops in Transnistria, officially to keep the peace, but today they are an ideal start for the Kremlin to extend a land corridor from Crimea to Odessa and on to Transnistria. The Russian intervention in Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008 was supposedly intended to protect the Russian-speaking minority. Putin wants to use the same pubic patch in the areas around Odessa and Marioepol and the man does not feel much sorry for the minorities.

There is also a people who, in accordance with international law, freely chose their return to the Russian homeland. A homeland he should never have left.

This is a clear indication that Russia considers us not as partners but as adversaries to be weakened, split and compromised. Following the annexation of Crimea, Russia is creating an offensive strike force in the region. In fact, Crimea is becoming a Kaliningrad of the south, with all the consequences of that. The rapid enhancement of offensive Russian military potential is a real threat and security risk for all the neighbouring countries, not just Ukraine. What is happening, by the way, is not a surprise. After the Russian invasion of Georgia seven years ago, the confrontational military pattern became obvious to all who wanted to see it. In fact, the EU has been lagging behind in its reactions. That is why Mr Paşcu’s report is so important and timely. The Mistral assault helicopter carriers symbolically connect the Georgian invasion with the Ukrainian one because, just after the war against Georgia, Mr Putin ordered these modern French-built warships, and the commander of the Black Sea fleet commented that if they had had these vessels at their disposal, they could have completed the Georgian operation in half a day instead of three days. That is why the message of this report is also to France to abandon, unequivocally and finally, the sale of the ships in question to Russia. They could well be used for enhancing the security of the EU borders.

Unfortunately, the Minsk agreement remained, for the most part, just a dead letter on paper. That is why it is high time for Russia in particular to take responsibility and help stop hostilities and thus prevent new casualties and destruction. I support the consistent approach of not recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea, its commitment to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. At the same time, I am committed to continuing to discuss such a necessary peace settlement actively and constructively. The European Union and Russia will become partners again then and when the preconditions for partnership are met – a relationship of proven trust, respect for international principles and signed agreements. The report also covered an extremely important energy dimension and calls for the promotion of energy security as well as the reduction of Member States' energy dependency. In doing so, the Member States of the European Union should also ensure through their measures the necessary security of the exploitation of oil and gas, i.e. their safe transport in the Black Sea area. This was because the Black Sea basin is extremely environmentally sensitive and the increasing militarization of the region further threatens this sensitive ecosystem. Russia's policy of strengthening offensive military forces in the Black Sea and the planned strengthening and modernisation of the Black Sea fleet are the best reminder that the Black Sea basin should be a real priority in european union foreign policy action. This should be added to the possibility of a new escalation of the Transnistria/Transnistria conflict, which would constitute an overflow of war from Ukraine. The existing Black Sea synergy is outdated, which is why I am joining calls on the Commission to develop as soon as possible a new comprehensive European Union strategy for Black Sea space.

Unfortunately, then there was no European determination. If all European leaders had adopted an attitude such as President Lech Kaczynski, who was then accused of anti-Russianism, perhaps the situation in Ukraine would not have been so dramatic today and Russia would have been much more cautious in its expansionist efforts. That is why it is so important today for the Union to take a firm stance – factual, not just verbal, non-appeasing of the annexation of Crimea and a firm response to what is happening in the Black Sea basin.

Unfortunately, all these events show the weakness of the European institutions, the institutions of the democratic world. I call for greater consistency, for dialogue with those countries that may be partners for us, for ukraine to be assisted, for the support of those countries that are counting on Europe – a modern Europe, a democratic Europe.

Mr President, many States of the Union are unwittingly involved in geopolitical games of influence between NATO, the European Union and the Eurasian Union. The effort to expand NATO and the Union to the Caucasus, Moldova and Ukraine, the energy hybrid and electronic war in the Baltic region and the countries of the Aimos peninsula, the sanctions against Russia, Crimea, are made in the context of the incessant struggle for power and lead by the powerful players of the above organizations. Let us first point out the fact that the annexation, or better so reunification, of Crimea with Russia is not illegal because that is what the People of Crimea wanted, and it is also proving to be historic. The other Baltic countries, under the pretext of supposedly bad Russia, fell into the trap of Germany's foreign and economic policy, as dictated by the US. Thus, they were forced into a harsh internal devaluation, extremely painful for their citizens, in order to be able to maintain their stable connection with the euro, and without any support whatsoever from the euro area. When Europe's strong economic and more central geopolitical countries such as Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom did not adopt the euro, the Baltic countries were quick to submit to German hegemony, granting their national sovereignty through their entrapment in the common currency. Anyone with a common mind understands that additional sanctions on Russia and discussions of military presence and flexible retribution lead to an escalation of the crisis and in no way benefit the European Union.

The illegal annexation of Crimea and the clustering of military Russian equipment there led to a change in the balance of power in the Black Sea Basin.

The expansion of the conflict from eastern Ukraine to the south threatens to encompass regions populated by a compact and Bulgarian minority in Zaporozhka and Odessa Oblast, as well as to affect Moldova, where a large Bulgarian community also lives. We also need to keep a closer eye on the rights of other minorities in annexed territories, in particular local Crimean Tatars, who are persecuted for their support for Ukraine's territorial integrity. The same applies to the rest of the population in Crimea, as well as to the population of Luhansk and Donetsk region, which increasingly face a violation of human rights.  We have a duty to work to secure new energy suppliers and reduce our dependence on Russian supplies not only of words, but finally of the share. This is particularly concerned with Eastern Europe, such as Bulgaria. We need a pipeline like Nabucco, so I categorically state that we need to start thawing the project. Nabucco, or pipeline, which also passes through Bulgaria, is a chance for Europe.  Dependencies, however, are not only energy, but also corrupt, dear colleagues.

It is vital that the Member States of the EU work together, both within our Union and NATO, to meet what is a very real and concerning military threat to our security. At this juncture, I take the opportunity to highlight the difficulties that those in the Crimea are now facing. There are soaring food prices and water shortages, and these are just part of the daily struggle that people are facing under Russian occupation. As feared, the Crimean tatars are being persecuted by the Russians, and ethnic Ukrainians are being expelled from the territory, with an increasing incidence of arrests, raids and police interrogations of their populations being reported. We have also seen incidents of violence against the Jewish population and their property. Indeed, in just the first week of the annexation, a synagogue was vandalised with swastikas.

The European Union's Black Sea security strategy needs to be redefined and strengthened. This is necessary as a result of the change in the strategic landscape in the area, so that we can talk about an increase in the capacity to respond to developments in the neighbourhood, which seriously affect European security. The illegal annexation of Crimea, the numerous conflicts frozen by Russia in the region, but especially the arming and strengthening of its military capabilities, both strategically and tactically, are likely to prompt a strong reaction from the European Union and the United States of America. The eastern borders of the European Union, including Romania and Poland, as well as the Baltic States, are under increasing pressure. I therefore appreciate that the sanctioning regime applied to the Russian Federation must be continued and strengthened. Member States must remain further united, in one voice, in Russia's hybrid war against Ukraine, and show solidarity and commitment in sanctioning actions that contravene the rules of international law. Energy security is used today by the Russian Federation as a real weapon, but we draw its attention that, however much Member States depend on this dimension, they will never accept the violation of the basic principles of security in Europe. I believe that we should consider, with all responsibility and seriousness, the possibility of providing Ukraine with defensive military means, but not only, so that we can talk about a real strengthening of its defence capacity, as a guarantee for the preservation of peace and security in the region, until it is too late. The US has shown its readiness for this, and high-land states can make an important contribution if they join efforts. Thus, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia must consider the possibility of more sustained cooperation, including in the military field.

This, of course, has had traumatic consequences for the Russians and has led them to adopt a series of behaviours which are obviously unacceptable and which have been the subject of due condemnation by vast sectors of the international community, the United Nations, the European Union.

These two pose new security threats to the European Union and to our eastern neighbours. The European Union is now only some 100 kilometres away from the war in eastern Ukraine and less than 300 kilometres away from Crimea. This of course brings us to the point where we need to build a new comprehensive EU strategy for the Black Sea region which corresponds to the new challenges. The current approach of the European Union in the region is outdated. The fact is that we were able neither to prevent Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008, the war in Ukraine or the annexation of Crimea, nor to provide suitable responses, and we have also not been able to provide solutions to the frozen conflicts in the region. I expect the High Representative/Vice-President to come up with a comprehensive strategy addressing the new security challenges in the region in the near future. The fact is that Russia is increasing its military spending and is ready to pursue military actions which we, the European Union, are of course not ready to pursue. We are a project for freedom, and this is one of the fundamental achievements of 70 years of European integration. We should of course never jeopardise this fundamental achievement. Precisely because of this, we should act in a way which prevents escalation in the region and not only addresses it, which would mean an additional level of escalation. We should also take into account the military, reputational and financial risks which the Russian Federation is ready to take to keep the region insecure and, basically, to prevent the Black Sea region from becoming an area governed by the rule of law, a prosperous and a secure region.

I think the summit has an enormous and strategic importance as well. As you know, the College is a college in which one Commissioner can replace another Commissioner. I think it has been a really fruitful and very helpful debate and exchange. It was very helpful for the EU in forming its policy towards the Black Sea Basin. Let me just make a general remark and then some detailed remarks on the issues you just raised during the debate. Generally, we can say that the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sebastopol by the Russian Federation created a threat, a very dangerous situation, which is a direct challenge to international security, with grave implications for the international legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states. The EU will remain committed to fully implementing its non-recognition policy, including through restrictive measures. On the other hand, if and when a sustainable solution to the Ukraine conflict is found, we will obviously need to adjust and recalibrate our relationship with Russia. We should be ready to engage with that country. We cannot let dividing lines and lasting rifts split our continent. Some honourable Members just raised the issue of energy policy and complained about the lack of action at European level regarding the independence and diversification of resources under energy policy. Let me simply say that the European Commission and the Council have just adopted the communication on the Energy Union. Vice–President Šefčovič is travelling to Central Asia to have negotiations there in order to help diversification for central European and EU countries and the EU Member States generally. We are implementing the Third Energy Package, which aims to bring about independence and diversification in energy policy as well. Others raise the issue of human rights in Crimea. While obviously it is a difficult situation, and we have difficulties and independent NGOs have difficulties in gaining access to Crimea, we can say that High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini is supporting the Council of Europe’s efforts in making the situation more stable and more developed in human rights there. She is supporting Commissioner Muižnieks’s efforts in that area. We have condemned the violation of rights, notably (but not only) of Tatars in Crimea. Some of you raised the issue of the European Security Strategy. Yes, we need a review of the European Security Strategy. It is on its way and we are absolutely relying on your cooperation on that procedure. We look forward to working closely with you and the Member States on the review of the European Security Strategy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1553, "date": "2015-06-10.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, I would first like to say that the report is based on facts and realities. Some of it comes directly from Russian open sources, so there is no point in denying it. A second observation I would like to make is that there are no ample references, due to the title and the subject of the report, either to the legal aspects – which have been touched upon by some of my colleagues – or to the human rights situation, as has also been mentioned here. All I would like to say here is that there were no human rights problems before, when Crimea belonged to Ukraine; but now there are, after Crimea was annexed illegally by Russia, with the Tatars. So I think we should bear that in mind. Some of our colleagues have mentioned that the NATO enlargement, which was disrespecting a pledge made to Mr Gorbachev – it was mentioned that he said so – was the cause of what has happened with respect to Ukraine. I would say that even the vision of Mr Gorbachev that there was a pledge that NATO should not enlarge is ignoring the sovereign will of the countries, because we wanted to get into NATO. Probably he meant to say that NATO should not have accepted our decisions, but that is exactly what the Warsaw Pact used to be like. I participated in one of the last meetings of the Warsaw Pact and I participated in NATO, so I know the difference between them. Anyone coming into the Chamber – probably visitors up there – and listening to our debate would believe that we have seen two different movies. We saw a movie in which Russia is occupying foreign territory through force and transforming it into a stronghold. Others have seen a poor, defenceless, peace-loving Russia defending itself against conquest by NATO and the EU. That is not acceptable.

However, I believe that recent serious events in the country fully justify our addressing this issue once again this afternoon. As Commissioner Mimica said when he addressed this House in April, it is important for Burundians to know that they have champions in the outside world supporting their ambitions to achieve long-term democracy and resilience. That can only be done with consistent and continuous attention to the needs and aspirations of citizens, not least their human rights and fundamental freedoms. Since the last debate in this House there have been a number of developments which unfortunately give rise to considerable concern on the part of the EU. You already know that the decision of the ruling party to nominate President Nkurunziza as a presidential candidate promoted a serious division across society and across politics. The situation deteriorated rapidly with the attempted coup on 13 May. The EU condemned the attempted coup. Indeed, we deplore any act of political violence. This is unequivocally not the way to encourage the openness and transparency which Burundi needs to navigate this crisis in a spirit of consensus and reconciliation. The international community, including the European Union, has obviously been faced with a very challenging situation. As High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini said in her statement following the events of 13 May, our first thoughts must be with the citizens of the country. Their security and safety is paramount, and it is essential the situation does not spin out of control. These concerns also encompass the regional aspect. From a humanitarian point of view, since the political crisis erupted in Burundi, the wave of refugees fleeing Burundi has been ongoing and increasing in intensity over recent weeks. As of today, almost 100 000 people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries: Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. The Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department is closely monitoring the situation and has already released EUR 1.5 million to meet the immediate needs of Burundian refugees arriving in Rwanda last month. Additional humanitarian aid is being considered to cater for the specific needs of refugees hosted in Tanzania, including health assistance to stop the possible surge of diseases and epidemics, notably cholera. I would like to turn now to the political situation and to our reaction. The EU has been supporting Burundi in its efforts to entrench democracy since the Arusha Agreements put an end to years of civil war and laid the foundations for a new era. This year’s legislative and presidential elections were to be a key step in cementing the long-term democratic development of Burundi. That is why High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini decided to deploy an EU Election Observation Mission, led by the chief observer David Martin MEP. At this point I would like to pay tribute to the dedication and commitment shown by Mr Martin and his team during these difficult weeks. Overall, we remain convinced that respect for the Arusha Peace Agreement is key for the further stability of Burundi. This is the overarching principle we all need to follow. We cannot ignore the fact that the third-term issue is at the origin and the centre of the crisis, and we continue to urge all, including the President, to put the higher interests of the country first. In order to preserve the best chances for the election to succeed, there is a need for a broad consensus on the issue. The idea of the electoral observation mission and of our financial support to the elections was to contribute to an inclusive, transparent, peaceful, credible and fair process that will give confidence to the political actors and electorate and would ensure acceptance of the outcome. This remains our objective, but, to reach that objective, some minimal conditions needed to be met. Unfortunately, our assessment was that these conditions were not in place. In particular, we noted continuing restrictions on independent media and freedom of expression and assembly, excessive use of force against demonstrators, a climate of intimidation for opposition parties and civil society, and a lack of confidence in the election authorities. Developments in the last few days have done nothing to ease our concerns. For this reason we suspended the Electoral Observation Mission and, indeed, our financial support for the elections. We are not alone in questioning the credibility of the elections. Last week, the Catholic Church decided to withdraw from the process and two members of the Election Commission resigned. The African Union (AU) and the East African Community (EAC) are also refraining from sending an electoral observation mission at the moment. But this is not the end of the story. If domestic stakeholders agree on acceptable conditions for holding the elections, then we are ready to redeploy the actual observation mission and support the process. This means we now need to concentrate on getting those conditions in place. All parties should engage in good faith in a dialogue to restore the necessary conditions for democratic elections and, primarily, the government of Burundi should reach out to all domestic stakeholders by restoring confidence through concrete measures. The EU supports all efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the political crisis in Burundi and especially the work of the East African Community, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, and the African Union. As you are aware, the East African Community convened an emergency summit in Dar Es Salam on 31 May. I would like to take up some of the conclusions of that summit, because they are important to our approach in the weeks ahead. We join the East African Community in praising the work of UN Special Envoy, Said Djinnit. In difficult circumstances Mr Djinnit has been facilitating a political dialogue, which is the only way forward. He has our full confidence and it is important that all forces support his efforts. On 5 June the spokesperson of High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini issued a statement calling on all parties in the dialogue to work with Mr Djinnit and with the envoys of the African Union and the East African Community in order to find a consensus on the road ahead. This is the message we are giving out locally, as well as internationally. We have supported the East African Community’s call for a postponement of the elections and we take note that earlier today a presidential decree was signed fixing a new calendar for the elections. But this timetable will not be relevant unless it is accompanied by urgent and serious efforts to build consensus and to take all the steps needed to make the elections credible. It is therefore vital now that the East African Community’s conclusions should be followed up with concrete action. This includes a cessation of violence by all parties and the disarming of youth militias. Conditions proposed by the EAC to ensure safety and respect for fundamental freedoms need to be followed up. It is first and foremost for the government to ensure these conditions are met, and to stop the violence. Obviously the EU will need to review its options in the longer term, but I want to stress the delicacy of the current moment. Delivering successful elections will not be an easy task. All Burundi’s partners need to support African efforts, led by the EAC and the AU, and focus their efforts on calming the political climate. We do this while reminding Burundi and Burundians of the principles which matter to us and to our partnership. The Cotonou Agreement is absolutely clear on the need to respect human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law as essential elements. We must keep this in mind but, at the same time, we need to leave space for Burundians with their regional and African partners to find viable solutions to be current crisis. I want to end by reiterating an important point made by Commissioner Mimica last month. In the current climate, the Commission has to plan for all possible scenarios and, of course, to consider the adoption of possible additional measures, including those related to EU development cooperation with Burundi. But in all these considerations, we need to give attention to the impact which different measures could have on the extremely poor population and thereby the stability of an already fragile country. I look forward very much to hearing the views of the honourable Members.

After years of civil war in that country, which has killed 300,000 people, Burundi took a tentative path towards stabilisation and democratization in 2005. With the elections to Parliament and a new President this year, the country, which is still one of the poorest in the world, should take a major step towards greater democracy, the rule of law and greater security for its citizens. The EU was prepared, as the Commissioner said, to support this process and has already allocated EUR 6 million to conduct the elections. An EU and European Parliament election observation mission was ready to accompany the conduct of the elections. The announcement by current President Nkurunziza that he will run for a third term in defiance of Burundi's constitution appears to jeopardise all efforts to hold free and fair elections in Burundi. Civil society demonstrations in the capital Bujumbura are being violently suppressed, more than twenty people have already died, and more than 100 000 Burundian citizens, many of them children, have fled and left the country. And the youth organization of the president's party, Imbonerakure , terrorizes all people suspected of being in opposition to the ruling party. A military coup has already failed, and the compromise between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups found in the Arusha Treaty threatens to be dissolved. Influential institutions, such as the Catholic Church, have withdrawn from the preparation of the electoral process. The summit of the East African Community, also mentioned by the Commissioner, has recommended a postponement of the elections. However, this summit did not take a position on Nkurunziza's desire to run for a third term, which can, of course, now also pose a threat to the whole region, because next year there will be elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Rwanda in 2017. And there, too, presidents could run unconstitutionally for a third term. At the same time, many refugees from Burundi are now becoming a burden on neighbouring Congo, Rwanda and Tanzania. As the European Union, we should act in cooperation with the United Nations and the African Union states and do everything we can to ensure that free elections can be held in Burundi this year. There are possibilities for influence. We could stop the financial contributions to the Government of Burundi so far; we should, however, help the refugees in the refugee camps. And we should maintain our will to support a democratic electoral process in Burundi.

It is clear that the instability in Burundi is not the fault of its neighbours, and its neighbours should not pay the price of that instability. So any assistance we can give is very welcome. Can I also thank the Commissioner for his kind comments on my role as the Chief Observer and reciprocate by saying that, while in Burundi, I was very impressed by the level of engagement of both the External Action Service and the Commission in trying to find constructive solutions to the very serious problems that Burundi faces. While I was there, Article 8 discussions took place and Article 96 actions were seriously considered, so I welcome the fact that we are fully engaged in the country. As the Commissioner has said, the immediate cause of the unrest in Burundi is the decision of President Nkurunziza to try to seek a third term, and that is clearly – no matter what he has forced his own constitutional court to say – in breach of the Arusha Agreement. And the consequence of his attempt to achieve a third term has been violence on the streets – not by the demonstrators, but by government-backed militias, the Imbonerakure – who have tried to put down these peaceful demonstrations and forced demonstrators off the streets. The first thing that needs to happen in Burundi is that the official security services need to rein in this unofficial militia. The second thing, if we are going to have real elections in Burundi, is there has to be space for the opposition to campaign, and in the short 5-day period I spent there, it was clear to me that government-backed parties were able to hold rallies and encourage supporters, while any attempt by the opposition to get public space was ruthlessly put down. A third thing that needs to happen – and the Commissioner mentioned this – is we need to make sure that the media is reopened. I have to say, I saw a level of cynicism I have rarely seen anywhere when, on the one hand, firstly they banned the radio stations and refused them permission to broadcast, then in the attempted coup, the radio stations were blown up and it was impossible for them to broadcast, and then the government said ‘now you are free to broadcast’ – having destroyed the facilities needed to actually carry out any broadcasting. So the conditions for credible elections do not look good; they need to be restored. I understand today Burundi has announced that the elections will now take place on 29 June and 15 July.

Moreover, in order to legitimize repression, the authorities said that the demonstrations were now equated with an insurrection against the legal order. Finally, what seems even more serious to me, we are awakening the ethnic fibre, knowing that 21 years ago, this phenomenon had caused real tragedies and a real catastrophe. Secondly, I had the opportunity to participate in the Arusha Agreements in 2001, on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, and I can say that Mr Nkurunziza's decision to take part in these presidential elections is clearly totally contrary to the Arusha agreements. So in my opinion, he's disqualified. What should the Commission do? I believe that we really have the opportunity to be effective and that the European Union must strongly announce that the government that would be the result of elections held under such illegal conditions would not be recognised by our institutions. We must demand an immediate end to the indiscriminate repression of opponents, the immediate opening of the media space, the return to the country of opposition leaders in exile, the unconditional release of all political prisoners and an immediate end to harassment against civil society. There is also a need to threaten to close bank accounts held abroad by those responsible for cracking down on protesters, and to explicitly raise the threat of international legal action.

Madam President, since our last debate, after President Nkurunziza's announcement that he intends to run for a third term, the violence has continued to escalate: several dozen deaths are to be deplored and more than 90,000 Burundians have fled the country, with journalists and opposition leaders being the first victims. Zedi Feruzi, leader of a small opposition party, was murdered on 23 May.  Today, the main opposition leaders are either abroad or in hiding. The elections were postponed in extremis at the beginning of June. The electoral commission has published a new timetable that will not solve anything. This commission is totally disqualified since two of its members are on the run and it has to make its decisions by a majority of four-fifths. The opposition immediately rejected the new timetable and laid down several conditions for the upcoming elections, including the establishment of a new electoral commission and the disarmament of pro-government militias, including imbonerakure. The Burundian authorities are hiding behind institutional shams, claiming that, for constitutional reasons, elections can no longer be postponed.  Has the international community mobilized sufficiently? Of course, the EAC has called for the elections to be postponed. Does the European Union's electoral mission still make sense? Can it still declare itself ready to deploy if the necessary conditions for peaceful, inclusive and credible elections are met? In view of this violence and this timetable, it is impossible.  The UN special envoy is increasingly in dispute and the Burundian authorities remain deaf. Arusha's fragile balance is more threatened than ever and the country is in danger of falling into civil war again. The rise of tensions is indeed accompanied by disturbing ethnicist discourse.

It is, once again, the result of an autocrat's rigid adherence to power. The election has now been postponed due to pressure from the regional organisations EAC. This is a success for the EAC. But it does not solve the fundamental problem of the president's bid for a third term. And this adherence to this third term also threatens the peace process in Burundi. After all, under the Arusha Agreement, only one re-election is possible. The question now remains: what can the international community do here? It must monitor more closely the Burundian media, especially the International Criminal Court. And it must pay particular attention to the media, which, as in Rwanda in 1994, is fuelling this ethnic problem, this hatred of peoples, which also exists in Burundi between Tutsi and Hutu. This ethnic tension must not be further fuelled by the media. The International Court of Justice should also launch an investigation into the serious human rights violations in Burundi, especially on the part of the government militias. Simple condemnation by the international community does not help here. Commissioner, you mentioned Cotonou. Through Cotonou, we would now have the opportunity to suspend development aid, as Mr Zeller said. What is your position on this? Does the Commission intend to convert budget aid into direct humanitarian aid, for example? As you have said, we need money for the refugees here, we need money for the fight against cholera. The money could be taken from budget support in order to put pressure on the government in Burundi. If we put extra money in, I hardly believe that this will put pressure on the Burundian Government.

Of course, at least we can say that the police and the army are reacting in an acceptable way, that the more balanced composition between the Tutsis and the Hutu is nullifying Nkurunziza's attempts to foment an ethnic conflict, recalling the spectres of genocide. The Arusha agreements, at least in this one they are holding, but at the collapse of the country tested by galloping inflation, with no more cash in the cash for the attacks and with more than 100,000 refugees and with an army very soon, without pay, it is a collapse that is just around the corner. The report of our mission tells us that in truth no credible dialogue is standing between the current government and the opposition: too weak and fragmented. In Dar es Salaam, African and Eastern leaders have been too ambiguous and hesy, and the real defenders of democracy are only civil society activists. Nkurunziza's arrogant claim is based precisely on this timidity, on this pavidity, them and ours.  Because if Nkurunziza knew that we are all cohesive about not recognizing him in Europe, America and Africa, maybe he would side with it. If there were strict and inflexible conditionality, then credible and democratic elections would be allowed. Sometimes taking time also means wasting time and we don't have this time.

Madam President, you must protect the Members of us who are on the floor.

Why did they want to suspend a debate about Burundi, when people in Burundi are dying for democracy? They're a disgrace to this House. (Applause) Madam President, we want democratic elections to be held in Burundi, but there have been no conditions for that to happen: it has not been possible. Elections in Burundi are very important for Burundi, but they are also important for the region, for the entire region.  From here I would like to congratulate the work of our representation in Burundi, our Ambassador, the High Representative, our technical observers and also our colleague David Martin, who have been able to assess the real situation in the country: a situation of harassment of the opposition, of absolute blockade of the free media; an impossible situation in which more than forty people have already died and, at the moment, there are one hundred thousand refugees who have gone to neighbouring countries, for fear of repression.  The president is responsible for all this. The President, who has clearly violated the Arusha Agreements; the President, who has decided that his own political career is more important than the life and freedom of his citizens.  The Constitution is down, and the Arusha Agreements are down.  The European Union has to be firm. If we agreed that the President could not be re-introduced, the President cannot re-introduce himself. And it is therefore unacceptable that we continue with this escalation, which we have not managed to stop eer the European Union, the African Union, or the United Nations. We are failing because the Burundians are dying—even though that makes the EFDD Group's colleagues quite laugh, that is what is happening.  We need to act quickly and we need to concentrate our financial assistance on sustaining civil society, all those who are fighting justly to ensure that the Arusha Agreements are respected: European Union money must go to sustain that civil society. And we also need to activate restrictive measures, interrupt visas, intervene on the current accounts of the Burundiese elite that is blocking democratic development. But this afternoon I have to regret that, if the Burundians have seen this session, we are ashamed of the image that the European Union has given this afternoon with regard to Burundi: people playing with the Rules of Procedure to block a debate like this; people who don't believe in the European Union; people who don't believe in democracy; people who have been laughing, screaming to block out a decent debate, which is what this House has to have. I thank you, Madam President, for the patience you have had and I hope that in Burundi today you will know that, in addition to some groups that have come to break the union, there are many others who are here to defend the values of the European Union, which also contemplate solidarity with the countries suffering. (Applause) Madam President, we want democratic elections to be held in Burundi, but there have been no conditions for that to happen: it has not been possible. Elections in Burundi are very important for Burundi, but they are also important for the region, for the entire region.  From here I would like to congratulate the work of our representation in Burundi, our Ambassador, the High Representative, our technical observers and also our colleague David Martin, who have been able to assess the real situation in the country: a situation of harassment of the opposition, of absolute blockade of the free media; an impossible situation in which more than forty people have already died and, at the moment, there are one hundred thousand refugees who have gone to neighbouring countries, for fear of repression.  The president is responsible for all this. The President, who has clearly violated the Arusha Agreements; the President, who has decided that his own political career is more important than the life and freedom of his citizens.  The Constitution is down, and the Arusha Agreements are down.  The European Union has to be firm.

I heard colleagues over there talking about what happened to their grandparents 50-70 years ago in Europe. I am afraid that human rights abuses, torture and oppression are realities now in Burundi today. That is what we are here to talk about. I wonder what the people of Burundi must think when they see a debate about a very serious situation in their country being used to make a cheap political point by people over there. Let us go back to this very serious debate. I hope some of you will think hard about that, and maybe think about the people of Burundi, for whom this debate is extremely important because it is about their country and their aspiration to live in the kind of democracy that you and I are lucky enough to live in. Commissioner, I apologise to you as well on behalf this House because you have come here to give us a very good statement, a very clear statement, which covers all the essential aspects of the situation in Burundi. Since we last spoke about it, things are clearly not better.  As chair of the Committee on Development, I have received first-hand information from people on the ground about what is happening – about the human rights abuses, about the youth militias linked to the government which are causing violence, about the intimidation and all the issues that our colleagues have spoken about, and about the real hardship and the suffering that is being caused by the instability in the country, with people fleeing over borders. I am pleased, as the Chair of the committee, that we have stepped up humanitarian aid –unlike UKIP, who do not seem to think that people need that aid – people in Rwanda, in Tanzania, in DRC, where people have fled their country. Last month, Commissioner Mimica reminded us that the EU is a major donor to Burundi, a country which comes 180th out of 187 on the Human Development Index. In the last EDF programme we doubled our aid to Burundi. I know that people here are asking whether we should continue aiding that country in this period. I do not think that poor people should ever pay the price for the folly of their own government. We should remind the Government of Burundi of its responsibilities in respect of human rights under the Cotonou Agreement and remind it that the Council did adopt conclusions on this on 18 May, and the Government should be clear that we are looking at what we can do, because we want the elections to take place. I want to join others who have commended the work of our chief observer, David Martin, in the last few weeks; he has been working with my other colleagues. We want democracy in Burundi. We want the elections to take place under decent conditions. There are a few weeks now to put things right.

Is Burundi the other Rwanda? The current crisis is marked by an eminently political trait: it is the intention to perpetuate itself in the power of its President, against what is established by the Burundiese Constitution and the Arusha Peace Agreements, which has led to this conflict. And do you have anything to say about it? Do you have anything to do? The Rwandan genocide was not only ethnic in nature, but also political in nature. Kofi Annan bitterly regretted, ten years ago, the international inaction, his inability to stop the genocide, which ended with 800,000 men, women and children.

We must think of Burundi, as we thought of the Maasai, as we thought of the illegal immigrants in Burma and we do not think of europe's illegal immigrants.  But do not be ashamed to talk about things that make no sense in relation to what Europeans are asking us to do, what young people, the elderly and businesses are asking us to do!

It is said to be the only truly international language. Sport opens doors, brings people and communities together and bridges divides. For us Europeans, any discussion of sport is first and foremost associated with discussion about football. Albert Camus used to say: ‘What I know about morals, I owe to football.’ For that reason it is all the more unfortunate to hear that sport is being used for criminal purposes. FIFA, born in Europe a little over 100 years ago, has not only gone global, but the events it organises are watched by millions, and sometimes billions, of people. As we speak, the FIFA Women’s World Cup is ongoing in Canada. These events are a source of hope for boys and girls around the world. Such events cannot be undermined by continual suspicions of criminal activities. Illegal betting and match fixing have been making the headlines in recent years. But who could have imagined that the scale of organised crime was so massive. Football is not only a game; it is also an economic activity, creating jobs and attracting investments. As in every economic sector, a sound and transparent basis is needed. For all these reasons, it is important that trust be re—established. The Council and its Presidency have been following the recent developments within football’s governing body, FIFA, with great attention and concern. The context in which we must address this issue is important. The responsibility for good governance and the proper functioning of sporting organisations lies with the international sports bodies themselves and not with governments or EU institutions. However, given the importance of sport to citizens, and of football in particular, it is clear that standards of governance in international sporting organisations are an area of legitimate concern. As far as the EU is concerned, the Lisbon Treaty introduced a new specific competence in the field of sport. It is noteworthy that Article 165 of the Treaty mentions the moral integrity of sport in particular. The Council has paid specific attention to the issue of how sporting organisations are governed and run. In May 2011, the Council adopted a first EU work plan for sport. It established an expert group to address the issue of good governance, which agreed a set of ‘Principles of Good Governance in Sport’. These principles identify the key elements necessary to ensure public and stakeholder confidence in the organisations responsible for sport. Even if the role of the EU is limited to facilitating exchanges of good practice, transfers of knowledge and networking of stakeholders at national and international level, the EU institutions have a role to play in ensuring that good governance principles adopted at EU level are recognised and implemented in all EU Member States. The EU can also facilitate the promotion of principles of good governance in sport beyond its borders, with both the sporting bodies and the public authorities of third countries. Honourable Members, I would like to quote European Council President Tusk. In the context of the recent G7 meeting in Germany, he said: ‘I am really satisfied that some leaders want to use the summit to discuss corruption, including the recent FIFA scandal. We do not need empty declarations against corruption but we have to be ready to fight against those who were corrupted and those who corrupt. We need to fight corruption in all its dimensions, no matter how powerful the authors of these disgraceful practices are.’ I would like to highlight the work done by the EU on corruption in recent months. The Latvian Presidency made this a priority, as early as the Trio Presidency Programme. We highlighted, in particular, cooperation with the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), as well as progress on the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Indeed, following an agreement between our two institutions, we strengthened rules to prevent money laundering. The Anti-Money Laundering Directive will strengthen EU rules and ensure consistency with the approach followed at international level, based on the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force. And the Funds Transfer Regulation introduces further requirements regarding the information accompanying transfers of funds. I signed these pieces of legislation with President Schulz at the time of the European Parliament part-session in May. Of course, the global fight against corruption requires much more action and many more steps, as illustrated by the recent revelations on FIFA. But we have made a contribution, at EU level, to the priority that the fight against corruption represents. With regard to the recent developments at FIFA, there is now an opportunity for major reform of that organisation. However, as I said, no matter how many laws we pass, they will not be effective if there is no true will on the part of the organisation to self-regulate and observe these standards. The Council will follow this debate closely and pay due attention to the views that are expressed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1614, "date": "2015-06-10.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I want to thank the European Parliament for putting this item on today’s agenda. I usually enjoy talking about sport, but today’s subject troubles me deeply. Football often dominates the news and conversations all over the globe. It is the most popular game in the world, and European clubs and our national teams are at its heart. But the last two weeks have revealed an uglier side of the beautiful game. We see an international governance system in football that is broken and has lost all trust and credibility. European fans and our own football associations have shown clearly what they think. FIFA as an organisation in its current form is no longer fit to run international football. Small change will not be enough – but big change may not be enough either. FIFA needs a fresh start, a complete overhaul of the organisation’s culture and institutions. It needs to take responsibility to become a new transparent organisation that meets the highest ethical and moral standards. Fans across Europe and around the world demand nothing less. What role should the European Union play in this process? Clearly this is not an area where we should be legislating or creating new instruments. Our job in the EU is not to organise sport, but we will support and encourage those who are serious about reform. The Commission has already been working for some time with a group of experts on good governance, which developed recommendations looking at transparency and accountability in decision-making, democratic structures and processes, inclusive representation and effective auditing. The expert group is now working on ways to take these recommendations and principles forward. We are looking at how the rights to organise major sporting events are awarded across the single market and taking into account the realities of the digital age. Building on this, I now want to look at how to promote the implementation of principles of good governance by all the sports organisations, including football. Of course, it is not for the European Commission or the European Union to run sports organisations. They have to take responsibility and implement good governance standards themselves. But we can help to develop those standards and encourage federations to put them in place. We can signal to those sport bodies which want to play ball that we are ready to help them. The autonomy of sport, free from government interference, is fundamental; but, like other organisations that play a public role and which fail to respect the highest ethical standards, our sporting federations must face greater scrutiny. Competition in our single market must follow the rules. At the Commission, we work closely with Member States and sports organisations to achieve a real change in sport governance. We will not stand by silently when sports federations fail to do their job. We must be ready to share the thinking we have done in Europe with others who now face the challenge of reform.

What we are discussing today does not affect only a small number of managers of a sports organization. This issue concerns all of us who love sport and live it day by day. We always talk about the values that sport embodies and, therefore, sport must be especially exemplary. Sport cannot hide its shortcomings and hide behind the sacrosanct principle of sport autonomy. I am thinking in particular of the fight against doping, the fight against violence, the fight against discrimination, the fight against rigged parties and the fight against criminal activities in a broader sense, such as corruption. These matters concern the general interest and, therefore, from the European Parliament we have full legitimacy to discuss and propose solutions. I would like to recall that on 2 February 2012 we adopted a report on the European dimension of sport which I had the honour of being rapporteur. This report proposed that public and sports authorities should act together. I believe that now, more than ever, this must be implemented in order to eradicate corruption and lack of transparency in the world of sport. Autonomy in sport is based on good governance. Good governance is an inexcusable condition for the autonomy and self-regulation of sports organizations, which must be based on the principles of transparency, accountability and democracy and the need for a zero-tolerance policy against corruption. It is urgent that FIFA catches the bull by the horns. FIFA is sick and its illness is due to its current ruling class. His illness is serious and cannot be cured with a touch of magic wand. FIFA must react and take urgent action that includes reforming its statutes, organizational structure, accommodating the different representatives of the sport. It should also limit the number of mandates of its leaders and modify the system of choice of its members, as well as undergo an independent audit of their finances and implement a strict ethical code. Prior to FIFA, other sporting institutions have experienced similar crises and managed to find the right way to overcome them, as UEFA has demonstrated with its reforms. The ball is now in the field of FIFA, its confederations and its national federations. Let them know that Europe is watching them and that Europe will continue to express itself, as many times as necessary, in order to give football the prestige bestowed on it by millions of practitioners and supporters every day, in the four corners of the old continent and beyond.

With all its interdependencies, dependencies and dark sides, FIFA is more reminiscent of the multi-headed monster of Greek mythology, the Hydra. With Joseph Blatter, she has lost only one head. But the question remains as to what will happen next. Right now, however, the way is clear for major reforms and a complete realignment of FIFA. There must be no simple move to the agenda. The values of sport, such as fairness, team spirit and equal opportunities, must not be trampled underfoot by corrupt machinations. The consistent action of the US Public Prosecutor's Office clearly shows us the importance of criminal sanctions. Years of self-commitments, half-hearted reforms, and an ethics committee that is not so sure whether it deserves the name at all have not been enough to stop the self-serving mentality of many officials. FIFA must now launch comprehensive reforms. The European member federations, but also UEFA, have a special responsibility here. The questionable European Championship awards in 2018 and 2022 also urgently need to be put on the agenda. Sports federations also have a kind of responsibility for respect for human rights. We need good governance with clear international standards and rules to preserve the integrity of sport.

We have known for years that there is corruption in FIFA, and this has been sapping the soul out of the world’s second most popular sport after cricket. In this House we have long called for reform, particularly after the ludicrous decision to host the World Cup in Qatar, a city of 300 000 people with summer temperatures well into the 40s and no tradition of football. But it is only now that the FBI has acted that we begin to know the full truth. I congratulate the FBI for acting. I think they have done sports fans around the world a favour. Now that the rotting core of the once beautiful game has finally been exposed, the ensuing fallout will undoubtedly expose others, and it is entirely necessary. I welcome the fact that Sepp Blatter has resigned, but much more needs to be done. Blatter needs to go now, not at the end of December. The bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should be investigated and, if there is any evidence of wrongdoing, the entire process should be re-run. But we need root-and-branch reform of FIFA, as others have also suggested. In particular, I do not want any new president to be tarnished by the old regime. We need a completely new field of people coming in here. If FIFA wants inspiration, they should look to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). After they had a similar scandal before the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, they put athletes at the core of their executive committees. I think FIFA should be looking at exactly the same thing: trying to put athletes at the core of the decision-making process. They are the people who know the sport.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which Sport, and football in particular, is not, as is often claimed, the most beautiful side thing in the world. No, sport – and football in particular – is the glue, the putty that holds our society together. This is especially true of the many associations, which are mostly run in the voluntary sector. In my own country alone, Germany, there are 26 000 football clubs with almost seven million members who are active in the sport of the disabled with children's and young people, in the field of the elderly. We know that these associations are the best-functioning social stations in our society. Added to this is the great enthusiasm that football, fair competition, generates among spectators. This applies to the Kreisliga as well as to international competitions up to the World Cup. All these people meet regularly, with the proviso of treating each other fairly, respecting values and rules of the game and being a role model. At the lower level, i.e. in the voluntary sector, this works excellently. It is all the worse that where a lot of money flows, where large sums of money are paid as remuneration, nothing works. Confidence in FIFA has been squandered. It is sad to see how greed, the pursuit of power and the lack of moralmorality of individuals discredit the whole of football. All those who are honest about football have a right to expect honesty, transparency, openness and fair play from the football government – FIFA. FIFA needs fundamental changes quickly to restore its credibility. I can only agree with the main demands of the President of the German Football Association today on his ten points. Among other things, it calls for a rapid investigation of corruption allegations, the rapid change at the top of FIFA, the limitation of terms of office, more transparency in World Cup allocations, strict control of cash flows and an adjustment in the voting system. This requires Europe to be united in UEFA – on reforms and also on future personnel decisions.

I, as an Italian, am unfortunately not surprised. We, alas, are sadly used to such scandals and not just in the world of football! Very recent cases of corruption, fraud, rigged matches and illegal betting, often handled by organised crime with the complacency of footballers and managers. To understand us better: an investigation is currently underway by the District Anti-Mafia Directorate of Catanzaro for football betting and a few hours ago the news came out of the launch of an investigation, complete with a search, against the Vice-President of the Italian Football Federation, who is called Claudio Lotito, for attempted extortion, even! However, everyone knew, for example, as it was denounced by Inspector Garcia, that the allocation of the World Cup in Russia in 2018 and those of Qatar in 2022 was tainted by serious corruption. FIFA's ethics committee ignored all the report's conclusions and confirmed the assignments.  Fifa and the whole world of football must be reformed, not only in Italy, but throughout Europe, which seems for too long to follow its own logics that are completely outside the genuine values of sport, such as healthy competition, the development of the person, friendship, discipline and education. Footballers are often role models for the younger generation and therefore play an educational role, but all too often the example given is not up to scratch. Perhaps we should reflect on this fact: our society should ask itself whether it is right to entrust such a fundamental educational role to those who in the vast majority of cases are unable to do so because they have neither the means nor the preparation. In conclusion, I believe that when it comes to transparency, democracy, good governance and financial fair play, these concepts should not remain declamations of principle, but should be applied on a daily basis.  This scandal, albeit in the bitterness of the moment, nevertheless offers us the opportunity for a reform that I believe must be seized.

It is extremely important that we firmly and unequivocally put an end to all forms of corruption that undermine credibility and damage the reputation of this discipline. In this context, it is crucial to protect athletes and to ban third-party ownership of players in European sport, to eliminate violence, to doping and to combat match-setting.

It is vital that an independent body is set up to monitor compliance with ethical standards. FIFA must once again earn the trust of the people, and this goes through the introduction of the mandate of the members of the executive committee and the transparency of the payments of senior management. First, I call on the Commission, together with the Member States, to make optimal use of the set framework of the European Union Work Plan for Sport, focusing on actions and concrete measures directly affecting good governance.  Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that to date only nine Member States have signed the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions. Worst of all, the corruption scandal will inevitably affect not only professional football organizations, but also amateur clubs.

Therefore I have little confidence that any reform at FIFA will actually happen. The Commission has to take urgent action. FIFA is subject to our regulatory rules. We cannot just abdicate our responsibility and leave it to the US again. The reform that is urgently needed is greater transparency in accounting, an independent audit of the last 10 years, and the adoption of watertight procedures to tackle corruption. We should question why FIFA is established in Switzerland. It cannot just be for tax reasons, can it? If FIFA does not reform, UEFA needs to take action, supported by all the Member States – unlike Blatter’s latest re-election bid: when UEFA called for a vote against him, big Member States like France and Spain refused.

But it is about more than just awarding world cups to Russia or Qatar; it is about marketing rights and possibly purchased votes in the Executive Committee. The question is whether the FIFA leadership has abused the trust of football fans around the world to enrich themselves personally through a system of dependencies and corruption. The investigations by Swiss and US authorities must be supported without reservation. We also need Europol and Interpol and Eurojust. The resignation of Joseph Blatter was overdue, but only a first step towards a radical new beginning for FIFA. An interim president must be prepared to push for deep structural reforms of this second-largest sports federation in the world. Criteria: time limit on the term of office of the members of the Executive Committee and the President, continuous external and independent review of all financial activities and transparent rules for the award of the World Championships. Unfortunately, UEFA, as the European governing body, has only a small share of the vote, but has a special responsibility due to the size of its members. This is especially true for the DFB as the world's largest football association with more than six million members. DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach presented a 10-point plan today, from respect for human rights in host states to a balanced vote weighting according to the size and relevance of the associations. The sponsors, but also the broadcasters, play an essential role, which must exert their influence in order to speed up the restructuring processes. Special responsibility lies with the public service broadcasters, which co-finance the football system through our fees. Obscure FIFA methods have undermined the integrity of football.

Mr President, what has been revealed in recent times within the F.F.I.A. only causes sadness to all of us who care about the sport.   We must, however, separate any responsibility of the players from football itself. Our message must be clear. Football has nothing to do with corruption. Those who engage with it should be punished by example. It is a social good with a huge influence on the daily lives of millions of people.  As the European Parliament, I believe that we have an obligation not only to demand that the matter be cleared up immediately, but also to press, as far as we are concerned, to proceed with all the necessary reforms for the good of football itself.  But, Mr President, I want to dwell on another point before I close my speech. The recent scandal at the World Football Federation should be an occasion to open up the debate on the significant changes that football needs in general, such as the labour rights of footballers and athletes. It is amazing that, while everyone is talking about football, there is almost no discussion of the real problems of the protagonists. The real protagonists are not only the big stars, they are not just the big teams that we all admire and are glad to see. True protagonists are the millions of children who with a ball in their legs dream at some point to make their dream come true. It is the athletes of smaller teams, but also players of smaller categories, who make football what it really is: the most popular sport on the planet and a global social phenomenon.  What are the rights of these people? What about the thousands of children who, because of a misfortune, will ingloriously end their careers? What do we do about unacceptable practices with regard to players' rights?   Ladies and gentlemen, world football wants change and yes, it needs catharsis at all levels. But it would be unfair if the debate were confined only to the alleged phenomena of corruption.

Football is one of the most wonderful things in the world and it is a disgrace how some officials have dealt with it and what they have done. However, I am at least as annoyed that many – perhaps in all areas too – have intervened far too late. It took a very long time for the American police to take action and then to draw conclusions from it. The dramatic thing for me is that there is an organisation that people have been able to work without the clues, the concerns, the complaints that have also been made public, really having a wide space. In this respect, it is not possible now for Mr Blatter to resign but to remain in office. But an interim chairman really needs to be rebuilt fresh and new. We also need to take a closer look at this. There is no point in replacing one person with another, but structures must be called into question. That is why it is imperative, for example, that the Garcia report should also be made public, so that those who are now looking into reconstruction also know the basics and draw conclusions. I think it is precisely the Europeans who are in demand. How often do we talk about our ambition to stand up for certain values, to stand up for the rule of law, to be against corruption. Have we all carried out our duties to such an extent, including the European Football Association and all its organisations? Or did we not look away from it because it's such a great thing? Have the media actually played their role in the past in terms of enlightenment? Here, too, there are very different things. In part, we have also pushed this forward , and at least we have tolerated it – just now the reference has come – through financial support, even through the media sector. I am grateful that a start has now been made. It just needs to be used resolutely. It is wise for the European Parliament to interfere in this debate with clear demands.

I think FIFA’s integrity needs to be restored and people’s trust in it rebuilt. It is unequivocal and there is a consensus. On the other hand, we have to respect some things as limits for our action. The very first limit is the principle of subsidiarity. We have to take action under the principle of subsidiarity. That means that we have no room for legislation on sport at European level, but we have to support, foster and encourage closer cooperation in sport issues. The other one is the autonomy of the sport. Let me make this clear: FIFA is not a European organisation. It is not only an autonomous organisation but a worldwide organisation. FIFA’s problem is not only Europe’s problem; it is the problem of world sport, of world football. The European Union can play a big role in restoring trust in FIFA, but we are not the only players and we are outsiders. Are we outsiders? Yes and no. We have tools and we have instruments to help restore trust in FIFA. We can help those Member States, those associations and those players that are interested in rebuilding FIFA and FIFA’s role. We are just now working in a working group on good governance and we have strong allies in that work. We have stakeholders with whom we are in close cooperation and I think that we have good results and we can continue along this path in the future as well. You are about to adopt a good resolution.

The Commissioner was supposed to heal the situation in PZPN after the disclosure of further cases of corruption in this organization.

The Olympic movement is based on three fundamental values: excellence to give our best, friendship above all difference and respect – respect for one's neighbour, respect for fundamental ethical principles. This oral question to the Council, which I am presenting on behalf of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, aims to make us reflect, reflect on the growing discrepancy between the values that inspire sport and what many major sporting events become, in reality: a huge accumulation of interests, both economic and political; a tool for face-washing of regimes that are far from being considered democratic; a missed opportunity to really move towards greater respect for human rights.  Sport, such a powerful tool, cannot live outside the defence of human rights and a commitment to freedom of expression. Sport cannot be blind to what happens where it celebrates its great events, because that blindness makes us all complicit.  These are the first European Games in history, promoted by the European Olympic Committee and, therefore, it is Europe's responsibility not to be complicit in a country, of a regime that systematically violates the values we intend to defend.  We cannot ignore what is happening in Azerbaijan, and these are the 2015 Baku Games. Europe cannot come forward in Baku to applaud, while we are aware of the level of repression in Baku against whom it sees the voice against the Government. It is not just the major human rights organizations that Amnesty International has been prevented from entering Azerbaijan today – the Council of Europe, the United Nations, the OSCE have also told us.  There is a very clear consensus on this situation. Azerbaijan is relentlessly persecuted against human rights defenders and the preparation of these Games has only served to increase this repression. Civil society has been systematically eradicated in that country, annulled, silenced; and the European Union and its Member States say nothing. There are no more organizations working on human rights; the ones in their twenties have been closed.  In Azerbaijan you can safely practice sport freely in large top-notch facilities; but if you criticize the government or defend human rights, you have two options: jail or exile. Because if you criticize electoral processes, such as Anar Mammadli and Elnur Mammadov, you go to jail; if you document the cases of political prisoners, as Intigam Aliyev or Khadija Ismayilova did, you go to jail. If you don't resign yourself to staying silent, just raising your voice, as Leyla Yunus and her husband Arif Yunus did, you're doomed to the worst treatment. You see, President: Leyla Yunus was a finalist for the Sakharov Prize and this Parliament has made a commitment to it. He's about to be in prison for a year. All this time in pre-trial detention, without being tried, in prison, in very poor health. Her husband was also imprisoned: we know nothing about him.  His daughter Dinara, who is here right now, in this House, and who only has them in the world, is wondering why we do nothing. Perhaps the Council can give us some answer today, it can give some answer to Dinara Yunus.  What is the position of the Council and the High Representative in this relationship between sport and respect for human rights and democracy? Shouldn't the Council take advantage of the forthcoming Baku Games as a unique opportunity for the European Union and its Member States to collectively and forcefully defend human rights and universal values? Shouldn't respect for the basics: human rights be indispensable when deciding where major sporting events are held?  These European Games are less than 48 hours away. From here I want to demand the release of all the prisoners of conscience who today suffer from the lack of freedom in Azerbaijan.

Now we turn to another sport—related issue: the European games in Baku. As I said during the previous debate, sporting events are an important economic activity, creating jobs and attracting investments. Many sporting events and world championships are being hosted outside the EU and, in particular, in emerging economies. This tendency has only increased since 2008, since when most of the world’s major economies, including the EU, have been obliged to pursue a policy of fiscal restraint. This means that issues such as those raised by the honourable Member will continue to be high on the political agenda. The oral question on which I am now intervening is related to the relationship between sport and human rights, and this relationship should not be underestimated. I would also like to recall that sporting events bring people and communities together and bridge divides. They provide an excellent opportunity to promote democratic values. To this aim, in May 2014, the Council adopted a second EU work plan for sport, under which a set of guiding principles relating to democracy, human rights and labour rights is going to be prepared, in particular in the context of the procedures for awarding major sports events. Work on these principles should be completed later this year. In this context, future Council presidencies will be in a position to decide how best to take forward the role on good governance achieved under the two EU work plans. The aim is to ensure that international sports organisations operate in a way which continues to ensure the support of EU citizens and governments. As regards specifically Azerbaijan, the Eastern Partnership is the main framework within which we set relations with that country. As you know, the most recent Eastern Partnership summit took place last month in Riga. The summit’s joint declaration contains all the participants’ joint commitment to strengthen democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are the principles at the heart of their partnership. Moreover, the summit’s participants reaffirmed that people-to-people contacts are one of the important modalities of the Eastern Partnership and, in this context, the leaders looked forward to the first ever European Games to be hosted in Azerbaijan in June. It is true that there are concerns about the state of democracy and the human rights situation in Azerbaijan. However, isolation of the country might not be the best response. Dialogue and engagement are important in promoting human rights. I hope the period of the Baku games can be a window of opportunities for progress in this field. Indeed, I am aware of your concerns regarding, in particular, the detention of human rights defenders, activists and journalists, as expressed in this oral question and in a letter that several of you addressed recently to the High Representatives and to ministers. I share these concerns. The EU is raising its concerns on human rights with the Azerbaijani authorities directly and publicly. It has been calling for the fair treatment and release of detained individuals. During their visits in recent months, Commissioner Hahn and EU Special Representative Lambrinidis have raised these issues repeatedly, sometimes publicly. We hope that the Baku games will be an opportunity for the Azerbaijani authorities to show their progressive commitment to democratic values and human rights, and that they will not miss this opportunity. I thank you for your attention and I look forward to your views during this very important debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1678, "date": "2015-06-10.json", "name": "Sandra KALNIETE", "mepid": "96934", "text": "  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to thank the \" Mr. President! Dear colleagues! We all know that major sporting events, as well as sport in general, are not just the focus of sports fans. We know that sport and major sporting events have significant potential, which contributes significantly to the protection and promotion of human rights. The international community must therefore seize this opportunity to make demands to improve the human rights situation in countries that wish to organise prestigious international sporting events. I firmly believe that we must not allow the authoritarian regimes of the world to use major sporting events to consolidate their power and to shine feathers, especially if these sporting events give the name of Europe.  Europe means not only a certain geography, it also means certain values – human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law. It is therefore at least ironic that the first European games take place in a country with almost the lowest level of democratic civil liberties between all the Member States of the Council of Europe, in a country where the Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is forced to close a week before the European Games begin.  I am convinced that European leaders should also ask themselves about their attitude to the world football championship in a country where political opponents are killed and which has illegally been aneced by the territory of another European country.  In the meantime, I would like to use this podium to send a message to politically imprisoned people in Azerbaijan. You know, the fact that European games are taking place in Baku does not mean that Europe has forgotten about you and betrayed you. And I will name the political prisoners to whom I want to send this message: Leyla Yunus, Arif Yunus, Rasul Jafarov, Intigam Aliyev, Khadija Ismayilova, Orkhan Eyybzade, Elvin Karimov, Faraj Karimov, Siraj Karimov, Mammad Azizov, Rashad Hasanov, Rashadat Akhundov, Ilkin Rustamzade, Omar Mammadov, Hilal Mammadov, Abdul Abilov, Rashad Ramazanov, Ilgar Mammadov, Tofig Yagublu, Yadigar Sadigov, Anar Mammadli, Bashir Suleymanli, Emin Huseynov.

Sports bodies which influence allocation decisions, such as FIFA, seem to be more interested in the economic resources of these countries than in anything else.  The next games are another example of this constant, they will take place in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, a country whose economy is travelling at a high rate, thanks to the huge oil and gas fields, but which does not seem to be as advanced in terms of human rights. In recent years, particularly during the last twelve months, expressing dissent has become very risky in this country, due to an increasingly intolerant system of criticism that is putting pressure on a large number of journalists and human rights activists. I would like to mention, for example, the case of Leila Younis, one of the best-known human rights defenders in Azerbaijan and one of the three finalists of the last European Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. She is currently being held on charges of high treason, fraud, forgery and tax evasion. The wave of repression has also hit foreigners: journalists, members of non-governmental organisations and UN officials have experienced first-hand the intimidation, harassment and obstruction that the Azerbaijani authorities have put in place to stifle criticism.  At present, therefore, there seems to be no room for opposition in Azerbaijan. The international spotlight, which has been on the capital Baku since 12 June, is therefore a unique opportunity that the European Union and its Member States should seize in order to collectively defend human rights and promote universal values. The European Union, through the High Representative, should call for the release of all political prisoners. I believe that athletes must also make a real commitment to the issue of human rights, raising these issues with local organisers and athletes and using their popularity to support those who have been unjustly deprived of their freedom.  Finally, in more general terms, it would be perfectly desirable for the High Representative to push the International Olympic Committee, the European Olympic Committees and the other major sports federations to include respect for human rights in the list of basic requirements to be met for hosting international sporting events and to integrate these requirements into the decision-making processes of sports federations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1680, "date": "2015-06-10.json", "name": "Arne GERICKE", "mepid": "124815", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take back from the ECR Group.

This also happened when Baku had Eurovision in 2012. There is much to improve on the human rights situation in Azerbaijan. I believe and hope that the organisation of the Games in Baku will promote the country's openness and, sooner or later, human rights.  Sporting competitions and cultural events are held continuously in countries where human rights violations occur. I do not believe in isolation policy, but in cooperation, and human rights are best promoted through dialogue. It is appropriate for the European Parliament to debate human rights, such as the suspicions of corruption in FIFA just now, and sport. It is difficult to come up with a better forum than Parliament for such a debate. Citizens of 28 countries are represented in this House. I understand very well that the International Olympic Committee and other sporting organisations avoid taking a position on policy. Sporting events are supposed to unite, not tear.  I am opposed to the death penalty, but if the death penalty were an obstacle to the organisation of international sporting events, we would not be able to allow sporting games to take hold, even in the United States. I'm not going to Baku to watch these games, but I want to wish the organizers and athletes well. I also hope that this will strengthen human rights in Baku.

Almost half of the state budget would have been devoted to it. But human rights defenders, who denounce this situation, come to disrupt its beautiful scenario. The bank accounts of NGOs have been frozen, their lawyers harassed, their leaders imprisoned. One of the most well-known cases is that of Leyla Yunus, a vehement critic of the government, who was arrested in July 2014, days after calling for a boycott of the games. She was, indeed, one of the finalists for the Sakharov Prize. His pre-trial detention must officially end after the games; funny coincidence. Her condition is of concern, she does not have access to the medicines she needs, she has lost 16 kg since her arrest. We promised to monitor his situation.

In fact, he has done so for the last 12 years and, so far as I am aware, no one has called for his removal nor had any reason to do so. Although I do not regard ECHR membership as a defining characteristic in identifying adherence to human rights, would it not be hypocritical of the European Union to, on the one hand, accept into EU law judgments of the ECHR that have been handed down by Azerbaijan’s representative whilst, on the other, refusing to acknowledge that Azerbaijan seeks to fulfil its obligations towards the international community? I do understand the serious concerns being raised in this Chamber during this debate. However, sporting events such as the forthcoming Baku Games in Azerbaijan, as pointed out by the Council, are a great way to bring countries closer together. Indeed, what better and more peaceful way to continue to encourage Azerbaijan in its engagement with the rest of the world? Azerbaijan, to my mind, should be commended for the manner in which its Muslim, Jewish and Christian citizens have built a largely peaceful society. There are few places in that region with such a record. By some standards, one could argue that Azerbaijan is a success on this issue alone.

The Olympic Charter contains the principles of the International Olympic Movement, which consist in understanding sport as an instrument of harmonious human development with a vision of promoting peace in societies and respect for human dignity. The rules apply both to the sports competition itself and to the entire organizational side of each sporting event. There are fears that the Azerbaijani authorities will try to use the Olympic sporting event to strengthen the international image of their policies without solving human rights violations. The detentions of social activists, journalists and human rights defenders and NGOs signal the progressive shrinking of civil liberties in the public sphere. The Azerbaijani authorities have forced many activists to suspend their activities and to leave the country.  These authorities must stop persecuting and intimidating civil society organisations, opposition politicians and independent journalists, and to refrain from disrupting and undermining their valuable work for the development of democracy in this country. With such a large sporting holiday as the European Games, the eyes of the whole world will be on Azerbaijan. This is therefore an excellent opportunity for the country's government to reform human rights. Sport plays an important role in European society. This is an area that can make a significant contribution to improving respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Sport regulates social behaviour and creates a sense of belonging within the community, which in turn leads to the strengthening of democracy.  Upcoming international sporting events will be an important and sensitive choice for the European Union.

That's how I've always imagined the mission of sport. Even as a young man, I was hit hard by the boycott of the two Olympic Games in the 1980s, and some less young people will remember that. When, as the competent sport of the Ministerial Council of the European Union in 2008, I was surprised by the question of whether the European Union would boycott the Beijing Olympic Games because of China's violation of human rights and freedoms in Tibet, I immediately rejected this possibility, as a boycott would do more harm to the Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, than to the authorities. A boycott would miss the overall cultural effects that such an event brings in the environment where the games take place. Interestingly, the same view was later defended by the Tibetan religious leader Dalai Lama. Today, we have once again linked this sporting event in Baku to the violation of human rights and freedoms. This is a legitimate, while a legitimate debate on the human rights situation in Azerbaijan is certainly always welcome, as is in other countries, including within the European Union.

The Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs should clearly call on the European Olympic Committee to make demands on host countries to ensure respect for human rights. When the European Olympic Committee fails to assume its responsibility for this in the run-up to the Games in Baku, it is all the more important that the EUROPEAN Union now sends a clear signal about this – not least in support of the forces fighting for human rights within the country.

Question, which is also vague, since it does not mention specific human rights incidents in Azerbaijan. The aim of the question, as shown by the debate, is the politicisation of sports competitions starting in two days, on Friday, in Baku. Furthermore, a fortnight ago in Brussels, at the mini-session of the European Parliament, we discussed partnership. Because colleagues did not rais these issues at the time. On the contrary in Riga, the leaders of the European Union not only did not address the issues of human rights protection in Azerbaijan, but instead co-signed a joint declaration on democracy and human rights.

These games will open on Friday of this week. 6 000 athletes from 50 countries will take part and compete in 20 sports. Even a team from Armenia is there, despite the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. The European Games are a kind of European Olympic Games, and Azerbaijan has made enormous efforts – especially financial efforts – to meet the strict requirements of the European Olympic Committee. Eur 820 million alone went into the operational budget for equipping the Games, and billions of euros in infrastructure, especially in construction, totalling around six billion euros. From a political point of view, Azerbaijan has been involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy since 2004 and has been a member of the European Eastern Partnership since May 2009. Azerbaijan and Europe are important strategic partners. For the period 2014-2015, the EU has allocated €3 million to support civil society in Azerbaijan. Human rights are important, there is no question about that. Human rights are also in line with the Olympic idea. The Olympic Committee's Agenda 2020 therefore provides for respect for human rights, respect for freedom of the press and safeguarding the protection of minorities in a candidate country. Let us not politicise sport, ladies and gentlemen. I would agree with the Council's assessment – as you said today, Minister: the European Games should be a window of progress between Europe and Azerbaijan in strengthening relations between Europe and Azerbaijan.

The European partnership is a space in which respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms must be guaranteed. I will inform Commissioner Hahn and the High Representative of this discussion and will also convey your concerns to them. I would like to recall that respect for human rights and democracy is a core value of the EU, and we do not hesitate to promote it. The EU, through the European External Action Service, is raising its concerns with the Azerbaijani authorities directly and publicly, irrespective of the European Games. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, and Commissioner Hahn also raised the EU’s concerns on human rights issues during their recent visits to Baku in February and April respectively. In particular, they called for the fair treatment and release of detained individuals. The EU delegation in Baku, working closely with the embassies of EU Member States, is supporting local human rights defenders, including by applying the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. Together with like-minded partners, the EU is carefully monitoring the cases – including the court cases – of those in detention. We are also working with the Council of Europe and are hopeful that the joint committee drawn from Azerbaijan’s government and civil society, mediated by the Council of Europe, will deliver positive results. We continue to look actively for other ways in which we can support civil society in Azerbaijan, including those activists and independent journalists currently in detention. As I said at the beginning of the debate, the Baku Games are an excellent opportunity for the Azerbaijani authorities to demonstrate their progressive commitment to democratic values and human rights.

Let Azerbaijan give the sense it wants to its European Games and let us care about the practice rather than the consumption of sport in our societies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 1725, "date": "2015-06-10.json", "name": "Inma RODRÍGUEZ-PIÑERO", "mepid": "125043", "text": "  in writing. – Large sporting events take on a dimension that goes far beyond the sporting realm. The purpose of this oral question is to highlight the importance and potential that these events can and should have in contributing substantially to the defence of human rights. The European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan, the first of its kind, are held between 12 and 28 June. The United Nations warns of the relentless persecution of opponents, human rights defenders and journalists in the country, whose civil society has been eradicated, silenced. This crackdown has increased as the date of the Games approached. Sport cannot live oblivious to the defence of human rights, and Europe cannot come forward in Baku to applaud while we are aware of the suffering of the Aliyev government, especially those who have the voice against it. We call for the release of all prisoners of conscience in Azerbaijan and hope that, with the collaboration of governments and sports federations, respect for human rights will finally become a key element in deciding the venues of the great sporting events of the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1726, "date": "2015-06-10.json", "name": "Monika SMOLKOVÁ", "mepid": "96655", "text": "  in writing – Every major sporting event at international level, which in addition is mediated by television and radio broadcasts, attracts a great deal of attention from athletes, sports fans, but also citizens who are only passive observers. They bring great attention and popularity to the country where sporting events and games are organized. Participants in the games, as well as viewers, will also learn a lot about the country, its history, its present, but also the politicians who run the country. I therefore believe that it is also necessary to use the European Games in Baku to draw the world's attention to human rights violations in Azerbaijan and the closure of journalists who point to non-compliance with the law. Visitors to the Games, athletes can also use the space to discuss with the people of Baku how human rights are being violated in their state.

That is why every important sports event in countries which are outside of the mainstream political power and strategy games in the world becomes a matter of lively political controversy. Azerbaijan is certainly not a country with the highest standard of respect for democratic values, such as human rights, the rule of law and freedom of expression, but it is nevertheless a country which can proudly display its commitment to secular values, religious tolerance and gender equality. Instead of continually exposing Azerbaijan to criticism which barely takes account of its complex geopolitical situation and the fact that a large part of its national territory is occupied by neighbouring Armenia – with the assistance of Russian troops stationed on its territory – the EU should do much more to boost dialogue with Baku and contribute to a just solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
