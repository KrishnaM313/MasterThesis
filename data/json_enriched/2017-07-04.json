Tkun idea ġdida ta’ kif nidħlu biex inwettqu l-prinċipji tal-Unjoni Ewropea.  Mr President, I am here today to close a small chapter in Europe’s history but one which for us Maltese, the smallest Member State, means a lot. Even though holding the Presidency of the European Council might not have a direct effect on citizens, the Maltese people feel a sense of pride, and every time we closed a dossier and we were praised or criticised we felt part of something larger than the small island we live in. Let me start by transmitting a sense of the positivity that the EU Presidency has brought to our country. During the past six months we achieved a lot in terms of making a difference in people’s lives. We closed important dossiers – ending roaming charges and introducing cross-border portability, which affects apps we use in everyday life, and moving ahead with the WiFi4EU initiative. Other important dossiers which we closed were the Anti-Tax-Avoidance Directive, the double-taxation dispute resolution mechanism, better protection for workers from cancer-causing substances, and rules on business-to-consumer contracts for the supply of digital content. The EU joined the Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women. We have also seen serious advancement on gas security of supply, paved the way for 5G, and reached an agreement on the Malta Declaration charting the EU’s way forward. These are important issues and initiatives which, if communicated effectively, can show citizens – even the most sceptical millennials – that the EU matters for them, on issues like the use of Spotify through the available free wifi connection, to women’s rights, to enhanced worker’s rights, to facilitating future technologies. I must stress that these are all positive achievements which we should be talking to citizens about in our daily interactions on the media and when we meet our citizens face-to-face. The Presidency, however, was also a stark reminder that there are issues which we are still at loggerheads about. Migration, Mr President, is one of them. For all the good intentions which we all declare, including through signed declarations, when it boils down to real, effective solidarity, we, as Member States, should all be ashamed of our record. Countries like ours are now home to thousands of migrants and have been for the past decade or so; countries like Italy have seen hundreds of thousands of children, women and men reach their shores; and now we look at Europe, at politicians, and think ‘Well, on this issue this Europe is a failure’. So, do we blame any citizen in any country who feels short-changed because of the geographical reality they live in? How are we making a difference in these peoples’ lives? Are we just blaming them for turning to extremist parties? It is in this context that Malta supports the agreement reached between Italy, France and Germany in the presence of Commissioner Avramopoulos. We agree with the need for more financial transparency for NGOs, more specifically who is funding them and why: not to engage in some sort of war of words with these organisations, but to make sure that we all play by the same rules. We agree also that there need to be clear rules of engagement, that we should not engage in Libyan territorial waters, and that there is a need for more coordination between the coastguards involved. I must remind you that our small island, the smallest Member State, devotes 100% of its military assets to cooperating with all the relevant authorities to save lives at sea. However, to be very clear, this cannot go on forever. In the absence of real solidarity by all Member States, no one should blame the Member States affected for then trying to protect their national interest. But this is a road we do not want to go down. I think that we are still in time to have not only effective solidarity and effective border protection but also a way of managing this phenomenon together, rather than reacting once again, as we have been doing, in crisis mode. It has felt like the tail wagging the dog, rather than a situation in which we grasp control, we have an effective discussion and we move ahead, while making very clear what European values are and how they can be implemented. It is the time for choices for everyone. European Union membership is not something whereby you choose which values you adhere to and which values you do not adhere to. European Union membership is one set of values for each and every one of us. Our Presidency also had to deal with Brexit – this disastrous creature which all of us should have seen coming but none of us acted to stop. We have worked on this with some of the best people in the field, and here let me praise once again Michel Barnier’s contribution and the excellent collaboration between Council, Commission, Parliament and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. But then again, what are we praising here? The terms of a painful divorce which millions of citizens will have to go through? What are we doing, and what are we not doing, in order to make sure that such an experience does not present itself again in the future? I believe that this self-critical analysis of our work should stand. This is not self-flagellation but a reflection of what people in our cities, towns and villages are telling us. There is another dimension which we should not disregard. Europe does not stop with its borders. Our role in the world is as crucial and central as any other continent, and has become even more so in the past few months. We are at the forefront on certain issues which cut through oceans and forests, such as climate change. In this context, we must keep on defending the agreement on climate change that was born in Paris – that was born in Europe – and spread it from north to south and make sure that it gets implemented. Europe must not close its eyes to what is happening just 60 km off our coast in Libya, because Europe is Libya’s neighbour and Libya is Europe’s neighbour. Our seas should be a force to unite the world. Our vision for the world must be to build bridges and not walls. But first we must understand that solidarity begins at home and should be shown with the smaller Members of our family and those going through a crisis. Together we have overcome so many challenges, and if we heed our people we will once again rise to the occasion and bounce back on the crucial issues that affect citizens in the workplace, in our kids’ classrooms, in our hospitals and in our homes when families sit around the table to discuss their daily successes and failures. Finally, a word of thanks to Council President Donald Tusk, to my dear friend Jean Claude and all his team and to yourself, Mr President, and your predecessor. Your constant support was the guiding light of our Presidency. Who would have thought that a small island of Malta’s proportions – just half a million in population, the size of a medium-sized city in Europe – would have managed to chair hundreds of meetings and conclude important measures affecting the lives of so many millions of Europeans? That, I believe, is the beauty of Europe. I will sign off by wishing all the best to our Estonian colleagues and by recalling what was, I think, one of the fantastic moments of our Presidency where we were together in Rome and were hosted by President Mattarella. He gave a definition of Europe to which I subscribe. He said that Europe is made up of ‘small States and those that have not yet come to realise that they are small’. I believe that really is our Europe.

These clumsy allegations did not succeed in derailing the work of the Presidency.  Some indications regarding future prospects can be taken from the Maltese Presidency and the experience of it. First, on immigration, the Union still lacks cohesion, as Prime Minister Muscat has just said, but can this emerge through the normal deliberations that go on under different presidencies, six months at a time, under the present process? We need a special effort. Secondly, Brexit talks have got off to a slow and ambiguous start. The danger here is that, instead of reaching for an outcome that is politically fair and strategically smart, both sides get stuck in detail.

In terms of asylum, migration and security, Malta has made a strong effort to limit illegal migration flows from Africa to Europe. Malta, for example, advocated training the Libyan coastguard so that they could stop the migrants. All this to prevent fortune seekers from Africa from illegally crossing the Mediterranean to Europe via Libya. In addition, Malta was able to significantly increase the number of people who return voluntarily. The figures prove that a vigorous and sustained approach to the migration crisis remains necessary. Last week, no fewer than 10,000 economic migrants made the crossing from Libya to Italy in just two days! I therefore hope that, building on Malta's work, Estonia will continue to address the migration crisis as a matter of priority.

France and Germany have promised Italy and Greece that they will increase relocation, but this increasingly sounds like words to buy time. The migration and humanitarian crisis, unprecedented since World War II, is rotting away and it is not a failure of Malta. It is not Malta. It is all of us who close the borders with Greece or Italy, as if we did not have a common responsibility. Malta is one of the few countries that welcomes unaccompanied minors who have arrived fleeing the war, because most do not want to know anything about minors. In the speeches yes, but, in reality, welcoming and working with minors requires assuming responsibilities, coordinating and working more and better. Not welcoming minors, minors refugees, is a symptom of Europe's disease, because these young people can become extraordinary adults and we throw them into crime. As the semesters of this term go by, we see that the gap between security and reception policies is widening. In security, there is speed and commitment on the part of the States - and I am pleased that we are quick in this. but in the others there is slowness and apathy with the most underprivileged, and that increases our shame.The semesters hide, more and more, the word \"asylum\" or \"refugee\", as if in this way these vulnerable people whom we are not caring for disappear, because we do not have the courage to draw the virtue of the collective effort involved in supporting othersand really support us.It is not innocuous: the logic of national selfishness also makes impossible our possibilities of progress in this global world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 12, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Neoklis SYLIKIOTIS", "mepid": "124689", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, six months ago, during the Maltese presidency, I said on behalf of the GUE / NGL that the new presidency must take clear steps to change course from the disastrous neoliberal policies of austerity, strengthening social cohesion.

Mr President of the Commission, I myself come from a small State, and I fully understand your indignation: you are right to stress that the Head of Government of a small State is entitled to so much respect for A head of state or government of a large state leaves this assembly. Nonetheless, I believe it was your responsibility to deliver your speech as you planned to do and therefore not respond to one disrespect with another disrespect.

Mr. Muscat, I will start with the definition of socialism: \"theory aimed at transforming social organization for the purpose of human justice in terms of work, pay, education, housing, etc.\" I will not teach you anything, Mr Muscat, by saying that fair taxation is an absolutely crucial lever to achieve this goal of social justice. But what have we seen from the Maltese Presidency on this? First, a great silence. In the priorities announced, the words \"taxation\" or \"taxation\" were conspicuous by their absence. But should we be surprised since, with an effective tax rate for multinationals of 5%, Malta is part, like Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, of the club of European tax havens, at least for The multinationals? Then the Panama papers and even a Maltese government agency shed light on the involvement of prominent politicians in the country in fraud, tax evasion and money laundering. So, that the Maltese presidency does not push the fires in the fight for tax justice, put up with the opacity of the trusts, which are one of the absolutely essential vehicles in this phenomenon, or want to put the top European politicians in the spotlight. shelter of a rigorous attention from banks, so this is not surprising.In fact, your government prefers tax certainty over tax justice.This is, in fact, the theme of the only initiative taken by your finance minister on the fiscal front.Let's understand each other well.It is about giving multinationals, and therefore their managers and shareholders, visibility on the taxes they will have to pay.A visibility, we are told, called into question by the flow of new rules in progress, started following the multiple scandals that we have experienced in recent years.In other words, rather than responding to the anger of those who are the victims of tax injustice, you think it is more important to reassure the owners of capital.Dear Mr. Muscat, who could guess, given this record, that you are a socialist?", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 14, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Rolandas PAKSAS", "mepid": "96694", "text": "On behalf of the EFDD Group. - The first Maltese Presidency was not only a challenge for this small and young country in the European Union, but, above all, a challenge for the European Union as a whole.

It has just been said: small states, large states. It has been stressed quite often that Malta is the smallest state - absolutely right. But I think that the European Union is characterized precisely by the fact that everyone makes their contribution, both large and small states. And I find out from my personal work perspective that Malta did a very good job there. I would now like to express my thanks to the Maltese Presidency for three reasons - three reasons that have not yet been mentioned: One is - all things that I have seen myself - an inter-ministerial conference in Malta, at the invitation of your Commissioner Karmenu Vella, to blue Growth and at the same time a further development of the economic power in the Mediterranean area and maritime tourism. It was very successful, in a very good atmosphere and with good decisions. Another point, where I would also like to thank you very much: This is something that your President Coleiro Preca is very committed to, which again fits in with migration policy and the flow of refugees. She held a conference in Malta, made a statement afterwards and then held a seminar here in Parliament in Brussels, which I was also able to host as a host, on the subject of maternal health, especially among refugee women. In other words, I saw that it is a small country, it cannot move everything, of course it does not easily manage to get the solidarity that we urgently need in Europe or to create the distribution key, but You are doing something very specifically to help these minorities, and maternal health, especially for pregnant refugee women, is an extremely important issue. A third point: You have successfully dealt with various points, various laws in the maritime field, for maritime security - I can also tell you about this on behalf of myself I would like to thank colleagues from the ALDE Group. And personally I negotiated something with you very successfully, which is special for Malta, because it was about qualification in inland navigation. You have no inland waterway transport at all, but I have to say that your negotiating team has worked very successfully with me to ensure that, against the opposition of some of the larger Member States who have said they want to legally participate, they have succeeded in increasing labor mobility in this sector improve and create something good there. So thank you again from my job. I am already looking forward to it: in October you will be holding the follow-up conference to the great UN Conference on the Ocean in Malta, which was in New York in June, again with Karmenu Vella, with whom I work very well.

In a nutshell. First of all, I have to say that I find it shameful when the Maltese Presidency is accused of being unable to solve the migration problems. That turns the actual situation completely on its head! It is other Member States that have refused for years to come to common solutions both on the causes of flight and on the solidarity-based distribution of refugees. And one can hardly blame the Maltese Council Presidency for that; rather, those who have proceeded with harsh words are actually the causes for the inability to adopt a European migration and refugee policy. Unfortunately, we saw the failure of the money laundering directive reform in the Maltese presidency. And again I have to say: It is not your fault in the Maltese Presidency that it failed. When it comes to financial crime, many member states are soft on crime, they protect the intransparency of their trusts, Germany has no cadastre. These are all things, Europe has to work together and not everyone has to protect dirty money nationally.

I would love to take the blame for the migration problem, because that would be simple and would mean that whoever comes next would be able to solve the problem. Unfortunately, we all know that is not the case. I must also shoulder the blame, as representative of the Council, for this fiasco for the simple reason that it is not the fault of the Commission. The Commission’s ideas are very clear and, as a Member State, we totally agree with those ideas. We cannot blame Parliament. Your position as Parliament has been more or less the same since the first time I was here 12 years ago and, really and truly, there is nothing more to say about these two institutions. The problem is within the Council, and it boils down to values once again. I am afraid that it has nothing to do with politics because, if it had to do with politics, for every political problem there is a political solution. Now we have to be very honest: it boils down to what we believe in. And that is why I urge my colleagues in the Council to have an honest debate, without making excuses about why we should do something or why we should not do something, but about what kind of Europe we believe. And, rather than just Europe, what values we believe in. This is a Council problem and we have to come up with a solution. I must say that, as a Presidency, we have inched forward and made some progress. What we saw in our strategy was a constant search for what could unite us. When it comes to migration, what really unites us in the Council is the external dimension of the phenomenon. I think we have achieved a great deal in saying that we need to address this issue from both a humanitarian and a security perspective. It is not just a humanitarian problem, but it is not just a security problem either. For some this was something that couldn’t be said, but I think we managed to put forward a sensible approach when it comes to the external dimension, and we have achieved progress. I will give you a couple of examples where sterling work is being done by the Commission – things that are not said and that maybe some of you will not agree with, because they are philosophically opposed to the perspective of some – but these are things that are being done. With our missions in Libya this year we, as the European Union, have so far managed to convince about 5 000 people –double the number from last year – to go back voluntarily to their countries of origin and not to engage in crossing the sea. What is 5 000 when compared to the numbers arriving on our shores daily? It is nothing. But I must stress that, for every person who is convinced, a huge input and a huge effort is being made by all of us as the European Union, and we aim to get that number up to 10 000 by the end of the year. Will that make a difference? It is a drop in the ocean, but at least it is a drop because, until now, nothing significant was being done. I must also commend the huge efforts that are being made in Mali and at the southern Libyan border. For the first time, we are seeing the European Union engage with tribal communities at the southern border; tribal communities that earn a living from smuggling people. And, when we engage with them, they tell us quite clearly, in a very realpolitik fashion, that they are not doing the right thing in collaborating with criminals and ask us to give them an alternative. They ask how they will pay for their tribe to get food and shelter. For the first time, money from the European Union is going directly to those communities at the border to show them that there is an alternative way in which they can finance their own activities. This is only a start, but it is an important start. I must also say that we have managed, through the good offices of a number of Member States, notably Italy and the Netherlands, to train the first batch of Libyan coast guard members. Most importantly, once they had been trained, they went back to their country and did not escape because there were previous cases of training programmes where we, as Europe, trained people who ended up with militias, fighting against what we trained them to do. So this is a significant step forward, which cannot just be brushed aside as insignificant. May I just touch on the issue of smallness or greatness? When we say that we are a small country, we are just saying things as they are. We have limited resources, and I am very proud of what we have managed to achieve: a five—minute meeting on Brexit where we put forward a united European position in what many thought would have been a protracted discussion for hours on end with divisions. No; it was a five-minute meeting that ended in unity concerning the Istanbul Convention. This was a great achievement, which I think is an achievement by the whole European Union. To my colleague from Greece, I apologise for not mentioning Greece. I will say that Greece is always on our mind. After Germany, we are the country which contributes the highest percentage towards the Greek bail-out, so Greece is definitely on our mind. We did this without blinking an eye because we believe in solidarity. For us solidarity is not something that we advocate when migrants are coming to us and we want others to help us, but solidarity is something we practise when another Member State needs our help. That is part of the way we think. On the issue raised by Mr Giegold – whom I thank for his very proactive approach today – I know that there are many misgivings about the issue of fiscal policy within this institution. This is something that we need to engage with even more, not just as a Member States, but in a number of Member States where we need to understand each other better. We have to draw very clear lines on what we disagree about. Fiscal policy stands fairly and squarely within the remit of Member States to decide, but there need to be clear rules. I agree with that, and I must stress that, in the case of Malta, our tax system is OECD-compliant. It is the same tax system which the Commission approved before our membership of the European Union and it has not changed since then. So my point is that, if it was not a problem 13 years ago, why is it a problem now? Let’s discuss that. Once again I want to stress that this is an issue that lies fairly and squarely within the remit of Member States. On the issue, mentioned by Mr Giegold, of investigations: investigations are ongoing. They are independent and something which we will always respect. There is rule of law in our country, and I look forward to further debate on this issue, which I am sure we will have in the coming months. Finally, I was amused by Mr Lamberts’ speech, a Green politician defining socialism to me. I loved it. I will not engage in definitions, but will just tell you what I stand for and what my government stands for. We stand for free healthcare, we stand for free university education, we stand for free childcare, we stand for increasing the minimum wage, we stand for increasing pensions, we stand for full employment, and we stand for equal marriage, on which we will be voting in our Parliament tomorrow.

A Europe which treats its citizens and its businesses according to the same rules or a Europe which encourages tax aggressiveness between its multinationals, its SMEs and its start-ups to the detriment of its citizens?

At the same time, Parliament has not remained outdone since, whether through the TAXE 1 and 2 reports or, soon, the future recommendations of the commission of inquiry on the Panama papers, further proof of the need to legislate in this area, we also worked on this file. Commissioner, you have offered us a text which we have amended. I would like to highlight five key elements in this report. The first is the enterprise threshold, which is set at 750 million per year. We would have liked a threshold of 40 million, if any threshold at all, so that all multinationals could be put on an equal footing. But we have reached an agreement on this threshold, as well as on the need for the Commission to carry out an impact assessment after four years in order to assess whether this threshold should be lowered and whether the list of criteria is sufficient in relation to the desired objective. The second element, which was strongly requested by civil society, concerns data: they will be published in a common register accessible free of charge to all. The third element is the list of criteria, such as the name of the company, the number of full-time employees or the value of assets, which will be published. This will allow the competent authorities to detect possible errors or fraud. The fourth element relates to sanctions. Each Member State will be able to decide to impose sanctions on companies which do not comply with the directive, and therefore which do not publish their data. Finally, the last element concerns the complete disaggregation of data, as already foreseen in action 13 of the OECD BEPS project. That is, the data should be broken down by country, by sector and by year. This is an essential element. A safeguard clause has been added in order, among other things, to protect sensitive business data, because all of us here in Parliament understand that our multinationals must also be protected. But, on this point, we unfortunately have a difference of views as to the definition of the safeguard clause, because, for us socialists, the companies concerned can ask a Member State for a derogation so as not to publish data that would be commercially sensitive, but on four conditions. The first is that this exemption must be requested again each year. The second is that its relevance needs to be assessed and reviewed by the European Commission to avoid problems with SwissLeaks, for example. If the latter considers that the request for exemption is unfounded, the company must publish the data. With regard to the third criterion, we believe that, when this exemption ends, the company concerned must retroactively publish the data which had been the subject of it. Finally, we think it is important that there is a time limit on the exemptions. For us, this limit should be the tax prescription in each Member State so as not to give an “amnesty” bonus to potential cheaters. I think it's really essential for better tax fairness that we know where the biggest companies make their profits and how much tax they pay in each of the states where they operate. Without this information, tax fairness will never become a reality. Every euro in tax that is not paid by multinationals is overpaid by households. However, we must restore confidence and fiscal justice in Europe.

Thank you, Hugues, for presenting the key points of this report. With this position, which Hugues Bayet has now presented, we want to enter into negotiations with the Council after the votes. Public CBCR is great. Global reporting on corporate profits and taxes is exactly what we need in Europe. This directive is one of the most important initiatives taken by the Commission after the tax scandals. It holds the multinationals, but indirectly also the governments, accountable. All taxpayers need to be entitled to know what profits are made by global corporations like Starbucks, McDonalds, Monsanto & amp; Co. do where they book, where they pay their taxes for it. We in this House represent the citizens, we represent the taxpayers in all of our Member States. We have to prove that we mean business and create transparency for our constituents that prevents unlimited secrets from individual companies in consultation with governments. I therefore appeal to all colleagues, to all progressive MEPs in this House, to the liberals, to the conservatives, to all those who have made a special contribution in the TAXE and Panama committees: corrected with the adoption of Amendments 84 and 85 and 86 the regulation that was created in the committee votes. I have already received a number of signs that the clause proposed by us as co-rapporteurs is acceptable. Show us in the vote that you too are against limitless, unlimited intransparency, and vote with us! This worldwide publication of the corporate taxes that we want to introduce is correct and important for many reasons. It should be emphasized that the European Parliament, with the support of almost all political groups, is in favor of publication worldwide. We want the publication to take effect worldwide and the figures will in future be published country by country. We do not want any restriction to the states of the EU and the states of the tax swamp. If Starbucks wants to make profits in the EU internal market, it must in future also publish profits in Dubai, Shanghai or Panama. Our idea of ​​the directive only applies to the very big ones, i.e. those with EUR 750 million in sales per year. Only the data that is already available are to be published, and this is done worldwide, country by country. With this guideline, we are shedding light on global profit-shifting structures, we are making these opaque constructs more visible, we are making competition fairer, especially for SMEs, but certainly also for large companies in Europe, and we are creating fairness for the corner coffee house, such as Starbucks had to give way and could not withstand the competition. Worldwide public reporting by country is a key to transparency. It has enormous added value in terms of development policy, and it creates fairness for all those who dutifully pay their taxes. With the publication of the number of employees, everyone can see in which country employees are registered, where the multinationals have their letterbox companies and in which country they only post their profits. The transparency is an added value for all stakeholders - for customers, for employees, for investors and of course for the taxpayers. The transparency will not be anti-competitive either. On the contrary: it will attract investors, those investors who want sustainable companies and who want to invest sustainably. That means: We want sustainable companies that make their contribution to the tax systems and to the welfare state. With that in mind, I would like to express my thanks to all those who have contributed constructively.

And, naturally, since recent disclosures have once again underlined the magnitude of the problem, calls for action have gained force. We have put forward a raft of measures to tackle tax abuse and to make sure that companies pay their fair share of taxes in the countries where their actual economic activity is taking place. In addition to measures addressing directly companies’ tax affairs and the work of tax authorities we are convinced that corporate transparency is part of the equation. Parliament has been vocal and pivotal in calling for a valid answer to the widespread public discontent. The Commission responded timely in a constructive way.  The public country-by-country reporting, which we are examining today mainly aims to address two issues. First, a growing public distrust in the fairness of the tax system, and second, the accountability of multinational companies towards our citizens. The proposed corporate transparency measure is an ambitious and unprecedented move, a move that requires striking a delicate balance between, on the one hand, the public’s legitimate demands for information, and, on the other, legitimate calls for our businesses not to weaken their world-wide competitiveness.  The Commission also paid attention to complement, but not undermine, the existing system of exchange of a country-by-country reporting by tax authorities. This system is gaining remarkable traction globally under the aegis of the OECD and G20 and with the full support the European Union.  It is easy to see the importance of the issue. Due to corporate tax avoidance, our governments miss out an estimated EUR 50 to 70 billion a year.

State-by-state reporting is a fundamental measure for transparency and against tax evasion and avoidance at global and European level. Compared to the initial proposal, Parliament has extended this obligation for multinationals to all countries in which they operate, including outside the EU. This will also allow developing countries to obtain valuable information on multinationals operating within their borders. The poorest countries, in fact, are the ones that pay the highest price for these practices, losing hundreds of billions of dollars every year, fundamental resources for development. The fight against poverty and inequality also passes from here. Unfortunately, today there are those who preach well and scratch badly in this House, wanting a safeguard clause that would allow multinationals to avoid publishing information deemed sensitive. Without at least the retroactive publication of this information, this becomes a very dangerous loophole for continuing to hide profits.

The idea behind this initiative is to increase tax transparency and to put multinationals under pressure from public opinion, to make sure that large companies pay their fair share of taxes in countries where they create value. This is yet another piece of European legislation aimed at eliminating the harmful practices of tax avoidance and tax evasion in Europe. The PPE Group has supported the Commission’s proposal from the very beginning. We are in favour of more transparency in corporate taxation, but we also want the EU legislation to be consistent with international standards for tax information exchange established by the OECD under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, and adopted by almost 100 countries all over the world.  With those considerations in mind, we have worked hard to find a compromise that would be supported by all major political groups in Parliament. We have made important concessions. We agreed on the disaggregation information, we agreed on an extension of the list of information required, and we finally agreed on the review clause for the threshold. However, we have not come to a common position on the safeguard clause.  The left side of this House insisted on much more radical proposals that would go far beyond the Commission’s draft and would undermine the OECD BEPS Agreement. Accepting these proposals would establish an uneven playing field, with EU companies subject to more demanding requirements for public disclosure than their competitors from third countries. We do not want to discriminate against EU companies and that is why we oppose some of the rapporteur’s amendments that simply put EU companies at a competitive disadvantage vis—à—vis their third country competitors, and which would also make the business climate in the European Union less friendly for investors.  Our objective is to strike a balance between the legitimate demand for more transparency, on the one hand, and the need to protect EU companies in order to guarantee more jobs and growth in Europe.

The financial statements required for this are available for purchase in most major business areas. In contrast, the key purpose of country-by-country reporting is to bring transparency to the financing and tax arrangements of tax havens. Despite some shortcomings, the proposal is a clear step towards greater accountability and transparency for large companies. This is needed not only to secure the payment of tax to the states where the actual business takes place, but also to identify the various risks.

This would be an amazing achievement that will enhance transparency, limit wrongdoings and increase the confidence of our citizens on globalisation. The more transparent our multinationals become, the easier it will be to defend their big and undeniable importance for our economies.  In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs our groups reached an agreement on 95% of the report. We should not abandon it because of a small disagreement on just one issue, and weaken the broad consensus we have in this Chamber just before the Council negotiations start. We all know that some Member States will do their best to weaken this legislation. I hope that no group in the European Parliament will make their task easier. If our voters could ask us to do just three things in this Parliament, one of them would be to make more transparent the dealings of our multinationals.

Today we are taking an important step to advance in tax justice: we are going to advance a rule that will oblige multinationals to publish, country by country, how many taxes they pay in relation to how many benefits they have and in relation to other data that determine their activity, and it is very important. I would like to first of all express my gratitude to the rapporteur Hugues Bayet for the work that he has carried out and the good collaboration that there has been. This legislation will prevent many multinationals from developing aggressive tax strategies. I want to say that we have improved the Commission text: the data will be disaggregated, country by country, outside the European Union; it is going to have to be explained what kind of preferential tax regimes for patents these multinationals have - this is also very important.

For example, the 750 million euro profit limit from which the rule applies is excessive and we would have preferred it to remain at 40 million.

As we know, this proposal came after the \"LuxLeaks\" and \"Panama Papers\" scandals, which showed that the fight against tax avoidance still has a long way to go. And the European Union cannot waste any more time, it must give an immediate response, on pain of losing a credibility that is already quite shaky today. These scandals have also made us clearly understand that this phenomenon must be combated by adopting rules that are also valid on a global scale, even outside the European Union. This is why we are very disappointed that the text proposed in the Legal Affairs Committee, initially appreciable and ambitious, especially with regard to reporting obligations outside the European Union, was then greatly weakened with the introduction of the safeguard clause, to the point of therefore casting serious doubts on the real effectiveness of the proposed rules. I therefore sincerely hope that these errors can be corrected through the amendments proposed to the final text also by our group, and which concern in particular the lowering of the threshold for large companies of the reporting obligation (therefore passing from 750 million to 40 million annual turnover), the obligation to report the funds received by the State and the loans made to political bodies or personalities, the fundamental obligation for multinationals to make public, in a disaggregated way and without exception, information on taxes paid in all countries of the world, including tax havens.

These unfair practices must be sanctioned and the victim States compensated financially. The Commission’s initiative to make it mandatory for large groups to publish their sensitive financial information, broken down country by country, is a good thing. However, in the global economic war, this European transparency poses a real problem of information asymmetry for our companies vis-à-vis their international competitors. Indeed, an American or Chinese company which does not have a branch or subsidiary in Europe but which exports to the European Union or wishes to set up there will have a great deal of information on economic activity, country by country, of its competitors. It is therefore imperative to combine, within the framework of this country-by-country reporting measure, transparency and confidentiality of sensitive economic information. Under these conditions, we believe that the publicity of this information should be limited exclusively to the tax administrations of the Member States to avoid any risk of extra-European economic espionage.

In addition, some countries of the Union act as tax havens, making tax avoidance even easier and more legal for those who have the means and at the same time enjoy the benefits of the free movement of capital and goods in the Union.

It is not possible today to ask small businesses in Greece to pay total charges amounting to up to 70% of total income.

It is true that, as that Directive says, that threshold can be revised after four years, which must be narrowed in order to be in line with the OECD. The safeguard clause is a good clause, because it strikes an essential balance between competitiveness and the necessary transparency, and it has been the result of multiple commitments until reaching a balanced point. Public information on those company data that are considered relevant, especially for tax purposes, is very important to avoid tax evasion. But that's not the only reason why transparency is important. It is important because it will undoubtedly reinforce corporate social responsibility and corporate governance as well. It is undoubtedly a benefit for all: for citizens, for workers, for shareholders, for the administrations themselves, for investors. It is true that trust and workers' rights are reinforced, because it consolidates dialogue and fosters mutual trust, since it provides objective and reliable data on the real situation of the company. It is important, therefore, to work on trust. One of the objectives of this initiative is to build trust, work on social commitment and good governance.

We know the Commission wants big companies to supply it with information on their EU and non-EU operations for publication in an EU register. The list is modest in length, although no doubt it will cost companies a great deal of time and money to prepare the figures and also to have them audited, as the proposal requires. But it is a list that betrays a much wider ambition.  When the Commission asks companies not just about tax they pay in different Member States, but also to disclose the nature of activities in third countries – the number of employees in each location, the related net turnover and accumulated earnings – we can deduce that the EU aims to not only harmonise corporation taxes, but also to introduce taxes based on wealth, capital and turnover, rather than profits, and to challenge existing tax residency and transfer pricing rules. When multinational corporations realise this, some of them will ask themselves why they should bother investing time, effort, and capital in the EU rather than somewhere else. Some will rightly conclude that markets are growing much faster elsewhere in the world and that bigger profits can be made without endangering themselves to the avarice of an EU Commission running out of other people’s money, which is shortly about to have a budget crisis when its second largest net contributor, the United Kingdom, leaves.

But it is clear: medium-sized, small companies, medium-sized companies pay their taxes in the countries in which the added value takes place, while the large multinational companies across Europe can happily optimize their taxes. We set up the TAXE committee, the Panama Papers committee, and through the work of colleagues on these two committees, we have seen how tax avoidance works. If you want to prevent tax avoidance, you have to react. In this respect, I believe that the proposal that the Commission has put forward is a sensible one. At the same time - and many colleagues have pointed this out - there are of course also international rules of the game, the BEPS action plan, which we have already implemented here in Parliament. I think that in times like these, when competition is fierce, it is really important internationally that we keep an eye on competitiveness for our companies as well. That means: transparency, yes, but please do everything with a sense of proportion. So I would therefore ask colleagues to vote in favor of the EUR 750 million threshold in the vote this afternoon, not to go beyond it.

I would just like to make a technical reminder, because it is clear that every politician can defend his ideals, but I think it becomes problematic when we say the reverse of what is actually written in the texts. It may be a problem of understanding, but with regard to competition, I would like to ask all those who are in doubt to reread before the vote Article 48 ter, paragraph 3, which provides that any non-European company which has a subsidiary in Europe is subject to the same advertising conditions. This therefore means that an American or Asian multinational company that has a subsidiary in Europe will have to publish exactly the same information as European companies. There will therefore be no distortion of competition and I know of no, absolutely no multinational which has a turnover of 750 million euros, which has no subsidiary in Europe or which could do without 'a market of more than 500 million consumers. Therefore, I think there is obviously a misunderstanding of this article.

Mr. President of the European Commission, thank you for being here. Dear colleagues, on behalf of the European Parliament and the peoples of Europe represented here, I pay tribute today to Simone Veil, the first President of this directly elected Parliament, a Frenchwoman, a European, a Minister of State, an academician, a deportee from Auschwitz, a great figure of our time, a politician, a woman. In her extraordinary life, she has been all of this and more. The story of her life is the story of our continent, that of a torn, lost continent, which has known the worst atrocities of which humanity is capable, but which has succeeded, as it has, in finding the strength to go up the slope, to rebuild and be reborn. Seventy years ago, all was lost, for Simone Veil as well as for Europe. 78651 is the number the man's infamy imprinted on her skin when she was only 16 years old. This number, which she wanted to engrave on her French Academy sword as a warning to future generations, marked much more than her arm. It must remain forever imprinted in our collective consciousness and constantly remind us of the ultimate reasons why we decided one day, from the ashes of war, to pool our destiny. Let us never forget it and repeat it over and over again to the younger generations, for whom the collective memory of this catastrophe is in danger of fading, so much so that peace is now taken for granted and taken for granted. Simone Veil has always been aware of the fragility of peace in Europe since 1945. In her eyes, this peace constitutes an exceptional good. It was with the energy of a survivor who knows the price of peace that she fought in countless battles in France and in the European Parliament, battles that have advanced the rights of all citizens. Simone Veil belongs to that generation of great minds, of which Helmut Kohl was also a part, who succeeded that of the founding fathers of Europe. They took over from European construction in a very difficult period and continued what their predecessors had started. Simone Veil's contribution was fundamental to this. An example of determination, her commitment to Europe led her to become the first President of the European Parliament elected by universal suffrage. I want to express here all our admiration and deepest gratitude for the essential role she has played as President of this Assembly. In her inauguration speech on July 17, 1979, she fully appreciated the weight of the responsibility that was her own. Here are his words: \"For the first time indeed in history, in a history which has seen them so often divided, opposed, bent on destroying each other, the Europeans together elected their delegates to a Common Assembly. These elections are, without a doubt, a major event in the construction of Europe since the signing of the treaties. \" It is a twenty-three minute speech in which she clearly outlines, with extraordinary lucidity and vision, the lines of development of Parliament for the next forty years. I invite you to reread this speech, which I find surprisingly timely. You will find there the enthusiasm, the hopes, the expectations, the intentions of a whole generation of men and women who sat on these benches long before us. He inspires us and obliges us. In the aftermath of the first European elections, no one knew what would become of this newly elected Assembly. No one, except Simone Veil! Today no one knows what this Parliament could have become without her. If we are what we are, if this Parliament has been able to expand its powers, become what it is today, it’s mostly because of her. Aware of the historic task with which it was entrusted, it accompanied the young Parliament in its first steps, steered it in the right direction and laid the foundations for its future development. Our debt to this great woman therefore remains immense. In his view, Parliament, with its legitimacy derived from elections, should now fully play its role of democratic control, which, according to him, is the primary function of any elected assembly. It was also to exercise, with wisdom and conscience, its new budgetary power, which she considered fundamental among the powers of a parliament. In addition, Simone Veil was convinced that the duty of the new Parliament should be to constantly give impetus to European construction. She firmly believed that it was necessary to make full use of the powers, still limited, which Parliament then held. She also felt that it was not enough and that more had to be done. “Parliament,” she said in her speech, “must also be a body of general policy control within the Community. Let us not believe that the strictly institutional limitations of its powers can prevent a Parliament such as ours, from making heard at any time, and whatever the field of Community action, the voice conferred on it by political authority. resulting from his election. ” In other words, Simone Veil wanted a political Parliament. Great destiny that of Simone Veil. Sentenced to die at the age of 16, she has just entered the immortality of history today after a long and intense life, during which she worked tirelessly to defend the ideas and values ​​that were her own, and which have become ours. The rocket of his academician's sword is made of two hands that shake each other, a symbol of reconciliation between peoples. His exemplary life was the image of this reconciliation, which required extraordinary courage and the greatest love. His life has shown that it is possible to resist the temptation to hate. Her life has been and will remain a tremendous testimony for all of us and for future generations, because Simone Veil had the courage to continue to believe in the goodness of man despite everything. On behalf of all of us, I pay tribute today to this great lady. I express the greatest admiration for his courage, intelligence and deep humanity. I express our gratitude for the love and passion she has shown in everything she has undertaken. I declare loud and clear our pride in having had her as the first President of this Assembly. When she was inaugurated as President in 1979, she declared: “Our Parliament will have fully satisfied the hopes that it has raised if, far from being the place where the internal divisions of Europe resonate, it succeeds in expressing and to make the Community perceive the momentum of solidarity so necessary today. \" Thank you, Madam President, thank you Simone, for these words, so current, and thank you for everything you have done for us and for those who will come after us. * * * (Broadcast in the hemecicle of a video retracing the journey of Mrs. Simone Veil) * * * (The Assembly, standing, applauds)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 105, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, dear colleagues, President Tajani did me the honor of giving me the floor at this tribute ceremony, because Simone Veil was a great lady of the liberal and democratic family.

Only Simone and her sister will survive this hell, where they will see their father, mother and brother disappear. She will live her whole life with the number 78651 tattooed on her arm. The Shoah, its horrors and its memory will forge - I believe - the strong and entire personality of Simone Veil. Young married, she studied law, at a time when the woman was at home, and quickly became a renowned magistrate. When she was appointed Minister of Health, in 1974, by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, nobody in fact would have bet a former French franc on this high official responsible for making the President's flagship promise vote, that is to say - say the decriminalization of abortion. (Applause) Yet, faced with an Assembly almost exclusively made up of men, as she herself will point out, Simone Veil braved all political dangers to form a majority in the center under the boos of the old traditional right and, sometimes , anti-Semite. This feminist fight, this progressive fight propels Simone Veil into politics through the front door. However, it is not towards France that its ambitions are directed, but towards Europe. As has already been said, in 1979, in fact, Members of the European Parliament are, for the first time, elected by universal suffrage, giving this ballot a test value of the people's attachment to European construction. It was the Auschwitz survivor, who harbored no hatred or resentment against Germany, who was elected. On the contrary, she pleads for reconciliation around the shared values ​​of liberal democracy and the rule of law, and it is on this speech that her list comes far ahead in France. She rallies the liberal group, of which she will be the victorious candidate to become the first President of our Assembly. This is the start, Mr President, dear colleagues, of a long parliamentary career until his return to the French government in the 1990s. It would take too long to list all the achievements and all the successes of Simone Veil, who was to chair the liberal group from 1984 to 1989. Parliament then had few powers, but it deployed all its energy to support the major projects of the time: the Single European Act, the accession of Spain and the Portugal, which thus became part of our European family, and also the reforms which were to bring Europe out of or bring out of its torpor, which at that time was called \"eurosclerosis\". In reality, Simone Veil never really left public life until her death, and after having made her eternal by making her an academician, France is now questioning her elevation to the Pantheon. But it is right that, in this forum, too, Mr President, here in Strasbourg, a place so symbolic of this dual French and European destiny, tribute be paid to this truly exceptional character, the embodiment of our shared history and also the incarnation of our common future.

They belong to various political shades. These colleagues currently sit in the French Parliament. Consequently, their seat is vacant, but the French authorities refuse to communicate the names of their successors, on the grounds that appeals have been brought by various citizens against their election. It seems to me that this process is unfair, because these colleagues are now sitting in the French Parliament, regardless of the outcome of the appeal against them. It seems to me, therefore, that the parallelism of forms should lead the French authorities to communicate to you the names of their successors so that they can sit in the same way in the European Parliament, obviously awaiting the outcome of these recourse. This is the reason why, based on Article 4 of our Rules of Procedure, which provides that the President can address the national authorities to ask them to communicate the names of the successors for the vacant seats, I believe that this approach should be made by our President, with the support, I hope, of the President and members of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is responsible for the

It is indisputable that this project is of pan-European interest.

As a result, the European Union has adopted measures to approximate the rules of civil procedure of the Member States, which, however, are not sufficient. I call on the European Commission to propose a directive with specific recommendations for the establishment of common minimum standards in civil proceedings at European Union level. Citizens must be empowered to invoke the fundamental right to a fair trial and an effective remedy wherever they are in the Union, and to be able to assert those rights and to bring proceedings before the courts of other Member States as easily as in its Member State.

Moreover, the Russian authorities have imposed further restrictions on the Ukrainian economy, including the embargo on agri—food imports and the banning of transit of goods to Central Asia. This is the price the Ukrainians have to have to pay for their Euro—Atlantic aspirations. At the same time, it was necessary for us to address the concerns of EU producers and farmers, as well as the issues which are still problematic in our relations with Ukraine: corruption.

So how to allow coastal communities to survive, to maintain their traditions, to respect their vocation and to have a decent income? The coastal areas are naturally an attraction for tourism. It is therefore necessary to create spaces for fishermen as part of the services offered to tourists. Boat trips or fishing trips offered to tourists by chance and left free - and sometimes disorganized - initiatives are certainly not enough.

At the same time, fishing tourism is an opportunity to attract tourists and this is very important, especially in areas that are remote and insular. We must keep in mind that rod fishing, as the report states, offers various social benefits and is important for human health and well-being. At the same time, the socio-economic benefits of tourism will become apparent mainly during the summer season and I also consider this to be positive.

It seems to me that the boundary condition, the breach of which leads to numerous irregularities and pathologies, is forcing employees to adopt a flexible work base when we only want to increase productivity and competitiveness at the expense of employee rights. Thus, while we should not combat flexible forms of employment, effective mechanisms must be developed to prevent their abuse at the expense of employee rights.

Over the past few days, we have made real progress towards better coordinating our efforts between Parliament, Member States and the Commission. We need to maintain this positive dynamic. Only together can we achieve tangible results in the key areas where our citizens and businesses expect the Union to provide an effective part of the solution. The structured dialogue between Parliament and the Commission is working well, and together we have designed a focused and prioritised agenda. We have read the summary report from the Conference of Committee Chairs and I look forward to hearing your further input in our discussions today.  Halfway through its term of office, this Commission is effectively delivering on the 10 political priorities established at the outset, and on the basis of which this House approved our appointment. We have kept the focus on the big things, where effective European action can make a concrete difference in addressing the challenges facing Europe. Some of these challenges were predictable. Our digital agenda, for example, addresses the need to adapt to – and lead – the fourth industrial revolution that is underway. Others, such as the migration crisis, have evolved at a rate, and on a scale, that requires us all to be innovative and quick on our feet in finding ways to manage the situation effectively. Today we see what is happening in Italy, and we have just been discussing in the College of Commissioners today the series of immediate measures that can be taken by the EU Member States, the Commission, the EU agencies and Italy itself to accelerate our response to the pressing and dire situation in the central Mediterranean. The implementation of the 2017 Work Programme is well under way. We have many important proposals on the table and we will redouble our engagement with you and the Council in the coming months to ensure real progress on measures such as the European Pillar of Social Rights, where I look forward to the interinstitutional proclamation to be signed by Parliament, the Council and the Commission before the end of this year. The string of brutal terrorist attacks on European cities again shows that we must deliver on the European security agenda by reaching timely agreement on tackling money laundering and on the European Travel Information and Authorisation System. With rising security threats and instability in our neighbourhood, we need to make good progress on the European Defence Fund, and I see a lot of political momentum on this subject. In the autumn we will present further measures, including on tackling tax fraud and tax evasion and on EU company law. We will deliver on our circular economy strategy with important proposals on plastics. Commission President Juncker will deliver a State of the Union speech here in this House on 13 September. As usual, our letter of intent will be sent to you in parallel. On that basis, I look forward to further exchanges between us all. I hope that we will also have productive discussions with the Council in the latter part of this year so that we can adopt our Work Programme for 2018 on 24 October 2017. Our work next year will remain focused on delivering on the remaining actions provided for under our 10 priorities and the strategies for implementing them. We will pay particular attention, in terms of implementation, to the adoption of pending proposals. We will maintain a focus on regulatory fitness. The opinions of the REFIT Platform will feed into the discussions on the Commission Work Programme so that we continue to deliver on our shared policy ambitions without any unnecessary complexity. We want rules that will actually be implemented and thus bring real results on the ground, with a special focus on small and medium—sized enterprises. Indeed, above all, 2018 will be a key year for delivery. When this House rises for elections in 2019, citizens will judge for themselves whether Europe has done what they expected. The Commission will continue to be your loyal partner in helping to find compromises and reaching agreement on key legislative measures. The joint declaration on the EU’s legislative priorities, signed by the Presidents of our three institutions in December 2016, has proved very valuable. After six months, we have been able to complete work on terrorist offences and firearms and on boosting the Capital Markets Union. The day after tomorrow – on Thursday – you will vote on better access for blind and partially sighted people to copyright works, as well as on the European Fund for Sustainable Development to address the poor living standards and lack of work opportunities which push people to migrate. But more effort is now needed on legislative proposals that have not really progressed so far, including on the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the Common European Asylum System. This joint declaration process is not a matter of fast-tracking or undermining the quality of scrutiny and decision-making by the co-legislators. That would be counterproductive as it could only lead to poor results that do not address the challenges we face. But our cooperation does help to ensure that, where problems or delays arise, everyone is focused on finding solutions. We have shown with the European Border and Coast Guard and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) that, when we all work hard on a shared priority, we can achieve the right results at the right time. I hope that agreement on EFSI 2.0 is close in sight. So I look forward to the three Presidents’ agreeing later this year on a new joint declaration to shape our work for next year. All this programming and planning is not a bureaucratic process or a means in itself. Our dialogue about priorities is deeply political because it is about the sort of Europe we want to create. The Commission has launched a broad debate on the future of Europe with you and with national parliaments, with local and regional authorities, and with civil society at large. I count on your support in spurring an active, inclusive debate around where we want to be as the EU in the future, not just next year but also in the years to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 158, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "József SZÁJER", "mepid": "23821", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I will start where the Vice-President of the Commission stopped. Europe is still facing a crisis that we have not overcome yet, and that means much closer attention is required. We cannot just act like in normal peace times, so the exercise of determining the next year’s legislation is a very important debate. It is also a good way of mapping out how the various political parties here in Parliament are thinking about that. On behalf of the PPE I would like to say we still believe that a competitive social market economy is the cornerstone of the European society. We also have to be very careful and pay attention to citizens and their needs. In this framework I would like to say clearly that we have asked the Commission to make efforts to further improve the work-life balance. We have also asked the Commission to determine their key priority actions to strengthen industrial competitiveness, enable companies to compete in domestic and global markets and reinforce the capacity of the Union and its Member States to support the development of businesses, with special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. We also would like, in the context of completion of the digital single market, to see special attention paid to cyber security, interoperability and the digitalisation of the transport sector, including road safety. In the area of migration, which is the big challenge ahead of the European Union, we consider it of the utmost importance to tackle the root causes of migration by upgrading the Union’s development and cooperation policy in Africa as well as its role in the resolution of conflict in its neighbouring countries. The other area which citizens are demanding us to pay special attention to – and we are doing that by forwarding the demand to the Commission – is security, which, in both its internal and its external aspects, should be a priority, with commitments to the neighbourhood and to ensuring the stability and implementation of the European Defence Action Plan. In the financial area, we are expecting the Multiannual Financial Framework post-2020 and the proposal on own resources to be tabled by June 2018. This is very important if they are to correspond with the Commission’s and Parliament’s political cycles. Simplification of cohesion policy and the future of the common agricultural policy should be key elements. The PPE Group wants to insist on implementation. The Commission is taking the right course in that, instead of addressing the many areas where there is a demand from the left in this House for regulation, it is concentrating on how we implement the existing legislation.

This year is particularly important because we are also discussing the future of Europe, and Parliament should be involved in these discussions taking place everywhere. We are in a new situation. This is a kind of moment of truth, of clarification, because the right-wing political parties have decided to table their own resolution – a very conservative one, as we see it. Let me be precise. What is really needed in the European Union today? Progressive forces, and I believe the majority of citizens, are sure that we need to have a new growth and jobs strategy driven by sustainable development goals. This is very clear. Progressive forces and the majority of citizens know that we need a stronger social pillar, making sure that everybody – in whatever kind of job, including in the digital-economy transformation – has a decent labour contract and full access to social protection. We also need to make sure that we have the means to invest in people, particularly in children with the ‘Child Guarantee’. Well, I must say I find it regrettable that the motion tabled by the conservative forces in this Parliament does not agree with any of this. They do not include these requirements – which are so clear – in their motion. We also know that in order to really respect the Paris climate deal we need to translate our commitments into a real investment policy supported by the Union budget, and we know that in order to cope with the current refugee crisis the real solution is a European asylum system, which requires full reform of the Dublin regime. This is so clear. Nevertheless, it is not recognised by the right-wing coalition which is now organising the European Parliament. Finally, we know that, in order to cope with these external challenges, we need to strengthen internal cohesion among Europeans, and this means tackling the divergence in the eurozone, with the Banking Union and fiscal capacity being introduced. It also means having a forward-looking Community budget, counting on our own resources, based on corporate taxation, and based on energy emissions. We need to turn Europe to the future and not to the past. I believe that Parliament must be involved in the discussion which is coming in the European Council and everywhere.

We face many social and environmental difficulties, as has been outlined by Commissioner Timmermans, but I want to focus on the enormous economic challenges we face: competitiveness, the loss of jobs to overseas employers, low growth rates, eurozone stagnation. These have led to unemployment levels in parts of Europe that are far too high and poor wage growth that has led to stagnant household incomes for far too long.  So as the Commission designs its work programme for 2018, the foremost objective must be to address Europe’s economic weaknesses by pursuing measures that unleash and encourage the creative capacities of our entrepreneurs and businesses, especially SMEs. This will deliver benefits for the whole community. If we can get that right, so many of our other political, social and environmental problems will be easier to overcome. If we are economically weak, we will be dominated by others who may not share our democratic traditions or political principles, but if we are economically strong, we will be in a position to defend our values and promote our common interests in what will be a very difficult century ahead.  To help set an agenda of renewal, we have been pleased to work with the EPP and ALDE Groups on a joint motion. Of course, our Groups have very different political visions for Europe – there are many areas where we do not agree. But what we have in common is a desire to address Europe’s shared problems in a practical way, with a programme of constructive reform.

This morning I heard – I was not present myself – that President Juncker was very upset at the low turnout of MEPs in this room and called us ridiculous. Well, I would like to say that the absence of the Council is fairly ridiculous because we are three EU institutions, the Council representing the Member States and the Member States are responsible for a very important part of the implementation of the things that we are talking about today. We need the Council on board and yet the Council doesn’t seem to think that they need Europe or the Commission or Parliament. It is very symbolic that the Council is absent because we all know that there is a big problem in the implementation and the enforcement of European policies. Despite our occasional differences, the Commission and Parliament are usually singing from the same hymn sheet. We do our homework, we adopt policies and then the problems start because the Member States fail to implement. If I may give you one blatant example it is of course the famous EU Passenger Name Record Directive which had to be adopted in a big rush. So where are we now with the implementation? Absolutely nowhere. And this is typical for most of the files. When it comes to implementation and enforcement I would also like to look at the Commission because – yes – we are talking about important topics today that we would like the Commission to take initiatives on, but we would also like the Commission to be a bit more assertive when it comes to enforcing EU law against the Member States. We have been talking here a lot about issues relating to fundamental rights and the rule of law, but I am also thinking about something like Dieselgate. Why does it have to be the Americans who take action, who find out? Why isn’t it our own authorities? If we agree that it is the national authorities that implement EU policies we have to be absolutely sure that that is what they are doing: implementing, applying, enforcing the policies. Because if they fail to do that then they should not have that power; then it should be at EU level. Another request to the Commission: we note that when it comes to files relating to, for example, fighting terrorism, there is a systematic absence of impact assessments. Can we please make sure that from now on, every proposal relating to the fight against terrorism and crime will be accompanied by an impact assessment? Finally to my colleague Ms Rodrigues, who referred to us as conservative right-wing forces. I think that is very funny because when it is about other topics I am usually accused of being left-wing, so whatever. I am probably in the middle. I would say, you know, conservative forces are right-wing and left-wing these days. On your topic of a social Europe, the Liberals are very much for a free Europe but also for a fair Europe. And that means fair opportunities for everybody, and confusion is often in social Europe equates a socialist Europe, well we see it differently. We believe in opportunities, in opening our borders and giving young people access to the labour market, rather than replacing outdated social security systems at national level with one at the European level. Let’s finally give young people an opportunity. People have been excluded from the labour market – yes, dear colleague – excluded from the labour market. Let’s finally give them the same chances as those who are already in a job.

However, it was not until 1997 that it was banned in Europe. In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of lives have been ruined or lost.

Despite growing opposition from our fellow citizens, you persist in wanting to conclude tailor-made free trade agreements for multinationals, like, again this week, with Japan. Ten years after the onset of the global financial crisis, what do we see?

As for your recommendations on work, they are based on a totem: flexibilize, flexibilize and flexibilize. Mr. Timmermans, when you talk about better regulation, who do you mean? To our fellow citizens or to the owners of capital? When you talk about impact analysis, are you talking about impact on life or impact on profits?

It is often said that one should solve the causes of a problem, not just treat the symptoms. I would like to say that there are simpler solutions to the migration crisis, which is the crisis we should be talking about all the time in this House. The crisis created by an overly generous immigration policy in, above all, countries such as Sweden, with a well-meaning thought in itself, but which in practice is catastrophically counterproductive for the well-being of a democratic state. In addition, the crisis is caused by the enormous population growth that is taking place outside Europe and the dysfunctional nature of these areas and countries, which results in high unemployment and very bleak future prospects. In Italy, economic migrants are mainly pouring in right now. Some days there will be thousands. The solution is not to arrange a mandatory redistribution from Italy to the rest of Europe. It's like pouring water out of the boat but not plugging the hole in the boat, if I am allowed to use such a parable in these contexts. The Commission and some Home Affairs Ministers presented a solution on this day, which will, among other things, help the Libyan Coast Guard to better patrol its coast. We also want to help Libya secure their enormously long southern border. It is not said who will do this. It sounds like building a new state apparatus in Libya, which will be a big challenge. I have a simpler solution. Return asylum legislation to each country. Give Italy the right to limit the number of people seeking asylum. Decide on a break in asylum applications, or why not the right to say no to the boats from various organizations that are currently basically transporting migrants almost all the way from the Libyan coast to Italy.

From 2001 to 2016, corporation tax in the EU member states has fallen from 30% to 22% on average. It is a race to the bottom between the countries of Europe, not to create growth, but to steal growth from each other. It's deep good night! It is not a Europe that works together, but a Europe that cheats itself for billions of tax dollars. It must be stopped now! Therefore, we need a common corporate tax base and a common consolidated corporate tax base. But not only that: for the companies that earn the most, tax evasion costs every citizen in the EU 15,000 kroner in lost welfare every year due to tax havens, tax evasion, aggressive tax planning. That is why we must have a common European blacklist of tax havens with harsh, automatic and cash sanctions for both tax havens and the companies and wealthy individuals who use them. Finally, the EU to-do list for 2018 should create new jobs and protect existing ones.

Because the initiatives taken by the Commission, which are meritorious, in the field of clean energy for example, were taken before the implementation and assessment of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

In connection with this, I would also like to draw attention to the conclusions of our EMIS committee of inquiry, which has put forward very ambitious goals and new initiatives with regard to the Euro 7 standard.

The European Consensus for Development and the monitoring of institutional and political changes are indispensable tools for the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the UN global development goals. Working with the private sector is an essential part of achieving these goals, and mobilizing private funding is essential in addressing the root causes of illegal migration. However, in order to monitor the implementation of instruments such as the Trust Fund for Africa or the new European Fund for Sustainable Development and to regularly evaluate their effectiveness, a specific reporting mechanism and adequate parliamentary oversight are necessary. Promoting democracy, good governance and respect for human rights is key to building security in partner countries. Therefore, when working towards peace and stability, account should be taken of the updated ODA criteria in this regard.

But I have to say that my role in this debate is to listen very carefully to you and take note, and that what you have said is then duly reflected in the preparation of our work programme when we come back. I hope for some understanding of the fact that I am not going to go into individual questions which, by the way, sometimes have nothing to do with the Commission work programme. What I see in the contributions of your Members, Madam President, is a great ambition to tackle the huge problems Europe is facing. Migration: very clearly, we are tackling today what is an unacceptable situation in Italy, and European solidarity is warranted. And urgently warranted, because the Italian people have shown an incredible level of humanitarian outreach to people in need, but they cannot be left alone in solving this problem. And that is when Europe needs to act. The same applies to the situation on the Greek islands. It is a lot better than a year or a year and a half ago, but still far from being solved, and we need European approaches to solve those problems. Many Members mentioned the issue of inequalities in Europe. At every level, the crises we have faced over the past couple of years have increased inequalities. And, if I understood this House correctly, fighting these inequalities is something Members see, broadly across this Chamber, as one of the priorities for next year. We are talking not just about inequalities within the Member States and between social groups and because so many people were left behind in the crisis, but also about inequalities between Member States. The whole idea of European integration and the structural funds and all the influence we have is to create convergence between Member States. Ms Morvai, you draw attention to big wage differences between Member States which have a disruptive effect. If you can create economic convergence, wage divergences will decrease. And we need to use the opportunity in the coming years to use the instruments we have already put in place: the digital single market; the energy union – extremely important – perfecting the internal market – still a lot to do – creating a fairer tax system, helping Member States to do that and also making sure that multinationals pay taxes – these are all steps that we need to take in the next couple of years. I fully understand the depth of the challenge, but where I would like to caution you a bit is not to be too gloomy about where we are. Unemployment is decreasing, and sometimes even quite rapidly. There are more jobs in Europe than ever before. Youth unemployment remains too high, but there are also elements of hope. Economic growth is increasing in every single Member State. A year ago, a prominent politician in the country I know best said there would be a patriotic spring in Europe this year. He said this because he thought there would be a wave of ultra-nationalism breaking up our European cooperation and the European Union. What have we seen? Indeed, a patriotic spring! A European patriotic spring, because after the election in the United States the rest of the world is looking to Europe to make sure the Paris Agreement will stand, and to take the lead in making sure the Paris Agreement will stand. After the election in the United States, other parts of the world are looking to Europe to create free and, above all, fair trade agreements so that we maintain the values and economic growth that we stand for. Europeans have come together. European leaders have met in Bratislava and in Rome to say that they want to chart the future of Europe together and not be left alone or think that they can find solutions individually. This is the background against which we will formulate next year’s programme. Yes, the challenges are daunting. Yes, we still have a lot of problems, but things are looking better than a year ago, better than two years ago. We have things to build on, we have opportunities to create a dynamic at the European level that will make Europe the global leader in many of the main issues the world is facing today and tomorrow.

First, an adequate response to high unemployment, and especially youth unemployment, which remains high in a number of Member States, including Bulgaria.

Secondly, a workable digitalisation strategy is needed that takes into account not only the needs of businesses but also those of citizens. In the EU, 40% of workers do not have digital skills.

The EU global strategy was adopted about a year ago. It is the prelude to an unprecedented expansion of European military structures. Important interests are an open and fair economic system and access to resources. In order to be literally prepared for this in the future, the EU global strategy calls for the development of top military capabilities at the same time, and this is exactly what is now being massively started. Even if the opposite is constantly being claimed - the vast majority of the population does not want this militarization. What people want is a peaceful, democratic and social European Union - today more than ever. And what are you doing? Exactly the opposite! Some examples: As part of the so-called permanent structured cooperation, important parts of the EU's foreign and security policy are to be placed in the hands of a few countries. How might that affect the EU skepticism that already exists in many countries? As one of the goals of the EU peace project, no country should ever regain supremacy in Europe. Yes, how much do you want to deny reality? The big and richer countries - above all Germany - are telling the others more and more where to go economically and militarily. That's bad, that's dangerous. Next example: The new EU headquarters has existed since June. It is declared to simplify and accelerate military operations in the future. But that is not what the citizens want. In Germany, for example, over 80% of the population want fewer, not more, military operations. Yes, for many, all of the Western military interventions of the past few years are part of the problem, not the solution. You too, Ms. Mogherini, always say: people want security, they want security from the EU. Of course, who doesn't want security? But more Guns and more military do not bring more security. This is mainly about access to raw materials. And by the way: For the majority of people, security also means social security, and unfortunately the EU doesn't have much to offer here, especially not for the people in Southern Europe. That is why most of them do not want to spend more money on armaments in view of the social imbalances - money that is needed much more urgently elsewhere. But no, it will go purposefully in the other direction. For the first time in the next EU budget, an armaments budget - known as the Defense Fund - is to be set up with a total of EUR 38.5 billion, although the EU treaties prohibit expenditure on military policy from being taken from the EU budget. It is in the paragraph on the CSVP. But according to the motto “what does not fit, is made suitable”, the prohibition is to be circumvented, a different chapter is simply taken for armaments money - no longer in the chapter on CSDP, but quickly relocated to the promotion of competition. Well, one can really lose faith in the law. Dear colleagues, once again: the citizens want a democratic, peaceful and social Europe. Act on it at last!

By the way, this is why, for the first time in two and a half years, I am sitting on this side of the Hemicycle because it is clear in our Treaties and in the work that we have done that the work on EU security and defence lies in the hands of the Council competences. Last year we started on strong, unanimous – still at 28 – and sustained work to respond to the need for security of our citizens. Let me say first of all that security and a European approach to security is a priority for all European citizens. No matter in which country – east, west, north, south – and no matter what kind of political background our citizens have, European defence and security is mentioned as a top priority in all the Eurobarometer surveys that have been conducted in the last year or so.  Second, we realise that we have to make full use of the instruments that the Lisbon Treaty gives to the European Union. This is an issue on which Parliament has always been very strong, demanding the full use of all the instruments we have – I remember very well that in the hearing I had in the Committee on Foreign Affairs at the beginning of my mandate, this was a point that was very strongly made – so it is not something that was started as a reaction to some external factors, or semi—external factors like the British referendum, but there were some accelerating elements or, I would say, factors that intensified the political will to make security and defence in the European Union one of the fields where the Council wants to relaunch the European Union integration process.  This is why in Rome, during the celebrations for the 60th anniversary of our Treaty, this field was clearly indicated as one of the priority fields for the relaunch of the European Union.  Clearly not the only one, and here comes the picture in which we do our work on security and defence, because I want to clarify, first, that our work is not leading to a militarisation of the European Union. This is not leading to a European Union army. If there is anyone in the world that knows the power of soft power, the need to combine different instruments, the need to have an integrated approach in responding to crises and conflicts, in using all different tools from the diplomatic to the humanitarian, development, economic and cultural, it is the European Union.  There is a genuine European way to security and defence. It is made of civilian and military means together, hard and soft power together, cooperation with our partners, and also strategic autonomy. Let me say that, in particular in times such as these, if we want to be able and free to do security in our own European way, we need to strengthen our own capabilities and capacity to act also as a security provider for our citizens, and also for our partners in the world. The European Union not only is, but will stay, the most relevant donor of humanitarian and development aid. That is going to remain. We are going to stay the main pillar of the multilateral system based on the UN agencies and UN values and principles, as well as on the approach that preventing a conflict is always better than dealing with it militarily.  We know very well that there is no single crisis or threat in the world that can be dealt with through a purely military approach. This is the European way to security and I want there to be no doubt about the fact that this approach is not changing. But, at the same time, we can – and we must – do better and more efficiently on defence and security in the narrow sense of the word. I often say that security for us is also development cooperation, climate change action, investment in peacekeeping, and so on. Having said that, we also have a responsibility to use the instruments we have when it comes to security and defence in the narrow sense. As I said, this work has been taken forward in the follow-up to the EU global strategy since last summer. It includes the work done by the Commission – on which Jyrki Katainen and Elżbieta Bieńkowska will share more details with you – and includes work that has been taken forward in full cooperation with NATO in line with the joint declaration signed at the NATO Warsaw Summit last July.  I also want to be very clear on this: the work we are doing to strengthen European defence is also a matter of strengthening NATO and is beneficial for both. Last week I reported with Jens Stoltenberg on the 42 joint actions that the European Union and NATO have taken together as organisations different in nature but both contributing to European security.  Let me also recall that the decision on defence budgets – spending more on defence – is not a matter for the European Union institutions but for national governments and national parliaments. So a debate about how much we should spend is not for here. This is a national competence. The whole two—percent debate is for Member States that are also allied in NATO. It is not for the European Union to tackle this. But, regardless of how much Member States decide to spend, what the European Union can – and must – do is help them spend better and more efficiently, which means spending together.  I always quote two numbers: Europeans invest in defence 50% of what Americans do, but the output of European investments in defence is 15%. So there is an investment gap. This is not for us to tackle. It is a national sovereign choice, but the output gap – how efficient the investment is in output – is something the European Union can help with. So it is not about militarising, but about rationalising. It is about the efficiency of the investments, namely how we can use our resources with economies of scale – that is the point – and also how we can use the instruments for acting together as a Union in the world. I will mention a few concrete steps that either have already been taken or are ongoing with decisions already taken in the Council – either the Foreign Affairs Council or the European Council recently – with the support of the EEAS and the European Defence Agency. You often think that I have two hats, but I actually have three hats because I also have the European Defence Agency and, in this case, the Agency is proving its added value. First, we will enhance the coordination of national defence plans through the new coordinated annual review on defence. A trial run of the review will already be carried out this autumn.  Second, we will launch an inclusive and ambitious permanent structure cooperation (PESCO). This is based on more binding commitments between Member States to jointly develop and deploy military capabilities. A few weeks ago the European Council agreed that a common list of criteria and binding commitments will be drawn up within three months. This should pave the way for notifications to the Council to start the formal process of establishing a permanent structure cooperation and I am confident that this process can be done before the December European Council if Member States are coherent with their commitment to proceed in this way. Third, the Commission – and here I will not enter into the work that has been done with Jyrki Katainen and Elżbieta Bieńkowska – has set up proposals for a European Defence Fund with, by the way, excellent interinstitutional cooperation and coordination that I think is also exemplary for other fields of action. I think that will continue in the months to come. The ideal would be to have PESCO projects financed by the European Defence Fund. Fourth, work has been launched to make the Battlegroups – launched and established exactly ten years ago – fully deployed. We have never deployed them and this will be addressed during the review of the Athena mechanism in the second half of this year. Fifth, we have established the first ever command centre in Brussels for the operational planning and conduct of military training and advisory missions. This capability is already providing support and guidance to our training missions in Mali, Somalia and the Central African Republic and is working closely with our civilian command centre to strengthen the synergies between our missions. Sixth, and finally, we are also working to improve our civilian crisis management to make it more responsive and make sure it has all the capabilities it needs. All six of these measures have either already been taken or are underway with a speed that is quite remarkable – a few months of work – and a unity – all these decisions were taken unanimously at 28 in the Council – and with a great sense of unity and responsibility. Let me add that the work on the future of European defence should not make us underestimate the current work of European defence. We have today men and women in EU uniforms serving under the EU flag, already contributing to the security of our citizens and our own region. Just last month, a Portuguese surgeon who served in our training mission in Mali was killed in the terrorist attack in Bamako.  We should honour the men and women that are serving peace under the EU flag. Our EU men and women are supporting our African partners in their work for peace and security in extremely challenging environments. Our training missions are supporting the local security forces as they fight against terrorism or against criminal networks. This is the European way.  We are a cooperative power and a multilateral power, always believing in an integrated approach, always believing in prevention. We are a force for peace and human development. This is how and what we are, and this is how and what we will continue to be, with more instruments to serve this way of working on security. We are – even more so – a security provider for our citizens and for our partners and this is how we use our military: in the service of peace, in the service of the UN Charter, and in the service of multilateralism.  Developing EU strategic autonomy to do so is even more important today than it was in all the previous decades. A stronger European Union in the field of security and defence is good for Europeans and good for the rest of the world.

We have had excellent team work in the Commission and with the High Representative/Vice-President, so the Member States and the Commission have worked together in order to identify possible tools to deploy for defending our values.  This discussion here in the European Parliament is as important, because we have to identify the strong political will, in which direction, and how deep we want to go in order to protect our values. Actually the rapporteur said rightly that a peaceful, democratic EU is our peoples’ core value. These are not only core values here in Europe, but they are the same values that we represent outside Europe, and that is why we need the capability to defend our core values both inside Europe and outside Europe. And this is the reason we are talking about the future of security and defence today. The High Representative/Vice President already mentioned a few concrete political issues, like finding solutions to pad up group financing. This would be a significant improvement in our capability to defend our values. Also, a NATO-EU declaration is not only a political declaration, but also a very concrete action plan on how the two organisations can work together in order to get better output, as the High Representative/Vice-President mentioned. I encourage Member States and the European Parliament to be active in developing deeper security and defence cooperation. PESCO offers an excellent opportunity for this, and, generally speaking, our Treaties allow the Member States to do basically whatever they want. One important and necessary opportunity would be to create a European cyber and hybrid defence capability, but everything depends on the political will – the political will of this House, and the political will of the Member States. Let us be clear: it is not the Commission’s power trap. It is a matter of timing and the level of ambition on the Member States’ side. Equally important, NATO will remain a provider of security in Europe that a stronger Europe will reinforce. Our proposals are complementary to NATO. Two weeks ago, the Commission adopted its reflection paper on the future of European defence, a communication on the European Defence Fund and a proposal for a European defence industrial development programme.  With the reflection paper, we have launched a debate on what role the EU will have in the future in this very important area. We have proposed three scenarios, which range from a security and defence cooperation scenario, under which Member States would still decide on the need for security and defence cooperation on a voluntary and case-by-case basis, to a much more ambitious common defence and security scenario, which foresees the progressive framing of a common union defence policy, leading to common defence. While the three scenarios differ in the level of ambition, they all present a step in the same direction: strengthening European defence.  Now we need an honest debate on the kind of future we see for Europe in defence policy. Therefore, the debate today in the European Parliament is very welcome. When looking at the economic side of defence cooperation, we do everything 28 times – or, in the future, 27 times – so the problem is that we duplicate everything so many times that the application problem with NATO is not a relevant problem, because nobody wants to do it. Duplication also has a price tag. The lack of cooperation in defence and security between Member States is estimated to cost annually between EUR 25 billion to EUR 100 billion. This is not an efficient way to use our resources. How should such a large amount of money be used? We must do it efficiently to ensure the best security the taxpayers deserve. For this reason, we have created the European defence fund, which has three different angles.  The first angle is defence research funding. Research organisations can apply together for the funding of collaborative research projects from the EU budget. We want to change the way defence research is done in Europe, pulling together both human and material resources. We have allocated this year EUR 25 million, and with your support we will allocate next year EUR 40 million and EUR 25 million in 2019 – altogether EUR 90 million in three years.  The second angle is support for joint development of capabilities, using the EU budget to incentivise joint development of prototypes. To qualify for support under the European defence industrial development programme, there must be at least three companies from a minimum of two countries which can apply to build joint prototypes, for example in drone or satellite projects. For 2019-2020 we have re-allocated resources from the EU budget worth EUR 500 million for these purposes. Our proposal is that for the next Multiannual financial framework (MFF) period the EU budget funding will be EUR one billion per year. With the support of Member States co—financing the programme, we could generate a total investment of EUR five billion per year. This will be a game changer in terms of strengthening defence research and industrial capabilities, and it makes our public spending more effective. Importantly, the fund is not only for big countries and big projects, but also for small countries and for smaller companies in the defence value chain. We want to make sure that everybody can participate.  Finally, the defence fund is meant to help Member States to do joint acquisitions of capabilities. Instead of buying capability separately, Member States could do it jointly using different types of financial models, and these can range from pooling to debt financing and can help overcome challenges of different budget cycles and reduce the cost for individual Member States. Honourable Members, this is one of the biggest challenges for our future. We have to make sure that we can protect our values inside Europe, but also externally.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 201, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President!

As the EU will act as initiator, facilitator and reinforcer of cooperation and collaboration between the Member States, the latter will remain in control. But as we begin this journey together, I would like to warn against the possible temptation in the future of imposing certain measures, particularly if considered in line with some other measures representing EU reform in general. To my mind, the highest probability for that to happen is in relation to the single defence market, a major component of the future European defence union. Although eliminating the current fragmentation and duplication in the European defence industry – a product of historical evolution – is desirable, politically this should be done better through integration rather than through buying-out, even if accompanied by compensation, as some suggest.  Moreover, a strict buy-European in defence would be politically justified only in the event that the EU increases its corresponding share in the territorial defence of the Member States. Otherwise, as long as NATO, with the US in the lead, remains the main security provider for the EU NATO Member States, the appeal to buy European, leaving aside the important questions relating to availability, price and location of production, would be likely to remain minimal, particularly in the east.  In general, my feeling is that the eastern-flank Member States would favour the development of cooperation between the EU and NATO along the current lines, with each organisation doing what they are best at, rather than, as some suggest, attempting to create and consolidate an EU pillar within NATO. However, let us remember that working to align the strategic cultures of the Member States would alleviate many of these potential barriers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 203, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Geoffrey VAN ORDEN", "mepid": "4513", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, listening to Ms Mogherini and Mr Katainen you would imagine we are starting from scratch on defence. We have very fine, capable armed forces right across Europe. We have a well-tried defence alliance, NATO, which binds the United States to European security and in which, with two very minor exceptions, all the EU Member States are fully involved as members. So why does the European Union want to create autonomous defence structures? We all know it is about European political integration. That is what it is about. Listening to Ms Mogherini you would imagine that an EU army has already been created, although everyone denies that they want an EU army. So you need to make up your minds, Commissioners. Do you want it or don’t you want it? What is the latest justification? Well, we used to hear a lot about the comprehensive approach. Interestingly, in this reflection paper on European defence, the words ‘comprehensive approach’ are not mentioned once. Instead we get a new justification and it is all about figures. It is all about the numbers of tanks and aircraft and things being produced across Europe, and invidiously comparing these with the capability of the United States. For example, it says the United States has just one type of main battle tank while the European Union has 17. This, of course, is complete nonsense. Realistically, there are two main battle tanks in Europe – the German Leopard II and the British Challenger II. The same with fighter aircraft: the US has six main types in service, and, according to this, the European Union countries have 20. This is complete nonsense. Basically there are two main fighter aircraft in service in the main European Air Forces – Tornado and Euro Fighter. Some also have the American F-16, of course, and the French went their own way with Rafael and the Mirage 2000 series. These arguments just do not stand up to scrutiny, and why are you doing this, Commissioners?

More than two thirds of our European citizens are right to ask that Europe invest more in European defense! So I welcome the proposals you are making here today. I honestly think we have made more progress in the last two years than in the last 60 years. Defense was a key issue in the creation of the European Union, but we have relied on the Americans for far too long to ensure our security. It is very clear to us liberals: the most ambitious scenario is the only scenario that will help us. The Commission presents three scenarios. For us liberals a real European defense union, and as for me personally, I would very much like to move towards a real European army. That may be a step too far for many, but I believe that if we are to ensure the safety of our citizens, it is the most necessary step. Ms. Mogherini has rightly quoted the figures: 50% of the US defense budget, an output of 15%. There are studies that say that we waste between 26 and 100 billion euros a year by not working together! So please let's do it now. Also NATO's argument, with Trump's statements, with Brexit on its way. If we don't take those steps now, Europe will be doomed.

You are calling for investment in the defense sector, for the strengthening of the military industry and for the development of the Union's military capabilities, so that it can be a stronger partner in the military sector. You are proposing the creation of permanent military structures and a European defense fund, with a budget of € 5.5 billion a year to finance war systems. Really, who is the enemy we must defend ourselves against? Especially when, instead of denouncing the wars and invasive policies of NATO and the US, further cooperation and full cooperation with their policies is announced. Not only will these proposals not benefit the Union, but they will have catastrophic consequences. They will condemn the people to poverty, exile, misery and insecurity. Instead of investing in a new pillar of militarization and proposing an even less social Europe, use the Union's funds for social development and social solidarity. The Union has a duty to take initiatives for full demilitarization, for peace to prevail and for the promotion of social prosperity.

This week, the Commission launched no less than three proposals for increased ambitions in the field of defense, and it is not possible to debate the defense union without talking about all three parts of the package, and they are in turn also part of a long-running trend to shift focus from civilian efforts to more military, not least in terms of budget. So we should discuss both the basis for discussion on the future of EU defense, the new Defense Aid Fund for Member States and an investment aid program for the arms industry. The scenarios that the Commission paints in the discussion paper include a proposal to gradually transform the EU into a military alliance. But instead of turning the EU into a NATO 2.0, we want to green that we increase cooperation on the civilian tasks that the Treaty of Lisbon already states that the EU should deal with, such as. crisis preparedness, conflict prevention, mediation and peacekeeping operations. The 28 EU countries have a total of 178 different weapon systems. The USA has 30. We have 17 different tanks, the USA has one. We have 29 different ship models, the United States has 4. We have 20 different fighter jets, the United States has 6, while the United States has twice the budget. The Commission addresses this issue of overcapacity, fragmentation and inefficiency in its documents, and we can only agree with that. If the countries cooperate and coordinate their production better, then everyone is a winner. However, in order to solve the problem, the Commission is proposing that cooperating Member States receive lubricants from EU funds to bring about this cooperation, which has been on the table for several years, but which is not due to a lack of will in the Member States. The EU already spends more than 200 billion euros on defense every year - most in the world after the United States. The problem is not that there is a lack of money, but what operational capability we get for them, and we think it is the wrong way to go with a militarization of the EU budget because the money tend to be taken from civilian spending areas such as aid or humanitarian peacekeeping operations.This case will also involve reduced budgets for the European Investment Bank, the Strategic Investment Fund, SME programs, regional development, Erasmus +, Copernicus and others.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 207, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "As I take my seat in this rostrum, I would like to remind you that we are in a topical debate and that, according to the rules, this does not involve any intervention on demand or a blue card.Here, I take the liberty of reminding a certain number of colleagues who signal to me for blue cards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 208, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Bill ETHERIDGE", "mepid": "124951", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Madam President, I think that after this I am going to have to report to the doctor because I think I am having a hallucination.

First, we don't have an investment gap, we have a huge crater of inefficiency. We don't just duplicate, we triplicate and quadruple, and that doesn't make sense! The first would be to apply the 2009 procurement guideline consistently before you want to spend more money. Second: At a time when Mr Oettinger is discussing whether we are missing 12 billion or 20 billion in the European budget, it makes no sense to say that we are now spending additional money on defense from practically all funds that can be found ! Third: In the third scenario, conceiving the EU as a kind of second NATO is completely absurd. Second NATO without the USA would either mean that the idea of ​​strategic autonomy is a dangerous self-deception, or one has to consistently resort to the European atomic bomb. And fourthly: I find it completely unbearable that the idea about the governance of these expenditures also includes provision for industry to be allowed to operate self-service, because it should have a say in what money is spent on armaments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 227, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Janice ATKINSON", "mepid": "124938", "text": "   – Madam President, another new shiny building, stuffed full of six-figure salary functions.

It was never clearer that Europe must become a security provider and to ensure progressively its own security, because currently no Member State is strong enough to meet on their own the evolving threats and challenges we are facing. So this is definitely – and I want to underline this – not about militarisation. This is definitely not about grabbing any power from the Member States. This is about securing and ensuring Europe’s strategic autonomy, and for this we need a very competitive European defence industrial base, a European defence industrial sector, and with the European defence fund this is what we aim to achieve. This is the industrial pillar of our action; this is the one we are moving together quite fast. The defence fund will support the whole capability development life cycle, as we mentioned before – as Jyrki Katainen mentioned – from research through prototype development to joint procurement and acquisition, which is very important for us.  The Commission is for the first time making all its efforts, using all its tools – including the EU budget – to support and promote stronger defence cooperation, especially on the industrial front. This is important, both from a strategic perspective and from an economic perspective. A few more details: a single market in defence is not in contradiction with the European defence fund. On the contrary, with the European defence fund we want to open the defence supply chain cross-border. There is a very high need to build trust at the level of industrial cooperation, and through the EDF I hope – and I am sure – we will do that. I also want to underline the importance of the procurement and transfer directive, and I want to commit to doing my best to execute both of them. On one more thing – maybe a little too detailed, but I think it is important to answer the question – we have taken the specificities of defence in building the European defence industrial plan. We are fully aware of those specificities. That is why, as I said, it is not about grabbing power. The Member States will stay in the lead; they will decide on the priorities, on the capabilities, and finally on the projects, so this is not the role of the European Commission. Everything will be owned by the Member States, and the Member States only.  Thank you very much for your cooperation; I am looking forward to our future discussions, and I also count on your support during our work on the adoption of the whole plan.

The European Union is not a military alliance. It is not meant to become a military alliance, and that is why the work we are doing, in parallel to strengthen European defence and to strengthen EU-NATO cooperation, is working so well. I do not know where one of the speakers got the information that NATO and the NATO Secretary-General are not supportive of this process because the Secretary-General has repeatedly, publicly and privately, stressed the fact that strengthening European defence also strengthens the Transatlantic Alliance. I am ready and, as always, willing to discuss different political views, but at least starting from the facts and the actual objectives that we have in reality. Let me clarify this too: there is a cost for the European Union not working together on defence, and what the Commission is doing in relation to the industrial base is a clear demonstration of that. The fragmentation of investment has a cost for the budget – for the taxpayers’ money that we often refer to. It is not the case that we are investing more on defence, because you might have noticed that Member States – as I see every day in dealing with Defence Ministers, Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers –have their own national defence budgets. They have their own investments; they have their own capabilities. We are not working to increase that. We are working to make that spending and investment more efficient by making investments together among Member States, with the support of all the EU institutions. Also, Member States own one single set of forces and they are perfectly capable of deciding whether to use their forces in EU missions and operations, in UN missions, in NATO missions or in their own bilateral or multilateral initiatives. Investing in strengthening cooperation among Member States on defence makes it possible for Member States, which in some cases are also NATO allies (there are five Member States that are not NATO allies), free to make their own strategic choices. We are not building a European army. I understand that, for political reasons, or propaganda reasons, some of you want to continue to refer to this, but this is not the reality of the facts. We do have headquarters of our military and civilian missions and operations and, by the way, I would like to remind our friends in the UK that one of our headquarters is currently in the UK. It is the headquarters of the European Union’s Operation Atalanta. After the UK leaves we will probably have to move the headquarters somewhere else. But we do have EU mission and operation headquarters currently working to support ongoing EU operations and missions. What is the reality here? It is that we need to make the system of command and planning of the existing operations and missions more effective because having a fragmented system of headquarters – as anyone who deals with military issues a little bit knows and understands – is not necessarily the most effective way of managing a military operation. So this is not about building a big headquarters. It is not about creating a headquarters of the same kind as the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE): it is about rationalising the existing headquarters that we have spread around everywhere, including in the UK. By the way, I would like to stress that all the decisions we have taken so far, the ones that have been already implemented and the ones that have yet to be implemented but are on the way, have been decided unanimously by all the 28 Member States, with the UK fully involved, sitting at the table of the Council that I chair and fully participating in the decision making. And I am very happy about that. Some of you mentioned, I think, that this can be one of the fields in which future cooperation with the future third-party UK might be explored. Another point: what are our militaries doing? I would like to clarify this because our militaries are not making war. Our militaries are supporting peace. This is the European Union way to security, and I would like us to be very clear about that, because it is also a way of honouring our men and women serving under the EU flag. They are there for us. Just as national parliaments are responsible for the national participation of men and women in uniform in military missions or civilian operations, we as European institutions have the responsibility to recognise and honour the work that men and women in uniform are doing serving the EU around the world. I believe we need a reality check here. Our militaries are saving people in the Mediterranean Sea. Our militaries are training and supporting African security forces in trying to implement agreements or carrying out peacekeeping. This is the kind of work that our EU militaries are doing. I would ask some of the honourable Members, please, to refer to the reality of the facts and not to ideas they want to use for a political purpose, because this is where the roots of so many European problems lie. We have to start from the reality of the work we are doing. Last, but not least, two small points. One of you referred, and rightly so, to the need for all our work on defence to start from the security needs we have assessed. That is perfectly correct: it is exactly what we are doing. That is why the sequence of our work began with an assessment of the security environment. That was done last year. Then came the presentation of the global strategy identifying the strategic priorities for our foreign policy and security policy, including in the defence sector. Only after having shared a common level of ambition, which was achieved in November, are we now strengthening our approach to capabilities and the industrial base. So the sequence is clearly this: we start from the security needs and then we develop the instruments we need to fulfil this level of ambition. A last point on financial resources. If we, the Commission, Council and Parliament, set a target for our level of ambition, a target for what we want to do on security and defence at European Union level, then – and I see Commissioner Oettinger here in the room, so it is an appropriate time to say this – we also have to define how we finance the level of ambition we set ourselves.

In Europe, we spend 1.3% of the EU's GDP on defense, while in the USA around 4%. The problem, however, lies not only in too low defense budgets, but also in the very poor effectiveness of their use. By spending 50% of the US budget, Europe has only 15% of the combat capability of the US Army. The dire situation concerns especially research into new military technologies and implementation of new technologies. Therefore, I consider it advisable to create a special defense fund in the EU budget, which would allocate EUR 500 million annually to research and EUR 500 million to the implementation of new technologies.

In March of this year, the Commission took a comprehensive look at the European Union in a White Paper, ventured an outlook and presented the future of Europe in different ways with five options. This White Paper process leads to the European Parliament, leads to the Council, leads to our social partners, to our citizens, to the European public. We are keeping the White Paper process for the European Union, the EU-27, on the way in, particularly along some of the most recent developments, such as the goal of our British friends to leave, but also along with important challenges that our citizens have to face and through the next decade for a good offer. Building on this, we have now presented five reflection papers over the past few weeks - papers for thinking, thinking. The social dimension of Europe, defense - Mrs Mogherini just spoke about this - deepening economic and monetary union, we have considered globalization and what this means for jobs and the European internal market, and now we have the reflection paper a few days ago on Europe's finances 2025, the future. That roughly coincides with the preparations for the next multiannual financial framework, which will apply from January 2021 and which must be worked out together with you over the next few months for the five or five plus five or seven years of the next decade. It is very important to me that our paper is open-ended. We don't have any priorities yet, no preliminary determinations, no preliminary decisions, but we ask the questions that arise. We point out the problems we have. We show the opportunities that Europe has and then give different answers without preference. That is why the paper on finances is in An invitation for the next decade, a starting shot for a public debate - first and foremost with this House, the European Parliament, but also with national parliaments, the governments, the Council, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee, ours Citizens. And I would like to ask that you, as outstanding personalities in your home country, in your regions, in your constituencies, also promote this debate. It is possible that President Juncker's State of the Union address in September will discuss initial preferences and insights. In any case, we want to propose conclusions to Parliament and the Council and the European Council for December or for the first quarter of next year. According to our legislation, the Commission is required to present its proposal for the next financial framework before the end of the year. Our preparatory work is also well advanced. But two important foundations are not yet in place either at the moment or in the next few months. On the one hand, if we want to take the White Paper process seriously and implement it credibly, then we have to wait for the detailed statements from Parliament, national parliaments, Member States, the public and the social partners, then evaluate them and then weight them - option five, that is option three , two, one and four or a mix of several options. But this will not be possible until the end of the year at the earliest, more likely in the first quarter of next year. More seriously, if the financial framework - the Commission's proposal for the next MFF - is to include budgetary clarity, budgetary truth, realism, then we need to know what the financial implications of our British friends' exit will be. We assume that there will be no serious problems with the implementation of the current financial framework. I am grateful to the British - me come back to it later - that they accepted the mid-term review. 2018 is a budget that is on stable footing. 2019 from the end of March: our expectation that the rights and obligations of the MFF will be honored by 28 member states. 2020 the same case. Let's wait and see. Then there are subsequent commitments which Mr Barnier will have to talk about with Minister Davis over the next few months. I am sure that by the end of the year we will know far more about incoming payments, about outstanding bills, about amounts due from the budget on the way into the next decade, concerning the United Kingdom. That is why - I have already discussed this with your Committee on Budgets and with the rapporteurs, Mrs Thomas and Mr Olbrycht, and I also raised it a few weeks ago with the group chairmen and the President - we, the Commission, consider it preferable that we include the white paper process and our reflection paper for the next MFF and that we include the effects of Brexit as much as possible and therefore in the middle of next year, in any case before the summer break, maybe in late spring, that is, as early as possible and so want to present the next financial framework late as it makes sense - budgetary clarity, budgetary truth. We speak openly over five years or seven years - we all know the arguments - over five plus five years, and we should see that the reflection paper should reflect on traditional and new tasks and responsibilities in the European Union. I currently see two or three gaps in Europe's finances over the next decade. The first loophole: After a phase of transformation and after the departure of the United Kingdom, we will structurally and recurringly be missing ten or eleven billion euros every year because the British were net contributors - whether their economic strength or their high pro- Head ESD. And we need to fill this gap. And the second gap arises from new tasks, new responsibilities, which it makes sense to assume at European level. In general, I want to say that it has to be our ambition - I want to make this an explicit requirement for all of my considerations: for every euro, for every cent that we invest in Europe through the European budget, we should demonstrate the added value - added value. That is the principle of subsidiarity. This means that if a task, a project can be carried out just as well and just as cost-effectively by the member states, then there is no added value. I therefore want to speak to you, also along the lines of the paper, about the question: What does added value mean? Four examples: If we tackle a major research program or a major project like Galileo or high-performance computing or robotics together, because no company and probably no Member State can do this alone, there is added value for the European economy, our labor markets in global competition. Second example: If we upgrade the rail line along the Danube from Austria to the Black Sea - across borders - there will be clear added value if this is coordinated and also co-financed at European level - the “Connecting Europe” facility. Third example - even more difficult: Erasmus + is a great success story. One could also say: why are we doing this in a European way in terms of financing? Because I believe that, on the one hand, it educates people - young people -, is interested in Europe, gives them the opportunity to get to know other foreign regions, cultures and languages, and to make friendships for life. That's why we see added value in it. But if a rail line starts in Bulgaria and ends in Bulgaria - in one country - and is co-financed by us through the Cohesion Fund: is there any added value? More difficult. I think so, by Through this investment aid, we are making Member States in which the gross national product per capita is less than EUR 10,000, while in other Member States 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 - four, five, six times - more competitive , make their location more attractive, increase the quality of life and therefore bring these Member States - our citizens - closer to the European average of an income, a standard of living, a labor market. But as I said: We want to prove the definition of “added value” for each project and program individually in the financial framework. The Cohesion Funds certainly play an important role. I am therefore grateful that Mrs Creţu was co-author and jointly responsible for this paper, because her programs are extremely important for the infrastructure and economic and social development of Europe. Migration, border protection, border control, defense research and defense are also new tasks. If you look at all of these new tasks that are performed more sensibly, more cheaply, more efficiently in Europe and thus relieve the Member States, then there is another coverage gap of ten billion, at least ten plus ten. And then the ambition of perhaps bringing funds from outside - the European Development Fund - into the budget, in order to fully comply with Parliament's right to vote, and to give you overall responsibility as co-legislator for all financial flows at European level, could be a third one Be point. And we have to work together - and this is also what the paper serves - to examine how we can close these two to three gaps - 20 to 25 billion euros per year. The way to the bank and debts are blocked. Europe is the only level that has no debts, is not allowed to do so, does not want to do so - in contrast to member states, regions and municipalities. We should therefore also look at the options - although, if I may be frank, option two (Europe is reduced to the internal market, nothing else) is not my option, a purely theoretical, fundamental option, I am more between five and three and five and four, but still open-minded - Know: Before we ask the Member States for new money, we have to see that our investments get even better. The expenditure balance serves this. We have to modernize our programs, if possible, to simplify them, we want to go into the future with even more flexibility, we should do everything to ensure that the investments are convincing, project after project, and bring sustainable benefits to economic strength, the quality of the location and jobs, and indeed not just a flash in the pan, but permanent. So it could be that we say: We have to cover the Brexit gap through optimization and cuts and reallocations, but also through new money - 50/50 or 40/60 or 60/40. But new tasks that we take on - if we co-finance defense investments and weapons orders, we relieve the member states - that is, for new tasks we first and foremost need fresh money, supplementary income from the member states. An important question is the diversification of income. Should it only be contributions, some customs duties, is the sales tax still up to date, or can own resources, based on the report by Mario Monti and his high-level group, be a useful addition? If not now then when? If you have new tasks, tackle noteworthy new tasks, you should also have the courage to propose new income for them - in addition to existing sources of income. The connection to energy, to the ETS system, to CO2 emissions and their purchase, or the financial transaction tax - nine proposals were made. We are waiting for your feedback and that of the public, and we will definitely get two or three of them the proposed options on the revenue side in our MFF proposal in late spring of next year. We then have to look at the discounts. The British negotiated a permanent discount back then - Prime Minister Thatcher. If the British leave, this is a chance, no, a logical reason that all other discounts that were only created because of the British discount, which legally expire at the end of 2020, will not be extended either. If the mother of all discounts goes, I want to dismiss the children too and thus achieve a clear administrative simplification and a reduction in bureaucracy. A budget without discounts and thus with far less horse-trading would be a step forward on the way to a decision, particularly among the Member States in the Council. Ladies and gentlemen! I want to come back again and I want to ask you - not because we don't want to work, if you expect it, we will present our budget before the end of the year. But we will certainly have to make a supplementary proposal in the summer of next year, because only then will the issue of Brexit consequences become apparent. My request is that you take note of the fact that the Commission will finalize its financial framework for the next decade on the basis of the analysis of the reflection paper on finances 2020, 2025 and on the basis of a reliable interim result by Michel Barnier before summer next year, in late spring - so as early as possible, as late as makes sense, to ensure budgetary truth and clarity - will be presented to you. My request: Participate, and if we come later with our MFF, I would like to offer all the groups, the Committee on Budgets and every Member of Parliament that we can discuss individual points that are clear - the elimination of discounts, own resources, new priorities - earlier Discuss in a politically binding manner and express your expectations as comprehensively as possible the then developing Commission draft can be incorporated in advance.We should make the best possible use of the time until the summer of next year so that discussions with the Council can begin immediately afterwards - perhaps even before the next European elections.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 252, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "José Manuel FERNANDES", "mepid": "96899", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would like to greet the Commissioner, congratulate all the colleagues and all the colleagues, and congratulate him, Commissioner, on the realistic ambition he has and the commitment.

I hope that the Council will have the same desire; I hope that our proposals, our ambition, will echo in the Council. I advocate a structured dialogue for this objective, which is to have the best budget for the European Union after 2020. To speak of the budget is to speak to the citizens; it is talking about employment and, in particular, youth employment, research and innovation, agriculture, fisheries, support for local authorities, culture, support for education and universities, mobility, means of communication, public water supply and sanitation; it is talking about improving the quality of life, but it is also talking about competitiveness; it is also talking about solidarity, which in the European Union must exist between the Member States and within the Member States. And it is also, today, new priorities and I speak of security and defense. We need predictability, we also need stability, and that adds to our obligation.

The objectives of the European Union Strategy, of the Europe 2020 Strategy, continue, but, as I said, we have a new priority, which is security and defense, and this needs additional resources, additional funding. Fines and fines, for example, must remain in the European Union budget, it does not make sense for them to return to the Member States. It is also important to flexibility and simplicity, and I welcome the proposal that the “rebates”, the compensations, end.The added value is something that depends on the location.The added value cannot mean only large projects or cross-border projects.There are small projects that bring enormous added value and the political component here is essential.Added value also means economic cohesion, social and territorial cohesion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 253, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL", "mepid": "96991", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, we have read the reflection paper in detail, and if I had to highlight one sentence it would be this: 'The concerns and expectations of European citizens must be an important factor in shaping the new budget of the European Union ». In recent years, more and more is expected of the Union when it comes to tackling challenges for which it has neither the competence nor the financial resources and, indeed, Europe today is not experiencing its best moments. There is growing disaffection precisely because we are not doing enough, and that is what we have to give an answer to: we have to propose a courageous project, which will once again excite Europeans, which will attract generations that we have not lived or wars or dictatorships. And that is now or never. We have to respond to the refugee call for help from Europe because the Member States are not doing so. We have to lead the fight against climate change in the face of a Trump who is an arsonist. We have to make a bigger European Youth Guarantee available to young people because we are denying them the future and the present. We have to Europeanize defense and security policy because together we will be much more effective. We have to continue financing, one hundred percent, the common agricultural policy to ensure quality food at an affordable price, and we have to continue with the productive investments of cohesion policy. And, for that, we need a solvent budget. It is time to talk about the new resources: we really have to start a financial transaction fee; we need a European corporation tax.

These cuts would apply to the two most important EU policies: the cohesion policy, the common agricultural policy, and it is these policies that are the most important instruments for equalizing the level of development between the old and new member states. Moreover, such restrictions on expenditure from the EU budget are a breach of the principle that more developed EU countries pay certain funds to the budget in return for unlimited access - in this case to 150 million consumers of Central and Eastern Europe - and despite the fact that this title is making enormous profits, now they will try to reduce the burden on this account.

Member States which opt out of solidarity in one area do not have the right to demand solidarity in other areas. I also support - and I quote your document - \"the priority which is investment in people\". I read: \"A guarantee for children, supported by funds from the European Union, could thus be set up on the model of the guarantee for young people\". This is new and interesting, Commissioner. I am in favor of the creation of a macroeconomic stabilization mechanism, aptly called in your document \"bad days fund\". I support the idea of ​​creating a crisis reserve financed by unused appropriations from previous years and the creation, in spending programs, of an unscheduled reserve, which would be available to deal with unforeseen events. Finally, as co-rapporteur on this dossier, I fully support the need to implement new own resources in the next multiannual financial framework. These new own resources are essential, as you said, in order to face three realities: the consequences of Brexit, the burdens resulting from the new challenges and the reluctance, it must be admitted, of many Member States to increase their contribution. to supply the Union budget from their budget. The options that you are proposing in this area, or in any case that you are suggesting, further to the Monti report, are relevant: no more discounts, establishment of a basket of own resources, in direct connection with two priority objectives of the Union - decarbonization and deepening of the single market - and new revenue from European policies.I would add, Commissioner, that within the framework of the next multiannual financial framework, I am in favor of limiting, by the end of this financial framework, the proportion of GNI resources for supplying the budget.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 256, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Xabier BENITO ZILUAGA", "mepid": "135490", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, change course or follow the same failed recipe as always in the face of Europe's challenges?

Most of us here would agree that Europe will have to face big challenges in the coming years, whether the need for a more inclusive and sustainable growth, the fight against inequalities and climate change or security issues. To face them, we will need not only a clear political will, leadership and ambition, but also money. Therefore, we welcome the Commission’s underlying idea to link the future EU budget framework with a clear project for Europe. Since we in the Greens/EFA Group would like to see a stronger, fairer, more efficient and greener Europe, we would also like to see a strong, fair, efficient, flexible and green financial framework, a budget able to deliver results where we are most in need of them, a budget that invests in the future – for instance by building better chances for our youth or increasing research and development for the good of all of society – and a budget aligned with crucial commitments such as those reflected in the Paris Agreement. At the current pace, we are going to fall short on the 20% climate-related spending objective. However, we need to deliver more on climate by significantly increasing efforts and the share of climate—related spending. On the revenue side, there is a clear need to reform the own—resources system. With Brexit there is a unique opportunity to reform it and to scrap all rebates and corrective measures altogether. We should leave the current system – which is overly based on GNI contributions – behind and move towards a budget which is more autonomous of Member States’ transfers. To conclude, I ask the Commission to put forward not only thoughtful reflections, but also ambitious proposals for the next MFF.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 258, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Marco VALLI", "mepid": "124778", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have a remark to make to all my colleagues, because I see that they are rightly looking with concern at the future of EU resources.

We need an absolute and even quick revision of the problems linked to expansive austerity: it is a contradiction, something that does not work. There is a monetary drug in place, we need to ring the alarm now to be able to reverse this trend, and then we can also talk, perhaps, to give some more resources for interesting common projects.

In my opinion, it is already quite clear what will happen with the next multiannual financial framework after Brexit and what the Commission's idea is. Not, as it would be logical, in my opinion, given the departure of 60 million citizens from the EU, to reduce commitments and payments, but to ask for even more money from European citizens with new community taxes disguised under the name \"own resources\" or with an increase in transfers, especially from net contributing countries such as my country, Italy. I welcome what the Commissioner said about the effectiveness and results of the budget lines, but words must be followed by deeds. For too long we have been talking and talking about performance budgeting without doing anything. I want to know what concrete results big budget lines and big budget lines produce, and if there are - and I think there are - budget lines or tasks that can be done better at the national level.

Now, as before, the Commission goes down a predictable path of creating new spending priorities – spending on the European common defence policy, the challenges of migration and other ambitious plans could well add another EUR 12 to 13 billion to the deficit, making it in the region of EUR 25 billion per year.  Commissioner Hogan has confirmed a three billion black hole in the common agricultural policy budget. Just last week, Commissioner, you confirmed that other major programmes would not be immune to cuts. Inevitably, this will mean that countries like Germany, France and the Republic of Ireland will pay in more and will receive less in return.

We will be there for this discussion. In this dialogue, we will not be sterile opponents or mere goads, but partners in building together the project for financing the future of the European Union. Article 25 of the financial framework provided for the Commission to present its draft future financial framework before 1 January 2018. I do not want to play the procedure to the detriment of politics. However, I alert you to the credibility of our institutions. How can we ask our fellow citizens to respect the law if we ourselves break free from it? At the very least, the approval of the co-legislators is required. In any case, it is time to start work on the financial orientations of Europe after 2020. However, it is a very strange exercise in which we must engage to prepare the future financing of the Union without having defined neither the strategy, nor the level of ambition, nor the priorities. Everyone expected the Commission to exercise its power of initiative and clearly indicate its proposed course for the future of the Union. Unfortunately no, we are faced with five alternative scenarios. I prefer to be honest, Parliament will not work on five scenarios, but on its vision and priorities for the Union. Commissioner, I share your observation that the current financial framework is under-sizing. I share your concern about the downward trend in expenditure ceilings since 1993. I share your criticisms on rebates and on the current system of Union budgetary revenue, dominated by the contribution of the Member States, which inevitably leads to the deadly logic of the just back. I also share your requirements democratic as to the duration, budgetary unity and sincerity of the next financial framework. Finally, I want to agree with you on most of the goals you indicate, such as economic strength, sustainability, solidarity and security. However, as I read you, I see the impossible equation of wanting to do more with less money resurfacing. Investment, migration and youth have constituted new programs in the current financial framework, with all the funding difficulties we have encountered and the sacrifices we have had to make on key programs, such as research. You add to it - and we could agree - new commitments related to security and defense issues. This expenditure may in no case be to the detriment of solidarity programs, such as cohesion, youth, social or development aid. With new expenditure, new revenue! Our future must be based on three pillars: consolidated solidarity for our fellow citizens and our territories; an economic power oriented towards sustainable development, which will give us energy and food autonomy; a security policy to ensure peace. Finally, Commissioner, we would be inclined to reject the current budgetary under-dimensioning and more motivated than ever to demand new own resources for the European Union, as you propose.

The current financial perspective was overshadowed by the great economic crisis and under enormous pressure from Prime Minister Cameron, and he was putting pressure on budget cuts to avoid Brexit, to convince the English that there was money to save in Europe. And paradoxically now, this project that will be born has Brexit as the biggest unknown, because the budget is a vision of Europe in numbers. The budget is about numbers and it's hard to budget this budget with little idea of ​​what the financial deal with the UK will look like. So it makes sense to delay its submission by the Commission for next year.

Today we see that what was felt to be a success in Germany at the time is causing problems for the EU. Because the European budget is underfunded, and in view of the new additional challenges - I'll just mention combating the causes of displacement and improving border management - that is fatal. Now something interesting is happening: Members of the current government are saying we should definitely let the EU cost us more. Because in Germany two insights prevail. First: Germany is only doing well if our neighbors are also doing well. And secondly: Anyone who examines the financial flows will see that the money, e.g. B. flows through the structural funds into the EU states, flows back as purchases or orders to the Federal Republic.

I think that the idea of robbing Peter to pay Paul is unhelpful. It is very unhelpful to say to the rural parts of Europe that they must lose funds to other policy areas. There are some interesting ideas in this paper, and some challenging ideas too around possible reforms of the common agricultural policy, including the distribution of payments, and some food for thought around how we will design a policy that meets the challenges of climate change and biodiversity and delivery. But let us not forget the income challenge in agriculture and in rural areas. It is frankly enormous, so this paper is really important.

Let me say one thing about the speed that we need: if you can come forward with your MFF at the beginning of next year, we will, as Parliament, finalise the work on the regulations before the elections.

For me, your requests to speak were the beginning of our joint reflection. Certainly the White Paper and with it these five papers go first and foremost to the Member States, but you are also the same addressee, all the more so when the budget is discussed in the White Paper process, that should be your right as king. That is why I think this timely referral is an important start today. We will evaluate your requests to speak and will be happy to come back to you. In essence, it's about the following: A household currently has around 150 billion in income and expenditure - I am simplifying. If the British leave, we will miss 15 percent of the income, we will be short of 23 billion, and therefore the consideration will be that the budget structure for the next decade will be either 125 billion per year, or 150 as before or 160 more. In the suspense - 125 to 160 - let's move. You know that very well, because you are not floating in a vacuum here - by the way, neither do I, I speak every day with ministers from our remaining 27 Member States, including representatives of the regions. There are a significant number of Member States who say: if the British go, there will be no money. But let the one percent cap remain. A clear line, I can tell you in a private conversation which better-spending member states I mean. A clear calculation: 150 minus 23 equals 127 - that's it. I share my colleague Geier's opinion. This budget is structurally sewn to the edge and even underfunded. With flexibility between budget years and budget chapters, we can halfway compensate for what is necessary to finance new tasks and maintain existing programs. To put it straight away - because I can feel this concern: the two major investment and spending programs, including agricultural policy here Both pillars, and here cohesion policy, should - however we decide - not suffer from clear cuts. Agricultural policy is the only fully communitized policy, a not insignificant economic sector, and cohesion policy serves to strengthen regions and bring them closer to the European average. This task will remain an important priority for the next budget, especially in the context of enlargement over the past decade. I cannot guarantee that we will receive the funds now, but we will avoid deforestation. The two pillars, the two major programs, must remain efficient. With our balance sheet we will show where we can do even better. I claim that we are not bad at all, the Court of Auditors alone, our internal audit process and your competent budgetary control committee ensure that this is the case. We're not that bad. I know budgets and budget implementation at local, regional and national level. In comparison, I would like to say that the quality of our household advice is good, that our budget execution is orderly, that the bookkeeping, the control takes place, that abuse is avoided as far as possible - the error rate will also be in 2016 (we will send you that in a few weeks forward) continue to decline - and that the added value of our investments is quite considerable, the number of lost investments is manageable. The expenditure balance is intended to deepen exactly this consideration. MEP Valli - I don't see him anymore - said: as long as everyone is in recession. No, not everyone is in recession anymore. We still have a few countries in stagnation, but most countries, including program countries - Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Cyprus - are developing much better than planned two years ago. Europe is currently with its economy, with its structural growth and still too high Pedestal is also surprisingly good when it comes to new jobs. For the first time, we have shown a slight lead in terms of economic growth in our competition with the USA. We shouldn't talk to each other worse than we are. The key question is: What about the one percent cap - it was also mentioned. I'm not talking about three or two percent, but if we don't get something - 11, 1.2, 1.25 over one, then the fulfillment of our tasks will not work. And I would like to avoid competition or competition: migration and defense are financed at the expense of the Cohesion Fund. That would be a new split in our European family. Some might say: yes, refugees, they don't want to go to structurally weak areas, they want to go to Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Germany, Austria - that is, to net payers. If you then make migration investments there at the expense of the Cohesion Fund, I definitely want to avoid this split. We need an integrated approach to the next multiannual financial framework. Everything was also said beforehand on the subject of net contributors. For every euro that comes to Brussels - from Berlin or Vienna as an example - and goes back from there to Bratislava, Tallinn, Warsaw, Riga, - incidentally, then increased by national funds - 60 percent, 70 percent go back to the construction industry, building materials industry, construction equipment industry , Building trade, civil engineering, plant construction, mechanical engineering, truck construction, planning offices, architecture offices. In truth, my home country is a net beneficiary of a common European cohesion and investment policy. Should structural funds only be given to poor regions? I am open, we ask the question. But the fact that we need acceptance speaks against it. And if there are only poor regions, the acceptance in economically stronger regions decreases. That, in turn, would be anything but integration, as solidarity. And since there are often cross-border projects - Interreg - we should achieve that every region that wants to cooperate with other regions in other member states has certain resources from us so that projects can be carried out jointly from the European budget. Mr Solé, we take the 20 percent target for climate protection seriously. We are monitoring this month after month in the implementation of the budget, the Court of Auditors is currently examining this and is presenting a report to you, and I want to be responsible for the fact that in the end one can say - and also use this as the basis for the start of the next draft budget: The 20 percent can be demonstrated in expenditure and investments in favor of energy savings and climate protection in the execution of the household. We don't want to steer a union. We do not want to burden the citizen with new taxes, but one consideration: climate protection is European policy, Paris, Marrakech is a European success development. The ETS system is European legislation. Industrial companies, steelworks and coal-fired power plants buy licenses for emission rights on European exchanges. All legislation of this House. then the idea that the revenue will go to the European budget is not entirely remote. It would be two sides - legislation and revenue - of a single coin. We will have to examine the question of conditionality. Keyword bike lane: Well, dear Member of Parliament van Dalen, - I don't see him any more, generally the critical requests to speak are all absent and those who agree are present - in any case: we don't want bike lanes, bike lanes make sense for reasons of mobility and that Environmental protection. But it is up to the Member State to decide whether there are bike lanes or bypass roads or whether it is a community center, because up until now the Member States or regions have decided what to use for funds from our structural funds. This is exactly where our consideration starts - European Semester and country-specific recommendations. Shouldn't we work out these recommendations on the strengths and weaknesses of the member states, on priorities, even better and earlier, together with the national ministries and administrations and regions, but then also make them a blueprint for calling up funds? A thought from my previous area: We could show very precisely where in rural areas the digital infrastructure is bad, where there are dead spots, where you should invest in broadband and fiber optics. If this were a priority in the recommendations, ultimately decided by the Council and developed by the Commission and the Member State, then the Member States would be required to call up substantial resources from our structural funds for this. The exciting question is: does this still complement the rule of law, i.e. civil rights and the rule of law, as a condition for the call of funds? We also presented this openly with our reflection paper in the room. Finally, I want to come to the timing. If you do not contradict me, I would like to simply give you my impression that, although you are not pleased, in the light of the prevailing circumstances - the White Paper process and Brexit - you are ready to take note of when the Commission and that the Commission in late spring, at least before the summer break next year, will present her budget and her proposal. If clarity arises earlier - keyword Barnier and Davis, Brexit negotiations - then accordingly earlier. That is, as early as possible and as late as it makes practical sense. But there comes the crucial point: If the proposal is on your table in May or June next year, if you like, then there will be two large time windows for the deliberations in Parliament and the Council, and ultimately in the European Council. I will point them out to you. Here we are only service providers. You decide and the council decides when. And both Time windows are about a year long. The one time window would be the usual: at the very back with time pressure - five to twelve to five past twelve. It would be after your European elections, you first have to establish yourself, have to organize your internal structures, order functions, then there was the summer break, then the new parliament, with many new members, with a breath of fresh air, but perhaps also without experience in November will be ready. We have exactly one new commission - the next commission from November 1st. There remains a time window from November 2019 to November 2020 - one year. The other time window - check it out - would be: We will present it in May and we will negotiate from May 2018 to May 2019, with the time pressure of the upcoming European elections, with this Parliament, with your experience, with our Jean-Claude Juncker Commission. The advantage of the second time window would be clear. Last time we were late. Before Christmas 2013 - that was the Barroso Commission, incidentally no change of commission, it was the same Parliament, and it was Lewandowski, your colleague - we finished shortly before Christmas. The year 2014 was a lost year because the implementation, the implementation until the rural area had the guidelines, was at the beginning of 2015. We had a year, basically, without any significant implementation. Only now, in 2017, will our structural programs pick up full speed. Should we allow ourselves this again? Shouldn't we learn from mistakes? If we want to continue budgeting at full speed for research, defense, structural policy, infrastructure, rural areas and agriculture immediately after the 2020 budget has been implemented, then we would need our financial framework between the Council and Parliament to be approved much earlier. The question goes to you, and the question goes to the Council and the European Council: when are the heads of state or government in the end? inclined to look at our budget?But not through the laying on of hands, but through intensive processing.And if this decision is clear - time window November 2019 to November 2020, or time window May June 2018 to May 2019, one year each - then we can prepare this accordingly with us.You decide.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 293, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "The discussion is closed.Motions for resolutions to be tabled under Rule 123 (2) of the Rules will be notified subsequently.The vote will take place during a next part-session.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 294, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Simona BONAFÈ", "mepid": "124814", "text": "in writing. - As the challenges increase, new fields of action are opened up at European level, such as migration, internal and external security, defense and the social pillar.

Cohesion policy has a proven high added value for the EU as a whole, not just underdeveloped countries.

Over 480 billion euros of investment is expected to be guaranteed for the period 2014-2020. At the same time, net financial exporters receive an 80% return through the free market. However, in four of the five proposed scenarios, cohesion funding has been reduced in favor of the new priority policies.

And why is this important? Because in this report, which I drafted and which I brought in front of you, we are providing the first reaction of the Parliament: the evaluation of the draft budget of the European Commission on the basis of the political priorities of the Parliament, which we have adopted with a large majority in the plenary of the Parliament in March 2017.  Before we talk about political priorities and the in-depth evaluation of the draft budget, I would like to say one thing very clearly ahead of the next week’s dialogue and towards the Council that we are going to meet next week: the European Parliament will not accept automatic cuts to all budgetary lines – to all headings of the budget – as the Council has been doing in recent years. The European Union’s budget is not made by machines for machines, but it is made by politicians for the people on the basis of political priorities and taking into account the expectations of the people. Automatic cuts made by the Council to all headings of the budget, not taking into account the political priorities which the Council and Parliament have given ourselves jointly, is clearly irresponsible.  What are the political priorities of the European Parliament? We have said since the beginning of the year that we have two main priorities: firstly, growth and jobs; secondly, the safety and security of citizens. How do we want to achieve these? On growth and jobs, we want to use the limited resources which we have in the EU budget to strengthen our economy and to make it more competitive, so we want to strengthen innovation, infrastructure, SMEs and the Erasmus programme, because that is also a support for labour mobility in Europe – it supports young people. I want to say very clearly, Commissioner Oettinger, that the draft budget which you presented at the end of May 2017 generally corresponds with and is in line with the important political priorities which we adopted in March 2017. I think you did the right thing on the first priority – on growth and jobs – to strengthen innovation (the Horizon 2020 programme, infrastructure, connecting Europe facility, Erasmus). We will have to work together to see whether the amounts foreseen for the COSME programme, for SMEs, also fulfil our objective of creating more employment, more jobs in Europe, because SMEs are where jobs are being created. We need to make sure that the amounts foreseen by you in the COSME programme are also sufficient. You also propose in the draft budget, and we agreed, that the Youth Employment initiative should be continued:  EUR 233 million for next year. That is good, but in parallel we also have to make sure that this money is well spent. We owe it to the citizens of Europe to make sure that every single euro spent is well spent, and concerns expressed by the Court of Auditors with regard to the Youth Employment initiative we will take very seriously.  The second priority – security, the safety of citizens – is important because there can be no growth and no jobs without safety. If people do not feel safe in Europe, then there is no labour mobility, no investment. To achieve this objective, we wanted to see the agencies of the Union which have responsibility for justice and home affairs strengthened – you are proposing this. We will have to work together in the upcoming months, and also with the Council, to see to what extent that corresponds to the needs on the ground, or whether we will have to do more. My report on the mandate for the trialogue clearly supports the preparatory action on defence, because in those areas where Member States are ready to cooperate at European level on defence research, we have to enable this. We have to stop spending money 28 times in 28 Member States at a national level, but spend it once at European level and then share the results amongst all of us. When it comes to neighbourhood policy, you increase the ENI East programme; we think that is very good; we have to see whether the amounts allocated for Western Balkans are sufficient on the ground. Lastly, I want to say that we need – and this is a call towards the European Commission as a whole – a quick decision on the continuation of the Turkey refugee facility. That is not for you to decide, but the Commission as a whole needs to provide us with clarity – we need to know how much money will be needed for this important programme.

Dear Mr Mureşan, your introductory words, but also the mandate and the report on it that you have drawn up, are largely confronted with concurrent considerations by the European Commission. 2018 will likely be the last normal budget year. In other words, with 28 Member States, with the multiannual financial framework moving forward, which incidentally ended two days ago - three and a half years are behind us, three and a half years are still ahead of us. And that's why I look forward to an objective debate in the further deliberations with optimism. Indeed, we believed that blanket cuts without looking at the individual programs and without adopting budget implementation in 2017 were wrong. Your priorities are our priorities, and Parliament's cooperation with the Commission in the run-up to this has also been reflected accordingly. It's about economic growth, it's about jobs, it's about combating youth unemployment, it's about us building something new for young people in heading 1a with the European Youth Solidarity Corps, without taking it away with a negative impact in Erasmus +, and it It's about continuing our proven programs, but also tackling new issues - migration as an established focus in the European budget. With the topic of defense research, we are feeling our way forward in the form of experiments by pioneers - 40 million in 2018, 90 million in the three years up to the end of 2019. From this knowledge it makes sense! If you - keyword defense drones - conduct research on a European basis and proceed in a coordinated manner, we will gain knowledge that will be very important on the way to the next financial framework, into the next decade. You raised the issue of Turkey / EU. We attach great importance to this: every euro comes Refugees benefit people and their homes in refugee camps - shelter, warmth, cold, water, food, clothing, security, education - and the three billion will be in the very foreseeable future, probably around the end of the year, in the form of obligations be issued by commitments. Now we are waiting to see how the next few weeks go - keyword G20 in Hamburg - in general, how and whether you can continue to work reliably with the Turkish government in some areas to fight the smuggling problem, to give people human dignity on the ground - three million There are refugees in Turkey, an enormous number. So we once marked a house number with the 230 million in the next household. We are thus credible and negotiable. We will have to ask the Member States to give us substantial additional money - as last time. Our British friends have to decide whether to stick with it - which we would welcome - and if necessary we have to increase the funds accordingly by reallocating them by November during the procedure. We will keep you informed of the progress of this agreement with Turkey over the next few weeks. It was very important to me that the mid-term review held, that the British were fair and collegial after their election, that the Purdah was only valid until election day and that the mid-term review is now being implemented in law, giving the flexibility that is needed in the Budget years 2018, 2019 and 2020 makes a lot more possible. All in all, I claim that it is a draft that corresponds to the priorities of the vast majority in Parliament. We will work together to ensure that there are no blanket cuts, but specific individual considerations - title by title, group by group, project by project and program by program. The trialogue starts on July 13th, and then we have tough ones in September and October Work ahead of us.But from many conversations with you, Mr Mureşan, and with others, I have gained an impression that the level of expertise in Parliament is very high and that we are both responsible for ensuring that this draft budget is roughly as it was drafted by us, can be implemented into applicable law in November.We are on schedule.Thank you very much for your effort!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 301, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Agnieszka KOZŁOWSKA", "mepid": "124889", "text": "author of the draft opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Mr Chairman!

Firstly, using our taxpayers’ money for projects which are broadly political in nature, whether so-called information campaigns or pre-accession funding given to third countries. And secondly, there are projects which would be better funded, better achieved, by Member States themselves. Rather than sending money across to the European Union for it to come back, it is sometimes better to simply cut out the middleman. Thirdly, there is the waste, mismanagement and fraud within the EU budget – and we still do not really know, with EU funded projects, whether they have actually added enough value to be worth the money that has been spent on them. Fourthly, there is a failure to respect subsidiarity: doing things at EU level when there is no actual need to do so. And fifthly, of course, the waste in administration, which is so well known anyway. There is much more that I could say on this, but what it all leads to is a budget that is perpetually too high, and it leads every year to the EU scrambling around to find ways to increase funding. In the UK in 2010, when Labour was voted out of office, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury famously left his successor a note saying ‘There’s no more money left’, and this seems to happen here every year.

The 2018 budget is where this operation is supposed to be completed, and so will the agencies. It is important for me to emphasize at this point that many agencies have achieved far more, because they had to use the so-called redeployment pool to generate part of the jobs that have become unavoidable at selected agencies - think of the growth in staff at Frontex . I would therefore like to state that the 2018 budget will be the last one in which agency staff will be cut. I think some of them have reached what can be called sclerotic. But the Council has a chance, ladies and gentlemen, to demonstrate its willingness to save elsewhere.

The time and the following items on the agenda in a nutshell: I think it is remarkable and positive how broad the mandate that Mr Mureşan has worked out for himself emerges from your remarks. I believe that strengthens his authority and your authority. The fact that the Commission's draft budget and your assessment, your comments and your additions have a large majority here in this House is also a clear sign of your strength in the trialogue negotiations. I am pleased that they will start on July 13th, based on the mandate, and I promise my support in all negotiation rounds. Most of the points were mentioned: migration, social affairs, infrastructure, cohesion, rural areas, research. Perhaps just a few more thoughts on three points: We are monitoring the personnel situation in our services very closely. We will have made the 5% staff cuts in the establishment plan as a commission this year - for other services next year. And then our services - this applies to Parliament, it applies to all institutions, it applies to the Commission, it applies to the agencies - a few years of stabilization on the basis of an establishment plan and legislation that goes into the next decade. And when agencies have more work, have new tasks, do extraordinary work, we always have the option of fine-tuning, adding a few positions so that the agencies can also fulfill their tasks alongside the general directorates. I will be in contact with the spokesman for our agencies over the next few days to hear their expectations. Galileo is a project of a decade, a century - the industry just couldn't get it right. We are late, but we can do it and thus create our own European sovereignty in a technologically outstanding area and are no longer solely dependent on the import of navigation services from overseas. The creation of the European Museum of History has been criticized. I recently saw a group of visitors there, young people from Europe who were there - they were thrilled. I think the Parlamentarium and the House of European History are excellent opportunities for further training, especially for our European citizens, especially for the younger generation. Because, whether we want it or not, whether you don't want it or I want it: there is a European history, unfortunately there is a European war history, there is a European cultural history, a European social history - Karl Marx - there is there is a European history of religion and the history of the Reformation in the Luther year, and there is basically also a European history of our changeful politics, from the Romans, the Greeks, before, the Hohenstaufen, from Charles I to Napoleon.

I would like particularly to thank the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I have been working very well and closely. They were very constructive throughout the work. I see with us still in the Chamber Bernd Kölmel and Indrek Tarand – my thanks to you, and also to Daniele Viotti and Anneli Jäätteenmäki, who were with us earlier. The rapporteurs for the opinions from the various committees were instrumental in putting together a mandate for Parliament which reflects the will of the colleagues in this House and that is why I anticipate that we will be able to adopt this with a large majority tomorrow. In addition to this, before concluding, I would like to say that growth and jobs and the security and safety of citizens are our biggest priorities. This is what we agreed with the Commission: that these things should receive priority next year. In addition, as was said before, we should not forget the traditional policies of the Union – cohesion and agriculture – and we should ensure proper financing. In this regard, the Commission did the right thing by proposing an increase in payments under Heading 1b to Cohesion and Structural Funds by 25% because we expect and we want to see money flowing into the programmes next year. This is why we are making money available for the real economy, so that NGOs, SMEs and regional and local stakeholders can benefit from the EU budget. I am confident after today’s debate that, together with the Commission, with Commissioner Oettinger, and with the Council – starting next week in the trilogue and then in autumn – we will be able to put forward and adopt a meaningful budget, a Union budget for 2018 which corresponds to the needs of the year 2018 and which respects and complies with European citizens’ expectations vis-à-vis the Union next year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 326, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "I close the debate.The vote will take place on Wednesday 5 July 2017.

Our attention is always focused on the latest political developments, from the conflicts in Syria and Iraq to the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf, but the topic we are discussing today, the condition of women in Saudi Arabia, is no less relevant. Definitely, inequality always makes a society weaker, and this is true of inequality between men and women. Our work for gender equality is not only consistent with our principles and values but it is also a matter of stability and resilience and it is a matter of economic growth. No country can achieve its full potential if half of its people do not have the same opportunities to work – and, of course, to learn and to have a say. In times of great change in the Middle East, it is essential that we constantly monitor the new threats to gender equality, and also the opportunities that arise for women’s empowerment. I can only concur that the situation of women’s rights in Saudi Arabia remains difficult. The European Union continues to engage the Saudi authorities on a number of human rights issues, including gender matters, and we consistently refer to the recommendation made during the last UN universal periodic review process on Saudi Arabia, which was concluded in 2014. EU Member States actively and constructively contributed to this exercise under the coordination of the European institutions. As you all know, the European Union does not vote in elections within UN political bodies. The decision on whether to support Saudi Arabia in the Commission on the Status of Women belongs to our Member States. But since Saudi Arabia has now been elected, I believe we should work to turn its membership of that Commission into an opportunity for Saudi women. Saudi society is changing, more or less slowly but constantly. The country’s authorities are starting to talk about reforms, and this is something we should encourage, and are encouraging in our diplomatic contacts with them. The new Crown Prince has publicly said that he believes it is time for change in this respect. This year we have seen a timid but interesting attempt at reforming the guardianship system, the system that forces Saudi women to ask for a man’s authorisation to travel, work or marry. A petition from local communities to introduce reform was signed by thousands. The Saudi leadership has acknowledged that the current system is not efficient in economic terms and could be an obstacle in fulfilling the ambitious objectives the Kingdom has set out in its ‘Vision 2030’. For the sake of Saudi women, we cannot miss any opportunity to encourage and accompany change in this country. We will continue to ask the Saudi leadership to demonstrate that it takes gender equality seriously. A useful first step would be for Saudi Arabia to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women. Let me add that Saudi women are very well organised and, with an international platform, I am sure that they can manage to make their voice heard. The UN Commission could offer this platform. We hope so. Already many Saudi women are fighting every day for their rights – like so many other women in all parts of the world. They are not subjugated, they are not resigned, and they are proud of what they have achieved with much hard work. These women can be the drivers of change inside their society. Let us take this opportunity to amplify their voice, to support their work and to advance gender equality in Saudi Arabia and right throughout the Middle East.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 330, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Teresa JIMÉNEZ-BECERRIL BARRIO", "mepid": "96806", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr. President, when I learned that Saudi Arabia had been elected to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, I thought it was a mistake, because it is incredible that one of the most misogynistic countries in the world may be in a body dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.

On April 21, thirteen new members were elected to this commission, which aims to defend the dignity of women around the world. Among these thirteen countries is therefore Saudi Arabia. How not to believe in a hoax? How can we imagine that this country, which had received the title of the most misogynistic country in the world from several NGOs, could become a member of a commission for the protection of women? How can a country that forbids women to drive, to go out alone, that hides them under the niqab and goes so far as to stone them, be considered a defender of female dignity? How to understand this, if not as an affront to women around the world, as the victory of the money of the petromonarchies over any moral or political consideration? Of the 54 voters, 47 were said to have decided that yes, Saudi Arabia could embody and promote women’s freedom. The women of this country will appreciate it. As a woman, I protest against this nomination and as a Member of the European Parliament, I denounce the complicity of the five states of the European Union which voted \"yes\" to the entry of Saudi Arabia. Finally, I would like to share with you an anecdote from The Independent newspaper. In March 2017, the Saudi authorities organized the first meeting on the topic of women's rights, a first step forward in the matter. Imagine that, during this meeting, the women were seated separately, in a separate room, single-sex required, and that they do not even appear in the photos. In 2015, Saudi Arabia was already elected to Commission on Human Rights and had, in the process, executed 153 people, up from 26 in 2010. Hopefully the revival will not be more difficult.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 337, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "- Mr President, the decision of the UN Council to elect Saudi Arabia as a member of the Committee on the Protection of Women can only come as a surprise.

Every woman should have a male prostate who will take on all the crucial decisions and control her life, from the moment she is born until the moment she dies. Women are also not allowed to drive, not allowed to be painted, not allowed to talk to men and much more. So you understand how much Saudi Arabia will promote women's rights at the UN. But if you consider that this country has the largest oil reserves in the world, is the largest exporter of oil in the world and that most of the UK weapons systems end up in Saudi Arabia, you will realize that it is not difficult, despite the fact that Saudi Arabia is funding terrorist acts around the world to persuade some of its enemies to support it at the UN, while voting there is secret.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 338, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Elena VALENCIANO", "mepid": "4334", "text": "- Mr President, I am not going to tell what happens in Saudi Arabia with women because we all know it.

Europe had limited itself in its relations with the island, in December 1996, with the so-called Common Position. The European Union actually imposed a self-imposed blockade on that relationship, but actually isolating Cuba was not a good decision. Within two years, an exemplary negotiation has been carried out and concluded and, in December 2016, the Agreement on Political Dialogue and Cooperation between the European Union and its member states and Cuba was signed. The High Representative deserves the recognition of this Parliament for having promoted the change of decision, for having promoted this Agreement and for having led the negotiation politically. We are going to succeed in closing, in part, the map of political relations between the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean. Cuba stops being the exception with this Agreement, and I think that is good news. Thus, it joins the rest of the Latin American and Caribbean nations with which the European Union is going to cooperate. I also want to congratulate Cuba for this step. The effective negotiation that has taken place has resulted in an international political Agreement that is as adequate as it is sophisticated and at the level of the needs of a relationship that will surely be complex and highly sensitive. It is a model Agreement of which there is much to highlight. I ask Parliament to grant its approval tomorrow to this Political Dialogue Agreement with Cuba, as our Committee on Development has done, unanimously; as our Foreign Trade Commission has done, practically unanimously; as the Foreign Affairs Committee of our House has done by a very large majority. The three committees have worked a lot and they have also given me a lot of work, but I think the result is good. The groups decided also process a Resolution; I presented a text, which I think was balanced, and the difficult part came later. Compromise after compromise, we have distilled the majority positions of this Parliament and I agree to acknowledge that I have all my colleagues to thank for accepting my limits. We have decided not to make demands, but political goals for the dialogue. We do not put conditions, but we establish challenges to a political cooperation that is now beginning, and always with respect for the sovereignty and independence of Cuba. Even so, I prefer that you look more at the Agreement than at the Resolution: I invite you to know it in detail, it is worth it. I would like all the agreements that the European Union signs from now on to be as clear and well structured as this one, and also for the way in which the European Union and the counterpart are going to work on human rights to be as clear. - by the way, a dialogue on human rights that is being very positive, as has been assured here in Parliament by the European Union's special representative for Human Rights, Mr Lambrinidis, whose work is always excellent. With the Agreement, we will all win: Cuba and us. I have no doubt that the Union is interested in cooperating with the island. This has been demonstrated by the central countries of the Union in these last two years: the President of the French Republic, the German Vice Chancellor ... all have traveled to Cuba with the same objective and, soon, the President of the Government of Spain will do so. and the King of Spain, who are preparing official visits for the next few months. We have always been interested in the relationship with Cuba. All Member States practically had bilateral agreements signed with the island, despite the Common Position, and in these years the European Union has positioned itself as the island's first customer and first supplier. It has been a great responsibility for me to be a speaker at this very important step that Cuba and the European Union are giving.Europe has a great opportunity to demonstrate to the United States, which intends to back down, that it is possible to maintain the highest level of demand with the highest level of compliance as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 364, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Elena Valenciano, but also all the members of this Parliament, for an excellent job done in accompanying these two years, two and a half years, of negotiations, which have been difficult, important, courageous , on our part and on the part of our Cuban counterpart, and which have brought us today, with the vote tomorrow, to a very important step. I share with Elena Valenciano the assessment that the political signal, I would almost say the cultural signal, of this passage is extremely important, not only for relations between the European Union and the island, but also as a strong sign of total commitment of the European Union in our partnership with all of Latin America and the Caribbean. It is a commitment that takes concrete form in many aspects, with bilateral relations with very different countries: sometimes we make the mistake of thinking that Latin America and the Caribbean are a single coherent bloc, while there are extremely different situations. The strength of Europe, the strength of the European Union - I think you know this very well in this House - lies in the fact that it is able to build relationships of commitment, dialogue and even cooperation and partnership, in some cases, with all of Latin America and the Caribbean, in a sense and in a spirit of frankness, of open friendship, also by addressing difficult issues with a sense of cooperation that derives from very strong ties: cultural ties, historical ties, even economic ties and politicians, in some cases, that Europe has always maintained, including with Cuba. They have been two years of courageous, exemplary path, as Elena Valenciano said, in some cases, which testified to a true commitment of the European Union to dialogue. We have made part of this journey together with the American administration, in parallel. I believe it is even more fundamental, today that some in Washington are investing more in a change of pace, again, to reaffirm that the European Union does not change its mind, does not change the course of its policy and proceeds in a courageous, open way, without taboos. , firmly on the path of commitment, dialogue, cooperation with Cuba and with all Cubans. Because our friendship, our agreement will allow us to accompany the whole island, all Cuban citizens, in the process of social, economic and political modernization that has been initiated since 2008 by the island's authorities. A process that will certainly be difficult, complex, in which the European Union will be able to accompany them not only with dialogue, but also with technical expertise: in some sectors it can be extremely useful. The agreement is not only a political dialogue agreement, but it is also a cooperation agreement that opens up the possibility of working together on many key sectors for the European Union as well, from cooperation on global issues in international forums to cooperation on regional issues . Let us not underestimate the role that Cuba can play in helping to resolve or understand some of the crises in the region which are also fundamental for the European Union - I am thinking of Venezuela, first of all. It is an agreement that allows us to initiate sectoral dialogues and cooperation in very important sectors, from the protection of artistic heritage, to cultural cooperation, energy, migration, the environment sector, scientific cooperation and many others, including dialogue. on human rights. Elena Valenciano said it very well: this dialogue that we have initiated and of which I know - our Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, has reported to this Parliament - is possible exactly because the European Union has moved on, it has engaged in a respectful dialogue, recognizing the differences there they are in terms of the political system, even of values ​​in some cases, but also the points of convergence of some values. I believe that this open, frank, constructive and respectful dialogue can be an extremely useful basis, also for this Parliament, as we move forward with the provisional entry into force of the agreement, with ratification by the Member States, in an extremely pragmatic but also transparent approach, which bears fruit. And I believe that this commitment, this way of committing ourselves as equals, without having lessons to give, but by making our experience available and affirming a friendship with the Cuban people, first of all, can be a useful way to go. I would like to sincerely thank not only Elena Valenciano, but also all of you and the commissions who have been involved in this process, which I know was particularly intense. I would like to share with you the satisfaction I experienced in December last year, when we signed the agreement with the Cuban Foreign Minister in Brussels, with the clear and distinct feeling of having turned a historical page. I believe it is fundamental for the credibility of the European Union in the region, but also in the world, that this becomes the way we deal with situations that have been difficult for years: with respect, without hiding from us the problems we have and will continue to have, but with the firm will to work for dialogue, for openness, for cooperation, to accompany the modernization process that has been started, with all its contradictions, with all its difficulties, without hiding them, but also without falling constantly in traps of ideology that belong to the past century. This is not the Europe that our citizens are asking us to have, and I believe that together - Parliament and all institutions - we have managed to offer a beautiful page of the European Union's international commitment. I would also thank on this occasion - then I will make some very brief conclusions - our Cuban counterparts, who have engaged with great openness, even mentally, with great negotiating effort during all these years of negotiations, with a great sense of respect for differencesand also for difficulties, but always looking for a solution.And I think they really showed a great ability to meet.Here I am reminded of the words Pope Francis used in his last visit to Cuba, when he said that the island can be the capital of a crossroads, a bridge, of many worlds: north, south, east and west..I believe that this agreement of ours, your vote tomorrow, somehow honors this idea of the island as a bridge with which the European Union, all of Europe, has decided to build a commitment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 365, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Frank ENGEL", "mepid": "96876", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, limiting myself to development issues, because that has been my role, I would simply like to say that this agreement is certainly good news.

In terms of development, we will always focus on aspects of food self-sufficiency, which is essential, and sustainable energy production, which is a sector of the future for Cuba. The only pitfall is that Cuba is now classified as a high middle-income country and therefore the European Union's development cooperation instrument may soon no longer apply to it. It will be necessary to take this into account when we revise this instrument, because it would be a shame if the cooperation effort that we are maintaining with Cuba - an envelope of 50 million euros until 2020 - simply comes to a halt. because we classify this country in a specific income category.

I remember very well the last time we had a debate in this House on Cuba, I believe it was about a year and a half ago: many of you complained about a certain delay, a certain absence of the European Union, which saw the United States of America, traditionally, economically, politically, socially and culturally less close and engaged in a dialogue with the island, be instead the forerunners of an opening - as has rightly been said - a reciprocal opening, on which it is necessary take a lot of steps on both sides. Today we are definitely in another post, today we are definitely facing a change of pace in which the European Union represents for the island, for the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean, but also for the rest of the world, for a certain concept of international relations and relations in the regions of the world, and also for the multilateral system represented by the United Nations, the fixed point on which we can count. Our path is always this: dialogue, frank, constructive, sincere commitment, without hiding any of the difficult and tiring elements of our confrontation, but always dialogue, openness and commitment, looking forward and not looking back. Few points: there is a political importance of the agreement - it was mentioned here - including for the dynamics regional, there is an economic importance, given the commitment of investments and trade relations between Europe and Cuba, there is a social importance, given the possibility and responsibility that the European Union has to accompany the island modernization process. I would like to underline the fact that the position of the European Union and this Parliament is, and remains, that of opposing the embargo and its extraterritorial effects. There is a dimension related to democracy and human rights. I would like to underline the fact, which some of you in this House recalled, that it is precisely Cuban civil society that supports this agreement, which asks us to implement it in all its parts, precisely because it represents a channel for dialogue, partnership, of cooperation, and I would invite colleagues who have not done so to at least read the agreement, because it is clear that the part on human rights dialogue is an integral and fundamental part of the agreement. And it is thanks to this political commitment that we have initiated, that we have also started a dialogue on human rights, frank, difficult, but constructive with Cuba.

I am going to ask you for a small favor: tell Mr Juncker that we are working very late today in Parliament. Well, I think that on the road to political dialogue with Cuba we will see if the results that we all hope are achieved. I think so. In the work of preparing the approval, the Accord, I have seen that there is a large majority in the House in favor. It is true that the Resolution has been very conflictive, because where the political groups put the main thing in their ideology, as has been seen, the distance is enormous. Cuba is Cuba, it is a very important international actor, as it has shown on many occasions; without going any further, in the very important dialogue for peace in Colombia. And there are many things that we would like to change in Cuba, as in many of the countries with which we have relations - of course we do - but it is up to the Cubans to follow this path, as we Spaniards did, or the Poles, or all the peoples of Europe. It is their turn to make the journey. It is up to us to dialogue, cooperate from the defense of our values, of course, and trying to understand the other. I want to thank all my colleagues for their interventions and, very particularly, the shadow rapporteurs for this report, Javier Couso, from the GUE; Ernest Urtasun, from the Greens; Teresa Jiménez, from ALDE; and Luis de Grandes, from the European People's Party. As you can see, a cast of Spanish MEPs. For us, the answer to whether the relationship between Cuba and the European Union is profound is very clear. It is. For Spain it is and, therefore, for Europe it must also be. When something is difficult in politics, only rigor, generosity, flexibility and a few doses of patience can find the optimal solution.

We had the funeral for Helmut Kohl here on Saturday. I think it became clear in what way the depth and diversity of European culture is expressed - as a supporting element. Culture in its diversity and commonality is a decisive factor in Europe's attractiveness. Ortega y Gasset once said: four fifths of the culture of European countries are the same, one fifth differentiates us. Today we do not see this as a conflict, but as a common wealth. This Europe came together through this path and the experiences we had. This could be an example - also for other parts of the world. This Europe, in which we overcome borders and understand culture not as a contradiction but as a common wealth, can also be a message to other parts of the world in order to make a contribution as a soft power, to make peace and at the same time to promote to be for us - in a very sober sense. I think that with a cultural diplomacy, dear Ms. Mogherini, we can also use this as one of the instruments as part of your global strategy. I think that for this reason we can do a lot here, as in questions of human rights policy within the framework of the United Nations, the United Nations Charter on Human Rights. We can involve this person who overcomes the limit in discussions. We should ask the Commission to include these elements in contracts to a greater extent, in order to create such links in this way. But I believe we should also use the interests of our Member States for this. I am fully aware that culture is the responsibility of the nation states and that under the treaty we only have a supporting effect. This is how you can build it up. We don't want the work of that Overcoming nation-states in securing their cultural identity, but we should also make clear to the outside world what we said in the European draft constitution: unity in diversity. That is then beneficial for the member states to participate accordingly, to use this as a common instrument and at the same time to bring about an impact in the world. I think that it is important that this should of course be done with respect for subsidiarity. But I can imagine that, for example, High Representative, we can also hold exhibitions within the framework of the delegations that we have abroad, so that smaller states in particular could present their culture there, which they cannot do on their own in such countries . It's a small start: exhibitions. As the Presidency of the Council of Estonia, Estonia is holding exhibitions on the premises of the European Union delegation abroad. The big countries are all proud to do it alone. But giving the small countries such an approach here seems to me a wonderful opportunity to represent what is common and what is different. I think that for this reason, also in cooperation with international organizations - also under the obligations that exist with the Unesco Convention and cultural diversity, we have an interesting instrument here, with which we also strengthen politics in the interests of Europe and the Member States can do.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 400, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "Dear Colleagues!Now that the time is so advanced and we, if I break up every minute at one minute, the speakers are now at 12:10 a.m., I will not do a catch-the-eye procedure or take any blue cards.I ask all of you to really keep your speaking time.Under no circumstances will you get more than ten seconds.Thank you for your understanding.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 401, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Silvia COSTA", "mepid": "96917", "text": "rapporteur. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Vice-President Mogherini, I thank the co-rapporteur Brok and the shadow rapporteurs from the CULT and AFET committees, but also the many interlocutors from the world of culture and art who have collaborated with us on our report. Dear Vice-President Mogherini, You know very well how much we have fought in Parliament since 2011 to develop a European cultural strategy at the international level with one of our reports, which was followed by an important preparatory action up to the specific address entered in the conclusions of the Italian Presidency of 2014. I remember with emotion the important resolution of two years ago, which I see collected in your proposal, after the destruction of the cultural heritage of Nineveh and Palmyra by Daesh, with the barbaric killing of Khaled al-Asaad, for a common European commitment to the persecution of what we consider a crime against humanity. We appreciate the Commission's support for documentation and reconstruction, and the commitment to present a directive on the trafficking and import of illicit cultural property, which is the subject of a recent and important Council of Europe convention. You also know that we have fought with specific proposals to make culture and education a priority of the Commission, also under two other profiles: as an instrument of freedom, of human promotion, of intercultural and interreligious dialogue, and also to prevent radicalization. , but also as the fourth pillar of sustainable development, an engine of creativity and innovation, a new economy, quality employment, tourism. In the communication, which we greatly appreciated, we find these three areas as priority areas of a new European strategy which, while recognizing the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, intends to strengthen cooperation between the European Union and the Member States in the field of cultural relations. international. This will be good for Europe, but it will also be good for the world. Indeed, Europe has in common a great wealth of cultural, linguistic, historical and religious roots, on which it has built common values ​​and a culture of human rights, which are an instrument for understanding other cultures. This is why it is important for us that Europe recognizes, also in its external action, the value in itself of culture and cultural rights in the context of human rights, together with artistic and expressive freedom, giving coherence to the politics and actions of 'EU in the international arena, and making it truly an authoritative global player in the work of reconciliation and peace. The structured dialogue with cultural actors and stakeholders, the multi-annual partnerships with international organizations such as UNESCO and the Council of Europe, in particular for cultural heritage and trans-European cultural itineraries, will therefore be fundamental, but also the experimentation of European cultural platform. We want this strategy to be effective by including culture and education in all agreements and partnerships between Europe and third countries, starting with the renewal of Cotonou with the ACP countries. But we need good multilevel governance, as we have indicated, strong coordination between the four DGs concerned, a dedicated budget line and adequate human resources in the EEAS, with thematic and geographical priorities defined in annual and three-year plans. Each European delegation will gradually have to equip itself with a dedicated focal point, which dialogues with civil society, cultural institutions of the European Union and local authorities, with a people-to-people approach. It will be important to develop the international dimension of European programs such as Erasmus, such as Horizon, and above all greater coordination is needed to prevent and rebuild the cultural heritage at risk or destroyed, also giving life to that intervention activated by UNESCO, which unfortunately sees only the Italian participation with the blue helmet of culture.We propose to create a new international mobility program for artist residencies, aimed at young artists and culture professionals, a European cultural portal and digitization as the main use for new languages, aimed at young people, also by activating European media.We also want the current situation of refugees and migratory processes to have a strongly cultural dimension, which is essential for a future of peace.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 402, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   vicepresidente della Commissione/alto rappresentante dell'Unione per gli affari esteri e la politica di sicurezza. – Signora Presidente, onorevoli deputati, vorrei innanzitutto ringraziare Silvia Costa ed Elmar Brok per il loro ottimo lavoro. Spesso dico che l'Unione europea è una superpotenza. Non c'è dubbio alcuno che nel settore della cultura siamo una superpotenza: è il cuore stesso del nostro soft power, e finalmente abbiamo deciso di usare questa forza che abbiamo e che è unica al mondo. La relazione contiene elementi estremamente importanti per il nostro lavoro, un lavoro che abbiamo portato avanti in quest'ultimo anno in modo molto determinato e con una grande unità di intenti: il Parlamento, il Consiglio – io sono stata onorata di essere il primo Alto rappresentante a partecipare a un Consiglio sulla cultura – la Commissione, il SEAE e le nostre delegazioni sono già al lavoro con moltissime iniziative a sostegno, tra l'altro, della possibilità per i singoli Stati membri di usare la diplomazia culturale per le loro stesse agende. Veramente quello che vedo è uno sforzo di coordinamento e di sinergia interistituzionale in questo settore che mi fa ben sperare.  Culture is first of all a crucial resource for our diplomacy, opening new channels and facilitating mutual understanding, and it can help bring peace and reconciliation inside divided communities around the world. Beyond that, international cultural relations are also a resource for our economies in Europe and beyond. As Elmar was saying, this is something we have learned from our European history. European cultural excellence comes from Europe’s openness and diversity. As we have learned as Europeans, cultural exchanges make us stronger, and never weaker. It is in this spirit that the joint communication was conceived, with the focus on three pillars. The first is intercultural dialogue: the promotion of culture and intercultural dialogue for peaceful relations among countries and communities. A very good example of this is the recent agreement with Tunisia, which will become the first country from the southern shore of the Mediterranean to join the Creative Europe programme. More than ever, there is a need to create a space – I would say a common ground and a common language – to engage in cultural exchanges inside and outside our borders. Sometimes we struggle to find the right language to talk to each other or to find ways to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard. Think of young people. At times people who have difficulty in making their voice heard or finding a channel of active participation in societies in their communities, find that voice through culture, be it music or even street art, because our understanding of culture goes beyond classical music. This is also the strength of European culture. Culture can be a very powerful channel for engagement, participation and active democracy. Second, culture is a resource for growth and sustainable development, as acknowledged in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. This is true both inside the European Union, where culture and creative industries account for over 7 million jobs, and in other regions and countries of the word. We are working with developing countries to support cultural industries, establish creative hubs, and develop professional training and competence in new technologies. I will give you one example. We have recently started to support a project called Ethical Fashion in the framework of the trust fund for Africa. We provide craftswomen and tailors from West Africa with vocational training and with the opportunity to work with fashion companies from all over the world. Some of these people are migrants who were given the opportunity to go back to their communities and, with new skills and a new job, restart a different life. Thousands of jobs have already been created through just this project alone. A third strand of our work – and I conclude – aims at reinforcing cooperation on cultural heritage. Let me say in this regard that the first ever G7 ministers meeting on culture in Florence was a very big step forward for the international community, under the Italian presidency of the G7 this year, to promote support for cultural heritage. I would like in particular to express my support for the work done by some Member States, notably Italy and Germany, to protect cultural heritage from human and natural disaster. This month I will table a paper in Council with ideas to take this work forward at European Union level. In 2018, the European Union and Member States will celebrate the European Year of Cultural Heritage. Europe has built an unrivalled expertise in the protection and restoration of cultural heritage. It is our duty and our responsibility, but also in our interest to share this with the world. When we contribute to the restoration of cultural sites in Kosovo or the rebuilding of the Sarajevo city hall, we are also contributing to stability, reconciliation, security and peace in the Balkans. This is in the heart of Europe. Our work in Timbuktu to restore the mausoleum and the library is also a way to re-launch the local economy and tourism and to prevent terrorism. We will soon sign a EUR 1 million programme with UNESCO to support the recovery and reconstruction of Syria’s cultural heritage. This is also a very important element of our fight against the financing of terrorist activities and organisations. For all these different strands of work to succeed, we need to continue our work together with all European actors and all our partners in the cultural environment sharing the same sense of direction. Parliament has been one of the strongest advocates of a European Union policy for international cultural relations. The preparatory action launched by the European Parliament in 2014 laid the groundwork for the drafting of our own joint communication, so it is now time for us to work on our first strategy for international cultural relations. This is perfectly in line – as Elmar was saying – with our global strategy for foreign and security policy that contains a strong reference to culture. I will push for a specific focus on cultural diplomacy in the next phase of the global strategies implementation. So I count on continuing our joint work, together with the European Parliament, to finally fulfil our huge potential as a cultural superpower.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 403, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Bogdan Andrzej ZDROJEWSKI", "mepid": "124893", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Culture is included in the community policy.

What I want to point out is, first of all, on time. It must be remembered that the European Cultural Agenda had its formal start in 2007. Ten years on, we are in exactly the same situation with today's report, but without the tools at all. If the next stage comes after another ten years, it can be said that this potential will be wasted or at least not used. Second remark - one must clearly distinguish the promotion of culture because of its value in itself, because of the value of artists, institutions, museums, people, and another thing is using culture as a tool to improve the image, to communicate better. We also cannot allow some kind of schizophrenia: in this room we say that culture is a great potential, and at the same time the Horizon 2020 program has been limited, Erasmus + or Creative Europe are in trouble, financial resources are being cut that are shifted to the European Solidarity Corps.

I would like to say a few words about one thing, but it seems to me to be a very distinctive one, and that is this online platform for cultural diplomacy, which the authors of the report so welcome. The assumed goal of this platform is to conduct activities that strengthen the cultural commitment of the European Union with third countries and their citizens. Well, as Mr Brok said, the aim of European cultural diplomacy should be to show the complexity and diversity of Europe's cultural heritage in all its diversity, including national diversity. So the question is: why in the case of the platform was selected in the tender a consortium that de facto consists of cultural institutions from only one part of Europe? Could the assumptions of the project not take into account the necessity of geographic diversity, precisely showing the cultural diversity of Europe? Unfortunately, this resembles the story with the House of European History, which is also, after all, an element of the cultural diplomacy of the European Union, where history was presented through the prism of the experiences of only some countries in Northern Europe.

We emphasize in the text the importance of culture as a tool for diplomacy and ask that it be recognized as the fourth pillar of sustainable development and as a human right. Among the concrete measures, we recommend: an annual action plan with a separate budget line to support international cultural relations; a mechanism for the prevention, evaluation and reconstruction of heritage in danger, including an emergency instrument to safeguard heritage in countries in conflict; the inclusion of culture in all existing and future agreements of the European Union with third countries. The political objective of this report is to foster cultural cooperation between the Union and its partner countries and to promote a world order based on peace, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights. In the long term, a cultural cooperation inside and outside Europe that is respectful of basic values ​​of civilization and common principles represents the only way towards this much desired order. We need to promote international cultural cooperation, understood in the broadest possible way, from policies that ensure the conservation of cultural heritage to a scientific diplomacy capable of spreading more rationality and love of knowledge in a divided world.

I would just like to say that Federica Mogherini is right - naturally I also thank Commissioner Navracsics, even if he is not present, because it was a joint production, and all her staff - she is right: an effect has already been achieved, I have been able to I also verify personally, in the sense that not only in Parliament for the first time are two committees together that have addressed a topic like this, and they are important committees, but also that an integrated task force between different DGs has actually been activated in the Commission , which is already a very promising result, overcoming the somewhat \"siled\" approach, which is what sometimes sets us apart. I believe that another fruit is what you mentioned: we made a great request to the Commission, in particular to DG Culture, and certainly the climate that has been created has favored the fact that Tunisia is finally the first country on the southern shore. of the Mediterranean that can effectively participate in the Creative Europe program. I also hope that it will be the European Union, as you said, and we look forward to this initiative by the Council, which can effectively take over, as the European Union, the initiative regarding joining the task force for protection. cultural heritage at risk, but also to adhere to the European and Council of Europe conventions on the protection of cultural heritage. One last wish: it would be very nice that in Milan, where in December it will take place for the first time - not in Brussels, in Milan, and this makes me very pleased - the European Forum on Culture, where the European Year of Cultural Heritage will be announced and European cultural diplomacy will be illustrated, that we can think of a launch, a launch event in all European delegations, in all institutionscultural events in the world of this great initiative: the European year in an international dimension.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 420, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday 5 July 2017.Written statements (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 421, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Isabella ADINOLFI", "mepid": "124831", "text": "in writing. - The report under discussion deals with a very important and complex issue.

The objective is to contribute to the preparation of the EU priorities for the United Nations General Assembly session each autumn, which the Council normally adopts in July. We agreed on 18 compromises based on 255 amendments. I would like to thank all the colleagues who contributed to the final version of this report, the members of the EU-UN Working Group, the shadow rapporteurs, rapporteurs and political advisors for their constructive approach and the Secretariat of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for its excellent support. The annual United Nations General Assembly Recommendations report empowers our institution to present its opinion via the Council to the UN General Assembly on issues ranging from peace and security, through climate change, to advocacy of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. In its report, Parliament recommends that the Council, inter alia, should: continue to call for full respect for the sovereignty, internationally recognised borders and territorial integrity of Eastern European and South Caucasus countries, namely Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, in the light of the violations of international law in these areas; draw the attention of the UN member states to the increase in tensions between some countries in the Western Balkans; urge their leaders to show restraint in their regional policies, with the EU and the UN remaining fully involved in seeking lasting solutions to bilateral differences, including by acting as mediators where necessary; further encourage the UN’s efforts to bring about peace in Afghanistan and to overcome the fragile security environment in the country; strongly condemn the actions of the North Korean leadership that threaten peace and security in the Korean peninsula and beyond; reiterate its unequivocal condemnation of terrorism and its full support for actions aimed at defeating and eradicating terrorist organisations; and step up efforts to clamp down on the recruitment of terrorists; support UN efforts to prevent non-state actors and terrorist groups from developing, manufacturing, acquiring or transferring weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, and to insist on full compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention; call for a strengthening of the global response to migration and address the challenges and security concerns stemming from aspects of illegal migration, such as people-smuggling and human trafficking; reiterate its condemnation of any act of violence, harassment or persecution against human-rights defenders, and push for stronger engagement in promoting the rule of law; take concrete steps to ensure the efficient implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015; ensure that the EU remains committed to the fight against climate change and call on all UN member states to uphold the Paris Agreement; regain trust in multilateralism and try to convince all the UN member states that this approach is the right one and that the UN should remain an internationally recognised organisation in so many challenging places on our planet.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 427, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, this year I celebrated Europe Day, 9 May, in New York with the new Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, to stress the natural partnership between the UN and the European Union, at the precise moment when the UN system is coming under growing pressure – if you want to be diplomatic – or under attack, if you want to be clear. We have seen a resurgence of the very old-fashioned idea that national interest is not compatible with a cooperative global order. And we Europeans know from experience that this is not the case. Our national interest, our European interest is to invest in the UN system, in multilateral decision-making and in cooperative global solutions for global problems. The United Nations needs our support now more than ever, and Mr Guterres made it very clear in this Chamber just a few months ago. It is a pleasure to see that the European institutions share exactly the same views on global governance and on our support to the UN system. Your report is perfectly in line with the work we are doing to define the European Union’s priorities at the next General Assembly and, as it was the case also last year, the report has been itself a source of this inspiration for our work. The Foreign Affairs Council will adopt the EU priorities for the General Assembly on 17 July, and the draft text aims to be political and focused, reflecting the new context. The multilateral system of global governance is under attack, as I said, and it is the moment to somehow renew our vows, to commit even more to effective multilateralism. I would like to stress the word ‘effective’ because the best way we have to protect the multilateral system is to make it deliver. Over the last few years we collectively have achieved some impressive results through the multilateral system, through the UN system: the nuclear deal with Iran, the sustainable development goals, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to mention just a few. The European Union is working and will continue to work to guarantee that all these agreements are implemented fully and properly. We have this responsibility. We are exercising this, building strong global partnerships, starting with the Paris Agreement. With our consensus on development, we are leading the way in the implementation of the sustainable development goals. At the same time, we know that the United Nations needs reform. António Guterres has put forward a very ambitious reform programme. Changes to the UN culture, structures and operations will be necessary. And we will use all our political and diplomatic capital to help build a coalition in support of UN reform, and to support the UN Secretary General in this respect. We are ready to do so because we know that this is in our own interests. We know that we truly need a strong and effective United Nations, and this is why the European Union’s voluntary contributions to the UN funds and agencies amount to half of their total budget, and we are proud of that. This means that we invest as much in them as the rest of the world combined. We do this, not only because it is right, but also because it is smart. It is smart to invest in the World Food Programme to prevent a humanitarian crisis or a refugee crisis. It is smart to invest in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help millions of displaced people. It is smart to invest in UNICEF to help children in a war-torn country to go to school and prevent the radicalisation of future generations. And the list could continue. Investing in global governance, sustainable development, climate action – and here again the list could continue – is for us an investment in our own security. Hours ago in this Chamber we had a debate on European security and defence. I also stressed then that this is part of our work on security. Investing in a strong multilateral system and in a strong UN system is for us an investment in European security. Not only European security, global security. This is the European way to security and it is also the UN way to it. This is the contribution we will bring to the next UN General Assembly. Beyond the ad-hoc things we will continue to do, this is the main message we bring. We will focus on conflict-prevention, thereby making a contribution to building peace. We will continue to work to implement the sustainable development goals via development cooperation on human rights – a key pillar of our work – and we will work with Mr Guterres and with all our partners towards a more effective multilateralism.

The UN bodies obviously play a major role in this regard.

Looking at the world today, it is clear that the EU and UN must strengthen the role of women in all segments of society. We especially need the representation of women from marginalised groups. The empowerment of marginalised women is not only democratic. It holds out the prospect of how to build democratic societies.  To this end, I have tabled multiple amendments to stress the importance of women’s participation in peace and security processes, all in line with the numerous UN resolutions on this issue.

Moreover, it is no secret that many of the Member States of the European Union are divided on a large number of global issues, and I believe that setting common priorities is an opportunity to show the international community that the European Union can play an important role. on the global stage, but also to speak with one voice. As a shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group, I am extremely pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has been able to draw up a consolidated text in which some important proposals for our democratic values ​​have been voted on. The report makes it clear that the European Union is one of the most committed defenders and advocates of human rights, fundamental freedoms and diversity, the fight against climate change, democracy and the rule of law. At the same time, the European Union must continue to support multilateral efforts to find lasting political and peaceful solutions to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. But also to continue to call for full respect for the internationally recognized borders and territorial integrity of the countries of Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus, and to support the resumption of diplomatic efforts for a peaceful settlement of ongoing and frozen conflicts.

Among the numerous topics that require close cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations, our focus should be on prevention and early action to stop the onset of crises, as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy has already pointed out. I believe that out common EU-UN efforts in addressing the root causes of terrorism, countering hybrid threats and promoting cyber defence must be strengthened and coordinated. Early action also includes fighting terrorist propaganda through social media platforms and supporting counter-radicalisation policies, in line with the UN plan for action to prevent violent extremism.

Madam President, Commissioner, Commissioner! I would especially like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Jourová on a great achievement. Today is a great day for the European Union and for the fight against fraud. I warmly greet Commissioner Oettinger, who spared himself four years of tough negotiations, but who finally got on board in time for success. We are convinced that we have made a real milestone today in protecting the financial interests of the European Union and in the new competences for the European Commission. We have completed a legislative process on the directive on combating fraud against the Union's financial interests by criminal law - the so-called PIF directive - a cumbersome term. We are dealing with a historic moment because we are removing a major legal loophole within the EU and taking the step towards becoming a European Public Prosecutor. The Committee on Budgetary Control has been calling for such a European Financial Prosecutor to be set up for 20 years, and now we are finally ready. I'm happy that it was still possible before midnight. I very much regret, Madam President, that this House has dealt with all sorts of marginal issues, but it has not been possible to put this essential part of real progress for the European Union and real European unification on the agenda at a Christian time, where perhaps someone is also watching. I very much regret - and I appreciate that Mr McAllister is still here with us in the sitting room - that this Parliament can no longer distinguish between what is important and what is not. That is a milestone for the European Parliament. I'll book it under personal revenge that we are now around hit this time - I don't mind, I can't sleep at night anyway. I want to tell you that this vote marks the end of four and a half years of hard work on this directive. In April 2014, shortly before the European elections, Parliament adopted its position at first reading. I would also like to thank my colleague López Aguilar, the co-rapporteur from the Interior Committee, very warmly. We held trialogues from October 2014 to December 2016, with a break of almost a year and a half from June 2015 to October 2016 because the Council refused to accept Parliament's key demand - including VAT in the scope of the directive. The compromise text ultimately achieved is quite impressive from a parliamentary perspective. In particular, the inclusion of VAT is a very important step. I would like to thank the Slovak Presidency - even if everyone on the Council side is already in bed. I would like to thank the Council very much for the fact that the various presidencies have made it possible time and again to move on in this difficult matter. I would also like to mention the Italian, Latvian and Dutch Presidencies, under which significant progress in negotiations was also achieved. I would also like to thank the many committed employees of the Commission, but above all you, Commissioner Jourová. This would certainly not have been possible without your continuous and persistent constructive commitment. Today we are laying the foundations for the European Public Prosecutor's Office, the so-called EPPO. The PIV Directive harmonises the definitions for relevant criminal offenses - including fraud, active and passive corruption, improper use of funds - and lays down a minimum level for the associated maximum penalties. For It is precisely these crimes that the EPPO will then have investigative powers.It will also have the opportunity to investigate VAT fraud from ten million euros if at least two Member States are affected.I would like to tell you: Today is a good day for the European Union, for the finances of the European Union, and that is why I believe that we should definitely not rest in order to make EPPO a success now.Madam President, I have waited so long for the moment, that is why I have decided to brutally overrun my speaking time, so you have to unplug my microphone today because I think it is a really good day to fight fraud.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 445, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Juan Fernando LÓPEZ AGUILAR", "mepid": "96812", "text": "speaker. - Madam President, thank you Commissioner Jourová and Commissioner Oettinger for being here at this late hour of the night, at the stroke of midnight. After hours of debating strategic guidelines, recommendations and the situation in countries on which the European Union cannot legislate because it has no jurisdiction over them ... finally a legislative initiative! Finally a piece of legislation under debate in this House; nothing less than the one that best expresses the political dimension, including the constitutional ambition of the European Union, because it is European criminal legislation, finally, in the protection of the financial interests of the Union, in the protection of the European budget against fraud of European scale. These have been years of debate in which I greatly appreciate the cooperation of the rapporteur for the CONT Committee, Mrs Gräßle. We have worked for more than four years to fulfill this objective of the area of ​​freedom, justice and security, this Directive that harmonizes European legislation, making fraud against the European budget an objective of European criminal law that will be necessary to launch the European Public Prosecutor's Office , provided for in Article 86, with the protection of financial interests as the primary jurisdiction, but it is expected that - pursuant to Article 83 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - it can be extended to other serious transnational crimes. Well, here we effectively have a discussion of those that are worthwhile, because it is about preventing fraud from being subjected to forum shopping, that is, to the choice of the most favorable legislation, harmonizing the criminal response legislation of the States members. And this is exactly what this Directive does with regard to fraud, corruption, misappropriation and embezzlement, finally establishing minimum penalties, minimum penalties and a penalty of up to four years in prison for these crimes - for course, optional for the judge, to be decided by the judge. But the really important objective is that Parliament has entered into dialogue with the Council, and this dialogue has lasted no less than two and a half years, because we adopted the first reading in April 2014 and we have been discussing four main issues with the Council. .. Include VAT fraud as an objective of European criminal law, resisted by the Council. We have finally managed to ensure that this financial resource of the Union - because it is indeed a budgetary resource of the Union - is covered by this Directive. The final compromise states that VAT fraud will have to actually import a significant amount - more than 10 million euros - and that it will have to be cross-border in nature, that is, involve at least two Member States of the Union. Secondly, the discussion on fraud in public tenders has a European scale, and the Council undertakes to consider the matter in the future application of the Directive. Minimum and maximum penalties: a minimum penalty, applicable throughout the Union, for crimes of fraud and related crimes, with a commitment of at least up to four years in prison, provided that the fraud amounts to at least one hundred million of euros. It is a necessary objective to protect the financial interests of the Union. And the discussion regarding the limitation period, which is what is always more heterogeneous and divergent in the national laws of the Member States: we have established a standard period of at least five years from the date of the alleged crime, but can be reduced to three in the event that there has been an interruption of the limitation period by national legislation, in accordance with the appropriate considerations in the process when the suspect has fled the country or had to be extradited before it can continue the process. We meet, by Therefore, with a piece of European criminal law.Finally, European criminal legislation that fulfills the objective indicated by the Lisbon Treaty, an area of freedom, justice and security, necessary so that the Council can finally adopt its enhanced cooperation, launch the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which will be,undoubtedly, an achievement of this legislature so fast of legislative achievements in the development of the area of freedom, justice and security.This legislature, which has dragged its feet in meeting the objectives of the Lisbon Treaty, today, at last, is scoring a goal at the true gate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 446, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, it is pleasure to be in the Parliament today together with my colleague, Commissioner Oettinger. Yes, to achieve the consensus on how we are going to fight against fraud against the Union’s financial interests by means of criminal law, this is a historical moment. I am happy to be here at this historical moment in spite of the late hour. I would particularly like to thank the two co—rapporteurs, Ms Gräßle and Mr López Aguilar. Without your tireless efforts and your continuous support in moving this initiative forward, we would not be here today. A quarter of a century after the adoption of the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities’ Financial Interests, it was time to modernise the legislative framework on the protection of the EU budget. The Directive updates the definitions of criminal offences affecting the Union’s financial interests. It also introduces common rules as regards sanctions and statute of limitations linked to these offences. The Anti—Fraud Directive is a decisive step forward and, in combination with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, we are entering a new era. The Anti-Fraud Directive will essentially frame the activities of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). It will provide the material scope for the investigations and prosecutions of criminal offences falling within its competence, and will ensure that the EPPO can rely on harmonised definitions of these offences across the Member States. The Council reached a general approach on the EPPO in enhanced cooperation in June, and this Chamber will soon be asked for consent. I am confident that the EPPO Regulation can be adopted as soon as possible with a strong backing from Parliament. I am happy that 20 Member States have already notified their participation in the EPPO. This will make it an efficient tool to protect the financial interests of the EU, and I invite more Member States to join. The work has just started. It has not finished with the adoption in the Council. I will finish now because I know that we are in a hurry here.

Fraud, breach of trust, bribery, and corruption are crimes of considerable financial weight. But if they go against a public budget - whether on a national level or here in Europe - then they are also endangering democracy. Because if we allow the European budget to be enriched and thus harm taxpayers and citizens, then this will be anti-democratic. That is why today's step is something to do with the budget and the democratic principles of the European Union. So far there has only been one Council convention - after all. It's over 20 years old. Today you create parliamentary law. We are strengthening the legal basis for all activities of our services against corruption, bribery, breach of trust and criminal offenses of this kind with this PIF directive and with the reform of the OLAF regulation that we are currently preparing, with OLAF as before and EPPO new. On the basis of the EPPO regulation we have legal bases and organs and instruments which - I believe - are considerable, which correspond to the European citizen and which make a great contribution to the credibility and honesty of European budget programs. I am grateful to the rapporteurs, Parliament, Mrs Jourová and their services, and I promise, on my responsibility for OLAF and EPPO: We will do everything we can to ensure that both institutions work perfectly and in a coordinated manner. I would like to ask you to put the EPPO regulation into legal force as soon as possible. Then we will have a European Public Prosecutor in 20 Member States and OLAF will work with it. And in the other seven or eight Member States, OLAF will continue to do the work and assist the national public prosecutor's offices. In the course of EPPO / OLAF job development, we will do everything we can to ensure that EPPO can get off to a good start and OLAF is not weakened - along the lines of the tasks that remain in all European Member States.A good day indeed and a success, thanks to the tenacity of you, the rapporteurs in the European Parliament!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 448, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Tomáš ZDECHOVSKÝ", "mepid": "124713", "text": "for the PPE Group. - Madam President, I am very pleased with this compromise, which has been reached for so long, because it is extremely important for the European Union to finally put in place measures to ensure the effective protection of its financial interests.

After all, the convention on the protection of financial interests itself provides for this inclusion of VAT.

Unfortunately, the European Public Prosecutor's Office will be set up in Europe without being a member of all the Member States. Among them, countries that are key beneficiaries of EU funds are not participating in the cooperation. So I am afraid, ladies and gentlemen, that the European Public Prosecutor's Office will not be able to monitor the use of EU money in the countries where they are most at risk.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 452, "date": "2017-07-04.json", "name": "Petri SARVAMAA", "mepid": "112611", "text": "   – Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their very important work on this very important file.

Having common rules designed to protect the financial interests of the Union is not only necessary, but it also makes the recovery of misused funds significantly easier and more efficient. Even more, the directive is an important step for the effective functioning of the future European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which will soon be established through enhanced cooperation. Unfortunately, the Council could not agree with all of Parliament’s views on the harmonisation of criminal matters affecting the EU budget. But I am glad that, for the most important issues, our hard-working rapporteurs were able to include review clauses in the final text.

The conclusion of the negotiations on the directive on the need to better protect money and the financial interests of the European Union is - I think - really a historic moment. Google, Starbucks and Amazon selected the countries with the best tax advantages, while criminals chose the countries with the weakest judiciary. That is precisely why we need the European Public Prosecutor's Office. Every year the EU budget loses EUR 50 billion due to VAT fraud, in my home country Austria it is between EUR 2 and 3.5 billion. So there is an urgent need for action. Since the European single market, the national borders for the movement of goods and people have fallen. At the same time, crime and organized crime no longer stop at national borders. Now it has finally been determined what powers the European Public Prosecutor will have. This has created the legal basis for the work of this authority. Above all, the right of the European Public Prosecutor to intervene in national authorities is very important - a first step towards common European criminal law. 20 states are involved, and binding minimum and maximum penalties have been set. We are now starting with the European Public Prosecutor, who aims to protect the EU's financial interests. One thing must be clear: fraud with EU funds is fraud with taxpayers' money. Money laundering, corruption and fraud in tenders must be eliminated. And, Commissioner, one request: Greetings to Mr Juncker.

An EU defence plan can only work if it is based on a clear definition of what the common EU interest is by way of security and defence against external threats from state entities. That definition does not yet exist in a coherent manner. Moreover, such a plan would need a military doctrine explaining how security/defence interests would be ensured, based on pooled or jointly coordinated resources, able to conduct warfare. No such doctrine seems available for the foreseeable future. Worse, according to current thinking, internal and external security are different sides of the same coin. Not true. So the defence plan will likely proceed on the basis of contingent military responses, ad hoc. Though the European industrial-military complex is right to lobby for a harmonised armaments market, this does not justify a ‘defence plan’ and is achievable without it. Likely too, a ‘defence plan’ will overlook the interests of neutral countries while another European dual structure of ins-and-outs takes shape. Is this really worth it?

That is why I am in favor of adopting this directive, which deals with fraudulent offenses affecting the interests of the EU in public procurement, money laundering, corruption, VAT fraud and the willful misappropriation of funds. Since these are measures to support the development of countries and regions, we must not allow a situation in which money intended for the general good ends up in the pockets of criminals. As a rapporteur for the opinion in the Committee on Legal Affairs, I was tasked with developing a definition of an official that under the directive covers not only EU officials and employees of the Member States' institutions, but also private persons to whom public functions related to the use of EU funds have been delegated. The same definition should also apply to activities in countries outside the EU, as a significant proportion of the EU budget funds are distributed beyond its borders.
