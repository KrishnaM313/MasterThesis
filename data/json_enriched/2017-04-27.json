I would like to underline that President Hoyer shows an active interest in informing the European Parliament on the activities of the EIB. I would also like to underline the contribution of the shadow rapporteurs, numerous MEPs and the experts from the secretariat for the drafting of this report. We started with a rather brief report of almost 4 pages and we ended up with a report that contains 12 pages of evaluations and proposals. I tried to take into account most of my colleagues proposals because I do believe that they contribute to strengthening the role of the EIB and developing the institutional cooperation between the EIB and the European Parliament.  The report also incorporates parts of, and is supplemented by, the opinion of four parliamentary committees. I would like to contribute to the interesting discussion that will follow by underlining five major successes of the EIB in 2015 and emphasising five other points concerning its activities that could be strengthened or ameliorated. First, in 2015 the EIB played a major role in reducing the investment gap that characterises the European Union. Second, I am impressed by the support given by the EIB to countries like Greece that face major structural problems that have caused the collapse in investment. Third, I am encouraged by the fact that the EIB devoted 37% of the new lending granted in 2015 to the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises which altogether constitute the major collective employer in the European Union.  Fourth, I also welcome, along with my colleagues, who have approved the draft report of the ECON Committee, the strong and increasing EIB lending to innovative projects. Finally, I believe that the EIB acted as a catalyst in the fast and effective implementation of the EFSI. Positive developments in 2015 go hand in hand with some other aspects of the activities of the EIB that have been underlined by the majority of my colleagues and could be strengthened or improved. First, we feel that the EIB group should try harder to adhere to the Commission stance on aggressive tax avoidance structures and we call on the EIB to end cooperation with intermediary countries and jurisdictions that are not following the rules on the market.  Second, we take the view that the EIB should develop its support for micro finance and go beyond the first successful steps in this direction. In this regard, we also think the EIB should devise a strategy to increase the financing of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in countries with unfavourable economic and banking environments. Third, we also invite the EIB to further strengthen its investment in social housing projects and increase its social housing project lending in order to cope with the arrival of a large number of refugees in EU Member States.  Fourth, we encourage better coordination between the EIB and the Commission as far as the external lending of the bank is concerned so that projects financed by the EIB and third countries are in line with EU policies.  Finally, we reiterate our call for the signing of an interinstitutional agreement between the EIB and the European Parliament on the exchange of information, including the possibility for Members to address written questions to the President of the EIB. I believe that the economic, financial and investment environment in the EU is much better today than it was in 2015 and that part of the credit for that considerable improvement belongs to the EIB and its policies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-04-27.json", "name": "Nedzhmi ALI", "mepid": "34250", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from all political groups for their constructive attitude and valuable contribution during the preparation of this report. The European Investment Bank is a long—standing financing partner of the EU institutions, contributing to EU integration, economic and social cohesion and regional development through dedicated investment instruments. The European Investment Fund and the European Fund for Strategic Investments play a key role in complementing the EIB’s interventions. The cathartic effect of the EIB’s fund raising is a key element in defining EU debt added value and ensuring that Europe remains a leading player worldwide in terms of competitiveness, innovation, infrastructure and attractiveness.  Based on the above—mentioned, the main elements of the report are as follows: firstly, enhancing the sustainability of the EIB’s investment policy. In 2015 there was EUR 77.5 billion worth of operations out of which EUR 69.7 billion went to EU Member States and EUR 7.8 billion went outside the EU. The consistency of the EIB’s finance activities with the EU’s general strategy and political priority areas is of indisputable importance.  The EIB is a core actor needed to revitalise the EU economy and maximise the effectiveness and value for money of available financial resources. It is necessary for the EIB to systematically pay attention to mid— and long—term effects when defining investment actions and its funding decisions and to investing in projects of systematic importance in the long term.  While there is a need to speed up economic recovery and to help certain economic sectors in geographic areas catch up, it is important to have a balanced strategy with a dynamic and transparent geographic distribution of projects and investments amongst EU Member States. Also, it is important that corresponding banks in the Member States, in order to facilitate small and medium—sized businesses, should act so as not to complicate the criteria and the rules.  Secondly, monitoring the EIB’s impact in the implementation of key public policy areas, and the report on the results and impact of EIB operations inside the EU in 2015 reveals that the investments are in the following key areas: innovation and skills, small and medium—sized enterprises and mid-cap companies, infrastructure and environment. The EIB should continue to define its monitoring indicators, in particular with regard to supporting EU policies. With this comes also the importance of the EIB’s contribution to the management of global issues.  Thirdly, monitoring of the EFSI’s added value and additionality: thus EFSI aims at leveraging through the EIB a total of EUR 350 billion in extra investment, in new projects, and the EIB group is developing various new products that will allow for higher risk-takings. In this regard, result-driven investment should be regularly assessed through the scoreboard of indicators by the investment committee. The goal is to identify well— targeted projects in terms of their contribution to growth and jobs and to have an objective overview of their additionality, added value and consistency with EU policies. Fourthly, deepening the EIB’s transparency, accountability and international control is a prerequisite for better corporate governance. The EIB’s operations must be accompanied by a greater transparency and deepened accountability so as to ensure genuine public scrutiny of its activities, project selection and funding priorities. Transparency in the implementation of EU policy leads to strengthening the EIB’s overall corporate accountability and credibility. It also contributes to enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of the funded projects, alongside the zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption in its loan portfolio. It is important for the EIB to pursue its fight against tax evasion, tax fraud and avoidance, irregular activities and money laundering. Bearing in mind the role of the EIB to finance a broad spectrum of activities inside and outside the EU, and the significance of this financing for economic growth, it is important that this institution fulfil its activities to the highest possible standards. Finally, regarding the previous recommendations of Parliament, the EIB should report on their state of play and status, especially with respect to the impact of its lending activities.

The Commission welcomes the two reports from Parliament which are of interest to us this morning and I would particularly like to thank for their contribution the two rapporteurs, Mr Georgios Kyrtsos, for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Mr Nedzhmi Ali for the Committee on Budgetary Control . Obviously, I am here this morning to say how essential and particularly strategic the partnership between the Commission and the EIB is for us. It is the key to the implementation of policies which have become major in the Union, particularly in the areas highlighted by your reports. I am thinking, for example, of infrastructure financing, support for SMEs, employment, the fight against global warming, support for sustainable transport or even the Union's external policies. All this says to what extent this bank, which is our bank, has grown, a significant extension. Its achievements in each of these areas are, in fact, proof that Europe is useful and that it responds to the needs of our citizens as well as to their concerns. It is the Europe of the concrete that is being built. I regularly visit our territories in Europe to highlight them and to say what Europe is doing and where it is going. Each time the EIB is present. This is particularly important in the difficult context of the rise of populism that we are experiencing. That is why I share the point of view of your reports. The EIB must continue its efforts to support investment in the Union and we are by its side. This starts with, no doubt, even more support for management of SMEs. We fully recognize the need to strengthen the EIB Group's support to SMEs, in particular for the financing of micro-enterprises. Greater risk-taking may be necessary on the part of the EIB Group in order to finance smaller companies. The Commission shares Parliament's view on the importance of the programs implemented under the European Progress Microfinance Instrument, which should serve as a basis for the design of future instruments under the Union program European Union for Employment and Social Innovation. It also requires our cooperation. The Commission supports the recommendation that the EIB, the Commission, national, regional and local authorities, together with national development banks, whose role is also to be welcomed, should strengthen their cooperation in order to create even more synergies between the Funds structural and other financial instruments of the EIB. The Structural Funds can particularly contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Investment Plan for Europe, namely the Juncker Plan, and be complementary to the support of the European Fund for Strategic Investments. We also recall that the EIB, in close cooperation with the Commission, has implemented major initiatives in favor of youth employment and we know how much of a priority this is for our populations. The \"Skills and Jobs - Investing for Youth\" program thus makes it possible to cover a large number of business projects, both public and private. Finally, the Commission supports - and we have worked a lot on it together as part of the approach to the Paris agreements - the EIB's ambitious climate strategy, which is in line with the objectives of the COP21 Paris agreements, both in terms of which concerns energy and climate. The focus should be on activities, sectors and products that have a significant impact in achieving these goals. We must promote new, innovative financial instruments which will allow us to raise private financing, in particular through green bonds, the famous green bonds. We are working closely with the EIB and other actors to put in place new financial instruments that will facilitate sustainable mobility. For example, to develop this market, to reduce the use of fossil fuels, the Commission and the EIB jointly launched in December 2016 the program for cleaner transport. As regards external actions, the current decision on the external mandate of the EIB underlines the need for a strong coherence between the activities of the bank outside the Union and the policies, programs and instruments of the Union. In the current context of the influx of refugees and migration, the Economic Resilience Initiative (IRE), the EIB must be complementary with the new Commission initiative to implement an external investment plan. Therefore, the initiatives converge. The IRE initiative enables the EIB, through the external mandate, to increase its capacity to intervene in the states of the Mediterranean neighborhood and the Western Balkans. The new European Fund for Sustainable Development, the EDF, on the other hand, relies on blended finance. It targets sub-Saharan Africa, the countries of the Union's neighborhood. The ambition of the new FEDD fund guarantee is clearly to go beyond existing instruments by supporting innovative models of financing by the private sector, developed by partner financial institutions. The Commission can only congratulate itself on the ever closer cooperation with an EIB which covers increasingly broad fields, because it is up to our ambitions, which are shared ambitions, for more investment in Europe and investments that are capable of preparing our future in its various dimensions.The support of Parliament, your daily work, is useful - I think Werner Hoyer will share my point of view - in promoting the role of the EIB in pursuing the objectives of the Union, in particular in tax matters.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-04-27.json", "name": "Pierre MOSCOVICI", "mepid": "1983", "text": "   President of the European Investment Bank. – Madam President, Members of the European Parliament, Commissioner Moscovici, it is a great pleasure and honour for me to be here today to talk about the 16th Annual European Parliament debate on EIB activities, particularly as this year two reports have been drafted on the financial activities of the EIB in 2015. I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mr Kyrtsos and Mr Ali, as well as their colleagues for their thorough work. I notably appreciate the explicit support of both reports for the EIB’s work as a catalyst for financing solid, sound public and private long-term investments, as well as the acknowledgment of the bank’s important role outside the European Union. But issues raised in the reports are also relevant for the future so, if you agree, I will not limit myself only to 2015.  Investment is recovering in the European Union, but large differences in regional and sectoral investment performance remain, and we need additional initiatives and projects in order to address this investment gap. Taking into consideration the current political and economic climate, it is unlikely that in the future we will have more, or even the same amount of resources available not only to support investment, but in fact for EU priorities in general. In addition, public funding and traditional instruments such as grants will not be able to solve all the existing and new challenges Europe faces. We must therefore find intelligent ways to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of available public resources, namely by crowding in private investors and making full use of the capacity of financial institutions, consequently leveraging public money and making more funds available for the real economy. I insist on the wording ‘the real economy’, because this is where we work. We are not a monetary institution, we are a real economy institution, and this is why I believe our work matters.  I am firmly convinced that this calls for a further use of financial instruments. The EIB group, as the EU’s Bank, stands ready to identify the areas where financial instruments can complement and probably release EU grants and to continue to implement such instruments for the benefit of the entire EU. Consequently, we vest our hopes in the ongoing revision of the Financial Regulation and 15 sectoral legislative acts, the so called ‘Omnibus’, which aims inter alia at simplifying and streamlining the implementation of financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  To give you one concrete example, once adopted the Omnibus will facilitate the essential combination of EFSI with European structural and investment funds, which might simultaneously improve the absorption of ESI funds and bring more EFSI financing to some countries.  As highlighted in the reports, the EIB’s activities have contributed to sustainable growth and employment in Europe and to stability in our neighbourhood. I am particularly proud that the EU bank continues to be the world leader in climate-related finance, as well as of the effect our financing has on young people. In 2016 alone, we financed 46 education projects to the tune of EUR 3.7 billion, improving conditions for 890 000 students. Also last year, EIB group financing sustained 4.4 million jobs in SMEs, which is where most young people find work, and since its launch in 2013 the EIB’s skills and jobs ‘Investing for Youth’ programme has provided more than EUR 37 billion towards projects that support jobs and better skills for young people. I strongly support what Commissioner Moscovici has just said about the need to continue our engaged work in the fight against youth unemployment.  These concrete results show the impact of our work on Europe’s future. Allow me to give you another concrete example where our innovative and financing products make an impact, in this case in a country hit by the financial crisis. Two weeks ago we activated the Trade Fund Facility 2.0 that will benefit Greek SMEs and mid-cap companies? This facility will enable Greek banks to provide trade and export finance services to Greek SMEs and mid-cap companies at a time when no commercial lines with private banks are available. Through this facility the EIB acts as a secure bridge between international and domestic banks, supporting trade and export finance and therefore having a direct concrete impact on the business of SMEs and, as such, in the real economy.  Talking of innovative instruments and in view of the forthcoming parliamentary reports on EFSI Implementation and EFSI 2.0, I would like to take the opportunity to mention EFSI and how it can finance investment, trigger growth and the creation of jobs. EFSI has been a success so far. To date, we can be proud that almost EUR 184 billion in total investments have been mobilised – that is to say 58% of EFSI’s initial target of EUR 315 billion. We are very well on track.  Over 4 000 SMEs are to benefit from enhanced access to finance thanks to EFSI support and we have already approved 22 investment platforms, most of them being the result of a very fruitful cooperation with national promotional banks. Let me emphasise that in quantitative terms EFSI is not business as usual for the EIB. As a matter of fact it has changed our DNA. Two out of three promoters of projects which benefit from EFSI are new clients to the bank, and this clearly demonstrates how much EFSI has changed the EIB group.  I am aware that additionality, as we have just heard, is central to EFSI and that we need to do more to communicate and demonstrate it better, based on concrete examples of projects. Eligible projects rest on market failures or sub-optimal investment situations. They are only selected if they would not have been financed by the EIB group in the same period or to the same extent without EFSI support, as specified in the EFSI Regulation.  Another important aspect is geographical balance and the latest breakdown shows that EFSI favours many smaller EU countries and those hit hard by the economic crisis. I sometimes still read statistics from the very first beginning of the EFSI implementation which show a different direction, but nowadays it can be clearly said that EFSI projects are particularly where EFSI projects are needed most, and we are very proud of that. In any case I can assure you that we continue to work on this, working with a regional and local focus to facilitate EFSI support across the EU.  The central role we play in EFSI does not mean that we retreat from the rest of the world. On the contrary, out of the EUR 84 billion of EIB group financing in 2015, over EUR 8 billion went outside the Union, directly contributing to the implementation of EU policies and standards. In recent years, the world has become more integrated and more challenging than ever before. Those external challenges and the EU’s objectives beyond its borders are best met through a stronger and more integrated EU response, ensured by enhanced coordination and joint action between the European Commission, the Member States and the EU bank. The EIB’s external lending mandate is indisputably the most effective and efficient EU financing instrument and a powerful multiplier of EU external action. Its Guarantee Fund and portfolio structure allow the EU bank to support investment of around 30 to 40 times the EU budget demand provisions for the guarantee, thereby delivering concrete results and impact in third countries at minimal cost to the EU budget.  We are very grateful for the open and cooperative attitude of Parliament on this issue, especially for ensuring that sufficient resources are attributed to this instrument, which will allow the EU bank to continue its global level activities on behalf of the Union.  Also looking to the future, we should establish a clear complementarity and harmonisation of the different instruments that the European Union employs externally, namely: the External Investment Plan the Commissioner just mentioned; the External Lending Mandate of the ECB; the Resilience Initiative for countries affected by migration, and even the G20 initiative for Africa. Overlaps should be avoided and coordination should be demonstrated.  In relation to the EIB’s Economic Resilience Initiative which comes on top of our normal lending to Africa and the neighbouring countries, a brief reference, to let you know, is that this is already there on the ground and is delivering results. Both reports stress the importance that the EIB continues to be a financial institution of good practice. I can assure you that we put very strong emphasis on being a leading financial institution when it comes to issues such as due diligence, compliance, good governance, transparency and accountability. We are continuously in contact with other international financial institutions, NGOs and relevant authorities to ensure that we apply best banking practice.  Europe’s citizens expect and deserve parliamentary oversight for their bank, and I say this with pleasure as a former parliamentarian. Last year I had the opportunity to address the plenary, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control. There were also numerous hearings with other members of the Bank’s management committee and services. We are ready to even expand our close cooperation with the European Parliament. In preparation for this plenary debate we also sent a state of play on the recommendations tabled in the previous report to the rapporteur, Mr Pirinski, the respective committee secretariats and the MEPs who were closely involved in the drafting process. The reports we are discussing today suggests that this oversight consists of a more structured exchange, and although in principle I have no objection to discussing the idea I believe we must discuss how future arrangements might work. We are ready to engage in this dialogue. Let me therefore conclude by assuring you that the EIB stands ready to live up to its institutional responsibilities, both operationally and in terms of reporting, and we welcome our regular exchange with this Parliament on our activities and their impact on the ground. Thank you very much, and I am looking forward to the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PSE", "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-04-27.json", "name": "Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL", "mepid": "96991", "text": "Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Madam President, Commissioner Moscovici, President Hoyer, we in the Committee on Budgets believe that the EIB plays a key role in the application of an increasing number of financial instruments.

The EIB is doing good and important work in development aid by stimulating investment, fighting poverty, promoting growth and infrastructure. One has to acknowledge that especially when one sees that the European Parliament naturally also imposes a great number of constraints on the EIB in the form of other political goals, which the EIB is faithfully trying to implement. So big praise for that. At the same time it is the case that in the work of the European Investment Bank in the development aid area, there is certainly still more focus possible. There are different funding channels that are differently effective. In our statement, we pointed out that financing through microloans, in particular, had a particularly high impact in terms of jobs. We propose that these microloans be further strengthened.

In my opinion, the bank has been particularly successful and efficient in two areas. First, the implementation of the European Fund for Strategic Investment: as you said, after a difficult start, this has indeed been a success story. The second area is microfinance, which, indeed, with limited funds has been able to sustain a large number of jobs in the European Union. The focus of our report here in this discussion is how to increase investment, because investment is something which is very much needed in Europe.  In this context, let me raise two points. The first is that more attention should probably be paid to private-public partnerships. I think this is an important instrument to mobilise more resources, and is certainly a promising avenue to increase investment across Europe. The second point I would like to raise is geographical distribution, which I find still imbalanced. Much more money goes to the ‘old’ Member States, whereas the ‘new’ Member States account for less than 13% of total funding in 2015.

It is very important that the European Investment Bank's efforts are directed at countries, areas that do not have enough expertise to think and finance very large projects, to build financial mixes and to think of innovative ways to finance much larger infrastructure projects. . The role of the European Investment Bank should also be to support the European Union's efforts in the fight against tax havens, tax evasion, and I believe that the European Investment Bank should refuse to finance projects to companies that have offshore activities or working with intermediaries with offshore activities. I also want to welcome the European Investment Bank's decision to work much closer with the European Parliament.

I would like to focus on one crucial thing, and that is how we, as Europe, are going to reach the Paris Agreement. It is true that the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 2015 published a communication on climate change action, but after Paris we now know that decarbonisation is the aim. If we then look at the lending of the EIB, there is still a lot of fossil fuel lending – in 2013, at the level of EUR 2 billion; at 2015, at the level of EUR 2.5 billion – going up. In 2016 it was lower, but we know that two big gas pipeline projects are pending to the value of EUR 3 billion. That is big expenditure, and the issue is that investments in those infrastructures are there for decades. If we want to achieve zero emissions by half—time this century, then any investment in fossil fuel infrastructure should be considered very, very, very carefully. Especially as regards gas, which has always been promoted as a transitionary energy source, we know that if we take energy efficiency seriously, European gas demand will hardly increase. Why, then, do we continue to increase infrastructure? We know that every pipeline that you build is a lock—in. It is not a transition; it is a lock-in, and this is something the EIB should really pay attention to. It is why, in the report, we are asking the EIB to come up with a serious plan for phase-out fossil fuel lending, and I would very much like to hear the President responding to that. Hopefully we can work on such a plan, because what the EIB is doing in the end is instrumental for our future infrastructure, which should be fossil—free.

I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their constructive work. A number of good compromises have been reached in these reports. From my point of view, it is particularly important to highlight the EIB's focus on financing small and medium-sized enterprises, because they are the backbone of the European economy. With total assets of over EUR 600 billion, the EIB is one of the most important donors of SMEs, but also of micro-enterprises. In 2015 alone, 37% or EUR 28.4 billion was given to SMEs for new loans. The importance the EIB attaches to research and development, climate action, innovation and competitiveness and the fight against youth unemployment is also to be welcomed; In 2015, around half of all new projects were dedicated to climate protection. And, President Hoyer said, the EIB is a world leader in climate action. The EIB invests 90% in Europe. In this context, there is a clear commitment in the Kyrtsos report for increased engagement in investments to cope with the migration and refugee flows, i.e. increased engagement in neighboring regions in the Middle East and in North Africa; the resilience initiative was raised. A new capital increase by the EIB, as mentioned in the Kyrtsos report, appears to be particularly effective, and not only in the context of sustainable development cooperation, but also to close the investment gap in the EU.

So we come to the subject of cohesion, and I have raised this issue in previous part—sessions. In this regard, I would like to express my appreciation for the information which you mentioned also coming from the Bank on issues raised in previous sessions. Regarding cohesion, I have received information which recognises that the 30% horizontal goal for cohesion investments has not been reached over the past two years. In 2015, it was 26.5% and in in 2016 it was 27%. Clearly there is awareness of the importance of this objective. However, I would invite you to consider whether enough practical steps have been taken to better manage cohesion objectives because it is not only a question of better reporting, but of very carefully looking into the way of actually interacting with the Commission, if you like, to devise the proper policy responses.

Second, is the European Investment Bank suitable for risk, that is, for investing in the South? Thirdly, can it particularly set up projects from A to Z, when there is no longer a market and when there is a need for a regional planning policy? Shouldn't we set up within the EIB an investment agency, particularly between North and South?", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2017-04-27.json", "name": "Nicola CAPUTO", "mepid": "124851", "text": "- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis has significantly weakened European economic growth and one of the main factors is precisely the decline in investment.

The EIB must contribute to overcoming regional inequalities by providing advice on the development of private projects and identifying more effective ways to support the economic development of countries in the stabilization program. Access to finance is the real problem for small and medium-sized enterprises. It is essential to develop a new strategy that favors access to finance for SMEs, including through programs and initiatives to facilitate trade, such as the European Progress Microfinance Facility.

We very much welcome the new framework for this debate, with the contribution of two parliamentary reports with very rich content, one of which concerns the control of the financial activities of the EIB. This is the consequence of the growing economic role of the EIB and its strengthened investment capacities, which the European Commission wanted and supported. Europe's economic and financial situation demands very determined political action. We are convinced that the activities of the EIB are a crucial component of the European Union's efforts to restore sustainable growth and a better level of employment in Europe, in particular through the partnership between the Commission and the EIB in the implementation of the investment plan for Europe. We have only to rejoice in this relationship between us. Our confidence in the EIB is very well placed. I am convinced that Parliament's opinion on the EIB's activities will be, next year, as encouraging as the one it drew up on the EIB's 2015 report and it will also take into account new contributions from this bank, which is our bank. In this context, I am delighted that, under the attentive and vigilant gaze of the European Parliament, a very close and very fruitful cooperation continues between the European Commission and the EIB for the good of Europeans, for more investment and more jobs.

I think a couple of issues are really of key importance for me now, because I heard the words ‘focus’ and ‘coordination’ again and again, and I can report to you that in the context of the economic resilience initiative for the Southern Neighbourhood and the Western Balkans, in connection then with the external investment plan of the European Union, and the G20 initiative on Africa, it is very evident that more and better coordination is absolutely urgent if we do not want to confuse our partners in the political and economic world. Second point, I thank you very much for your remarks on the external activities of the European Investment Bank. It is only roughly 10% of what we are doing, but it is gaining importance because it becomes more and more evident that the European Union is sometimes serving its interests best if it looks beyond its own borders and takes activities outside the Union, and the EU bank is ready to support that. I believe in the future there will be more. There is one big issue that has been the focus of the discussions in Washington last weekend, and that is climate change and sustainability, and I can tell you that the wind is not necessarily getting any more favourable to these issues. We have insisted also in the discussions with the other multilateral development banks and international financial institutions that we must not lower our ambitions on climate change mitigation and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals which we subscribed to so happily only three years ago. I think it is a question of credibility also of the financial institutions that we do not forget what we subscribed to in New York two years ago and in Paris one-and-a-half years ago. The EIB is in the vanguard in this respect among the financial institutions. There is one big issue within the European Union that we have to address and we will address it now with the New York Regulation for EFSI II, and that is cohesion. I think it has been a mistake in the original legislation, and you have something to do with that legislation by the way, for EFSI, because the combination of the ESIF and EFSI was very difficult in the old regulation and with the new one that is now on your desks, I think this will get better. I think we can be better on cohesion in the next couple of years. However, I want to get away from the impression that comes back in reports and questions again and again that we, so to speak, favour the old, big, strong Member States of the European to the detriment of the small ones. I shall read out the EIB’s 2016 signatures as a percentage of GDP, and I shall just mention the list in the order of magnitude of the Member States. So investments per GDP: Estonia: 1; Malta, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Poland, Slovakia, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Italy, Lithuania – these are the first countries on that list and I think that reflects the needs and the fact that probably roughly three times as much per capita goes into a country like Spain, and that in comparison to my own country shows that the European Union and the European Investment Bank are aware of our special responsibilities vis-à-vis those countries which are either relatively new in the Union or are in difficulties, and Spain is a wonderful example where the EIB could make a substantial contribution to a thorough improvement of the situation, and we are proud of that. Then there has been a lot of worry about microcredit. I fully share that. We have lots of experience with microcredit outside the European Union and I think it is gaining in importance within it as well. I have heard well that you encourage us to take more risk. I agree with that as well. This is a cultural issue for a bank which invests, but it must not be overlooked that this bank is capital-market based. We are proud to say, and sometimes politicians are proud to say, the EU bank is the biggest multilateral lender in the world. It is. But we are also the biggest multilateral borrower in the world because we refinance by going to the capital markets for EUR 70-100 billion per year through the sale of EIB bonds, so we have an accumulated debt also of more than EUR half a trillion, and that means we have to be very serious when we talk about sustainability. That is a principle that goes beyond economics, of course, but also when it comes to the principle of economic viability and the concentration of social and environmental standards which we observe closely.  Finally, I know that questions of accountability are always of utmost importance and so are questions of transparency. Everything can get better, but if I compare this bank to its peers then I would like to say that we are second to none, and if the biggest one is second to none, then I think we are not completely on the wrong track.

A lot of issues were raised, in almost all cases in a constructive way. I would like to complete my contribution to the discussion with a positive assessment of the future activities of the EIB and its institutional relations with Parliament. First, the EIB is functioning in a more favourable economic environment than in previous years. The eurozone economy grew in 2016 at a rate of 1.7%, which surpasses the USA’s 1.6%. The economic dynamics are even better in the European Union of the 28 Member States. Public debt was reduced as a percentage of GDP in the eurozone and in the European Union as a whole. In addition, the budget deficit in the eurozone was reduced to 1.5% of GDP in 2016, much lower than the 3% limit. That means that the EIB is in a better position to collaborate with the Commission, the Member States, and the private sector to boost its investment activity. Second, Parliament has developed its constructive criticism concerning the activities of the EIB, and I am certain that President Hoyer and his collaborators will respond in a positive way. They have the managerial skills to further improve the operation of the EIB and President Hoyer, as a former parliamentarian, can grasp the political and social dimension of our criticism.

The EKR Group accepts the report on the financial activities of the European Investment Bank, appreciating its role especially in the field of lending and combined financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, I see two aspects of the EIB's activity that require special attention. The first is the need to increase involvement in financing greenfield investments in the so-called the new Unia - areas with a large share of agricultural land and wastelands. One of the leaders in using funds from this pool is Poland, where the number of greenfield investments has grown in recent years at an average annual rate of 9%. However, the increase in such involvement of the EIB should also be followed by an overall increase in the geographic scope of projects implemented under the European Fund for Strategic Investments and ongoing expert training for its potential beneficiaries. Enterprises from the so-called of the new EU, they often struggle with a relatively low level of know-how in obtaining available investment funds and cannot compete with their more experienced western neighbors, for example the United Kingdom - the largest beneficiary of recent EFSI investments.

I regret not having been able to join you a few weeks ago; as I indicated in writing to you, Mr President, domestic political obligations prevented me from accepting your previous invitation. There was certainly no ill will intended on my part, and I very much value the regular exchanges that I have with Parliament and stand ready to work with you in the coming months.  Before turning to Greece, let me shortly address the issue of my remarks in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last month. In this interview, I made the point that respecting our agreed framework is crucial for maintaining confidence and solidarity in the eurozone. In the days following the interview, however, my words were linked to the situation during the crisis periods in certain southern European countries. This is very unfortunate as it was not what I said, and certainly not what I had intended to say. The crisis years have impacted societies throughout the eurozone and throughout the Union at great social expense, and solidarity has been justified.  The way I expressed myself has caused offence, and I regret this very much. It was, of course, never my intention to insult people. I have worked for the past four years to bring the eurozone closer together, and the last thing I want is to cause new divides. As Parliament stated in its recent resolution on the budgetary capacity, we can only successfully strengthen the monetary union if responsibility and solidarity are closely linked. I strongly believe in that, and I will continue to work for that.  One way to move forward in strengthening the EMU is to develop the ESM further into a European Monetary Fund. On my initiative, the EFSF and ESM programmes are being evaluated at this moment. The report is being drawn up by an evaluation commission led by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell and will be published in June, and I can imagine we will devote one of our future hearings to this report. One important lesson is that we should keep and improve on the expertise that has been acquired over the crisis period, and to anchor it at the ESM. The ESM, in my mind, should be in the lead in designing, negotiating and monitoring future programmes. Also, the ESM could in the future have a broader preventive mandate in line with how the IMF does it now by developing its own country reports to assure objective macroeconomic analysis. In my view, the Commission should continue in its role as keeper of the pact.  Having said that, now let me turn to Greece. A lot has been accomplished in the first part of the current programme, such as reform in the financial sector, the setting up of an independent authority of public revenues, implementation of the first leg of an ambitious income tax and pension reform and the creation of a privatisation agency, etc. These steps proved to be instrumental in bolstering confidence, and have resulted in a return of deposits, a reduced dependency on ELA and in a much better than expected fiscal performance overall in 2016. Eurostat came out last Monday with a primary surplus figure of 3.9% for Greece.  Meanwhile, the second review is, admittedly, taking too much time. Therefore, at my initiative in February and following intensified high-level talks in March between the Institutions and the Greek Government, an over—arching agreement was reached earlier this month. The authorities in the Institutions have agreed on the size, the sequencing and the timing of reform measures underpinning a growth-friendly rebalancing of the economy. In short, the authorities committed to legislating up-front further pension and income tax reforms, each worth about 1% of GDP. Pension reforms will become effective in 2019 unconditionally. Income tax reform is planned to become effective in 2020 in principle, unless front-loading is needed. We also agreed that the authorities can now legislate expansionary measures to implement as of 2019, provided of course that the medium—term targets are met. Apart from possible tax measures, it provides for improvements to the modernised social safety net that Greece is rightly developing.  Beyond this, recent discussions also concerned labour market reforms that balance the need for a flexible economy with the vital respect for workers’ social rights in line with European best practices. This approach has allowed the institutions to resume their mission in Athens. They returned last Tuesday, and I am confident that an agreement on the whole package will be reached very soon. The Eurogroup will then also review Greece’s medium—term fiscal trajectory and debt sustainability, and let me just say that I believe that the ten-year period of a primary surplus target of 3.5 per cent should be shortened.  In terms of the next steps, I expect that all of this will allow all institutions to come to the conclusion that the numbers add up, and the IMF to financially participate. I hope to be able to report to you the successful conclusion of the second review before the end of next month, allowing confidence to return to the Greek economy and for Greece to join all other eurozone countries in their ongoing process of economic recovery.

I want to salute Jeroen Dijsselbloem in passing. I can testify, having previously been Minister of Finance and now Commissioner, that, since taking office, he has worked tirelessly to find a solution to Greece's difficulties. He also made remarks on the future of Economic and Monetary Union. We will have the opportunity to talk about it. The European Commission will itself provide its own reflection document within a few weeks and it will indeed be necessary to reflect on the most harmonious articulation between the role of the European Stability Mechanism and the Commission as guardian of the interests general. We are meeting here at a very timely moment, following Eurostat's notification of the 2016 deficit figure at the beginning of the week, which validates what the Commission has been saying for several months, that is to say that the he Greek economy has shown itself to be resilient in the face of the turbulence of 2015 and the effects of capital controls. According to the program definition, the 2016 primary balance should amount to 4.2% of GDP. It should be remembered that Greece is doing significantly better than the 0.5% of GDP target set by the program, nine times better all the same. Still, of course, subject to confirmation. Certain elements are the subject of ongoing discussions with the Greek authorities and Athens, but the performance is still to be welcomed. Greece is therefore on track to meet its target of 1.75% in 2017 and 3.5% of GDP in 2018. This is what the Commission thinks. These developments are the result of Budget consolidation package which included quality parametric measures, adopted in 2015 and 2016, with a cumulative budgetary return. We must still be aware of the effort figure of 4.5% of GDP. Such efforts should not be forgotten or ignored. They must be grounded and deepened. This is good news, but we must be careful not to be complacent about the economic and social situation in Greece. As I told you the last time I was with you, the positive trends seen in 2016 now seem to be stalling, in particular due to the delays in the culture of the second MES program review and we know that unemployment remains at unacceptable levels in absolute terms, especially youth unemployment. Investment must also be boosted further to support growth. Greece cannot afford to lose the momentum gained in 2016. This requires constructive support from all to accompany the process of anchoring reforms and the recovery, which has started to emerge. For me and for the Commission, this means that the Greek authorities, all the institutions, all the players must be even more vigilant. We must work constructively and collectively to bring the second review to a close as quickly as possible. Where are we? What are the next steps? I am just repeating what the president of the Eurogroup said. First, substantive agreement was reached in Valletta this month on the post-program budgetary parameters needed to secure the deal. This should also help to close the review and fill in any remaining gaps. The post-program package for 2019 and 2020 will be fiscally neutral if forecasts are correct. It will consist of new budgetary measures amounting to 2% of GDP. But these measures basically amount to a restructuring of public finances to strengthen growth and social protection. Indeed, the package also includes 2% of pro-growth measures to be implemented if Greece meets its primary surplus targets, as we believe it will. At the same time, the Commission will continue to closely monitor the social impact of the package, in particular on pensions. The Valletta accord and the contacts that have been made since have enabled the institutions to return to Athens this week. The goal is shared, and that is to reach a technical agreement quickly. This deal is essential to mitigate the risks posed by delays, including over the positive budgetary result recorded in Greece last year and to deal with uncertainty, which is the Greek economy's worst enemy. Greece and its authorities have made significant progress on areas of the agenda that remained unfinished. I will not go into detail here since they were presented during our discussion at the last plenary session. But the current mission should make it possible to make progress on the elements that remain to be dealt with, both as regards the conditionality of the review and the post-program measures. We remain convinced that, thanks to the fundamental reforms and the efforts to be pursued within the framework of this program, the Greek economy is able to turn the page on a long and difficult period, but it must be supported, and not hindered by uncertainty. The recovery must also be sustained and anchored. In the work of the Eurogroup, under the responsibility of its President, the Commission is doing everything in its power in its role as facilitator to ensure that the balanced package of measures is implemented faithfully and swiftly. Once the technical agreement has been obtained, the Greek authorities must implement a series of measures prerequisites. I note that some have already been implemented, but others need to be finalized in the days and weeks to come legally and administratively. It’s not an easy task, but we are convinced that we can do it. If all goes in a constructive way, the evaluation of this second review should allow a formal agreement - this is what I hope for at the next Eurogroup - and thus pave the way for the disbursement of funds. Finally, the Commission will also continue to support efforts to make Greece's debt more sustainable. We believe it is necessary and possible. As you know, we have been arguing for some time that a more realistic path for the primary surplus will be needed after the program ends. This is what we are fighting for. Without a more credible trajectory, markets will be unwilling to lend at reasonable rates and Greece will continue to depend excessively on the support of its European partners. Ultimately, it is a matter of burden sharing between Greece and the Eurogroup. In this context, the Commission is obviously ready to work to find a fair compromise. I believe very sincerely that this is what we are succeeding in doing with Jeroen Dijsselbloem.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 46, "date": "2017-04-27.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "Before we begin the debate, I inform you that I will not be accepting a \"blue card\" question today.We are in a hurry because the vote will last about an hour and a half.So we have to hurry.Thank you for respecting the speaking times during the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 47, "date": "2017-04-27.json", "name": "Françoise GROSSETÊTE", "mepid": "2025", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, first of all, I am of course going to address the President of the Eurogroup and tell him that I regret, like many of my colleagues, the comments he may have made recently on the Southern countries, because the social distress experienced by many of our fellow citizens deserves better than caricatures and that seemed to me to be an insult to all those who work in those countries. Let's talk about Greece, where precisely this social distress is felt much stronger than anywhere else. Almost half of young people under 25 are unemployed, nearly half a generation is sacrificed, thousands of people are genuinely suffering and the health care system is in trouble. We must all make the effort to understand. Of course, to understand does not mean to apologize and, the commissioner has told us, we must not be complacent. If Greece is in this situation today, it must be remembered that it is in large part because of some of its leaders, such as Mr. Tsipras who, due to his unwillingness to make reforms, beginning of its seizure of power, brought us into this populist impasse. Today, we finally see that there is a commitment to reforms. The situation is slowly improving. We need to achieve lasting improvement, and of course we hope that the second tranche of aid can be released before the summer. The difficulties, which we also encounter with the IMF, are perhaps an opportunity to re-examine the question of Europe's independence in terms of macroeconomic surveillance and lending of last resort.

But now let us focus on Greece: the Greek economy is at a turning point. The primary surplus for 2016 has reached an astonishing level – far above the target of 0.5. IMF forecasts have proved to be wrong. Notwithstanding such an impressive fiscal consolidation, economic recovery is underway. The agreement reached at the last Eurogroup on the fiscal structural measures and the contingent expansionary package has been difficult, but now it gives us the concrete hope that this top—level agreement can be reached quickly, possibly in a few days. On this basis, we expect – and urge – the next Eurogroup to conclude the second review and to address the necessary debt relief issues. It is evident, as you said, that the primary surplus of 3.5 can be sustainable only for a very limited period of time. We need a medium—term fiscal path which is economically realistic and credible and a package of medium-term debt relief measures that is consistent with such a revised path. This overall political agreement is urgent and essential, not only for allowing Greece to honour its financial commitment in good time, but is necessary to keep up the positive momentum of the economy and to allow Greece to return to bond markets and to be included in the ECB QE programme, which will be a powerful driver towards stability, confidence and growth.

It now reaches the backs of the Greek people between Berlin and the International Monetary Fund with this ping pong! Mr Dijsselbloem, how do you, a Social Democrat, want to go down in history? As the president of the Eurogroup who contributed on the initiative, under pressure, to have a comprehensive package deal on 22 May or for your unfortunate statements about women and drinks?

Welcome. Today we talk about Greece once again, and once again we talk about budget cuts. The Eurogroup that you chair, Mr Dijsselbloem, is insisting on yet another round of cuts: of cuts to pensions, and of taxing people who have as little as EUR 500 a month in their pocket. These measures will continue to suffocate the recovery in Greece and will also increase social disruption, but nevertheless the Greek government is actually doing what you wanted it to do. It is delivering all those things; it does its ‘homework’, as you like to call it, despite the most horrific social cuts. It is time to acknowledge that, and it is time to give Greece some time to breathe and to actually do the long-term reforms that we really need and that are really necessary.  But we also shouldn’t forget the other side: it’s also the Eurogroup that must deliver. It’s actually you, Mr Dijsselbloem, who has to do his homework. Where is the debt relief that was already agreed for Greece in May 2016? Where is the end of the austerity paradigm that has brought so much suffering and very little success? What have you done as Chair of the Eurogroup, together with your fellow finance ministers, to end tax avoidance and tax evasions? By letting big companies avoid taxes, we lose EUR 70 billion euros each year, and that’s roughly half of the EU’s annual budget – money that we very much need to invest into Europe’s future. We cannot be tough when it comes to cuts for poorer people and be lenient when it comes to the tax avoidance of big companies. Frankly, I think the Europeans deserve a change of that policy. Let me also say something a little more personal, because I actually don’t believe that this was colourful language which you have used, Mr Dijsselbloem. It is nice that you say you did not want to insult southern countries. Very nice, but you still don’t understand that with your statement you have insulted half of the European Union population – all the women in this House, all the women everywhere in the European Union – because you say that women are an object that you either buy or spend money on. This is unacceptable, and I don’t understand how you cannot even see that there is a problem. This has brought about a lot of problems – a loss of credibility to the European Institutions, to us, to the Commission, to you and to the Council, and this is now your legacy that you have to deal with. I find this unacceptable. Shame on you, Mr Dijsselbloem, for disrespecting half of Europe’s population.

These are just issues that are brought forward, but which at some point will present their bill.

The real goal of the international usurers is to impoverish the Greeks financially, to force them to tolerate their governments handing over to these usurers the subsoil and submarine space of our country rich in energy resources and precious metals. So the problem of Greece is not economic. It is political and will be resolved in a political way. Greek nationalists will not tolerate what is happening in our country what is happening in Venezuela. We do not tolerate the transfer of our national sovereignty and the transformation of our country into a third world one in order to save the euro and to enable the political and economic elites of Germany to dominate in Europe.

I would like to make the following clear: Debates about further debt relief are not only impossible under contract law, these debates will not solve the root of the problem: A focus on debt relief alone is misleading. Argentina has gone into state bankruptcy with around 60% debt. Japan is still in the markets with a debt burden of around 250%. A fundamental reform of the economy, the labor markets and the pension system and measures for more competitiveness and effective privatization are what is and remains essential for the future. We need an honest change in action in Greece. However, if the International Monetary Fund's allegations are correct, namely that the surplus figures may have been embellished, I still don't see this change in action.

First, the growth of the Greek primary surplus is unlikely to last very long. According to the International Monetary Fund, it was due to one-off factors such as higher tax revenue. In the longer term, according to well-known professors Panizza and Eichengreen, it is unrealistic to expect sufficient surpluses to service Greek debt. Secondly, as German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has pointed out, the Treaty of Lisbon prohibits the reduction of the nominal debt of a member of the euro area, and debt is not even Greece's biggest problem, but competitiveness. Third, instead of restoring competitiveness, economic adjustment programs have exacerbated the problems of poverty, generating opportunities lost for generations, although there has always been a quicker and less painful way to restore external competitiveness, namely the abandonment of the euro.

The state of play of Greece's stability support program is a very important debate and, as you have all pointed out, it comes at a rather critical time, because Greece is at a crossroads today. After a year and a half of support programs from the European Stability Mechanism, it is now time to consolidate the progress made so far in Greece, to support the economic recovery that started to emerge in 2016, which awaits the conclusion of the review, and therefore ensure a successful exit from the program in 2018, as planned. The Commission once again welcomes the agreement reached within the Eurogroup on 7 April in Malta. I think this should allow the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to join the program. The post-program package - I say it again here - will be budgetary neutral if our forecasts are correct and I say to those who have criticized them here that, in general, in terms of budget surpluses, they have not not deceived. As for growth, that is another matter, because growth is very much dependent on precisely the progress of the program and that is what we have to take into account. All this essentially amounts to a restructuring of public finances to strengthen growth and social protection. There is, it is true, some work to be done in the days to come. (The President interrupted the speaker to demand silence in the hemicycle) However, I am convinced that the current mission can allow substantial progress. We are not very far from the end goal. Therefore, rapid progress must now be made to complete the review of the second program. It requires achieving to an agreement at the technical level in the coming days. For this, I repeat, the Greek authorities will have to implement a series of preliminary measures for the whole program. An agreement on the completion of the second review, which should also provide certainty on the primary surplus and the sustainability of Greece's debt, should be quickly reached between the partners. I am convinced that a lasting recovery, that economic and financial stability are not only in the interest of Greece and its citizens, but very clearly, it is in the interest of all, of the European Union as a whole, and we are aware that we are extremely awaited at this precise moment. We must all live up to the deadline with no short phrases, no ideological position but with a shared concern that Greece will move forward, regain growth and stability, create jobs and can simply move towards exit from the program.

The choice of words was unfortunate and people have been offended, and I regret that. The underlying debate still remains valid: that to build a community requires everyone to take responsibility, respecting agreements and frameworks, and, on that basis, moving forward together and strengthening solidarity in the Union and in the eurozone. That is the legacy that I would like to leave. That is what I have worked for and I think, looking back on the last four and a half years, the eurozone is in a much better state than when I came to the job as we are moving out of the crisis and many Member States are back into strong growth. I stress again that my remarks were about the responsibility for all Member States, not some of them, and if the impression was that it was about some of them, I regret that. It was not my intention. I believe that all of us should take that responsibility. I will make one remark about my personal opinions on the development of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM): I believe it can play a stronger role, which would also allow the IMF not to be part of future programmes. I am not excluding them from being part of future programmes and I certainly hope we won’t need any future programmes, but I feel that the ESM can play a leading role and that it should develop in that direction. That does not mean that I wish to take away responsibilities from the Commission. I made my remark about the Commission to underline that I feel that the Commission should stay in the lead as the guardian of the pact and the rules that we share.  Finally, on Greece, Parliament has my personal strong commitment that we will achieve that deal for Greece in May. It needs to be done in May. We have put in a lot of effort. The situation in Greece is not good enough; growth is falling back again where we need trust and growth to continue. So, yes, you have my personal commitment and I will come back to Parliament as soon as possible with that fair deal for Greece. I believe that, already in the package we are discussing now, the emphasis is not on austerity; it is about deep reforms that are necessary to create more growth, and any fiscal outcome of that can be reinvested in Greece and used for the positive policy initiatives so badly needed in Greece.  Finally, yes, we will discuss debt, and debt relief will be needed to find that solution. That is my opinion, and I believe that is shared in the Eurogroup. Last year we already gave that commitment to come back to the issue of sustainability of debt for Greece, because that is the only way that they will come back onto a sustainable path and a sustainable economic future.

The IMF continues to push for a haircut for Greece, while European creditors expect a primary surplus of 3.5% from next year and thus take Athens' debt sustainability as a given. In the context of the implementation of the reforms promised as part of the third aid package, a haircut, as the IMF is calling for, is politically not feasible at the level of the EU member states in the 2017 election year. The Greeks have long been granted an indirect haircut through interest rate cuts and term extensions. The economic outlook for the current year is good, but Athens lacks the liquidity to make the next multi-billion dollar repayment tranche in July.

However, I would like to talk about the fact that the famous Juncker Investment Fund was to be taken as a complement to the activities of the European Investment Bank. Unfortunately, this does not happen very well. We would just need Junck's investment fund to focus more on risky financial instruments and not to compete too much with the European Union's structural and investment funds.
