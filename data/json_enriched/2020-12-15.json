Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Thank you, Commissioner, for being here. It is also a great honour for me to be able to speak of this place, because it is now almost a beaten year that we have worked out a compromise with the Council. Mr Eickhout and Mrs Müller were also present, which was a night shift with the Finnish Presidency. However, it was important that we finally managed to get this modernisation of the Drinking Water Directive, which had been on the hump for twenty years. However, we have also taken various things on board, such as the first European citizens' initiative, which has collected the necessary – over a million – signatures. For example, we have included a new Article 13 describing access to water, and this is intended, in particular, to help our most vulnerable groups of society without permanent residence to gain access to water. That is why we have called on the Member States to finally make drinking water sources available in public places and in public buildings, in order to give these social groups a chance. However, we have also increased transparency. We want information on price scale, but also on the quality of water, to be more accessible to the consumer, because trust in drinking water will also lead to less plastic being used, more drinking water to be used, and that benefits us in many respects. However, we have also addressed the challenges, requirements and recommendations of the World Health Organisation and have adapted various limit values. For example, in the case of lead, we now have stricter limit values. But we have also gone further in order to finally put our close eye on new substances such as endocrine disruptors, in particular bisphenol A, but also microplastics, which were not yet provided for in the old directive.  In addition, in times of climate change, we are of course also talking about the consequences of climate change: about drought. That is why it was irresponsible for us to leave out various things. The Council would have preferred to do this when it comes, for example, to the loss of the lines. Many of our pipeline systems in Europe are very, very old and have a leak rate that can be up to 70% in different Member States. That is why it was very important that we also tackle this problem. I mentioned the trust in drinking water. Why is it important that people know how high quality our water is? When people drink water from the tap, they must be aware that drinking water that is bottled will require up to a thousand times more energy to transport this water. In other words, we are also reducing the amount of plastic waste generated by bottles. We actually laid a foundation stone for the Green Deal before the Green Deal was even on the table. I think that is something where we, as a Parliament, have also played our part in strengthening our ambitions. In this sense, I would like to thank all the colleagues who have worked on this. Today, however, we also have a resolution and a question for oral reply to the Commission, in general on water policy. We have just talked about stricter measures and stricter criteria for drinking water. That is why it is also important that we do not rely too much on cleaning processes and other cleaning methods. We need better protection of our water sources. That is why it was and is important that the Water Framework Directive is properly implemented by the Member States. There is the problem: we have the evaluation from the Commission, we have taken note of it. It is stated that this set of rules of our European water regulation is actually fit for purpose, but that implementation in the Member States is often either underfunded or simply far too far from reality to have our waters in good ecological, good chemical condition by 2027 – that is the aim. We must also note that more than half of our surface waters are still in poor condition. Freshwater stocks have fallen by 83% since 1970 – here again the link to the Green Deal, we definitely need to get on with it. European wetlands are natural carbon stores, and these too have fallen by 50% since 1970. In our resolution, we called on the Member States, and also the various sectors involved – agriculture, energy or even industry – to get involved. We have therefore set out the 'polluter pays' principle more firmly anchored. I would also like to thank my colleagues who have worked constructively with us. We have forged 34 compromises out of the 359 amendments, which have been supported across all political groups. We naturally have minor differences between colleagues in how we interpret this. However, I think there is a great deal of agreement here in Parliament, and I would therefore like to thank all the colleagues involved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Sara CERDAS", "mepid": "197641", "text": "  Author. – Mr President, the Water Directive is, to date, the main instrument of the European Union's water policy establishing a Community governance framework for integrated water management, the slowdown in the deterioration of its quality and the reduction of chemical pollution.  Currently, less than half of the EU's water bodies are classified as \"in good condition\" and only one of the 4 freshwater indicators has made progress over the past 10 to 15 years. The European Parliament therefore considers that the implementation of this Directive must be improved and accelerated. There have been, and are, a number of constraints when implementing water legislation due to inadequate funding and insufficient integration of environmental objectives into different sectoral policies. In this context, it is essential to focus on the application of water legislation by the different Member States. We have not achieved the objectives we have set ourselves for 2015 and we must work together quickly to achieve the objectives by 2027, which are these: the protection of all forms of surface and groundwater, inland and transition, the restoration of existing ecosystems in and around the water bodies, the reduction of pollution of water bodies and the guarantee of the sustainable use of water by all.  The control of the adequacy of water legislation has made considerable differences in application between Member States, in particular in relation to controlled pollutants and the limits set out in the Groundwater Directive.  So how does the Commission intend to achieve a more harmonious application? The integration of the objectives of the Directive needs to be improved in the different sectors, in particular agriculture, energy and transport, and these must be aligned with the strategies of biodiversity, the circular economy, zero pollution and the Common Agricultural Policy. What additional measures will the Commission take to protect water in the agricultural sector? Speaking now of chemical pollution, how does the Commission intend to solve the problems in the field of chemicals and pollutants that raise new concerns, namely how are drugs and microplastics? How will these substances be regulated? The next Multiannual Financial Framework should allocate resources for water conservation. Ambitious actions and projects need to be promoted to contribute to the objectives of the Directive that have not yet been achieved. What measures will be taken in this area?  We need to assign responsibilities to those who cause environmental damage, thereby encouraging non-pollution, changing social behaviour and becoming more aware of the importance of this scarce resource. When will the user-pays and polluter pays principles be fully implemented? So far, exemptions from the Directive have been used in an unjustified manner. The provision of more data, greater transparency and information on water management, aided by coordinated work between local, regional, national and European authorities, will contribute to greater and better river basin management. So how does the Commission intend to reduce the use of exemptions from the water directive in the 3rd cycle of river basin management plans? Effective and immediate responses to the challenges facing the water sector are therefore urgently urgently in line with its direct impact on human health, energy production, agriculture, food security, among many others. Specific funds and programmes are needed to enable the objectives advocated by this Directive to be operationalised. Finally, it is essential to focus on raising awareness of the importance of this resource, because we have no doubt, if no action is taken we will not achieve the proposed objectives for 2027. I would remind you that the mismanagement of this scarce resource will have serious long-term consequences for all of us and for our environment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Michael Roth", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Good morning, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Thank you for the invitation. Nice to be back here, I feel very honored. And the fact that I am able to speak again in the European Parliament in what is expected to take place here last week fills me with particular joy. Ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, the issue of water has been a topic of concern to us in the European Union for over 20 years – a highly controversial, highly sensitive issue. But we certainly agree – no matter where we are politically and what institution we represent – that clean, healthy water is the most important basis for a good life and that it must be our common goal that we work to ensure that all people in the European Union and, of course, globally have free access to clean water. This year, the European Parliament and the Council adopted two very important acts on water, and I would like to remind you of this once again. And this also makes it clear that we are also trying to live up to our responsibilities. Firstly, the regulation on water re-use in May 2020 and then, more recently, the recasting of the Drinking Water Directive in December 2020. Yes, we are still a long way from our common goal of being clean rivers, clean lakes – everywhere. The Council warmly welcomes the Commission's report on the aptitude test of EU water legislation and its main conclusions. Water legislation so far has, by and large, served its purpose. However, honourable Members, there is, of course, still a great deal of room for improvement, and I would just like to comment very briefly on the most important points: these are the right investments. This is concrete implementation in the Member States and in the regions, but also at local level. This is the inclusion of water in other policy areas: transport, agriculture – agriculture alone is responsible for 33% of water consumption, and a significant burden on our water is also caused by the agricultural sector. In this respect, it is important that we look at these different sectors and also ask what responsibility each sector has for the objective of making the waters cleaner. And then, of course, there is also the issue of chemical pollution, and we are facing completely new tests. But it is also about the administrative agreement and, not least, about digitisation. The Commission has put forward important proposals here, and I look forward to the fact that we will be able to debate this very intensively in the Council as well. The Environment Council held an initial exchange of views on the report on 5 March this year, and I would also like to assure you once again that all Member States are determined to adopt the Commission's recommendations in the preparation of their next river basin management plans and their flood risk management plans. Please take us at our word, honourable Members. As far as further measures to combat chemical pollution are concerned, the recasting of the Drinking Water Directive establishes a system of watch lists for the monitoring of emerging substances. And you know that a lot of things have changed dramatically; We didn't have to talk about that 20 years ago. These are the so-called endocrine disruptors, i.e. hormone load. It is a question of the burden of medicines. Or microplastics are a big issue, not only for rivers and lakes, but especially for the seas. And we are also called upon to find quick answers to these completely new tests, to the new burdens. The Council also looks forward to the publication of the Commission's proposals for updating the lists of chemical pollutants affecting surface waters and groundwater. We are also looking forward to an intensive exchange. Finally, once again, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is seriously committed to a sustainable water management policy that takes account of our common environmental objectives and contributes to the objective of a pollutant-free environment set out in the European Green Agreement. And we must live up to this responsibility together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Janusz WOJCIECHOWSKI", "mepid": "23784", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission very much appreciates the European Parliament’s support and interest in water policies. Let me thank you for your work on this file and for the strong support for the important resolution which you will adopt following today’s debate. The European Union has every reason to be proud of its water acquis. It has halted water deterioration, brought unprecedented governance to transboundary water management and laid the foundations to deliver on the human right to water.  Nevertheless, four major crises threaten our waters: the climate crisis, the biodiversity crisis, the pollution crisis, the resources crisis, and, on top of that, we now have the COVID crisis as well. Business as usual is not an option. I can assure this House of the Commission’s commitment to supporting Member States in their efforts to step up implementation of the water directives. When we received their legislation in a comprehensive fitness check, we found it broadly fit for purpose with some room for improvement.  At this stage, we see no need to revise the Water Framework Directive beyond updating the lists of surface and groundwater pollutants to align them with science. The year 2027 is the final deadline to achieve good status for surface and groundwaters. The next river basin management plans, covering the 2021—2027 period, will be critical in this respect.  The Commission is working closely with the Member States through the common implementation strategy, peer—to—peer assistance, the LIFE programme and various research projects. You ask for effective compliance. As the guardian of the Treaties, the Commission will continue to act with determination to enforce the directives. We have announced a set of EU pilots based on the country—specific gaps identified in the fitness check and in the second river basin management plans, and we will not hesitate to use the infringement procedure, should this prove necessary. Under the Green Deal, we have presented a revision of the Aarhus mechanism to improve access to justice. We need enforcement to work better at national level too. Policy coherence is key. We cannot fight pollution with one hand and do harm with the other.  This brings me to the importance of the Green Deal and the integrated and coordinated solutions it offers for crises that are complex and interlinked. Water is a recurring theme in the Green Deal initiatives. The circular economy action plan features water efficiency and reuse. The biodiversity strategy includes the restoration of rivers and wetlands. The farm to fork strategy covers nutrients, pesticides and eco—schemes, and forthcoming initiatives like the climate adaptation strategy and the zero pollution action plan reserve a special place for water. I’d like, therefore, to ask the honourable Members to make sure that this coordinated approach is maintained here in Parliament as well when processing the different elements of the Green Deal.  You have repeatedly called for more harmonised criteria on pollution thresholds, more action on pollutants of emerging concern and better information. We therefore very much welcome the formal adoption of the recast of the Drinking Water Directive this week. This revamped piece of EU water law on which we managed to find an agreement in trilogues almost exactly one year ago was a precursor of the European Green Deal. Now it is making a concrete contribution to climate change, the circular economy, zero pollution for a toxic—free environment, and thus to biodiversity as well.  Next year, the Commission will present the zero pollution action plan, the first integrated EU framework to holistically tackle and inform policymakers and the general public on pollution of air, water and soil.  We are already at work on many of its components. We are updating the legislation on environmental quality standards for both surface and groundwaters and revising both the Industrial Emissions Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive in continuous coordination with the scientific community and stakeholders. Our aim is to become collectively better equipped in tackling pollution at source and its key pathways. In doing so, we will factor in the lessons learned from the COVID—19 crisis to make better use of water surveillance with a view to becoming better prepared and more resilient. To finish, a word on financing. Member States’ efforts to draft the third river basin management plans coincide with the imminent adoption of the reinforced multiannual financial framework and the Next Generation EU instrument. The OECD estimates the European Union’s needs for water supply and sanitation at around EUR 289 billion for the next 10 years. We have to become fairer and better apply the laws so that the burden to pay is put on all water users and those who pollute it at its source. To conclude, it will be important to be generous with our rivers. If we restore them to health, they are sure to return the favour.

Madam President! All the water found on the planet is only 2.5% drinking water, of which only 0.007 percent can be drunk. The rest needs to be cleaned thoroughly, and even better than is done in many places today. Even in the European Union, where some countries must stop pouring water out of their ears when they try to explain why they have not yet implemented the laws and regulations to ensure clean water for Europeans. Many of my colleagues will say that. Because it has to be said that it is insanely important, but there is also other things. Namely, the contribution of water to CO2 reduction through energy efficiency improvements in the water sector. These are actually pretty crazy numbers. Listen, the EU water sector seizes two to three percent of our total electricity consumption. It may not say much, but it is. In fact, it equates to as much power as an electric car needs to travel in a straight line 38 million times around the globe or make two million return journeys to the Moon. You see it for you. The potential of energy efficiency improvements in the water sector is, a blow to the bag, 25 percent. That's the equivalent of saving 9.5 million trips around the world for that little electric car. Or just under 20 million tonnes of CO2. Energy efficiency in the electricity consumption of the water sector is not a drop in the ocean.

Still 1 million people in Europe have no access to water and 8 million have no sanitation today. This is cause for grave concern and must be a wake-up call for all decision-makers across Europe. We as politicians have a responsibility to ensure that all people in Europe have access to safe and healthy water to drink, and we must also make sure that the EU’s water legislation contains sufficient environmental standards. Later today, we will finally adopt the final agreement on the Drinking Water Directive after many years of revision. It is a welcome modernisation of this important legislation. We are improving access to water for all, in particular for vulnerable groups in our society, and the new rules also mean that we will use better parameters for assessing the quality of drinking water, with tougher thresholds for a number of chemicals as well as the watch-list for pollutants such as microplastics and pharmaceuticals. We are ensuring that tap water across Europe is safe to drink and taking a welcome step towards realising the human right to water in Europe. EU water legislation needs to be foolproof and protect the health of people and the environment. The Water Framework Directive is especially important in this regard and I welcome the fact that we will vote on this resolution later this week. It is very worrying that Member States are not adhering to the framework directive and are not implementing the rules the way they should. Unless there is a big improvement here, the Union will not reach its the objectives under the framework directive by the deadline of 2027. Half of the water bodies in EU have still not attained good status, and good chemical status has been achieved only for about a third of the surface waters. The solution to this is not to dilute the directive, of course. Europe should not lower its environmental ambitions, especially in the light of the Green Deal and the important role that clean water bodies with healthy ecosystems play for nature, our society and the climate.

Unfortunately, since the conclusion of the trialogues due to the Corona crisis, it has taken us longer to adopt the new Drinking Water Directive.  In fact, there is a lot of good to be said about them. The Commission's proposal came in response to the first successful citizens' initiative. The directive is therefore a hobby of European citizen participation. In future, the directive will not only improve consumer information. The updating of health-related limit values, the creation of an observation list for emerging pollutants, the ambitious rules for old lead pipes and harmonised regulation of drinking water contact materials will also improve consumer health protection. All this creates confidence in the high quality of drinking water in Europe.  With the implementation of the risk-based approach, we will be able to combat contamination at source in the future. Here, Parliament has been able to ensure that prevention must come before containment. This is a major step forward in the protection of our waters and our natural drinking water resources.

Water is a fundamental good for human life and its safety is an essential prerequisite for having the best of it.

If this Parliament shows that it is open to everyone's contribution, it not only makes a qualitative leap forward, but finally understands that opposition, with their ideas, also plays a fundamental role in democratic dialectics.  Let us go into it specifically: the checklist of endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals and microplastics, as provided for in the directive, is a fundamental step forward and a valuable tool. Today, unfortunately, in many Italian and European areas, drinking water is subject to a huge series of pollutants, and one case in all, the Veneto region where PFAS contamination has been one of the most serious health and environmental emergencies ever faced for years. Furthermore, reaching a compromise on a significant list of pollutants is a regulatory intervention, where, in fact, in some cases there were no rules.

The new EU Drinking Water Directive will bring crucial improvements for clean, healthy and also better drinking water. First of all, we owe it to the citizens who have signed the European citizens' initiative 'Right to water' 1.8 million times. And it was this citizens' initiative that carried us all to the hunt. That is why the European Commission has presented a new Drinking Water Directive. That is why the European Parliament has strengthened the proposals. That is why the Council of Member States ultimately approved at least part of the proposals. It is simply a correct and important sign that hormone-altering substances will be controlled and limited in the future, and that bisphenol A, which is also suspected of causing serious damage to children in particular, is now getting a European limit value. Likewise, that drug residues are regulated and microplastics. That we are now on an easier path to identify new hazardous substances via an observation list and to regulate them throughout Europe. In doing so, we have succeeded in continuing a success story, because the old EU Drinking Water Directive has already strengthened confidence in drinking water as a good food stuff throughout Europe. But now we are going a step further, because, on the initiative of the European Parliament, public drinking water dispensers are now being set up throughout Europe. And with that, instead of buying plastic bottles somewhere and having to buy water in the way that polluting packaging first, people can fill up their own bottles, and some harmful effervescence with a lot of added sugar may also be avoided. Incidentally, the European Parliament has worked hard here – including Mrs Heidi Hautala, who is leading this – to ensure that thousands of plastic bottles have been abolished in Parliament itself and replaced with drinking water dispensers. That has been years of work in the Bureau of this Parliament, but now the time has come: in the European Parliament, once Corona is over again, you can see what we want everywhere on the streets. Finally, I have one more point: we have another element of European water law, the EU Water Framework Directive. In fact, since 2015, it should have been implemented that all water systems are in good natural condition.

In order to counter this trend, it is first necessary to implement policies at European level in order to increase their efficient use, while ensuring access for all to drinking water. The drinking water directive, which we are finally adopting today thanks also to the action taken by European citizens, has this dual objective: awareness-raising campaigns, the fight against water waste on national territories, the installation of taps or water fountains in public spaces are among the main measures that, thanks to the work of the European Parliament, we have managed to include in this directive. It is an important step forward but, as highlighted in the Green Deal, we need to go further, to put in place a global strategy that aims not only at the efficient use of water resources, but also at the objective of water quality and therefore zero pollution for water, but also for air and soil.  Attention to water resources, which is a source of life, is crucial. On the one hand, we must achieve the good ecological status of European river basins and the full implementation of the Water Framework Directive in order to preserve and restore biodiversity in lakes, rivers, wetlands and estuaries and prevent and limit flood damage, on the other hand, the new measures will have to address the negative effects of urban run-off and new or particularly harmful sources of pollution. , such as microplastics and pharmaceutical residues.

I think it’s thanks to Parliament that we strengthened those provisions.  I think it’s also a good deal if you look at the improvements on, for example, endocrine disrupters, microplastics, and how we are, for the first time, dealing with a group approach on PFAs, so I think that is a good solution, but we also have to discuss the fitness check of the Water Framework Directive.

Rapid population growth, combined with climate change, leads to local water conflicts that can easily turn into regional wars in the future. The battle for the Euphrates between Turkey, Syria and Iraq, or the Nile between Sudan and Egypt are just examples of the regions closest to the European Union.  However, the problem of water resources affects not only Arab states or Africa, it is also our problem, the problem of the European Union. I am therefore pleased that the answer is this directive. My country is also struggling with a shortage of clean drinking water, droughts and supply shortages, and this costs us around PLN 2 billion. Today's debate on the revision of the Directive is therefore important, but with the new law there should be additional funding for infrastructure projects related to water and saving.

There should be public water fountains, of course with free water. But we all know it's not enough. The right to water must be strengthened in other ways as well, and in that respect we must continue to work together. Water must also be better protected. In this area, we are making some progress. If water contains too many hazardous chemicals, microplastics and other things that have been raised in this debate, it is clear that it ultimately also affects our entire habitat. The water affects us, both directly and indirectly, and in every chain. We have heard here ourselves how we actually need to reform agriculture in order to make it more effective for the protection of water.  The EU Framework Directive is an important step in protecting water. It is therefore important that it is not opened up for audit.

In future, the directive now stipulates that all people in the European Union must have access to clean drinking water. And this is above all a success of the citizens' initiative – so thank you for that! At this point, I would like to express my disappointment to the Council that the concern to provide access to drinking water was not taken seriously at first, but was only taken into account in terms of quality criteria. I think that was a disregard for the Right2Water initiative. But it is not just about quality, it is also about access, because water is a human right. That is why I am pleased that, within the framework of the directive, we have now succeeded in improving access. We are getting public drinking fountains throughout Europe and the Member States are obliged to take all necessary measures to give disadvantaged groups better access to water.

But with the amendment, we are also ensuring that drinking water is safe in Europe and, above all, remains safe. We place even higher demands on quality. European drinking water now complies with all WHO standards, and in the case of lead we halve the value – that is absolutely important and right. It is also important that we look in particular at microplastics and drug residues in drinking water – absolute caution is required here.

Water is an essential asset for citizens and it is not acceptable that more than half of the European Union's bodies of water are still in poor condition and that the targets have not yet been achieved, mainly due to inadequate funding and particularly slow implementation. Firstly, further action is needed in the field of chemicals and pollutants, in order to improve the quality of water bodies and to reduce risks to human, animal and environmental health. Effective action must be taken against pollutants and there is growing concern about PFAS, microplastics and endocrine disrupters and pharmaceuticals, among other things, from control measures at source. Greater attention should also be paid to the risk of releasing nutrients, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics and other pollutants used in agriculture in drainage basins and rivers.

We must be intransigent and demand, for example, the \"polluter pays\" principle. Water management is actually a problem with the climate challenge. So we need to tackle climate change head-on.

The Green Pact, the Biodiversity Strategy, the 'Farm to the Range' strategy, which aim for 50% reduction in pesticides, 20% reduction in synthetic fertilisers, 25% of organically grown agricultural land by 2030, should help us to better quality management of the water resource. Agriculture, which mobilizes more than 50% of the freshwater resource, is both a victim of climate change, guilty of climate change, but also a solution to climate change, if accompanied in new directions. Public policies, rather than working hard to address the consequences of agricultural practices culpable by the degradation of water bodies both qualitatively and quantitatively, must, in line with the Green Pact, with contemporary challenges, prefer to address the causes, the roots of the problem by accompanying the transition to agriculture that respects water resources, with a goal of zero pollution.

I wanted to assure you that not only the official text of the resolution, but also all the voices, comments and suggestions made during this debate, the Commission will undergo a thorough analysis in the course of its further work. This will be done above all by my colleague Commissioner Sinkevičius, who is directly responsible for water management and who, today, because of the need to attend the Council meeting, could not be present at the debate.  I would like to declare that the Commission is making and will make every effort to properly implement the directive that was mentioned today. A number of infringement proceedings are pending and further proceedings will be initiated if necessary. The list of derogations will also be maintained and updated.  I would like to express my satisfaction and thank the High House once again for being able to participate in this debate as Commissioner responsible for agriculture, because many of the voices were on agriculture. I confirm that proper water management in agriculture is of paramount importance and that improving the situation in agriculture is an important part of the whole package of measures aimed at improving water management. I would like to assure you that we are making every effort, in particular, to reform the common agricultural policy, its green architecture, the field-to-table strategy, the protection of biodiversity, but also the structural dialogue that we are already conducting with the Member States in relation to the recommendations in their strategic plans, to include the issue of improving water management and water protection.  This debate and your voices encourage us, and i personally, all the more so to pay even more attention to these issues. I declare that this will happen.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Thank you very much for this debate, because it has also expressed the fact that the institutions of the European Union are pulling together, sometimes at different speeds and with different passions. We owe this to the citizens, also in the knowledge – as has become clear in all the speeches – that water, clean water, is a human right and that it must also be accessible to all people. Of course, as a representative of the Council, I must also stress once again that responsibility for water, for clean water, is a central national competence, and certainly also a regional competence in some Member States. But one thing is also clear: rivers, lakes do not stop at national borders. That is why the European Union's commitment, including in order to provide a secure framework, is of paramount importance, and MePs can always rely on cooperation and constructive cooperation with the Council. A few questions have been asked – and certainly also critical – in the direction of the Council. One of the big questions was: why has all this not been implemented in this way? And why did we rip up the schedules? Firstly, I am also grateful to the Commission, which, as guardian of the Treaties, must always ensure that what we, as the European Union, have jointly decided on, is then implemented in the Member States accordingly. I also have the impression that the Commission is fulfilling its responsibilities here. But why is it so difficult? It is, of course, also so difficult because we are dealing in part with huge investments, and the question of financing has also been raised. And I would like to highlight the outstanding importance of the municipalities. I myself was a local politician for twelve years. We have invested millions in a very small town in the middle of Germany to make the water cleaner through sewage treatment plants. Even then, there were very, very strict requirements from the European Union. There has been a constant debate at the local level about this: why is the directive supposedly being implemented more strictly in Germany than in other countries? And the Commission, and not least the ECJ, naturally play a central role here. But community engagement is very, very outstanding. And how can this be better financed? Of course, we also need a dialogue, also on the ground, about new sources of funding – public, but certainly also private, when it comes to the responsibility of the economy. However, I would also like to emphasise once again that we have successful funds at European level, in particular the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, but also the Cohesion Fund, which supports the Member States, but also the regions and local leaders, in ensuring that we are better able to meet the common objective. Finally, I would like to make a second point, because I also have the impression that we are pulling together. It is that we make the objective of ensuring clean water everywhere a task of all policy areas. I have already explained in my opening statement that 33 per cent of water consumption has something to do with agriculture, as the Commissioner has just emphasised. We also know that there are two important instruments, particularly through cross-compliance, but also through rural funding, that will help us achieve sustainable growth in agriculture. And when we talk about sustainability, clean water and access to water naturally play a very central role. And it is precisely during our Presidency that we have once again emphasised – also through initiatives – that it is necessary to reduce the environmental and climatic footprint of the current agricultural system, including the food system, in the European Union, because we are aware of the limits of stress, and we are aware of shared responsibility, especially for clean water. Thank you for this debate, and thank you for the opportunity to take part in this. And I hope that, in the coming years, we will perhaps be able to live up to our common goal even more quickly and more decisively, because that is also the responsibility we have towards our citizens in all the Member States of the European Union. European Union. And above all, as a encourager at the global level – as some Members have also impressively pointed out – we too must show – as a region of prosperity, social stability and economic success with a strong industrial sector and still strong agriculture – that clean water and access to clean water are an essential element of prosperity and security. , not only in Europe, but throughout the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 35, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  The debate is closed.

The emphasis on providing tap water and admoniating access to water for disadvantaged groups should be appreciated.

Ensuring access to safe drinking water is paramount, as is environmental concern.

I welcome the intensive efforts of the EU Member States to improve water status and meet the high requirements of EU water legislation.

Access to safe water is a fundamental human right and is also one of the United Nations development goals. It is unacceptable that not everyone in Europe has access to good quality water. The EU must therefore promote the supply of free, good quality water in public places, perhaps even in every area.

We will be voting on legislation that will use about a third of EU funds in the next two years. We are also mobilising EUR 8 billion in recovery money, because the coronavirus is chastising the food chain right now and not next year. The outcome of the negotiations shows that Europeans value local food, security of supply and safe and high-quality food. I am proud that, in exceptional circumstances, we will be able to find a common solution in the content of the legislation, within the timeframe. We will continue for the next two years with the current rules of agricultural policy and ensure the continuity of national subsidies that are important to farmers. At the same time, we will ensure that more is done on climate and environmental issues. We are also responding to the shock caused by the coronavirus by facilitating state aid rules and the use of agricultural risk management mechanisms. The most important thing is that farmers will be assured of what is to come for the next two years, and the transitional period proposed by the Commission, which has proved to be too short for one year, will not take place. This will continue rural development programmes and ensure continuity for farmers. Now farmers and administration will have sufficient time to prepare and prepare for the changes brought about by the new programming period starting in 2023. The reform of the common agricultural policy will then enter into force, which will significantly revolutionise the rules and structures of the aid policy. I think it is important that the finalisation of the reform be carried out carefully, and now, within this transitional period, there is enough time for it. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the negotiators from all the groups for their excellent cooperation in this challenging work, where there have also been challenges along the year-long journey. Cooperation has been really smooth with everyone, and without a good team spirit we would not have achieved such a good result. I would also like to thank the recovery negotiator, Paolo De Castro, and his team for getting the recovery money linked to this legislation. Thanks are also due to the Croatian and German Council for its constructive cooperation and flexibility. I would also like to thank the Commission for its help in mediating the negotiations.

I’m happy to see that we are now reaching the finishing line. Thank you very much to the rapporteur, Ms Katainen, to the shadow rapporteurs; thank you to the Council, to the German Presidency, for the very constructive dialogue and cooperation. The position which is about to be adopted today is key for providing certainty to farmers and other common agricultural policy beneficiaries in the years 2021 and 2022. I’m delighted to see that despite the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were all able to combine two processes – the transitional rules and the integration of the additional allocations proposed under the European Union Recovery Instrument – into the rural development programmes. Today this plenary will vote on the merged outcome. It is a great achievement that the combination of two procedures did not hamper the quick adoption of the transitional regulation. The transitional regulation will include key elements that were brought forward by the European Parliament, such as the continuation of phasing out payments for areas with natural constraints which no longer qualify as such following the new elimination under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013; the possibility for Member States to support more easily risk management measures; increasing technical assistance funding for certain smaller Member States in order to prepare for the new common agricultural policy and the continuation of the transitional national aid and the Finnish national aid. I’ve also pledged that the EU Recovery Instrument Funds to be distributed under the rural development programmes will mostly be used for measures that ensure a recovery beneficial for the environment and climate and to help our farming and rural communities to be more resilient and recover from the effects of the pandemic. Moreover, I am glad that all institutions managed to arrive at a satisfactory outcome on the funding of the support programmes for the outermost regions and the smaller Aegean islands. The text presented for the vote is a balanced text that will allow farmers and citizens and businesses in rural areas to continue in 2021 and 2022 to benefit from income support, from tools for market stability and from support for investments, cooperation measures beneficial to the environment, as well as from the other structural measures.

In this regulation which we are voting on today, it is fair to point out that important measures have been achieved, for example those relating to the wine sector and the olive oil sector. But we must also say that others have been able to reach. I am referring in particular to internal convergence and external convergence which, although interrupted during the transition, I believe are elementary justice for European farmers. I would also like to highlight the agreement on the Recovery Fund introduced in this regulation. This more investment-oriented support that enhances the resilience of the sector is crucial if it is to be more robust and better prepared for the ecological transition that will be required of it.  And with regard to POSEI, the agreement reached was, after all, positive.  I am sure to say that I expected more solidarity from the Council and the Commission with these fellow European citizens who, in the outermost regions of our Union, suffer extraordinary constraints. It is an issue for which I ask for the utmost commitment during the negotiations on the cap reform and which I will of course continue to follow up on. In conclusion, we are pleased to have ensured that this regulation has not become an anticipation of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, but a continuity system with the necessary adjustments.

Not only legal certainty and the possibility of better planning one's business choices thanks to the two-year extension of the current agricultural policy, but also, and above all, an unprecedented injection of liquidity to deal with the devastating consequences of the pandemic. Thanks to the European Recovery Instrument, we are ready to release over EUR 8 billion for rural development as early as January 2021. A support package that must be made available as soon as possible by the Member States, so that it can really pave the way for economic recovery in the name of resilience, sustainability and digitalisation, and in line with the objectives outlined in the Green Deal. And it is thanks to the ambitious position supported by all the groups in the Committee on Agriculture in this Parliament that we have managed to prevent these funds from funding business as usual. For this reason, at least 55 % of the more than 8 billion will be allocated to young people, to small farmers, and above all to investments that promote the social and economic development of rural areas, pursuing essential objectives for an increasingly sustainable agriculture, such as the digitisation and modernisation of productive instruments, better safety conditions at work, short supply chains, renewable energies and the circular economy. However, in order for the recovery of the sector to effectively balance environmental, social and economic sustainability, at least 37 % of the funds will be allocated to measures with high environmental added value, such as organic farming, the reduction of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, soil conservation, improved water management and animal welfare. Once again, the European Parliament has shown itself to be the driving force behind the legislative process, so let me thank the entire negotiating team, the shadow rapporteurs who have worked in recent weeks to reach an agreement on Next Generation EU for rural development.

This regulation has the immense merit in my view to extend for two years the aid that farmers are entitled to rely on. I am delighted, along with my colleague Maxette Pirbakas, that the interests of our overseas farmers have been preserved. This two-year transitional period will also allow - second merit - to give States sufficient time to develop their national strategic plans, which I think is the most interesting innovation of the new CAP. I am more circumspect about the agricultural part of the stimulus package. I agree with many of its objectives, particularly those of promoting short circuits, financing the modernization of agricultural machinery and helping young farmers settle down. But I do not understand why at least 37% of the money should be earmarked for environmental actions. We should not have lost sight of the fact that the objective of the stimulus package was to promote economic recovery and not to ensure the protection of the environment, which is already the subject of the Green Pact.

I sincerely believe that we have done a great job for the end result.  The political agreement reached after the trilogos provides European farmers and ranchers, during 2021 and 2022, with guarantees of implementation of the current CAP rules, and will therefore continue to receive the direct aid from the first pillar and will continue the rural development programmes of the second pillar, which are very important elements for the legal certainty of these aids.  There are a number of essential elements that we have pushed from the European Parliament to deal with this transitional period. And I sincerely believe that we have made improvements from Parliament.  Firstly, from the outing point of time, from Parliament, we understood that the time required for this transitoryness was two years — and not one, as the Commission said, to be able to close the reform debate and properly carry out the development of the new strategic plans, giving legal certainty to this compromise.  Secondly, we condition our final support on the adoption of the new Multiannual Financial Framework. That's why we're in the latter house. Because we did not want to approve the Transitional Regulation without the multiannual financial framework being approved and we did not want to accept, first of all, the proposal for measures in the Commission's budget.  New proposals have also been incorporated into this Regulation throughout the process, as a legal instrument: COVID measures to address the situation created by the pandemic, the extension of rural development aid, measures on wine planting rights, which OPFH can continue with their operational programmes without changing them if they are not necessary , or the funding part of the Next Generation programme for rural development, to which my colleague Paolo De Castro referred, to which I congratulate him.

At the same time, the Regulation provides farmers with the necessary funding to deal with the current pandemic problems, thereby preserving their ability to produce quality and affordable food for consumers. An important aspect is to ensure flexibility between the two pillars, which allows Member States to transfer funds for direct payments with those for rural development.  Although the Commission did not initially include the continuation of transitional national aid in its proposal, we were able to add this form of support to the Regulation. There are eight Member States using this aid mechanism to help ensure the sustainability of farmers.  I note that SUPPORT through the ANT is provided by the Member States concerned and does not create additional burdens for the European Union budget. Moreover, it is a form of complementary aid, which does not have the capacity to distort the single market.

When The Commission started president von der Leyen's commission more than a year ago, when I, as a candidate for commissioner, was standing before the High Chamber, we had one great uncertainty: It was not clear what to do with the multiannual financial framework, what about the budget for the common agricultural policy – which was, after all, presented in a heavily stripped-down version – we did not know what to do next with the reform of the common agricultural policy. , we did not know what about the transition period. And all this has been affected by the crisis, which has affected the entire EU economy and affected agriculture.  In this crisis, our farmers have provided us with food security, for which we must continue to thank them. It is a great, great achievement that food supplies have not been interrupted. Farmers have provided us with food security. We, as politicians, as political and legislative institutions of the European Union, must ensure economic security for our farmers – and we are a few steps further down this path. And I would like to thank you very warmly, because what we are finalising today – the transitional regulation – is part of a broader package of actions that we are taking together. The fact that today we can provide our farmers with precisely this clarity about the transition period is the result of very good cooperation with the Committee on Agriculture. I wanted to thank you. I thanked rapporteur Katainen, but I thank you for the coordinators I have met many times in our joint work: Mr Dorfmann, Mr De Castro, Mrs Müller, Mr Häusling, Mr David, Mr Kuźmiukov, Mr Flanagan. Such constant and constructive cooperation has contributed to this.  Today we have a much better budget, EUR 22 billion more than was planned two years ago. Today we are already clear about the future Multiannual Financial Framework. Today we know that there is a recovery plan, some of which has already been transferred to the Rural Development Fund. But I firmly believe that there will also be an approach, there will be greater synergy between politicians. And rural areas are not only expenditure from the common agricultural policy, but also increased expenditure from the reconstruction fund for various activities around agriculture, for the reconstruction of agricultural processing, for example, but also the Cohesion Fund, which should also be more dedicated to rural areas. We are a few steps ahead in all of these matters and I wanted to thank you again for that.  We are providing our farmers with much more certainty about their future, and I firmly believe that what is in the process at the moment, that is, the trilogue procedure and the final shape of the reform of the common agricultural policy, is a process that is on track. Once again, I thank the European Parliament for this very constructive cooperation in all these areas and for the fact that we can today, after this first year of the Commission's work, give our farmers more such good hope for the future at this very difficult time. Thank you for the kind words spoken in this debate to the Commission, Mrs von der Leyen, including my personal one.

I wish we were not having this debate, because this would mean that we would not be living the nightmare we suffered because of COVID. What we are experiencing is a real humanitarian tragedy in the form of viruses that has already killed more than 476,000 Europeans; a pandemic that has resulted in the deaths of more than one and a half million human beings worldwide, as well as the contagion of more than 72 million people.  And, therefore, I would like to begin my speech by expressing my deepest condolences for the deceased, sending my most loving greeting to all family and friends and wishing for a prompt recovery for all the infected. I would also like to acknowledge the immense work of so many people who over the past few months have been and are on the front line of the fight against the pandemic: thank them all, thank you wholeheartedly for their immense dedication, sacrifice and professionalism. And precisely because of the immense work and talent of scientists and the investment of multinational pharmaceutical companies, supported by public institutions, today we can say that there is hope because we already have a vaccine.  Soon we will leave behind this terrible pandemic, but what follows is almost as tragic. Without a doubt, we are facing the greatest challenge we have faced since World War II. To the humanitarian and health tragedy are added the terrible social and economic consequences that we are already beginning to suffer: sinking of our gross domestic product, increase in debt and deficit, closure of business, destruction of employment, fall in consumption, uncertainty, since this nightmare is not yet over, but we remain immersed in it; macroeconomic data that already translates into the social needs and urgencies of many of our compatriots and their families.  In the face of all this tragedy, we must be proud of the European Union's reaction. I believe that the European Union and its institutions have risen to the challenge and have been able to provide a quick, effective, forceful and unanimous response since March and April, in which rapid initiatives were responded to to speed up Member States' access to the funds they needed to meet the needs of masks and health expenditure.  In this context, the Next Generation EU programme was born, an unprecedented economic recovery plan – we are talking about EUR 750 billion – and within this programme, next generation EU, is where we find the REACT-EU programme, which we are discussing today, a programme of EUR 47.5 billion.  Just as it was necessary to remember why this plan arises, it is just as essential to highlight for what. Public money recovery and injection plans are not good news in itself. Let us not forget that public money does not fall from heaven, comes out of debt, that we or future generations will have to pay, or it comes out of taxes, which we will undoubtedly have to pay. They are plans that must always be born in exceptional situations such as this one that we live in and with a series of concrete, measurable and evaluated objectives.  And, in my opinion, the plan we are presenting today is a very good agreement. We have reached a good agreement, as I said, that clearly identifies the investment areas, the objectives to be achieved, the sectors to be financed and the conditions to be met. Without a doubt, a good roadmap to achieve the real recovery of our economy.  What is REACT-EU? Grants and loans to small and medium-sized enterprises in crisis to support those who are to be the real protagonists of the recovery: the self-employed and entrepreneurs; employers, the only ones capable of creating jobs, that much-needed job; small businesses that create community, which maintain much of the employment, often sustained, at the moment, by family support.  The State will not be the one to revive the economy or to create jobs. The state has the opportunity to be able to help those who can do so, entrepreneurs. That is why we do not have to make the mistake of repeating the caduco interventionism of past times and, therefore, it is good that react-EU has approved aid to entrepreneurs and self-employed people.  In addition, this programme includes a clear commitment to something fundamental: training, digitisation, energy transition and support for our much-punished health systems, all of which are pillars of a recovery not only in the short term, but a recovery understood as building a european path of economic and social future.  This good agreement also includes much-needed retroactivity—as of February 1, 2020—so that Member States can use funding from the moment they began the pandemic. Having one more year to invest thanks to increased investment eligibility until the end of 2023 will enable the rationality of investment. There's no rush to spend the money. First, because we have not seen the end of the crisis and we still have to see many companies fall sadly and restructure. Therefore, we have to keep in mind that we are looking at the medium term. There is no rush to spend the money; you have to spend it well. And secondly, because it will be meditated and go where it can have a lever effect, one of the characteristics of cohesion financing.  The agility of the European Commission's two-week investment approval is very good news. We do not need the money to be in Brussels, but to be on the ground, in the regions, in the municipalities, where it is needed. We recognize, for this reason, the efforts of the institutions to shorten approval periods throughout the process.  Implementation will be carried out through the rules and structures of the existing cohesion policy; there will be no additional bureaucracy. And one hundred percent of the funds will be European funds; there will be no national funds.  In short, I would like to thank all the political groups of the Committee on Regional Development for the immense work they have done, for the effort we have made to get REACT-EU approved. It is a very good agreement for citizens, it is a good agreement for entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs and will undoubtedly help create jobs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 83, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Pedro MARQUES", "mepid": "197634", "text": "  deputising for the rapporteur. – Madam President, in the name of Constanze Krehl, our rapporteur from the S&amp;D Group, I address this plenary saying that 2020 was a year of drama and dramatic changes in Europe. We’ve suffered the drama of losing hundreds of thousands of Europeans. We mourn their loss and we extend our solidarity to their families.  But there were dramatic changes in the way we relate to each other, the way we work, the way we do business – all of this had to change this year. And a lot has also changed in politics and policy. Many of those who opposed further European integration started clamouring for more European common policies. Many of those who did not like cohesion policy started asking for the reinforcement of cohesion policy.  Fortunately, the European institutions were able to understand what was needed and what was expected from us. After some initial hesitation by some institutions, we put in place an extensive series of measures which protected the health of citizens, sustained the economies as much as possible, and protected employment and citizens’ wellbeing.  Within the multiple policy measures that were put in place to cope with the crisis it is important to underline that the first effective consequences on the ground were in cohesion policy. The Corona response investment initiatives, best known as CRII and CRII+ (Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus), were launched in April and had immediate effects, frontloading EUR 37 billion of unallocated resources within the current MFF. The flexibility that CRII and CRII+ brought to the European funds allowed for essential investments at the initial stage of the pandemic, such as on medical equipment, including ventilators and personal protective equipment, the support to SMEs, to job maintenance and to the vulnerable groups.  Cohesion policy was at the forefront of the response to the crisis and once again it delivered. And let me stress this: one of the key characteristics of cohesion policy is that it indeed delivers. It delivers concrete results and European citizens deserve and are eager for those results. That is why the MMF agreement was also so important, and that is why the blackmail by two Member States was totally unacceptable, and in the end it didn’t pay. We overcame that blackmail and Europe can now go forward on a path where we can see hope, where we can see the vaccine is coming, the beginning of an end to the pandemic, the economic recovery, the creation of jobs, and finally a better Europe, a greener and fairer Europe.  The new MFF and the new cohesion policy are crucial for the recovery, but REACT-EU is the first instrument that is now ready, bridging the gap between the first emergency crisis response and the long-term recovery package. For every act the EU approved in time the negotiation teams worked hard and fast to reach an agreement, and as a result we can already vote now on REACT-EU.  With this initiative the European Union is offering a strong reaction to the consequences of COVID, which is what people in regions are expecting from us. But the negotiation teams have also worked well and we should support strongly the content of the agreement, an agreement where important Parliament demands were incorporated, bringing more flexibility and more fairness to REACT-EU.  The EUR 47.5 billion from the REACT-EU programme will allow for investment in the areas where Member States have higher needs, be it on health, on SMEs, on supporting the most deprived, the self-employed or the freelancers. Parliament managed to secure a higher pre-financing and guaranteed that the Commission quickly checks and approves the programmes so that the money can reach the real economy as fast as possible.  Parliament has also insisted on having projects funded retroactively from 1 February onwards, enabling regions all over Europe to fund their reactions to COVID which they started in spring or summer. It was also important for Parliament to have a stronger focus on border regions, which was made through a link with the Interreg programme, because border regions and their populations were particularly affected when the borders were temporarily closed.  Finally, I want to underline the importance of the strong ties Parliament was able to introduce with the European Social Fund, the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived and the Youth Employment Initiative, strengthening the social dimension of REACT—EU, a fight in which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) and the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) were side by side.  The social impact of the crisis must be a priority and the European Union has to do everything to make sure the response to the crisis leaves no one behind. The European Union is a political project aiming at economic and social convergence. We must always keep this in mind or European citizens will be alienated from the future of the Union. Initiatives like REACT-EU, policies like cohesion policy that deliver concrete results, that touch, protect and improve people’s lives, are the ones that do the most to strengthen the sense of belief in the future of the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 84, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Agnes JONGERIUS", "mepid": "125021", "text": "  Rapporteur for opinion EMPL. Mr President, we must be honest about the crisis, and that is not easy. The measures that are needed are not fun. They leave no room for carelessness. They hurt. So we have to take the hits together. As good and as evil as it goes, we must prepare for the effects of the crisis. The React-EU emergency fund has been working at a breakneck pace in recent times. Now that this nasty virus is stagnating, this fund has been kicked out of the ground in order to alleviate the greatest need as quickly as possible. From this place, I would like to congratulate my colleagues Constanze Krehl and Andrey Novakov and Commissioner Ferreira for the hard work of getting this done here. React-EU creates the space to invest in sustainable employment, in new jobs. We're going to need it very much later.  In addition, it will be possible to finance a temporary part-time WW and so we can also keep jobs. Personally, I am proud that this does not come at the expense of the social potty. Fortunately, this remains at the same level, because we know that poverty will increase all over Europe. I also see it in my own Netherlands where the queues for the food banks are currently growing. We must therefore maintain the fight against poverty. We must not allow poverty reduction to become the child of this crisis.  For the whole of Europe, €47.5 billion is now in place to keep people working or to work. For the Netherlands, that's about 440 million, which is on the shelf. So I call on the aldermen from Dronten, from Lochem, from Utrecht or elsewhere in the whole country to call for action in The Hague, because the money is available, the needs are there.

REACT-EU, which stands for Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe, is an important milestone in this process, and I am thankful to the rapporteurs and Members, in particular of the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), for addressing the REACT-EU proposal with the same sense of urgency as its predecessor, the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative, CRII and CRII+. Every day, CRII and CRII+ deliver emergency support to workers, to hospitals, to small businesses across the Union, reaching EUR 18 billion by December. To continue this type of support in only a few months since the Commission’s proposal on REACT-EU in May, the College leaders reached a political agreement once again in record time. This was the first initiative agreed to be powered by the Next Generation EU, and it is in fact the first programme negotiation to be completed among the MFF Next Generation package of proposals. This is testimony to the added value unanimously confirmed by the REGI Committee on 3 December. Thanks to the proactive approach of the rapporteurs and our joint effort, our message to the European citizens is clear and strong. We are leaving no one behind. We are in this together. We will come out of this crisis together. Together we can achieve a resilient and strong repair of our economy and society. The vote today is an opportunity to unlock EUR 47.5 billion for crisis response and repair in Europe. This additional exceptional amount will support Member States and regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its social consequences. It will also serve to prepare the green and the digital transitions for a resilient economy and society in the longer term. REACT—EU builds on the flexibility of the CRII package while bridging funding in the first crucial years of the recovery towards long-term cohesion investments in digitalisation and sustainability. Which key features of cohesion crisis response were retained? Some of the previous interventions already underlined its support to the health sector, workers, small businesses and young people in particular: liquidity thanks to generous pre-financing, flexibility and the possibility of 100% EU financing. Eligibility of expenditure as of 1 February 2020 is retained, and the measures continue to be embedded in the current cohesion programmes for facility. What is new? First of all, the scope of the initiative, which now covers basic infrastructures for public services and enables the first steps of the repair in line with digital and green goals. Also cross border territories, as was mentioned before. Let me close by highlighting two core principles of REACT-EU. First, reflecting the importance of tackling climate change, REACT-EU is expected to contribute 25% of its resources to climate objectives, and in fact, the Commission regrets that we could not get this information or this requirement in the legal text as an article. That’s why the Commission will issue a statement in that regard upon adoption of the act. Second, I’d like to stress that the involvement of regional and local actors, economic and social partners, and civil society is essential for our policy, including REACT-EU.

In the midst of COVID's second wave, with heartbreaking numbers of the deceased and infected across Europe and still unpredictable economic consequences, today we approve the first fund of the recovery package: the REACT-EU fund, with EUR 47.5 billion for the countries that need it most.  And if we often talk about the inefficiency of the European Union, the rigidity of its procedures and how far away it is from citizens, today we show the opposite: that the European Union has acted fast and that it has certainly been up to date, and that this is an example of European solidarity.  Because this is not going to be a fund to use. It will have unprecedented flexibility, the usual restrictions will not be imposed and will have a co-financing rate of one hundred percent, so that it is regional and local authorities that decide what this money can be used for until 2023.  Thanks to REACT-EU, small entrepreneurs, hospitality, small shops will be able to receive liquidity to cope with the serious losses they have had since the pandemic began since February 2020. But health expenditures — beds, PPE, respirators — can also be financed and, of course, support can be provided to all the unemployed in need.  It is a breath of oxygen for the most affected sectors. In countries like mine, such as Spain, where forecasts indicate that one in ten companies is going to have to close, that GDP is going to collapse by 12% and that there will be one million more people at risk of poverty, citizens, who are having such a hard time, need good news. And this is good news.  Europe has now done its homework and we have to make sure that these funds are used correctly, that they reach citizens as soon as possible and that not a single euro is wasted.

The fact that we can vote on this dossier before the end of this year shows that the European Parliament, even under difficult working conditions, is able to work quickly on solutions for Europe's regions, for Europe's citizens, in order to provide targeted support for them in the crisis. With REACT-EU, we underline the important role of cohesion policy as a crisis instrument, but also the importance of the economic, social and, above all, territorial cohesion of the European Union.  REACT-EU is an important sign that we are not abandoning anyone, in a sign of solidarity with all regions and citizens. It is a flexible, temporary crisis instrument against the economic and social consequences of the pandemic and should be used by the Member States as flexibly and purposefully as possible, where the funds are most needed: up to 100% support from the EU– also retroactively.  It is important – and this is also the case in the negotiations – to set a concrete framework for efficient and high-quality funding, such as the emphasis on the social aspect of the crisis, the use of funds for youth unemployment and cross-border cooperation, or the establishment of a gender perspective and the strengthening of the partnership principle, that is, the involvement of regional and local administrations, the social partners and civil society. Of course, we Greens are also particularly concerned about strengthening climate protection and thus emphasising the so-called do no harm principle in climate protection, that is, the exclusion of climate-damaging investments in REACT-EU. As well as the time limit of the programme: REACT-EU is a short, targeted crisis assistance to The Member States, not a competition with the EU's regular cohesion policy with its high quality standards and strong sustainability objectives. A big downside from a green point of view, however, is the under-recommended target for climate spending of only 25% in this draft. I do not think that in 2020 we cannot talk about crisis management without taking into account the Green Deal against the climate crisis and enshering a stronger, more binding climate spending target. Overall, however, i would like to emphasise this, REACT-EU is an important instrument of European solidarity and in support of Europe's regions and citizens, in support of the Green Deal, digitisation in a socially just manner and gender-based development of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 91, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Andżelika Anna MOŻDŻANOWSKA", "mepid": "197541", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Today it is up to us whether we take the next step in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

Now, after a few months of work, we have react-eu ready. This is €47.5 billion in additional cohesion policy funding for our countries, regions, health services, businesses and, above all, the people of Europe. The slowdown in investment and the functioning of economies across the European Union has caused a huge economic and social crisis. REACT-EU is an urgent response to counteract this and return to development and economic growth.  REACT-EU is the first mechanism under the European Instrument for Reconstruction. That is why trilogue negotiations were so crucial, resulting in even better opportunities for its use, i.e. the eligibility period for expenditure extended until the end of 2023 and the level of investment advances increased to 11%. React-EU does not oblige, but gives the opportunity to make flexible decisions in each country in order to maximise the effect of reconstruction. All this to ensure that support reaches where it is most needed.

The goals for the recovery funds are to help swiftly and unbureaucratically and to overcome the economic crisis, while at the same time fostering European cooperation. In this regard, it was a good idea to use the framework of already existing programmes like the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which we know work well in the regions. REACT-EU follows the logic of swift, easy, productive and European. However the Recovery and Resilience Facility does not. It is shameful to see that the vast majority of the recovery money, EUR 670 billion, is being spent with little to no European agenda behind it. I also have to say: that REACT-EU has no obligation for the usage of Interreg is a pity. How the fact that in the first draft of REACT-EU, Interreg wasn’t even mentioned, is shameful and unworthy of a European Commission. After images of closed borders and failed European solidarity at the peak of this crisis, after months of isolation and for thousands of families, also months of loss and mourning, we need the European coronavirus aid to be used to bring Europeans back together. We need our funds to be spent in a European way, a way that increases European exchange, cooperation and solidarity, and that benefits our citizens. Here’s how to do it. Instead of transferring EUR 670 billion to the Member States, use them to top up these tools that foster European cohesion – top up the ERDF, the Cohesion Fund, the Just Transition Fund and the ESF, and then use the EUR 50 billion that are now planned for REACT-EU to top up the programmes that support European exchange, European culture and European education: to support Interreg, Erasmus and Creative Europe. This is the way we should spend our European money. To enable Europeans to study, work, celebrate life, live and laugh together, until once again this crazy pandemic is finally over. REACT-EU is not bad. It is one of the better programmes of the Next Generation EU funds, and probably the best that we can get from a Council like this, but for me as a member of the next generation of Europeans, one good programme is not enough.

Today we are looking at the REACT-EU programme, the first measure in the recovery plan package, which demonstrates that cohesion policy has been at the heart of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic from the outset. The REACT-EU action is a further step to support Member States in the recovery from the pandemic by providing additional resources to bridge the gap between the first, emergency crisis response and the long-term recovery of the economy and society as a whole, which awaits us in the next MFF.  REACT-EU ensures fair and cohesive action, much-needed flexibility for Member States to decide on the share of funds and retroactive effect, as countries will be able to justify the expenditure incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic since 1 February 2020, even if the measures have already been finalised and fully implemented.  I am convinced that, with a dedicated amount of EUR 47.5 billion, THE EU will continue and further expand emergency measures to respond to the crisis and to remedy the crisis. In doing so, it is particularly pleased that the programme does not provide for a predetermined breakdown by region, allowing Member States adequate flexibility and channelling resources to where they are most needed, allowing countries to justify expenditure incurred by 31 December 2023.  REACT-EU also foresees a business-to-day and rapid mobilisation of investments without additional bureaucratic conditions such as ex ante conditionality, thematic concentration requirements and the performance framework.

React-EU is one of the welcome responses to the health and economic consequences of a pandemic whose scope is still impossible to see. It is spooked that this pandemic could cause as many as 100 million new poor people in Europe. For this reason, I support the rapporteur's efforts to extend this programme after 2022, if necessary, for another two years in compliance with other instruments.  The social consequences of this crisis on society should be emphasised.  The Socialists and Democrats Club places special emphasis on them. I welcome the allocation of additional resources for the most vulnerable groups and children, the improvement of social inclusion and the eradication of poverty.  As you can assume after yesterday's conversation, we especially support the appreciation of the specificities of the islands and other territories referred to in Article 174. treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Due to the dependence on too often unsustainable tourism as the main source of income, the islands are further affected by the consequences of the pandemic. Having already proven through a pilot project that they can be at the forefront of the energy transition, islands can be at the forefront of sustainable digital development with adequate support and appreciation of their specificities. And the country I come from, Croatia, will have 800m euros available as a welcome aid. I agree with the Commission's recommendations that these funds should be channelled to the worst affected geographical areas in line with the economic recommendations of the European Semester. Only some of them are: improving healthcare, strengthening labour market and social protection measures, boosting corporate liquidity and investing in sustainable development. The effectiveness of all available funds will, of course, depend primarily on our willingness to make the most of the proposed reforms.

In order to substantially help this Fund, I consider it essential to channel this money directly into the real economy, to support small and medium-sized enterprises, which are at a marginal point and at risk of closure, and to support the sectors that really need it. And all sectors of the economy are in need, because small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers, the various productive sectors of the economy, even social groups, which are in danger of being sidelined once again, the unemployed, vulnerable groups, single-parent families, large families, all those who are actually in a much more critical situation than anyone else are.  That is why we are demanding that the European Union not only announce the EUR 750 billion for the Recovery Fund, but that this money be entered through flexible procedures, away from the well-known bureaucratic procedures of the European Union, away from those procedures that actually discourage citizens. Especially the southern countries, countries such as my home country Cyprus, were irreparably affected because they were based on the tourism sector and the tourism product, which was zeroed in. These countries and those businesses that have so far not received a single euro, these tourism businesses and these sectors must support the Recovery Fund, REACT-EU, before it is too late.

The pandemic has particularly affected small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the European Union, which has caused many SMEs to go bankrupt and some to be on the verge of survival. At the beginning of this health crisis, the closure of national borders led to a real economic bottleneck, affecting the movement of workers and rising unemployment in the Member States. The European Union, however, reacted quickly, showed responsibility and solidarity, trying and achieving effective protection for all affected citizens, employees and businesses.  A number of programmes and financial aid have been created to limit the negative effects of the pandemic. The REACT-EU programme was designed to save European Union member countries whose economies and jobs have been more severely affected. This programme will seek to limit national differences in addressing the effects of the crisis so as not to create regional gaps. Unemployment across the European Union is expected to rise to 8.6% in 2021 as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. The programme must therefore focus on avoiding the risk of having a lost generation and creating new jobs, and of course strengthening existing ones. Bold policies will be needed.

Flexibilities are already there in the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII), and so this is a continuation of this project and this programme until 2023. I would also like to underline that in fact, there was disagreement with going fast, and we share this concern. We have got to remind ourselves that after the European Council’s conclusions last Friday and this week’s plenary debate, I hope that the remaining procedures for the approval of the NextGenerationEU will go very fast so that the money reaches the citizens, the regions. On some comments that were made on which sectors, which regions we are proposing, it was approved by this Parliament and by the Presidency to concentrate efforts on countries and regions more in need of help. And so, what we are talking about is regions now that suffer the most and are less capable of helping themselves. I would like to finalise by thanking all those that had very complimentary words towards the Commission.

I think this is a landmark achievement. It’s a first, strong step forward. It is evident that human rights are at the Union’s core and in our DNA, and it signals the European Union’s strong determination to stand united in their defence. We will surely have the opportunity to discuss it more in detail on a few occasions, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank you again for your support in getting this important initiative through and then I hope that the Member States will be able to use it because, once you have a tool, you have to take it out of the toolbox and use it. Now let us turn to the recent developments in the Eastern Partnership. The Eastern Partnership was established 11 years ago. Since then, it has consolidated as a useful and relevant framework for the benefit of both the European Union and our eastern neighbours. It has offered closer political associations and economic integration with the European Union. It has also been key in supporting sustainable reform processes, including the rule of law, although I have to say that progress has not been linear and it is very different from one country to another. It has had a tangible impact on people’s lives. I think we should be proud of advancements in mobility, growing trade with the European Union, and improvements in digital and energy cooperation. We have achieved a lot despite the challenges faced by our partners. The last year and especially these last months have been particularly difficult and have put all of us to the test. We will for a long time be facing the consequences of the pandemic, which has shifted our priorities. Several of our partners have experienced conflicts, fighting and repression, unrest and popular demand for democratic values and reform. You know what I am talking about. In this time of challenges, the need for cooperation becomes stronger and the partnership with the eastern countries enables us to address these common challenges and provide a platform for dialogue and exchange of best practices. The Eastern Partnership forges an area of shared democracy, prosperity and stability with our neighbours in the East. It must remain at the top of the European Union agenda. It’s in our interest.  Our partners have made demands. For them, the European Union remains the most trusted foreign institution in the region, as our opinion polls show. Strength and resilience is the main objective and core element of the future partnership policy as set out in the joint communication in March. We will work with our partners on five areas of resilience: economic, democratic, environmental, digital and societal.  I think it’s key to empower civil society and independent media to increase accountability, to expose corruption and to enhance critical thinking. There is no hidden agenda behind this approach. We are only guided by the values we believe in – free, open societies based on human rights and the fundamental rights of citizens. Our reflection in the future also encompasses how to make sure that the partnership remains strategic, ambitious, effective and flexible. The partnership is designed to offer flexibility to develop more advanced relations with those who wish to do so, but it also has to remain inclusive and not to leave anyone behind.  We need to stress the great potential of the current bilateral agreements, notably the association agreements and the deep and comprehensive free trade areas with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.  In recent months, we have engaged in a comprehensive dialogue with partner countries, Member States, civil society and a wide range of stakeholders on the future shape of the Eastern Partnership. I think there is a strong consensus that the framework has delivered, and they can be proud of many achievements, but many challenges remain.  The implementation of practical and concrete activities will be the result of this debate and I will conclude after listening to all your observations and  remarks. I think it is a very important debate. Our Eastern Partnership is one of the most important things we have to deal with because our stability, security and even economic prosperity depend closely on how these countries are performing.  So thank you for this opportunity. I am looking forward to listening to your remarks.

The Eastern Partnership countries deserve the same, maybe a little bit later. It’s a pity that from the EU side we are still not able to promise a more clear vision of Eastern Partnership integration, and that creates unnecessary frustrations and a loss of hopes and dreams in those countries. But what we can do is to show where, in which place, the Eastern Partnership countries are on their road towards integration.

Belarus is in turmoil for the fifth month now. There is an intensifying crackdown on peaceful demonstrations, arrests and torture. In this situation, the EU must halt all cooperation with the government and redirect assistance to the opposition and civil society until new and legitimate elections take place in Belarus. Another sudden explosion of a fully-fledged military conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region took the EU by surprise. Fortunately, a ceasefire has been brokered, but the EU’s role was very limited. Whereas Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia appear to be more stable, it is noteworthy that they went through a complex electoral season, and while the process appears to have been reasonably well managed in Ukraine and Moldova, the aftermath of the parliamentary elections in Georgia is, of course, of serious concern. The political parties in Georgia should resume dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement, so that all members of parliament would work in the parliament and adopt electoral and judicial reforms in the interest of Georgian citizens and EU-Georgia relations. The aim of the Eastern Partnership is to work towards achieving political association and economic integration to promote well-being.

Founded in 2020, following events in Georgia whose wounds are still unhealed, the Eastern Partnership goes from disappointment to disappointment. From the implosion of Ukraine in 2014 to the painful clash between Armenia and Azerbaijan in recent weeks, the least that can be said is that the Eastern Partnership, for the moment, has not achieved peace.  It is even certainty for the countries that are members of it that they are increasingly interfering with the European Union in their affairs. In Moldova, we see that, in the end, subsidy agreements depend at times on the outcome of the elections. In Belarus, the European Union has decided to take things to the next level and, to hear some of our colleagues, an internet poll is now enough to choose who won the presidential elections.  But I don't think it really matters. When we are satisfied with having a foreign policy that applies sanctions, I would like to ask you, Mr High Representative: what was the result of these sanctions? Russia has been under sanctions since 2014. Now it is Belarus. Seriously, does any of us think it's going to change their minds? The answer is no. We have never seen sanctions bend a country.  Is it not time for another dialogue? For I believe that, within the European Union, all our nations are equal, but some make financial and human efforts to maintain an independent foreign and military policy. Others, obviously, have decided to follow NATO's instructions. As such, hearing eminent figures of the German CDU reject the very idea of strategic autonomy from NATO gives a real picture of reality.

Certainly, problems are not lacking. We have wars, we have dictatorships, we have stolen elections, we have situations of deep instability, we have corruptions that do not end or do not end—because they are the ones who have to do it—they have not just eradicated. I am not saying that the situation is particularly positive— and you know it — but it would surely be worse without this Association. Listening to some of you, I thought I had the impression that, for some, if you're not able to put troops on the ground, then your action is worthless. Well, I'm sorry to tell you, just in case you don't know: the European Union is not going to put troops on the ground. We're not going to be like Turkey; as you said, there has been support or military intervention. Are you suggesting I do the same? When you call for stronger, more determined, more energetic action, what do you mean? No, we're not going to intervene militarily. You better know and don't ask the apple tree for pears. We can do what we can do and we're doing it. We're not a military alliance.  We work from the fields of cooperation, diplomacy, support for civil society with our financial resources. We may be able and should take action using the instruments we have in the commercial and economic fields. But let me remind you that we invest a lot of money in this Association. I'm not going to give you a recital here of all the figures. Some of you have quoted them. Ukraine, for example, is the country that receives the most aid from the European Union. With COVID-19 we have accelerated and increased our financial support.  Yes, I know there has been a war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. And what have we done to stop it? Well, the tasks that give diplomacy and financial resources. We don't have any others. We have no others; please put your feet on the ground.  Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow we will have the agreements of the meetings of the Association Councils with Armenia and Azerbaijan. And of course we will raise the problems that you, with good judgment and reason, have raised here, of the abuses that have been committed in this war. And we will continue to commit ourselves to support with the means available to us for peaceful conflict resolution, to continue to combat bad governance practices, respect for human rights, freedom, progress and everything in our objectives.  Do not believe that we can solve the problems of these countries in ten years, which are the ones that the Eastern Partnership is of age. But we can't underestimate what we've done either. We can't be that negative either. The situation would be much worse if the European Union had not been an active and committed partner and funder of political and economic transformations in these countries.  Our support for Ukraine has been critical. And our approach to what has happened in Belarus is fundamental to supporting Democrats in Belarus.  Yes, I would like to collect complaints regarding the situation of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine, of course. Disclosing personal data on this website Myrotvorets is completely unacceptable and we have already requested that this content be removed and we are in contact with our counterparts in this field. Of course, we have been talking to the Ukrainian authorities and Hungary to resolve their disagreements quickly, constructively and with respect for minorities. We know and intervene as we can to defend the situation of minorities and, in particular, the situation of the Hungarian minority. Ladies and gentlemen, your criticisms are very stimulating and I assure you that I would like to have magic wands to solve the problems you pose. I don't have them. What I have are the Union's financial and diplomatic resources. We use them with all our energy and capacity. And I hope with your support; rather, surely counting on your support.  We have to keep insisting. This is not an easy task. The situation in these countries, after the decomposition of the Soviet Union, could hardly be imagined to be resolved in ten years.

Ukraine clearly took a pro-European direction, and due to the failure of then President Yanukovych to sign an association agreement with the EU, numerous protests began that led to the creation of Euromaidan.

As if that weren't enough, Cape Delgado, one of Mozambique's poorest provinces, with a tremendously fragile social structure, was devastated by Cyclone Kenneth in 2019. This only aggravated a situation that is now complicated by the extent of terrorism coming to them from the north, from Somalia.  We have specialized teams working on the situation in Mozambique; we have ongoing contacts with the Government and international institutions—the United Nations, the African Union, and the United States. We have allocated one hundred million through a resilience programme signed with the Government to respond to the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19, and, of course, we are ready to consider providing more resources. But this year, we have already contributed 37 million in humanitarian aid, priority to Cabo Delgado. We are strengthening cooperation with all countries in the region, combating the impact of human trafficking, which will unfortunately increase with this situation, and helping to implement the Maputo Peace Agreement between the Government of Mozambique and the Renamo. But the outlook is not positive, ladies and gentlemen: the situation in Mozambique deteriorates in the protection and heat of natural disasters and a country with very serious difficulties of government.  In reality, it is the entire facade of the Horn of Africa towards the Indian Ocean that is being the scene of an extension of conflict and the spread of terrorist forces. We're very concerned about the situation.  There does not appear to be any improvements in the Somali area to the south; recent tensions between Somalia and Kenya are not going to help either. But, within Mozambique, we need to take surely stronger measures.  I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal , a country which will assume the Presidency shortly - to move to the region as my personal envoy, as I cannot go for agenda reasons. And I have asked you, as a colleague of the Council, to pay particular attention during your Presidency to what is happening in that country , which Portugal is well aware of.

Mr Hanekom was accused of supporting the Islamist rebels in Cabo Delgado. These insurgents have been guilty of heinous crimes, including the beheading of villagers who stood in the way of their machinations. There is no doubt that these rebels really do exist, and they pose a serious threat to the state of Mozambique and the region beyond. And – Mr Borrell, you have just mentioned it – the terrorist influence from Somalia is being added.  However, as Mr Hanekom tragically learned, parts of the police and army in Mozambique are using these insurgents as a pretext to suppress all opinions in Cabo Delgado that deviate from the official line. These dissents include opposition to the development of offshore gas fields – one of the largest deposits in Africa – and to the forced purchase of land from the local population directly related to the development of gas fields. Add to that the exploitation of mining resources to extract precious stones, rampant corruption, and the presence of private militias – including the temporary emergence of Eric Black – all the ingredients for a humanitarian catastrophe are united.  Mr Hanekom did not want to sell his property. Influential groups wanted to force the sale. Mr Hanekom had partners who also pursued mining interests in Cabo Delgado.

We have given priority to humanitarian aid to Mozambique.  The Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) has allocated more than 14 million humanitarian aid in Mozambique this year. Five million have been dedicated specifically to the population affected by the conflict in the area. For us Cabo Delgado is an area of priority action, but think that demand for aid has grown exponentially in recent months.  In May, the United Nations anticipated that it would need EUR 35 million and are now asking for EUR 250 million. Surely they need them, but our budget is not expandable like a balloon in which it blows. We don't have 250 million euros available; if we had them... You also asked why we are not more active, as always, and why we do not send aid that the Government of Mozambique has requested.  Well, things aren't that clear. We are waiting for the Government of Mozambique to give us the green light to send a mission of security experts, who have been appointed since November and ready to leave for Mozambique as soon as they authorize us. There have been discussions with the Government, which doubts whether it prefers our experts or prefers bilateral relations with some countries of the European Union.  We have done our homework: we have exchanged letters and petitions with the Government of Mozambique and our experts are willing to move there, they are appointed! We just need to be authorized.   But look, let's not close our eyes to reality. You know her very well and have participated in this debate because you know and care about her. But Mozambique is a country that is mired in a deep financial crisis, with a debt level exceeding 110% of its gross domestic product; which has only been maintained thanks to the massive help of international donors; which has had serious corruption problems and government-wide business takeover problems. The International Monetary Fund has stopped its financial aid programme and the international community has diminished its Community support.  Nor can it be said that everything that happens in Mozambique, as some say, is a simple extension of the movements of terrorism called Islamist. Well, it's partly true; armed violence in northern Mozambique has been, from the outset, driven by rising poverty and inequality and detachment from a state that cannot bring basic goods to the population. But there are governance problems, there are traffic problems; there are problems...  Think of Mozambique as a country that has one hundred cubic trillion cubic natural gas – proven reserves – is the third largest natural gas reserve in Africa, after Nigeria and Algeria. You can imagine that this poses a sense of alienation for citizens, of saying \"we are a rich country and we live in poverty\", and their expectations are frustrated by a lack of development and misgovernment, or serious problems of government.  We are there to help to the extent of our capabilities, but Mozambique's needs go much further from the operational capabilities that our budget gives us.  I say to you with this the same thing I told you before regarding your demands for muscle interventions in Armenia and Azerbaijan: we have what we have, and what we have, we use it. And if suddenly the needs are multiplied by ten, my budget is not multiplied by ten.  We are ready to send missions, but we need the government to accept them.  Yes, I don't have time to go everywhere. I don't have time to go to Mozambique because either I couldn't travel or, when I travel, I have to attend to other needs. And I do not think it is a bad idea for the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal to assume, on my behalf, the presence in Mozambique — Portugal is the country that will hold the Presidency — just as I have asked the Minister of Finland to go to Ethiopia, and I will continue to ask my colleagues in the Foreign Affairs Council to help me in the international representation of Europe, because I cannot be everywhere. But they can help me—and a lot—and thus help create a more common foreign policy, more appropriate for all countries, because they participate in it.  And I hope, I am sure, that the presence of Minister Augustus, my friend Augustus, in Mozambique will help us to know reality better and to further promote cooperation with the Government and to further guide our resources, which are always scarce for the many needs that have been expressed in 2020, with COVID-19 and without COVID-19. In Mozambique is not a COVID-19 problem, but COVID-19 has aggravated it. It is a chronic problem of lack of good governance, development, poverty and inequality, and armed conflict. And all this can only be resolved through concerted action with the international community, of which the European Union participates to the extent of our capabilities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 159, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Klára DOBREV", "mepid": "197579", "text": "  The debate is over.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 160, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Klára DOBREV", "mepid": "197579", "text": "  The following point is a statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy: The 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process and the Southern Neighbourhood [2020/2918(RSP)].", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 161, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Josep BORRELL FONTELLES", "mepid": "28267", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, 25 years ago, I was there. The Barcelona Declaration set the goal to create an area of peace and shared prosperity around the Mediterranean. The Barcelona Process is 25 years old. What have we achieved and what are the remaining challenges and our priorities for the future? Well, I don’t want to be gloomy today, but I have to say that the situation in our southern neighbourhood has in some aspects worsened. We haven’t achieved some of our objectives, and the challenges have been growing faster than our collective response to them. Let’s face reality. The challenges have been growing faster than our capacity to respond to them.  In defining our response, we are not starting from scratch. We have a vast array of political dialogues and grassroots work undertaken over the last 25 years with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean, which you are now chairing. It was created during my mandate as President of this House and is an extremely valuable institutional framework, but we have to seize the new opportunities, the need to build more resilience and to fight the pandemic, and to increase trade and boost development. We had a ministerial meeting with our southern neighbours in Barcelona last November and this discussion gave us some ideas that I would like to convey to you. First, we need to have an inclusive approach as we develop greater economic autonomy. Some prefer to say sovereignty. I don’t mind what it is, but it needs to be more engaging on climate change and digitalisation. We use these two words so much that we are going to lose them. Second, we need an investment plan, building on the success of the External Investment Plan, but the needs are so big that we cannot expect to fulfil all of them with public money. We need private engagement to create jobs, especially for youth.  We should answer the calls of these countries. It’s time to act. We need to speak with one voice. Often we don’t do that and we pay the price of our divisions. I want to stress the need to focus our help on their youth. They need a peaceful and prosperous future. The demographic trends show them becoming younger and younger at the same time that we are becoming older and older, and this is going to create a gap that will push migration. The only way of facing that is to boost development at the same pace. But we don’t have adequate funding. We must admit that we don’t have enough resources from the national budgets. We absolutely need to develop private investment.  Finally, most of the regions cannot be addressed only bilaterally. They have to increase their regional and subregional cooperation. Only 5% of the trade among the countries of North Africa is trade among themselves. They don’t trade among themselves. At the same time, the gap in revenue per head is increasing. I think it’s now ten times higher in the north than in the south. If you compare both trends – the trends on revenue per head and the trend on demography – it is clear that we are going to create a big incentive for migration that, I repeat, can only be faced by increasing massively investment in the region. Then there is more bad news. The price of oil has been decreasing, and for some countries which depend a lot on oil exports this has created a big structural deficit on their public accounts. If it is just a matter of the conjuncture – a couple of years – they can resist, but if it becomes a structural issue and the price of oil remains low for a long period of time then the economic situation will be unsustainable. This is one of the consequences of the big shift that climate change policies will create on the wealth of nations. The stock of oil is a wealth that depends on its price, and its price depends on demand, and demand depends on the climate policy that we are going to follow. So we have to be ready to help diversify the economies of some of these countries and so they are not strongly dependent on oil exports, as is the case for some of them.  In any case, we have to be more committed to our partnership with the Mediterranean. It has to be stronger than ever because it is needed more than ever and, 25 years after the Barcelona Declaration, in Barcelona in November, all the states from the northern and the southern Mediterranean represented there reaffirmed this commitment. I am sure it will have the help and the support of the European Parliament.

Twenty-five years later and hundreds of millions of euros later, Europe is still far from achieving these goals and faces new challenges that it cannot respond to, as is the case with the geopolitical struggle that other powers do wage on our southern flank.  But how will Europe achieve its objectives, if it is not able to defend its most basic interests?  Mr Borrell, to this day, one of the most important partners in the European Union continues to challenge with impunity the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State. And I don't mean Turkey; I am referring to Morocco, which, in recent years, has overthrew sovereignty over Spanish waters in the Canary Islands and has narrowed the fence over Ceuta and Melilla.  The first condition of all foreign policy is geography. Europe cannot therefore afford to ignore the southern shore of the Mediterranean. We need to continue working on a Euro-Mediterranean policy that solves common problems.

As you think of Barcelona, the seat of the Union for the Mediterranean, I am thinking of the Treaties of Rome of 1957, which were considered the birth certificate of the European family, and I am therefore thinking of the red thread that unites Rome and Barcelona as capitals of Europe and the Mediterranean.  Together, therefore, we want to plan for a more sustainable and just future, along the paths of respect for the environment, development, culture and modernity, and we must be able to do this by working on strengthening economic governance and attracting important private investment, but there are also shadows, Mr Borrell.  We call for joint action against trafficking in human beings to be developed synchronously against organised crime, terrorism and irregular immigration, both from the areas of origin and transit, because the continuation of these trends will always prevent the region from making progress and will force European citizens to pay too high a price.

Israel, a privileged partner of the European Union, receives, thanks to the Barcelona Process, more than 170 million euros per year that help perpetuate the occupation of Palestine, funding, for example, military research.

Libya had the highest rate of human development in Africa, according to the United Nations, until NATO, with our help, destroyed the country to keep its resources. Today the war remains active and, with the excuse of migration control, Community policy is based on funding armed militias that create migrant concentration camps and slave markets.

We need to be modest and to be ready to engage more. Modest, because certainly the results are not good enough. And I’m not going to repeat the long list of problems that we have, but at the same time we cannot not put value on what we have been doing, because we have been doing things, and we have to build – continuous building – on the things that we have been doing in the past years and at the same time recognise that, yes, okay, the situation is not as good as we could have imagined 25 years ago, but let me put value on some examples. I’ve been talking about the European investment plan. We put 4.5 billion from the European Union budget and we succeeded in raising 44 billion of investment by 2020. That’s a good result. You will say that’s not enough. No, that’s not enough, for sure, but with 4 billion, we succeeded in raising 44 billion. And now we have been allocating, by June this year, 5.1 billion of European Union funds, and we have already generated ten times more in investments, which means 50 billion in public and private investment for development. We have created universities, like the Mediterranean University in Fez, to educate a new generation of young people with a Euro-Mediterranean vision. We have in training more than 100 000 young people and supported the development of over 1 000 small and medium firms. That’s not enough. No, that’s not enough: we have to continue. Yes, you have to continue. But I think that we cannot solve by ourselves: it is up to the people of these countries to solve. We can support, we can help, we can accompany, but there are problems that have to be solved by the people according to their interests and their will. Sans aucun doute, la Méditerranée est la première de nos préoccupations – et il faut encore plus en faire la première de nos préoccupations. Il n’est pas possible que le revenu par tête continue de diverger entre le nord et le sud. Il n’est pas possible qu’on soit toujours devant une région qui n’est pas du tout intégrée, avec des barrières qui empêchent un développement régional. Oui, tous ces problèmes sont là. Mais ce que je peux vous assurer, c’est que la volonté ne manque pas et que le Parlement, la Commission et le Conseil doivent unir leurs forces pour faire de la Méditerranée une mer de développement conjoint, de démocratie et de prospérité économique. C’est notre principal devoir. Si nous n’avons pas de succès dans cette politique-là, alors où aura-t-on du succès?  Dans quelle partie du monde devons-nous nous sentir plus engagés que dans notre voisinage le plus immédiat, pour éviter un fossé culturel, un fossé économique, un fossé générationnel, démographique?

First, the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the need to improve digital training solutions and ensure equal access to digital skills, tools and technologies for learners, teachers and trainers. Through what measures and with which financial and non—financial means, will the Member States promote digital upgrading and distance learning in vocational education and training (VET), while ensuring accessibility and acquisition of the necessary skills for all? How does the Commission intend to support the Member States in this, and how can this be coordinated and monitored together with the Member States? How will the Member States ensure equal access to the internet and to digital schools and all the digital tools in all schools? The Council recommendation provided for the number of quantitative objectives to be achieved by 2025. What measures will the Member States take to meet the objectives and how can the quality framework for apprenticeship and the Erasmus programme help to achieve them? How will the Commission support the Member States in achieving these objectives? How will the Commission monitor progress in achieving these aims and how will it relay this information to both Parliament and the Council? How will the Member States and the Commission improve the tracking of VET graduates?  There is a lack of coherence and discrepancy between the VET sector and the general education system, with VET often being considered as the less preferred option, despite the constant demand for more vocational professionals. What are the Member States and the Commission doing to boost the attractiveness of VET, and to ensure coherence and synergy between the two? What are the Member States doing at national level to improve the communication on VET, and what is the Commission planning at EU level to improve the communication on VET? What measures are the Member States taking to bring VET dropouts back into the system? What measures will the Member States and the Commission take to ensure that VET programmes are of high quality, are inclusive and offer equal opportunities to all, in particular to vulnerable groups and people living in rural or remote areas? What actions will the Member States and the Commission take to make quality and inclusive VET a right for all learners, as enshrined in the European pillar of social rights? How will the Member States and the Commission ensure that apprenticeships are of high quality and are diversified and tailor-made? What the Member States do to ensure a fair remuneration for apprenticeships and access to social protection?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this for the Council, on an issue of outstanding importance. Let me say this as a representative of a country where dual education – a close partnership between state/state schools on the one hand, businesses and the economy on the other – is the key to the lowest youth unemployment in the whole of the European Union and also the key to well-paid, decent, demanding, but also fulfilling work. I am grateful to all those who contribute to the fact that, despite our national competence, we also follow the principle of 'learn from each other, learn from each other' in order to strengthen vocational training.  What I also notice in many conversations is that there is still a very strong focus on academic education. Nothing against academic education. But it is important that young people, whether they want to pursue a career after school or then pursue an academic career, have the chance to meet social acceptance, that, above all, vocational qualifications are open to all – people with disabilities, but also people who have no chance of access in the light of their background or the financial circumstances of the families from which they come – and that there is no discrimination and no discrimination. And I would like to emphasise this in the recommendation that vocational training programmes must be inclusive and accessible to disadvantaged groups. The Council adopted the important recommendations on vocational training for sustainable competitiveness, social justice and resilience only a few weeks ago. There is also a special obligation for us as the European Union to act, because, according to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, everyone has the right to education and access to vocational training and further training. There is still a great deal of room for improvement here, and I also have the impression that the so-called European Skills Agenda and this recommendation have really given impetus to this debate – in the interests of young people, no matter where they live in the European Union and what their background is.  We believe that flexible and resilient vet systems can compensate for disruptions and turn threats into opportunities. In our statement, we said that while vocational education and training enables citizens to adapt to change, it should also enable them to shape change. It has just been expressed in the introductory words: the dramatic change in digitalisation is also creating fear. Many are worried and wonder: is this training, this qualification, still worth it? Or: Do I have the opportunity to master this qualification at all? That is why it is important that we make workers, young people, actors who are not just waiting for something to be put before them. I was particularly impressed by what we have launched as a joint declaration. Let me mention one last point, because it is one of the great success stories of a united Europe, namely the mobility of young people. Through Erasmus+, we have created the conditions for hundreds of thousands, even millions, of young people to have a chance to learn, work and live in another European country. But it is primarily a program for the academic elites. It is true that 1.5 million VET learners and staff have benefited from the Erasmus+ mobility programme for two decades now. But that is still too little for us, we need to go more broadly. We must also encourage young people who want to pursue vocational training and qualifications that it is worth getting to know Europe. This is also a good instrument against prejudice, stereotypes and resentment. That is why, in the Recommendation on Vocational Training at EU level, we have set ourselves a target that 8% of VET learners should benefit from learning mobility abroad by 2025. I am very pleased that this debate is also helping to bring the opportunities of vocational training to the fore. I would like to thank all those who are helping to strengthen and strengthen the role of the European Union in this important test. Here, close cooperation between regions, Member States, but also the European Union, is more imperative and more necessary than ever.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 182, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Nicolas SCHMIT", "mepid": "197428", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you very much for putting vocational education and training in the spotlight, and thank you for the support you are expressing in your resolution on the new Council recommendation on that. Let me also thank the German Presidency for their continued support during the negotiations on this recommendation, and particularly also for the adoption of the Osnabrück Declaration, which really identifies vocational education and training (VET) as an enabler, and I quote, ‘an enabler of recovery and just transitions to a digital and green economy’. Already before the pandemic our workers, young and older alike, needed massive up- and re-skilling opportunities to tackle skills mismatches. The pandemic and the accelerated shift towards a digital and green future demand this even more, because workers need to acquire digital skills and those skills needed for the green transition. We can only achieve this if education and training systems keep up the pace and meet the needs of our economy of the 21st century. The VET recommendation puts this vision into action, and the Commission provides concrete measures and instruments to support Member States in modernising their VET systems, which the 27 Member States wish to do. Enhancing the digital shift in VET is at the core of our policy, because most professions are directly affected by digital transformations. Digital has become the engine of modernisation, flexibility and the attractiveness of the VET systems, and it contributes to their inclusiveness by opening up new digital learning opportunities for all. The Commission has developed EU-level tools for schools to reflect their own progress and the pathway towards digitalisation. We have established quality standards. We are enhancing and promoting exchanges of good practices between Member States in all these areas. Vocational education and training also mean apprenticeships; they are a particularly appropriate answer to tackling the rising youth unemployment and they facilitate precisely the transition between education and the labour markets. The Commission will reinforce support to good quality, diversified and tailor-made apprenticeships thanks to the new initiatives such as the renewed European Alliance for Apprenticeships and the recently launched pact for skills, which precisely brings together companies, Member States, governments, regional authorities, providers of skills and social partners. I am particularly grateful for increased European funding for all these policies. The increase in the Erasmus+ budget will significantly increase the number of learners and teachers and trainers benefiting from VET mobility – and mobility was pointed out just now. What is the rule for university students should also become the norm for VET learners and this is also an aspect: how to restore the value of VET to the same level as other educational forms.  Moreover, Erasmus will also invest in VET excellence, because lifting quality and making education systems more inclusive are fundamental dimensions of the Erasmus+ programme, and the platforms of centres of vocational excellence financed through this programme. Modernising VET systems can in particular be financed through the European Social Fund Plus, and through REACT and the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The Commission’s strategic guidance for the Recovery and Resilience Facility laid out in the annual sustainable growth strategy proposes upskilling and re-skilling as one of the flagship initiatives of the Facility. Unprecedented funds are available thanks to the good outcome of the MFF negotiations, and I urge Member States now to use them to invest in people. It’s a matter of Europe’s competitiveness and social cohesion alike.  Vocational education and training is also based on the cooperation of schools, learners, parents, employers, social partners, government authorities, regional innovation agencies, researchers and many more players.  We all know that, in principle, education is a national competence, but we need this European cooperation, and by the way, professional education was already in the Treaty of Rome. It was also initially an objective of the European Community, because it was understood that we need a good professional education to have a well-functioning common market.

It is also an opportunity to create a sustainable green future. However, in order to build this green digital future, we need to focus much more on the wise hands and ensure a European workforce with strong professional skills and high-tech knowledge. That is why we must invest in our vocational training. Europe's vocational training must be an attractive choice for all, ensuring a high-quality education for all. We must ensure a much more common level of quality across Europe, thus fully including the pupils from the vocational schools in Erasmus Plus. Many more skilled workers are needed, and so we must also engage talented young women. And it even offers bonuses, because a better working environment occurs when both sexes are represented in the workplace. Anyone who wants an apprenticeship should be able to get an apprenticeship. Someone who is both with pay and dresses a good one for many years in the labour market. Now is the time to have the vision for a greener Europe.

We want thousands of Kevins, millions of Kevins who travel europe, coming from our villages, our towns, our cities.

This is why it is necessary to increase its attractiveness, to introduce innovative methods of learning and to improve the equipment of schools. It is also very important to gradually shape society's perception of the benefits of training. Secondly, it is crucial to find ways in which training can adapt quickly and flexibly to changes in the labour market, whether these are sudden ones, such as during the current pandemic, or based on technological or social developments. Furthermore, I believe that such preparation should really be for everyone. However, we must not only declare on this the removal of barriers to education, but also think about better accessibility of digital tools, strengthening digital skills, debariising the environment and improving the overall public perception of the possibilities of professional application of vulnerable persons, whether persons with disabilities or persons from disadvantaged backgrounds. Finally, I will mention one aspect that I lack in the recommendations, which concerns the acquisition of skills outside official educational structures. For example, many people acquire invaluable skills during the care of a loved one, but they are not formally recognised.

First of all, I would like to thank all the stakeholders for their ideas and their contribution to effectively promoting vocational training. I also welcome the adoption by your Parliament of a resolution promoting this form of training.  We all agree that, especially after this crisis, vocational training will become even more important. It will have to be open to new technologies, such as digital technology, such as digitalization. It must keep pace with the evolution of our economy, as the evolution of our economy will see the emergence of new professions, but also the need for new skills. And I believe that, precisely, what the Commission intends to promote is the flexibility inherent in vocational training. I think that is one of the important points.  The second point I would like to make is the extension of this form of training, the extension to many professions. There is no longer - there should be no more - this opposition between academic training and vocational training. We need open systems where we can move from one to the other. I think that is a very important aspect in valuing vocational training.  You also pointed out the attractiveness of vocational training, and salaries are indeed one of the elements of that attractiveness. Hence, moreover, the interest of having an framework for minimum wages, because if young people feel that they cannot earn a living by taking a vocational training course, the attractiveness will not be assured.  Yes, the youth guarantee must be an instrument to guide, to direct young people towards vocational training, and that is its objective. I believe that in Europe we face many young people who do not have a degree, who have no training and who are likely to be the losers of future economic development, the so-called NEETs. I believe that vocational training can be an absolutely valuable way to give these young people a new opportunity.  And finally, on Erasmus and the figure of 8% that has been raised concerning young people in vocational training who should have the chance to have professional mobility: 8% is not enough. I believe that there are still too many barriers that prevent young people in vocational training from accessing this professional mobility.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The debate has shown me that the institutions are also pulling together on this central issue. I would also like to reassure you – also in view of the central competences of education policy, which are in the hands of the Member States or the regions – that we take the recommendations very, very seriously and that we are also aware of the European dimension of vocational training. We have tried to shed light on this with a number of very specific examples, and I would also like to thank you for that. So what do I take with me from this debate? Firstly, vocational training needs more appreciation. The central importance of the craft sector, which is an irreplaceable pillar in the field of vocational training, has just been mentioned in a very, very many Member States, regardless of the structure of dual training. I take a second message with me: inclusivity and equity of opportunity. Dual education must really be open to all, and it must also help to ensure that people have a second, a third chance and that those who have failed or who have considerable difficulties can go their own way as free members of our European societies. Yes, and I would also like to acknowledge that the European Union is already making a significant contribution, for example through the European Social Fund, to improving training and qualification, especially for the disadvantaged. So it is always a question of adequate financial, organisational support. Another message I take away from today's debate is that we also see new developments as an opportunity and that we are also taking away people's fears of change. Of course, digitalisation, but also environmental issues, play a very central role at the moment. Of course, the Members who have pointed out that it is not enough simply to give a young person, an apprentice, a laptop or even an iPad. That will not be enough. And the very last thing I would like to promote again is the principle of \"learning from each other and with each other\" – completely unbiased. There are excellent examples in the European Union which show that it is possible and that what we have now agreed in the recommendation can also be implemented everywhere. Best practice is an excellent tool.

Within VET, digital learning is even more difficult than in classical education. At the same time, vocational education and training are crucial for maintaining classic European industries, which have long suffered from a shortage of skilled labour. The VET deserves our full support and this oral question with the EMPL resolution is therefore very appropriate. Last Friday, a trialogue agreement on the Erasmus programme was concluded after 2021. This is excellent news for young people in the EU, students, vocational education and training pupils, teachers and staff in the field. The mobility of pupils and staff in vocational education and training will continue to be massively encouraged in the EU. Up to a fifth of the budget of the Erasmus programme, which will total EUR 26 billion, can be devoted to this.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I would like to present to the Commission the list of questions presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the end of the derogation for slaughterhouses under Regulation (EU) 2017/185. Let me first point out that there are certain slaughterhouses in the EU that are allowed to slaughter and process animals without complying with certain hygiene requirements. However, this only applies to a limited quantity of animals in the poultry and hare meat sectors in order to market local and fresh meat to the final consumer or to retailers who deliver directly to the final consumer. In order to meet the high demand of consumers for these local products and to ensure better remuneration for local producers, short marketing cycles have been developed. I would like to point out that these practices go hand in hand with the Commission's farm-to-fork strategy. This strategy calls, among other things, on the Member States to switch to more sustainable production and consumption. In addition, short processing and production chains are called for in response to growing social demand and the favouring of local production. I would also like to refer to this as the current complex legal framework that applies, among other things, to these slaughterhouses. The Hygiene Ordinance lays down the specific hygiene requirements for food stuff of animal origin. By way of derogation from these rules, the Commission provided that an exception should apply to the direct supply of small quantities of poultry and hare meat slaughtered on the farm to the final consumer or to local retailers supplying the final consumer directly. However, this derogation will no longer be possible from 1 January 2021, since the scheme will no longer apply from that date, so that the undertakings concerned will no longer be able to carry out this activity. This is a serious problem for certain Member States, in particular the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hungary and Poland – but not exclusively. These countries have already asked the Commission to extend the derogation. Unfortunately, however, the Commission confirmed the end date of the derogation. She stressed that the only way to continue this practice would be to change the hygiene rules, which would require a proper legislative procedure. There is an urgent need to clarify which procedure will be introduced from 1 January 2021 in order to allow producers to continue their work.  That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is addressing the following four questions to the Commission. Firstly, how does the Commission intend to allow slaughterhouses operating under this derogation to process their products when the derogation no longer applies from 1 January 2021? Secondly, when does the Commission intend to take action on the matter and what approach does it consider appropriate? Thirdly, what new legal framework will the Commission create to ensure a smooth transition for producers? Fourthly and finally, given the urgency of the question, when does the Commission intend to present an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, which will allow producers to continue to supply local markets directly with processed poultry meat and hare meat? We thank you in advance for answering the questions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 202, "date": "2020-12-15.json", "name": "Nicolas SCHMIT", "mepid": "197428", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the EU’s 2004 rules on the hygienic production of food aim to ensure a high level of food safety for consumers while remaining proportionate for producers. They provide the framework for all food produced for the EU market. When they were adopted, the co—legislators took account of small producers, notably, including the possibility to adapt hygiene rules for small local establishments and excluding certain on-farm practices from the scope of EU food hygiene requirements. In particular, the rules expressly exclude fresh meat from poultry and lagomorphs produced and slaughtered on—farm for direct supply to the final consumer or local retail establishments, as you just described.  Let me clarify. This will not change on 1 January 2021. Farmers can continue to produce and sell this type of fresh meat without having to comply with EU hygiene rules, due to their comparatively low risk. However, the situation is different for meat preparations like raw sausages and meat products like pates manufactured from this fresh meat. While small producers could temporarily benefit from a similar derogation to that for fresh meat, it was subject to a transition period of nearly 16 years, which ends this year. This was foreseen to allow sufficient time for producers to adapt smoothly to the EU’s hygiene rules. Last year, the European Parliament and the Council repealed the Commission’s empowerment to lay down transitional measures, meaning a new transitional arrangement is no longer legally possible. This means that, from 2021 onwards, meat preparations and meat products from poultry and lagomorphs slaughtered on—farm must respect the EU’s food hygiene legislation.  Contacts with Member States show that only a very limited number are concerned about the impact of ending the transitional measure for meat preparations and meat products. Member States may of course use the possibilities provided for in the legislation to adapt national rules to EU requirements.

In these times of economic crisis, it is essential to defend this model of activity synonymous with jobs and economic wealth. The perpetuation of this derogation therefore represents first of all a real challenge for some of our rural areas, which are likely to be severely penalised, even though they are already going through a more than difficult situation.

As part of the Green Deal, the Commission has for the first time presented a holistic approach to a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system in the Farm-to-Fork strategy. With the expiry of the transitional measures under Regulation (EU) 2017/185, the Commission is contradicting this approach. In doing so, it is harming many small businesses, which are already making important contributions to achieving these objectives through their practices. In addition, the Commission plans that a maximum of six animals may be slaughtered in the case of slaughter on the farm with a mobile slaughter box and that this may only be done in the presence of a veterinarian. Why should more restrictive rules apply here than conventional slaughter in the slaughterhouse? Consistency and proportionality of measures under the Hygiene Regulation with the objectives of the Farm-to-Fork strategy are mandatory. Regional direct marketers, who have invested a lot of money and are also slaughtering stress-free, are forced to stop here by arbitrariness. Tell me a case where these slaughters have put consumers at risk to health. I therefore call for an immediate extension of the transitional regulation.
