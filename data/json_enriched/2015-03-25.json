We are all certainly deeply saddened and shocked by the terrible news that reached us yesterday from France. The plane crash in the French Alps has shaken us all deeply. The cause of this serious accident has so far been unclear, but the plane, which crashed in the mountain range, had 150 people on board, including six crew members and a group of students from the Federal Republic of Germany, from Haltern in North Rhine-Westphalia: 16 young people who were in Spain with their teachers for student exchange have died. An entire city in my own country is in shock. And all the people from other countries – from Spain, from Turkey, from other countries – who have victims to mourn, certainly all of us have sympathy. This also applies to the victims of the terrible terrorist attack at the Bardo Museum in Tunis. The background to this terrible terrorist attack, the fanatical fundamentalism that has no respect for the lives of others, is not new to us. We have been experiencing this time and again and in intensive form over the last few months, and it shocks us. Here, too, our thoughts and feelings are with the families, friends, partners, families of the victims. The relatives of the people who died in Tunis and the relatives of the victims of this terrible plane crash yesterday in France, who now need strength in these difficult hours and days – all these people who have been badly beaten by fate should be sure that at this difficult time the Members of the European Parliament, that our institution in full solidarity and compassion with them, begins the sitting with a moment of silence.

He sent the message out yesterday and he repeated this letter today with more content and more information. I would like to give you my input on this. I think there is one principle that is applicable in our House, and that is the right of all of our Members to be treated equally and fairly. I have serious doubts about this in relation to the report on Mr Uspaskich. We have to be 100% sure, in the case of Mr Uspaskich, that there is no fumus persecutionis, to use the Latin term, i.e. that a case has not been mounted against him in order to eliminate him and his party from the political stage in his country. I have to tell you that I have serious doubts about this – doubts that have not, unfortunately, been removed by the report that is on our agenda today. There are many bizarre elements coinciding in this case. First of all, a change in the original charges, a change from an administrative fine to not less than four years’ imprisonment – and that two days before an election! A falsified tax declaration – because it now seems that the signature on this paper is not his signature. And then perhaps the most important thing: the revelation in WikiLeaks that the highest authorities in the country want to hound Mr Uspaskich out of politics. The fact that he is a European of Russian origin does not mean that this is allowed, or that his freedom of movement can be limited, preventing him from participating in the election campaign. On top of all this – and I want to conclude here – the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) has also decided that there could be restriction of his personal freedoms. I have here, by way of example, the decision taken in the case of Mr Severin, who was pursued for corruption, and in his case there was never a decision to restrict his ...

I would also like to express my sympathy and solidarity with the governments of all affected nations. Our thoughts are with you today. Now I would like to report to you on the Spring European Council which was an absorbing summit with a long, heavy agenda. We took the first concrete steps towards an Energy Union with all its dimensions. Our discussion focused mostly on energy security. Leaders agreed that in future all gas contracts, both between governments and businesses, need to be more transparent to make sure that they comply with our rules and do not endanger our energy security. The details will be settled in legislation to be proposed very soon by the Commission. I hope our ambition will be supported by this Chamber. We also agreed to explore how European companies might cooperate to buy gas in bulk. This is a timely discussion. Our dependence on external suppliers is a major weakness and I am glad leaders wished to address it. Finally, we agreed to step up Europe’s climate diplomacy ahead of the Paris Climate Summit in December. In the presence of the ECB President, Mr Mario Draghi, we discussed the European economy. The outlook for our economy is improving, at least according to the latest forecasts. Oil prices have declined faster than expected. The ECB is implementing quantitative easing. The euro has depreciated. However, no monetary initiative, no matter how big, will work without structural reforms at national level. The time to reform is now when the wind is blowing in our favour. We still have around five million unemployed young people in the European Union, so nobody can sit down and relax. And neither should this House relax in its efforts to agree the European Investment Fund that will help us provide the investment that Europe needs so badly. We had a good debate on TTIP. The aim remains clear: to reach an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial agreement by the end of 2015. Leaders shared the view that we now all need to communicate the potential benefits to the public. In our sessions dedicated to foreign affairs we discussed both the Eastern and Southern dimensions of our neighbourhood policy. Europe should continue to use its diplomatic weight and to act as a stabilising factor. Based on the contribution of foreign ministers, the European Council debated the security situation in Libya. We are determined to support fully the United Nations talks aimed at securing an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of a government of national unity. We gave a clear sign that we stand ready to support an agreement as soon as it is reached. We also discussed the rise in uncontrolled migration in the context of Libya. The European Union is already taking some measures and these should be stepped up. The European Council also welcomed the intention of the Commission to submit a European Agenda on Migration in May. However, the single best step to control migration is the re-establishment of central authorities in Libya. Our meeting took place the day after terrorists attacked the Bardo Museum in Tunis, where many lives were lost. We were unanimous in our support of Tunisia’s young democracy, its economic and social development, as well as in the fight against terrorism. Tunisia is a shining example of hope and therefore we need to do our best to support it. Together with the High Representative, I will visit Tunisia and the region next week to review the state of play and see how Europe can help to stabilise the situation. Now turning to the East. This was the last meeting of leaders ahead of the Eastern Partnership summit in Riga. We confirmed our commitment to the six partner countries and highlighted the need to focus on strengthening democratic institutions. Finally, we agreed to step up our support to the peace process in Ukraine and to link our sanctions regime to the complete implementation of the Minsk Agreement. That is the best hope for ensuring that the deal brokered by President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel is respected. We agreed that if the situation worsens we are ready to take further measures. In the meantime, the European Union will continue to support reform efforts in Ukraine. I commend Parliament’s current work to finalise financial assistance to Kiev. Let me close with a word on Greece, which is so important to the future of the eurozone and the European Union. I held an informal meeting on Greece at the request of Prime Minister Tsipras. The aim of this meeting was very simple: to rebuild mutual trust and avoid misunderstandings. I think we were successful in this. We agreed to speed up the implementation of the Euro Group agreement of 20 February 2015. Prime Minister Tsipras promised to present additional reform plans soon. Let us hope that this clears the way for a solution. Given that the format of this meeting received particular attention, let me mention that I asked the European Council if members preferred to discuss the Greek question at a Euro Summit, to be held immediately if needed. Leaders did not think this was necessary, or indeed useful at this stage. In the coming weeks and months, I will continue to do all I can to help in this difficult situation. I look forward to our debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 24, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Mr President of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is I would like to begin by saying what you said at the beginning of the debate in the introduction: yesterday's plane crash left us all deeply affected. And what happened in Tunisia last week, in the country where Spring Day is sprouting and continues to sprout, has also affected us. Sometimes it is – and it is actually sad – that other people's deaths make us better. We sometimes become better people through such events. But we quickly forget that again. I would like us to remember for a long time what you have recalled here, and I think you are quite right to do so. There is little to add to the president-in-office of the Council about the course of the European Council, unless it is to point out that we are currently dealing with an improbably broad recovery plan. I am not talking about the Commission's investment plan, but about the side effects of this plan. Oil prices have been revised down by 50%. This is an economic injection of EUR 100 billion per year. If we have to correct the investment plan upwards by EUR 100 billion, we do not know how to do so. But it happened! The price of oil has fallen by 50%, the exchange rates of the euro by 30% in direct relation to the US dollar. Taken together, the two are an insane recovery plan. And it is up to the governments, as well as the Commission and the Council, to make full use of these new opportunities for economic reception! I was very pleased that the European Council, like the Council of Finance Ministers, approved the European Commission's investment programme. I have noted very well, Mr President, that you yourself stated in your speech to the European Council that the European Parliament will make a great effort to bring the legislative process to a good end by mid-June. Which does not mean that everything the Commission has proposed should be 'nodded off' by Parliament one-to-one. However, we need a decision by the European Parliament by mid-June so that we are able to implement and launch this investment programme as quickly and efficiently as possible. Nevertheless, I would like to point out once again – even if this might get on the nerves of some here – that we urgently need this initial guarantee of EUR 16 billion in budgetary resources and EUR 5 billion in EIB funds. We need to be able to present investors with a plan that will provide this reinsurance option. How this is done in detail is not only a matter for Parliament, but also for Parliament. I am confident that, in a sensible way, we will find ourselves not somewhere in the middle, but at the centre of common sense, so that all this can be done as it should be done. We agreed on the basic lines of the Energy Union in the European Council on the basis of a list of proposals from the European Commission, which will soon be materialised in the legislative process. This is a very important concern to me! I made it clear here in this Parliament – but in Strasbourg, which is actually the seat of Parliament, – on 15 July, when discussing the priorities of the then new Commission – it is getting older and older, Mr Timmermans is also growing, he is getting bigger as the Commission gets older – that the Energy Union is an important priority for the then new , is now an aged Commission. We have delivered, that was also Parliament's wish, we have done so, and this is an important matter! There are four fundamental freedoms in the European Treaties – in the Treaty of Rome – and I would like us to add a fifth without having to make treaty changes: we also need the free movement of energy in Europe! Ergo we must end the national silos that exist and the geo-blocking in the field of energy supply. I was very pleased that weeks ago in Madrid we had a summit with the French President and the Prime Ministers of Portugal and Spain to ensure the energy supply of the Iberian Peninsula for the future. Portugal is on the periphery of Europe without being a peripheral country, because Portugal is an important Member State of the European Union, but in terms of energy policy the supply situation in Portugal, and partly in Spain, is very unsatisfactory. We are trying to remedy this through the policies that have been put in place. We talked about TTIP and I asked the Prime Ministers to to make it clear what the situation and the view of things are. And all the Prime Ministers, regardless of what they have announced in their capitals after the end of the European Council, have committed themselves to the aim of concluding this free trade agreement, if possible, by the end of the year. This does not change the fact that we all – not just some – think that we should not sacrifice fundamental European values on the altar of this free trade agreement, should, and want. But this is being negotiated in detail. And the Commission has been given the task of regularly reporting to the European Council on the progress of the discussions. As far as Greece is concerned, I would not like to elaborate too much on this but we had this meeting under the leadership of Donald Tusk for the reasons indicated because, during the last European Council, the Member States did not like to discuss this in a formal meeting of the Euro Group at the highest level. So the President of the Council decided to form a smaller group, mainly to put people in touch who never speak to each other. It was very helpful. We think that the Greek government would be best inspired to present us with a list of immediate reforms to be undertaken. Prime Minister Tsipras, with whom I talked last night, is ready to present these reforms by the end of this week or the beginning of next week. These reforms will be examined by the groups that have been created – a technical group, a fact-finding mission in Athens and the so-called Brussels Group, a more politically-oriented group. Then after the assessment that will be given by the three institutions – IMF, Commission and ECB – the Euro Group will be in charge of putting this under its mediation in order allow us to proceed in the best way possible. I must admit that I have been very pessimistic in recent weeks because no progress what soever was made, but now we are back to normal and I think that we will come to a conclusion that will be in favor both of Greece – and we love Greece – and the European Union. Monsieur le Président, lundi prochain, je me rendrai avec Federica Mogherini. Le président de la République ukrainienne me fait l'honneur de me demander de coprésider le Conseil des ministres. Il est vrai que, depuis de trop longs mois, je n'ai plus présidé un Conseil des ministres, et je dois donc me rendre Kiev pour ce faire.

Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, this Spring Council has indeed been very much a discussion. I will start by mentioning this Energy Union, which is particularly important for us. I note that the Member States have supported the five pillars of this union: energy security, internal market integration, energy efficiency, decarbonisation and, of course, research and development. We can rejoice, because we have to accelerate the movement! And translate this Energy Union into concrete action as soon as possible. Member States must therefore be involved in this area and should not be wary of strategic issues. Let me emphasize some priorities. Firstly, energy security, which is primarily achieved by achieving a more integrated internal energy market. Member States must implement the existing rules before adding any more. Without regional cooperation to achieve this internal energy market and without firm application of the legislation of the third energy package, the Energy Union will be impossible. We need better connections and efficient use of existing networks. This is an essential condition for this internal market. Secondly, the European Union needs to better manage its supplies through a real diversification of its energy sources. It must reduce its energy dependence and promote energy efficiency, especially in buildings. This will make the European Union more competitive. Thirdly, innovative technologies must be the spearhead of the European Union. To become the world leader in these renewable energy technologies, we must seize opportunities in these sectors, not only in wind or solar, but also in biomass, electricity storage, CO2 storage and capture, hydrogen and, finally, the nuclear of the future. Support for research and innovation is essential to Europe's competitiveness. The task is therefore great: to strengthen this competitiveness, to develop jobs and to enable our young people to find these jobs on the European continent. As such, I welcome the Council's willingness to insist, in the context of the European semester, on the need to carry out structural reforms in Europe and to clean up public accounts in order to restore growth, which unfortunately remains fragile and heterogeneous. The European Union is now suffering from a lack of investment because investors do not have enough confidence. The Commission must therefore firmly implement the Stability Pact to the Member States. Structural reforms will not be done without a clear incentive to comply with European rules. These reforms are too timid and insufficient in some European countries. Let us not underestimate the terrible consequences of this lack of substantive reforms for the peoples of Europe. Greece is a particularly painful example. Finally, President Juncker's European Fund for Strategic Investments sends a strong signal and is timely. We fully support it because it restores confidence in areas where no more risks are being taken, for lack of long-term hope. I particularly stress the need to preserve research, fundamental or applied, because it is the breeding ground for tomorrow's innovation.

I would like to talk above all about energy policy and also about investment policy. I thought you were a little short of substance when you went into the energy union and the decisions on this. Nevertheless, I would like to congratulate you on the decisions you have taken on the Energy Union. Why? Because the strength of the energy union, under the inspiring leadership of Vice-President Šefčovič, is in the overall approach. Not only the energy security, not only climate - however important - not only the energy poverty or the need for energy of our industry, but the overall approach. If we look at that picture, we actually know what it takes. We know, as is the case in the Energy Union, that we need to move towards a low-carbon economy. That sounds very logical and we may agree in theory, but it remains a bit of a theoretical concept. We must be careful about this, because there was a time when we were at the forefront of new technology, renewable energy and even energy efficiency, especially in Europe. But we're losing that leadership role. There are other economies and regions in the world that are taking over. We must therefore focus on certainty and a total picture. Why don't we do that? Why do we not invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy? Because we have 28 different types of policies, with an energy mix here and an energy mix there, without a clear picture of where we need to go. That is the strength of the energy union and it must be prioritised.  One of these priorities, which has once again been clearly identified in the Energy Union, is energy efficiency, because it is now making that picture complete. Energy efficiency creates jobs, ensures that we meet our climate targets and makes our industries the most energy efficient industries. But here too, we must be careful that it does not stick to theory. And then I'll come up with the investment plan. You have broad support - and I am now addressing Parliament' s President - for that plan. We want more investment. As far as we are concerned, the Energy Union is one of the pillars that lies beneath it, one of the frameworks that determines what investment should be made in. We agree on this, but that is why we are also a little concerned about our discomfort in the European Parliament, and Mr Grossetête has rightly indicated it: another pillar of the Energy Union is research and development. Without research and development, we will not make it. And so it is unacceptable for us to get resources from Horizon 2020 and we must start looking for a good compromise.

Instead, I am afraid it demonstrated a weakness of will. I have to say that I take no pleasure in saying that, for my group wants to see the EU encouraging cooperation in dealing with issues affecting people in the EU countries right across the EU; not kicking the can down the road. On Energy Union and energy policy, we secured a commitment to the proposals put on the table but the detail was put off until another meeting. We need to demonstrate – as Ms Grossetête said – how we are going to encourage diversification of energy sources, better interconnection and energy security so that our countries no longer have to rely on unpleasant regimes in the Middle East or on Russia. On Russia, we welcome the decision to give Minsk a chance but we have been far too slow amongst us in responding to Russian propaganda. And have we forgotten Crimea? What message is the Council giving to Russia? It seems that the EU is saying to Russia: invade first, negotiate second. This was the summit that was supposed to focus on the economy. But the most serious issue holding back our economies – the eurozone and Greece – does not feature once in the Council conclusions. The major issue was relegated to a late-night discussion with a select few leaders. But all 28 countries have a stake in the euro’s future, so why was Greece not discussed in the Council? We were told at the time that this was because the Council President thought that the issue might be ‘a little bit too hot’. I have to be fair and I have to understand, Mr Tusk, that you are a servant of the Council and therefore you were reflecting that decision of the leaders. But I also have to ask you, if Council meetings are not going to discuss the most pressing issues of the day because an issue is considered ‘a little bit too hot’, then what is the point of the Council meeting? So, Mr Tusk, our plea to you – and our plea to the leaders of these summits – is: show that you have the will to stand up to Russia; show that you have the will to take the tough decisions about the euro and show that you have the will to provide solutions.

Having said that, Mr Tusk, I completely deplore the fact that you have organised a meeting on Greece with a limited format. What type of Union is this? Greece concerns all the countries of the European Union and at least all the countries of the eurozone and it should not be allowed that there are separate and limited meetings of a number of countries about it. I do not think that this is at all acceptable. It is against the interest of the Union and against the interest of the eurozone to do this. (Applause) I know there is always pressure.

The big countries wanted a meeting – I think it was France, Germany and Britain – about Afghanistan after 9/11. They had a separate meeting and they asked me – I was President of the Council – for a separate room. I found the dirtiest room in Ghent to give them for their meeting. The meeting lasted only five minutes. It was so dark in that room that they came out after five minutes and joined the meeting of the whole European Council. So I deplore this. Do not do it. It sends a bad signal to everybody. I have a number of very short questions. What was decided on Greece? We do not know what has been decided on Greece. When are they coming forward with their package of structural reforms, because that is the starting point of every exercise on Greece? Secondly, what is the decision on Russia? We need a proactive line – we already have a debate on this. Have the sanctions been deepened if Russia and Mr Putin go further? And has a positive package also been decided? I mean a positive package for young people, young students and researchers. We need to liberalise to make it easier for them to have visas to our countries. On the Energy Union, I think Ms Van Brempt is quite right that decisions on interconnection require a leading role for the Commission. If no decision is made by the Member States to give a leading role to the Commission to lead the negotiations about energy agreements and interconnections investments, we do not have a real Energy Union.

Mr President, we must say that we do not need dinners or meals to convey our views, we transfer them here, in full transparency, as we convey our views on the Commission and Parliament's committees. As far as the European Union is concerned, ladies and gentlemen, the Council conclusions contained an important reference to the need to safeguard the sovereignty and sovereign rights of the Member States for the exploration and development of natural resources.  However, there is no attempt to pressure Turkey to stop the illegal actions and harassment of the Republic of Cyprus in the exercise of its sovereign rights to explore and exploit its natural resources, as it certainly prevents the resumption of inter-communal talks on a solution to the Cyprus problem. There is no pressure on Turkey to fulfil its contractual obligations, apart from the fact that Turkey in this way affects the overall energy development of the region, but also the energy security of the European Union.  The Council conclusions also mention the importance of exploiting domestic energy sources. However, the role that the natural gas deposits of Cyprus and the wider eastern Mediterranean region can play is overlooked. The same omission can be found both in the Commission communication on energy union and in the Communication on energy security.  Now, as far as economic issues are concerned: the decisions of the European Council have also confirmed the continuation of the neoliberal austerity policies that led to the current crisis. It is not enough, Mr Tusk, to improve the indicators of the economy at a time when people are increasingly sinking into poverty, unemployment and poverty.  As far as Greece is concerned, the European Council, the Commission, the European Central Bank, the Eurogroup must stop financial blackmail. The Greek government is demanding for the country and its people an end to the disastrous policies imposed by the Troika and the memoranda. Let the Greek government implement its programme to address the humanitarian crisis and provide substantial support to the Greek people. Support the efforts of the Greek government and let it implement the reforms that previous governments have not done, and I am referring to reforms that can boost the real economy, but also address the serious problems of tax evasion and corruption, because it has finally been confirmed in practice that leaving the memorandum does not mean getting rid of the policies of harsh austerity.  Apart from Greece and Cyprus, which are in a memorandum of understanding, in countries such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, which are supposed to have left the Memorandums, the same policies of austerity continue, privatisations, housing divestments, the removal of the social state, the increase in unemployment and the impoverishment of peoples continue.

I think it is a good thing that people are laughing at such a debate, and that we are perhaps looking at what has been achieved and not been achieved in a more distant way. Mr Juncker is absolutely right: I was one of those who was very disappointed – perhaps least of what has happened outside the agenda, from the invitation to some special quarrels on the Greek issue. For my impression was that this small side-summit was absolutely necessary in order to control the tensions that had arisen and to get away from an almost inevitable 'graccident' on the way to aid to Greece. That was the word that had a lot of economic activity around this summit, that perhaps – without any real intention – that debates become self-sufficient, that Greece leaves the eurozone, and that we can only collect the rubble here in a few months' time. I am convinced that such a 'graccident' would have dire consequences for Greece, but would also have serious political consequences for the European Union. At the summits that I have been observating for a number of years, I sometimes have the impression that, as long as we cannot solve these fundamental problems of the euro and the euro crisis, other big, courageous decisions for the European Union are literally built up by the fact that this laboratory is all about the euro crisis. Then There is the Energy Union, Mr Juncker. I was one of those who reacted enthusiastically to what Mr Tusk had proposed. I believe that, if the Energy Union is right, we can not only provide optimal climate protection, that we can achieve innovation in large industrial sectors, that we can create security, security of supply, but also security with Russia and other countries on which we depend. But you have to do it right! If we put the old energy mix back in the centre, we can forget about it as a project for the future! Thanks to European generosity in subsidies, nuclear power stations are to be built in England, where the price of electricity is expected to be double to three times the current price of electricity in 45 years' time. Tell me why this is the focus of attention and not renewable energies, which are already making industrial electricity prices unrivalled low in Germany, even if the opposite is claimed! For me, the Energy Union would be what the Treaties for Coal and Steel or Euratom were to the founding fathers of the European Union. If we do this today, we must focus on the new, not on the old. This must be boring for you at some point! Or does a whole new generation of politicians really have to come before something new can be started here? Last disappointment, also towards Mr Tusk: I think it is a pity that the sanctions regime against Russia has not been bindingly linked to the implementation of Minsk. That has been postponed until the next summit. This is a weak point for the EU with regard to Russia.

When it comes to growth, this year we're going to grow a little over 1%. That's like a third of america, and that growth comes after two years of zero growth or recession.

It is easy to liquidate an entire branch of industry. It is much more difficult to rebuild such a branch and the well-being of people who have been associated with it for generations. The second point: both decarbonisation and the regional approach to creating a common energy market for my central and eastern European region pose a deadly threat and, truth be told, much less protection in terms of energy security than the current legal situation in the European Union. The same is true of the confidentiality of contracts. I would like to remind you that it is to the previous Commissioner Oettinger that we owe a better Polish in energy relations with the Russian Federation than to one of the previous Polish governments.  And now I move on to my subjects. I agree with the conclusions on Tunisia and Libya. I believe that this is the right course of approach, both for the Council and for the Commission.  As far as Russia and Ukraine are concerned, the sledging regime should be clearly linked not to control of the eastern border, but should be linked to Ukraine's regaining control of its territory, including Crimea. I would like to remind you that from September, that is, from Minsk I to February to Minsk II, the situation has actually deteriorated in this regard. And we should think about how to increase these sanctions, not reduce them.

Mr President, the President of the European Council has told us about the need for structural reforms in order to bring growth back to the Union. No one denies the need for reform. The crucial question, however, is what kind of reforms these are. Deregulation of the labour market so that labour is delivered disorganized and unarmed to capital does not lead to growth, but to recession. The flattening of social rights and the violent impoverishment of the economically weaker is not a step forward, but a step of reaction and regression.  The crucial, necessary structural reform is the fight against tax evasion and corruption, in particular the large-scale tax evasion and corruption that is being esvolved by multinational large companies. That is what our attention must focus on and that is what european Union policy must combat.  As for Greece in particular, it must be understood that the Troika's policies were largely toxic, led to a humanitarian crisis and must be corrected, as the Greek people concluded in the January elections. This must be done within the framework of European rules and the main elements of these rules are, firstly, respect for fundamental rights, including the social rights of all Europeans, and therefore for Greeks, and secondly, the inexo representative of the participation of states in the euro area.

I prefer to address the issue of energy by hoping that the European spirit and common sense prevail in solving the Greek problem. Energy is a central issue for the European Union and I am sorry that they have addressed it. According to European Commission data, 53% of this energy is imported, which is equivalent to an annual expenditure of EUR 400 billion. Still, the price of energy in the European Union is 40% more expensive than in the United States.  Portugal, like many other southern countries, believed in the sincerity of the alternative agenda, the European agenda that puts solar, wind and tidal water at the heart of its options and invested heavily to gain competitive advantages in this area. However, when they want to export, these countries run into not a physical mountain, because that technology goes beyond, but with the mountain of lack of political will of other countries and, let's be clear, the weight of some powerful lobbies like the nuclear lobbie. On 4 March, Portugal, Spain, France signed an agreement, which was mentioned here today by Jean-Claude Juncker, under his auspices, for the interconnection of at least 10% of its electricity grids and the creation of the corresponding physical networks. The interconnection target between Portugal and Spain is even higher: it is 11% in 2016 and 15% in 2020.  The last European Council recognised this agreement and said it is a welcome step towards achieving the European Union's 2020 target. The problem is that this 10% target has been reaffirmed numerous times by European leaders in recent years, with major advertising effects and no practical consequences. That is why I hope that the European Union and the Council of Ministers will now be as demanding in fulfilling this agreement as they have been with others that are much fairer and far less important and that the new investment support instruments will be considered as priorities for, after all, promises to give rise to concrete action.

Imagine President Juncker sitting opposite President Putin, Putin knowing everything about our gas contracts and Juncker knowing nothing. It is grotesque. Do we want to refuse to put our side on an equal footing with our partners who are sometimes opponents? Russia sees our cards and we do not see theirs. The European Commission has the right to know what Moscow knows about our gas contracts. Energy independence is also important and, as is regularly stressed, so is the question of sovereignty of our choices in foreign affairs, and we see dangerous cracks there, where the principle of solidarity of the Member States is under threat.

Tunisia is now a border site between civilization and barbarism. It is not the site of clash of civilizations, of a supposed Western civilization in the face of a supposed Muslim civilization. That's not what this is about.  It is truly a confrontation between civilizational values of universal expression and a barbarism that, in the name of Islam, has been imposed in that region. It was in Tunisia that the Arab Spring began and Tunisia has been the great example, the only one, unfortunately, to date, of a success in this process of democratization of an Arab society. What has happened in Tunisia in the last week, which has already been properly condemned and regretted here, must lead us to the notion that we must strengthen cooperation with Tunisia.

First of all, I want to thank Mr Nuttall for devoting all the time he had today to the tragic events yesterday in France involving the Germanwings aircraft. I think he spoke on behalf of all of us and I want to thank him warmly for that. Secondly, many of the Members of the European Parliament have addressed the issue of the Energy Union today and I just want to start by saying there is a common thread between three of the main projects of this Commission – the Juncker plan, investment, the Energy Union and the digital single market. All three of them have as goals the creation of growth and jobs in Europe and not to do this in a traditional way. Because I believe that if Europe thinks it can win in this enormous global competition on the basis of competition on wages or of competition on production costs Europe will lose. Europe can only win if it wins on innovation, if it wins on sustainability, if it wins on making an early transition into sustainable energy resources and sustainable social relations as well, because sustainability is about energy, it is about the economy and it is about social relations.  I would like you to see these three projects connected to one another on that basis. I would like to underscore what has been said by many of your Members that the Energy Union is obviously meant to protect us against blackmail from outside energy sources and producers. Obviously it has a geopolitical importance but, apart from that, it also has the huge advantage of helping us in the transition – which is inevitable – to less dependency on fossil fuels and to a greater use of the huge potential of renewable energy, which does not only contribute to a better environment but which is also a driving force in innovation and creating a new form of jobs and a new form of productivity and a new form of economy for the European continent. Very concretely on the questions regarding VAT, this legislation has come into force recently but it was decided a long time ago. The Commission is carefully evaluating it in a very pragmatic way and obviously the Commission will never want this legislation to have adverse effects on small entrepreneurs who are very often at the cutting edge of creating new employment and creating new forms of business. We will very carefully evaluate the effects. If the effects are not the effects intended by the legislation, or simply not foreseen by the legislation at the time it was drafted because the economy has developed in the digital area in particular and developed far more quickly than we could have envisaged at the time seven years ago, or if there are adverse effects, then certainly the Commission will take that into account. The two speakers on behalf of the ECR can therefore be assured that this has certainly been taken on board and that we had started on it before Prime Minister Cameron raised the issue with us, but we certainly feel encouraged by the fact that he did.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 79, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   President of the European Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, I will be very brief because I know how heavy your agenda is today so I shall say just a few words. When it comes to the questions from Ms Grossetête, Ms Van Brempt and Ms Harms, you are absolutely right that all five dimensions of the Energy Union are important. They are interconnected and mutually reinforcing no doubt, including renewables of course. But at this European Council we have focused our discussions on some of these aspects, in particular energy security, but also the so-called ‘climate diplomacy’, because of the Paris Summit. You will know better than me that the EU took strategic decisions on climate policy for the first time in 2007, and in October 2014 we decided on the framework of climate policy until 2030. We will come back to it in the European Council in view of the outcome of the conference in Paris. You can be sure that it will be one of the most important things in my whole term. And you are absolutely right: I was too brief in my introductory remarks, especially when it came to the Energy Union, but I was given just five minutes and I always try to respect the rules and I am a guest here, so sorry about that. As regards the question from Mr Verhofstadt and this problem with informal meetings in Brussels, the informal meetings in Brussels and also during European Council meetings are not my invention. In fact this is the most common method of work in Brussels. We have dozens of informal meetings every day, especially during our meetings. I can assure you that such a meeting with Mr Tsipras, Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande and the institutions was not a decisive meeting and it was absolutely clear for all of them, and also for the audience and for Member States. What made it more important was that it was a clear request from Prime Minister Tsipras and not from the largest Member States. I have heard it said that France and Germany, as the two biggest Member States, requested this meeting but that is not true. It was the clear request of the Greek Government. The second point is that in fact the leaders of the eurozone Member States asked me – even begged me – to do everything to avoid the risk of confrontation at the highest political level. In fact it is my job to avoid political crises and misunderstandings. We were certainly not ready to take the final decisions at the highest political level. This was also clear from my partners in the eurozone. Regarding Russia, I would like to recall a short part of our conclusion. The European Council agreed that the duration of the restrictive measures against the Russian Federation, adopted on 31 July 2014 and enhanced on 8 September 2014, should be clearly linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk Agreements. You know my position and my opinion but, believe me, this is the highest common denominator today among the 28 Member States. I am in complete agreement with you that perhaps we need a more ambitious and more proactive policy towards Russia and Ukraine but today this kind of agreement is what is in fact possible. I am sure that we should not downplay the significance of these conclusions. There was a very tough discussion about complete implementation. My feeling is that these conclusions about sanctions are relatively tough if I compare them to the mood or atmosphere among some Member States. I feel responsible for this conclusion but I also feel satisfied. I know that in politics almost everything is about impressions and not about facts but, in this case – I mean Russia and Ukraine but also in the case of the Greek crisis – I think the facts are much more important than impressions. I am quite sure that the results of our meeting regarding these two very difficult issues are quite satisfactory.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 80, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Unfortunately, energy poverty has also increased during the economic crisis, because heating bills, electricity are huge and not all people are able to pay for them.

In addition, energy security can be strengthened by ensuring stable networks, more efficient use of energy and using local resources and secure and sustainable low-carbon technologies.

The European Council held an exchange of views on the economic situation in Europe and on the implementation of major structural reforms by Member States.

On the subject of energy and the energy union, the commitments, although positive, remain fairly vague for the time being.

I agree with the encouragement of the greatest possible interconnection of European energy networks (in particular gas and electricity lines). Many Member States are severely dependent on energy from certain third countries, which significantly reduces their margins in energy procurement. A country's independence depends to a large extent on its energy dependency, so diversification of energy supplies must be in the fundamental interest of all EU Member States. The important thing is that the EU can provide substantial support for the interconnection of energy networks. It is not a good sign that the so-called \"1990s\" To finance the Juncker Investment Package, the Commission would realrare a significant amount from the budget of the European Network Finance Facility, which finances the achievement of this objective.  On the other hand, I welcome the fact that the Communication sets out as a priority objective the development of energy efficiency and the strong incentive for the transition to renewable energy production. However, the Commission should refrain from taking any action to prevent the use of renewable energies. For example, we should not limit the planting of useful types of wood that provide biomass raw material, the production of first-generation bioethanol produced from surplus yields, or support for combustion-efficient biomass boilers.  Finally, I do not agree with the significant involvement of agriculture in the scope of the greenhouse gas emission reduction target.

A better law guaranteeing energy security is needed, free from existing lobbying influence. Security based on increased energy efficiency and the use of local energy sources is the only recipe for Europe to regain global competitiveness. The real technical efficiency index, rather than the reduction in energy use, as is clear from the current Directive, should become an essential tool for achieving climate objectives. To this end, a directive on energy use must be rewritten, taking into account the physical approach to the efficiency of conversion and generation processes, transmission (efficient networks, pipelines and storage) and end-use (construction and utility equipment).  On the other hand, gross energy efficiency calculated for individual Member States should be calculated using an indicator that takes into account the GDP of those countries (according to Eurostat) at the beginning and end of the calculation period.

Firstly, the price of energy, the affordability of energy, are sufficiently weighted in the conclusions. The text also states, at the level of principle, that the composition of a country's energy resources should be kept under national competence. Finally, it is to be welcomed that the conclusions specifically emphasise support for energy infrastructure development, which includes better use of existing networks.  Although the concrete legislative proposals implementing the framework strategy are yet to follow, the idea of an Energy Union can be fundamentally supported by these principles. Finally, with regard to the 21st UN Climate Conference, I think it is important to reiterate that the global fight against climate change can only be effective in the future if other developed countries and the major emitters currently developing make ambitious commitments comparable to the EU before the 2015 Paris Conference.

The emergence of the LuxLeaks cases during the drafting period has vindicated our view and compelled a political response. It was necessary for the Parliament to take a political position and not to pretend that nothing had happened. This annual tax report is the standard vehicle of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on tax issues. The interest shown in it by MEPs is proved by the numerous amendments tabled on the issue, urging a clear political message. There was a wide range of proposals. More specifically, we can underline the focus on issues related to the requirement for social justice in tax policies. There was widespread concern about the taxation of capital, the taxation of income resources from interest payments, dividends and security returns, as well as on the control of financial vehicles used to facilitate tax evasion. In the same vein, the financial transaction tax still remains very popular. Many colleagues made proposals on its enhancement and expansion, as well as on the use of its proceeds to augment either the EU budget or the fund for climate change and even the European Fund for Strategic Investment. Moreover, the discussion indicated the persistent concern of the Parliament about corporation taxation, especially the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) and the minimum corporate tax contributions. There were many proposals which linked taxation to the competitiveness of European firms, as well as amendments on the way in which SMEs are taxed. Finally, the Parliament is still divided between those who favour coordination and those who favour harmonisation. The recurring coordination failures – as SwissLeaks and LuxLeaks also indicate – prompted many of our colleagues to stress the importance of more harmonisation on tax issues, using the European Semester, and other issues such as access to funding for honest taxpayers. The Parliament, as indicated in the compromise process, attempted to show a responsible stance with very strong support for a set of policies for assisting the fight against aggressive tax planning, tax avoidance and tax evasion, as well as policies to minimise the tax gap. There is also widespread understanding of the necessity for good governance in tax matters, for simple tax systems and tax policies that encourage entrepreneurship, strengthen competitiveness and support SMEs, and, moreover, understanding of the social consequences of tax policies, especially for economically weaker people. There are also issues that we can discuss further in the future, so as to share common ground for common policy initiatives. These issues include a definition of tax havens, sanctions against those who assist in tax fraud, country-by-country reporting, the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, the FTT, and shifting the tax burden from labour. One of the most important contested issues concerned the automatic exchange of information for making tax ruling practices and non—transparent agreements between Member States and multinationals apparent. So, in the light of current developments and public concern, it is extremely important for the Parliament to show its firm stance against any non—transparent practice that reduces legal certainty for taxpayers and distorts intra-market competition. We welcome the Commission’s prompt proposal on tax transparency to fight tax evasion and avoidance, which stresses that the provision of information can no longer be refused on the grounds of inappropriate disclosure of information and of commercial, industrial or professional secrecy. However, we must be very sceptical so long as the set of consequences for those who do not comply is not explicitly identified. Overall, despite the disagreement, we can say that the annual tax report is clear, coherent and focused, and that it lays the basis for a relevant, timely, fair, transparent, socially responsible and business-friendly tax policy for the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 107, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Pierre MOSCOVICI", "mepid": "1983", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the opportunity to have an exchange on taxation in Europe with you. The annual report on taxation, which we are discussing today, provides a diagnosis that I fully share. The picture of corporate and personal taxation in Europe is both illegible and too inefficient. The lack of coordination of Member States' tax practices and rules poses fundamental problems for the Whole of the Union. First, tax rules too often segment the internal market in such a way that most European or foreign companies do not have full access to it and face obstacles that hinder their growth opportunities. Second, tax authorities are no longer able - or less able - to properly collect the tax they are owed. Some taxpayers engage in aggressive tax planning to take advantage of the differences and inconsistencies that exist between tax systems. Moreover, it is clear that the Member States themselves are engaged in excessive competition to attract the most mobile tax bases. Thirdly, in the face of the revelation of this inice system, which benefits the most powerful, to the detriment of all others, and which is no longer tolerated because it is no longer tolerable, consent to tax is fading. It is the very heart of the social contract between the citizen and the public authorities that is at stake. We are therefore facing a critical situation that calls for swift and far-reaching action. My goals are the same as yours. First of all, we must restore fiscal justice within the Union and the Member States. Finally, we need to create a real internal tax market, a transparent and predictable framework for businesses to invest and for consumers to regain confidence. And, finally, we need to put taxation at the service of the Union's political priorities, whether it is the digital single market - the Commission was talking about this morning - or the Energy Union. The solutions exist and some have already been known to us for several years. Their implementation will require a commitment from all and, first of all, from most Member States, which have the final say on these issues and who will have to agree on the ambitious solutions we will propose to them. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has made the fight against fraud and tax evasion a top political priority for this Commission and I would like to dwell for a moment on this point. The European Commission, as you know, has just taken a series of strong measures to improve tax transparency in the Union with, first of all, a proposal for a directive on the exchange of information on rulings or - in French - tax rulings. The aim is to make available to all Member States information on the impact of their partners' decisions on their own tax bases, which goes hand in hand with a commitment to promote transparency, beyond tax rulings, so that the European Union remains a pioneer in terms of overall tax transparency. One possibility could be - as you recommend in the annual tax report - to extend to all sectors the current requirement, made to certain industries in the European Union, to make public certain financial information country by country. This is a debate that the Commission is prepared to have with Parliament. The Commission has not yet made a decision on how best to proceed, which will require further analysis, but it intends to work hard to carry out this analysis, which remains a necessary prerequisite for future common positions. The question of where profits should be taxed is also particularly relevant in the European Union, because of its unique characteristics such as the existence of an area with a single currency and an internal market with twenty-eight different tax systems. We have our own rules, our own priorities and our own goals. The Union can draw on the useful work provided by the OECD, but it cannot rely solely on its work. The Commission's work programme for 2015 foresees that it will present, in the light of global developments, an action plan for corporate taxation in the single market, where profits will have to be taxed more systematically where value is created, to bring production closer to taxation. This action plan will help to restart discussions on the ACCIS (or CCCTB) project, which is expected to harmonize the taxable base for many companies operating at the cross-border level in the European Union. This would not only make the internal market more competitive, but also limit the possibilities of corporate tax manipulation, which is a priority for us. This should also include shorter-term actions to enable the EU to implement the solutions that have been agreed at the global level, particularly at the G20 level. It is expected that the Commission will adopt this action plan - the second phase of our approach - before the summer, at the beginning of June, I think. I am sure that your House, through the work carried out in the TAXE and ECON committees, will contribute positively to the preparation of this action plan. I would like to say a few more words on two subjects. First, the financial transaction tax. The implementation of an ambitious tax framework on national financial transactions is a priority that the Commission shares with this Parliament, as outlined by President Juncker in his policy guidelines. Indeed, the Commission encourages tax reforms that involve those who have benefited from costly rescue policies and that broaden the tax base and reduce the tax burden on labour. I welcome the fact that at the last Ecofin Council in January, the Member States participating in enhanced cooperation reiterated their desire to create the conditions for the implementation of a harmonised European national FTT framework from 1 January 2016. I also note that the Member States of Enhanced Cooperation have stated that national FTTs should be based on the broadest possible taxable basis with low rates, while taking into account their impact on the real economy and the risks of relocation. The Commission's services have always offered and will continue to offer technical support to Member States in order to reach an agreement quickly, in a spirit of openness to compromise, while defending the fundamental principles of the Commission's proposal. Finally, with regard to indirect taxes, I would like to point out that the Commission intends to present, during this mandate, a series of reforms to the VAT system to improve its functioning, to reduce its administrative burden in order, in particular, to adopt a definitive VAT regime. The Commission favours and will favour a comprehensive approach because the introduction of scattered ad hoc measures could, particularly in the light of the negotiations in the Council, lead to inconsistent solutions, or even to achieve - we know how it works - any solution.

At the same time, several large multinational companies, such as Amazon, Starbucks or IKEA, are reportedly able to pay fees of just over 1%, playing with the tax differences between the States of the European Union. By example, if my country does not get enough tax revenue to cover essential expenditure on education, health or old age support, it runs the risk of paying a fine that could rise to 0.5% of GDP for non-compliance with economic governance rules.  However, 19 of the 20 largest Portuguese companies, of which they could most contribute their tax contributions to balance these public accounts, chose to move their place of office to the Netherlands or Luxembourg in order to benefit from the tax advantages offered to them. This practice of tax dumping between countries that share the same market and the same currency becomes unbearable to citizens. The recent proposal by the European Commission makes it mandatory to exchange information between EU countries on tax optimisation practices. It is a step in the right direction that I recognise and thank Commissioner Moscovici, but it is still insufficient. There are a number of measures that need to be taken to combat tax havens, to harmonise the tax base for businesses, to report from country to country. And the effort that is being demanded of citizens also requires that we have a determination in advancing these dossiers.

Although we have harmonised taxes within the European Union, such as VAT and excise duties, and non-harmonised taxes, such as corporate and personal income taxes, both of these tax areas are very unfavourable. I would like to draw attention to only two points. VAT fraud in most EU countries is already tens of billions of euros per year and is increasing every year. Moreover, there are an increasing number of so-called carousel offences, consisting in multiplying invoices for the sale of goods or services between companies from different countries without carrying out actual transactions and on this basis vat extortion. Increasingly, Member States are defending themselves against this so-called reverse VAT fraud, but this distorts the idea of this tax.

That has changed dramatically in these days, but I cannot say that the reason for this is so positive. Unfortunately, it was all caused by LuxLeaks and we are now in a situation where ordinary citizens are all worried about the fact that they feel that they have to pay much more tax - the same goes for small business owners - than the big multinationals do. Looks like they're slipping through the cracks. I think it is very good that we are now using the momentum to take steps forward, and that at least requires us to know exactly what we are talking about.

What we have seen in recent years, particularly in the crisis years, and this becomes more shocking associated with austerity, has been in the name of competitiveness a huge fall in capital tax, whether in profits or in revenues. In the name of so-called fiscal consolidation, we have seen an incredible increase in the tax rate of both labour and consumption, which, coupled with austerity and recession, has only had very devastating consequences for the periphery of the euro zone. And the result is that, when it's as far as the distribution of income and wealth is, we've become increasingly unequal. We have also seen aggressive tax practices, we have seen scandals associated with tax avoidance and fraud, as well as tax evasion, and we have seen that Lux Leaks is just the tip of the iceberg. European Commission figures show that European citizens lose a trillion euros a year as a result of tax avoidance practices. As we have seen, every year too, there is a permanent injustice. Nineteen of the twenty largest companies in Portugal moved their head to the Netherlands or Luxembourg so as not to pay so much tax. We are in fact witnessing tax dumping.

As corporations and wealthy individuals have found ever more intricate ways to avoid paying their fair share, taxation has become divorced from economic activity and, as a result, public coffers have been starved of revenue and governments have been unable to invest in necessary infrastructure or provide support for their needy citizens. We have reached the stage where it is vital for the protection of our civilised societies that we address the issue of tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. Tax avoidance is also undermining the single market, as the Commissioner pointed out. Transnational corporations are able to cut sweetheart deals with governments and to organise transfer pricing deals that could never be possible for the small businesses that are the backbone of our local communities across the European Union. In our role as the voice of small business and strong local economies, Greens demand that completing the single market should include the requirement of fair taxation across the Union, to ensure fair competition between small businesses and multinationals. In November last year, after the emergence into the public domain of the scandalous deals that had been agreed by President Juncker while he was Prime Minister of Luxembourg, there was a motion for the removal of the whole Commission. However, in spite of deep concerns about certain Commissioners, the Greens’ position was that they should be given a chance to resolve these problems before being dismissed. We challenged Juncker to ‘act or go’. Last week, we saw the Commission’s proposed action and it will not surprise you to know that we were deeply disappointed. The proposal on information exchange between Member States is necessary and welcome, clarifying an obligation which has existed since the 1970s but which has not been properly applied. If it had been applied, it would have ensured that scandalous ‘tax rulings’ could not have been kept concealed. However, this is only one of a number of measures that could and should be introduced to improve transparency on taxation. So I am pleased to welcome the many strong statements focused on addressing the issue of tax competition and tax avoidance included in this year’s annual tax report, especially the repeated call for a compulsory common consolidated tax base. I also welcome the establishment of the special committee to investigate tax affairs across the union. However, as a Green, I was deeply disappointed that, in this year that will culminate in the Paris negotiations on climate change, our most important amendments – calling for ecological taxation, the ending of tax advantages and exemptions granted to the aviation industry, and the phasing out of other fossil fuel subsidies – were rejected.

I therefore very much welcome the Commission's initiative and the proposal, which, in my opinion, is a first step towards sorting out this area by exchanging mandatory information on tax decisions. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kaili, for preparing a balanced report. However, there is one controversial subject that I want to say a few words about. In paragraph 25, she proposes that the European Commission consider introducing minimum corporate tax rates in order, and I quote, to 'reduce harmful tax competition between Member States'. I think it's a bad idea, for several reasons. Firstly, Member States are at different levels of economic development: some are able to offer very good business conditions, others simply do not have such resources. This applies to infrastructure or public services, government.

I have to say I was very concerned that the Commission’s communication was lukewarm in relation to country-by-country reporting of profits by multinationals. The Parliament has long supported this measure, and I hope that the Commission will let us continue with our internal work promoting it. I also hope that the Commission will be publicly more supportive of immediate action to move ahead with country-by-country reporting. We already have evidence that there is no negative impact from country-by-country reporting in relation to extracting industries and banking. We also know it would have a positive impact on SMEs, who at the moment are not competing on a level playing field with those firms who can shift their profits and hide where economy activity is truly occurring.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you, each of you, for all your contributions. What I take away from this debate is, first of all, a very great convergence of views on the objectives. All of us, whatever our preferences, want to put in place fairer and more efficient taxation in the Union. We want to put in place a transparent and predictable framework for EU companies to compete in global markets. We want to give the tax administrations of the Member States the means to exercise the prerogatives that are theirs and which are now weakened. That is the message I will send to the finance ministers and that we must all pass on to national governments, which, as you know, have an essential role to play in this area - the rule of unanimity is a rule that complicates things - if we want Europe to remain credible in this area. I will make three brief remarks, in telegraphic style. Firstly, in response to some observations, I can tell you that my conviction is that what we are proposing is substantial and that, in terms of transparency in particular, the progress of the package I am going to present next week marks - I do not hesitate to say this - a form of a new era for the European Union: never before has such an ambitious approach been proposed. , which goes far beyond, in fact, the arsenal we have had since 1977.  I would add that this is, of course, a first phase and not an end in itself. The Commission will present a second package before the summer which will include both measures for competitiveness and which will include new steps towards transparency, which I have said is ready to study with you. I mentioned country by country report. Second, it is true that we do not act only for ourselves. We are doing this in a global framework, including the OECD BEPS initiative, as part of the G20 initiative, and I would like to see collaborations with other countries outside the European Union.  I will mention, for example, in an area other than the one we are dealing with today, the agreement on the automatic exchange of banking information, which was signed last week with Switzerland and which will be concluded this summer. It is a real revolution, again, that marks the future end of banking secrecy, in a great country where we know that in this case it has a certain image. Thirdly, I want to assure you of my determination to make a difference, to rely without hesitation on the demands of a public opinion which, today, no longer tolerates certain injustices or practices, to put Member States before their responsibilities. To do this, of course, we need to work together, almost hand in hand, to do this. That is why I will be listening to your proposals. This is also why the work that your Assembly is carrying out in the ECON and TAXE committees on this subject plays an essential role both in terms of public awareness of the current state of taxation in the Union and in defining the solutions to be implemented.

The Commission has presented its 'tax package', which aims to make European taxation more transparent. One of the key measures of this initiative is the introduction of automatic exchange of information between EU Member States. If we succeed in getting this measure passed, it will be an essential tool in the fight against tax evasion. I would like to point out that every year tax evasion causes Member States to lose EUR 1 trillion. The fifty largest European companies have domiciled one fifth of their subsidiaries in tax havens. These are billions of euros that are hidden and do not return to the coffers of the states where these companies make profits. A political response is therefore crucial to address this problem. For the Socialists, the tax is fair when it is fairly distributed in order to allow society to make investments that serve the community: roads, schools, hospitals,... Moreover, when this tax is levied mainly on the backs of workers when speculators and large fortunes do not sufficiently participate in the collective effort, this is problematic.

However, a much bigger problem is that such actions mean that fair competition rules are being distorted.

Beyond obvious excesses in tax adjudication, which cannot be justified (no matter who does them and how), these exercises have actually targeted the financial services sectors of a number of EU Member States. Most of them, with the exception of the UK, are among the European minnows. Suddenly it seems as if countries which specialise in the provision of financial services should be considered a threat to the integrity of the EU. A recalibration of this approach is needed. The fact is that financial services remain necessary in a globalising world which has accepted neoliberal rules when ensuring that financial flows across nations and continents are managed efficiently.

We are voting for EUR 1.8 billion of macro-financial aid to Ukraine, which will be the biggest financial package given by the European Union to any third country. But that alone is not as important as the political message that the European Union is united in its effort to help Ukraine and to back it when the help is most needed. It has to be noted that our friends as well as our adversaries are looking for cracks in our unity. Ukraine needs our unity in order to sustain clear reasoning for their reforms. Just yesterday, we had an opportunity to talk to the Ukrainian Minister of the Economy. He gave us a cold but clear overview on the reforms that his Ministry and the Government are undertaking. Fighting the oligarchic structures, battling corruption and addressing inefficiency in the public sector are just a few of the points that he raised. It seemed to me that even the critics should have been convinced that Ukraine is doing its utmost to reform itself. It is chilling to imagine any of our countries going through those sorts of reforms, actually changing dramatically many fields of life that people were accustomed to. That was one reason why a colleague asked if the Minister is sure that the people of Ukraine will keep up with and support the pace of the reforms. We were reassured that, with a clear message from Europe that Europe is standing by them, the people will support and understand the need for reform.  Our foes would rejoice if they saw us disunited and would use it for their propaganda. We already know what they would say: ‘See, Europe cannot help the country that itself wished to sign an association agreement!’ The Council, the Commission, the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) are all calling for agreement on the proposed report without amendments, for one main reason. That reason is that time is of crucial importance here. If we vote ‘yes’ on the report today, the Commission will be able to issue the first tranche of the funds to Ukraine at the beginning of the summer. If we want the country, which is still fighting for its territory, to be able to stabilise its budget and economy, we have to agree on providing the funds as soon as possible. Of course, I have heard critics say that we are not sure whether the money will be used transparently or whether there are enough incentives for reform in the report. I believe, at this stage, that the Commission has provided for enough controls in the document that would be signed with Ukraine after our vote and following approval by the Council. We are, and will remain, in close contact with the Support Group for Ukraine regarding the reforms and regarding transparency in relation to the funds provided. When the situation in Ukraine stabilises, and I want to believe that it will, we will come back to the debate on how we can help Ukraine on its path to reform.

I would also like to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) for its contribution. As you know, the Commission submitted its proposal for a macro-financial assistance operation for Ukraine in the context of the enormous political and security challenges in Ukraine, and a deteriorating economic situation.  Ukraine is confronted by deep recession: its currency has depreciated strongly, inflation has been rising and international reserves have been declining. This shows that the situation is very acute, and Ukraine badly needs international financial assistance as soon as possible. Indeed, international donors led by the IMF have wrapped up a new financial aid package for Ukraine, with the most recent IMF extended fund facility, of 11 March 2015, amounting to USD 17.5 billion. The EU is also contributing with its current Commission proposal for macro-financial assistance (MFA) of EUR 1.8 billion in addition to the previous MFA operations of EUR 1.6 billion in loans. It is intended that this MFA operation will be disbursed in three equal tranches, and this is going to be the highest amount of assistance ever disbursed to a third country in such a short period of time. Of course, a new MFA operation will be subject to the fulfilment of conditions, namely political preconditions concerning respect for democratic mechanisms, human rights and the rule of law. Moreover, Ukraine must satisfactorily implement the IMF programme and, last but not least, must fulfil economic and financial policy conditions to be agreed between the EU and Ukraine in a memorandum of understanding. In this context, potential policy measures in the areas of public finance management, anti-corruption and transparency, the business environment, energy sector reform and financial sector reform are being explored and will be discussed with our Ukrainian partners. I would stress that timing is of the essence here. Ukraine’s most urgent and important financing needs are in 2015, and the first two of the three tranches under the newly proposed MFA operation should be disbursed this year – i.e. the first tranche before the summer break in mid-2015. Contrary to its proposal for last year’s MFA operation of EUR 1 billion, which was based on the urgency procedure, with a Council decision as provided for in Article 213 of the Treaty, the Commission has based the present proposal on Article 212 of the Treaty, which provides for a decision under the ordinary legislative procedure. The current Commission proposal follows precisely established practice for MFA operations – practice also reflected in the Joint Declaration of Parliament and the Council of 12 August 2013 on granting MFA. In view of Ukraine’s urgent financial needs, swift adoption of the current proposal by the co-legislators under the ordinary legislative procedure is very important. Therefore, I am pleased that the International Trade and Foreign Affairs committees upheld the Commission proposal without amendments. I am also pleased that the Council, through Coreper, today agreed to adopt the Commission’s proposal without amendments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 166, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Jacek SARYUSZ-WOLSKI", "mepid": "28297", "text": "   draftss author of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. – Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work.

Therefore, if the European Union has embarked on a path of full support for Ukraine, we must show that we are willing and ready to help and that we can act quickly, responsibly and stand by our political and economic commitments.

I also highlight the fruitful effectiveness of a common and coordinated approach in delivering a holistic assistance plan that can, indirectly, be a catalyst for the mobilisation of additional funding.

Our relations with Ukraine are developing within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and we must support the government's efforts on the reform path.  The military conflict, which has led to the violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity, is detrimental to the Ukrainian economy. Much of it was focused on Russia's annexed Crimea peninsula, as well as in the region held by the separatists Donetskaya and Luhansk. As a result, the country's economy has shrunk by more than 20% in the past year, and the direct budgetary costs of the conflict further worsen Ukraine's balance of payments and liquidity.  In this context, I consider the granting of financial assistance to be a fully timely measure, because the country's external financing needs are significantly greater than initially determined.

I remember that, on that occasion, we said that Libya was definitely one of the main problems we have to deal with in our neighbourhood, and that this applies not only to European countries but also to Libya’s neighbouring countries, starting with Tunisia. And here we are, some weeks later, discussing that fragile situation which is even more evident after the attack which took place last week. Tunisia is a very special neighbour for us. First of all, it is a neighbour which demonstrates that democracy, freedom and inclusive politics can be the future for the region. I was very impressed by the words of a boy participating in the demonstrations just after the attack in Tunis, who said that what terrifies the terrorists is ‘us’ – referring to his generation of Tunisian people in that street. The best response we can give to the attack that took place, and to the fragility of Tunisia, is to support that boy, that girl, those Tunisians of all ages who were in the streets reacting to the attack – just as French citizens, together with others, reacted to the attack in January in Paris – all the Tunisians, especially the younger generation, who believe in a free, democratic, open future for the country. The day before the attack, we were here in Brussels, together with the Foreign Minister of Tunisia, for the Association Council between the European Union and Tunisia. We were doing two things. On the one hand, we were discussing, as we do among partners, the positive developments in the country in the last year – the adoption of a new constitution, legislative elections, presidential elections, a unity government – and also the elements that make Tunisia fragile still: its youth, which is highly educated but has very low employment rates and very poor employment experiences; the place in society for young people and for young girls in particular in Tunisia; the fact that some steps in the democratic process still need to be taken – I am thinking of the local elections due to take place later this year; the differences – the cleavages – between different parts of the country, in which different regions have huge differences of income, social conditions and economic conditions; a sense of disparity within the country (we were even discussing the possibility of promoting twinnings between some regions or cities in Tunisia and some regions or cities in the European Union); and also the security challenge for the country. The security challenge comes, first of all, from the fact that Tunisia is one of the countries, if not the country, in the region where the number of foreign fighters is highest, around 3 000; but it also comes from the situation in Libya and the issue of border control. But apart from discussing all these things, we were also doing something else with the Foreign Minister of Tunisia. We were signing cooperation agreements together to open up European Union programmes to Tunisians: those Tunisian young people, enterprises, students or researchers who are willing, or who aspire, to participate in European Union programmes in an open way, opening the way for strong cooperation. We also discussed our next high-level visit from the European Union after my own visit – I visited Tunisia the week after the new Government took office in February – and the fact that next Tuesday we will visit the country with President Tusk. The day after the attack I had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Tunisia. We exchanged condolences – from my side for the Tunisian victims and for the attack on the heart of the country, and he expressed his condolences to me in the sense of the European Union, as many of the victims were Europeans. But he basically told me one thing: that they were doing all they could to react, to make sure that this attack did not interrupt their process, which was still fragile and difficult but which was on track, and that they needed to be supported by friends, and they saw the EU countries as their main friends. I passed this message to the European Council which was taking place on the same day, and which opened with a minute of silence. I shared with the Heads of State and Government the concrete elements of our effort to be a special friend to Tunisia in these difficult times, and our effort to increase cooperation. This is about four different levels of increasing cooperation: security cooperation, financial support, support for the economy with concrete, immediate measures, and regional cooperation focusing on Libya. Let me go quickly through these four issues, starting with security cooperation. Obviously security is at the heart of a democracy and of a democratic system, but the converse is also true. Security can be sustained only with a genuine democratic process respecting human rights and the rule of law, and we know that one strengthens the other. Democracy strengthens security and security strengthens democracy. That is why, from the European Union side, we are engaged in three different reviews in Tunisia: one on justice, one on border management and the third on security-sector reform. Actions on border management will start shortly, and a very ambitious security-sector reform programme, addressing counter terrorism, among other challenges, is now in its very final stage of preparation – this will include EUR 25 million. We are also working with our Tunisian partners to support the reform of their justice sector. We know that we need to do much more, especially at the present time. The EU counter-terrorism coordinator was in Tunis, at my request, just a few days before the attack, and started discussing with his counterparts areas of cooperation, including a counter-terrorism dialogue and a package of measures that will soon be finalised and, we hope, will be implemented in the coming months. It is important that in this process we keep the partnership on a completely equal level and that we discuss and decide everything with our Tunisian partners. However, we know that supporting Tunisia’s stability requires not only security. It means mainly – and I stressed this in my public messages as strongly as I could – supporting the economic and democratic transition. This is what will make Tunisia stronger. How do we do that? First, through financial assistance. Since 2011 the European Union has more than doubled the initial commitments to Tunisia. For last year alone – 2014 – nearly EUR 170 million was allocated to Tunisia, and micro—financial assistance of up to EUR 300 million in loans comes in addition to that. Financial allocations for 2015 have not yet been completely decided, but we are working with Commissioner Hahn to make sure that Tunisia gets what it needs and what it deserves, and that is also in our own interests. But beyond financial assistance, there are concrete measures – sometimes even creative measures – that we have to put in place to accompany Tunisia along its path of strengthening democracy and the economy. A true progressive integration of the Tunisian economy into the European internal market, supporting the economic model that was chosen by Tunisia and in the manner and pace suited to its own economy: this could be one element. The European Union is ready – and we started discussing this with the new Tunisian authorities last month – to start negotiations for a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement with Tunisia. It is probably also important to give a positive sign to investors, so that they can find ways of supporting economic recovery in the country. This will obviously bring results in the medium and long term, but we also have an urgent need to support Tunisia immediately. Earlier this year we adjusted our monthly import quotas on olive oil – something very small, but something very important for Tunisia – and we can do more in this respect. The Commission is also starting to work on Tunisia’s application to be associated with the Horizon 2020 research programme. These are only examples – and others will follow – of where we can make a difference completely and immediately. The fourth level of cooperation is, obviously, in relation to Libya. On one side there is the border issue, on the other side there is the bigger Libya issue that affects the situation in Tunisia. I expect some speakers will return to that, so maybe I will leave more for my replies in the end, but you know – and we discussed this in Strasbourg last time – that we are increasing the level of our commitment and of our engagement in diplomatic work. Just two days ago here in Brussels, I myself hosted a meeting of 34 mayors from various cities in Libya. Listening to them, I heard on the one side a desperation that only mayors can understand, facing their own people in very difficult situations. Most of those cities were bombed while we were meeting. But on the other side there was a strong, passionate, emotional feeling of needing to move forward and finding the political agreement that could allow Libya to restart. That meeting produced good results in terms of concrete cooperation and confidence-building measures, and also an appeal to the political track to produce a result. You know that a plan to establish a new political framework is currently being discussed, not only in Rabat but also in Tobruk, Tripoli and other cities, and I think – and it is also the view of our Tunisian friends – that this will be the only way to solve the Libyan crisis. Let me add one more thing before I finish, and this is about you, honourable Members, and Tunisia. Parliamentary cooperation is also an essential part of the support that Tunisia is looking for. It is a country where your engagement can have a huge impact. The two European Union electoral observation missions in 2011 and in 2014, and the European Parliament contribution to the ongoing EU project assisting the Tunisian parliament, were really significant for them, and also for us. I look forward to the establishment of the Joint Parliamentary Committee with Tunisia, which is provided for in the action plan for a privileged partnership. The European Parliament, by strengthening its links with the new parliament, can certainly play a key role in reinforcing Tunisian democracy. I think we all saw the images of Tunisian Members of Parliament singing their hymn inside the Parliament during the attack, just as they were working on an anti-terrorism law. Our debate today is also our way of standing together with them and saying to all Tunisians – not only the Members of Parliament but starting with them – and to the rest of the world and the region, that they will never be alone, and that if they turn towards us to look for friends, we will be there ready to support them.

The attack on the Bardo Museum targeted the country in the region, which has made real efforts to turn the promises of the Arab Spring into reality. Beyond the innocent victims, the attack was therefore aimed at hitting the Tunisian democratic transition itself, a transition that is a political and institutional scenario unique in the Arab world. But make no mistake, the Tunis attack is not only an attack on our partner but also an attack on Europe.  First of all, it is obvious, because the majority of victims are European citizens. Secondly, because the security of the Mediterranean is also our security. Finally, because the attack on the Bardo Museum is an attack on our values: tolerance and fundamental freedoms. Daesh claimed responsibility for this attack, once again confronting us with the barbarity of an ideology built on a political interpretation of Islam and on the rejection of the other. The same barbarism and intolerance that struck Yemen last Friday. The same barbarism and intolerance that struck Christians in Pakistan, victims of suicide bombings, on 15 March. In the face of all this, we must more than ever stand firm in the defence of our values, fight together against terrorism and fanaticism, with our partners and, first and foremost, with Tunisia. We have supported the democratic transition of this country from the beginning and we must not abandon it in these critical times. There is a need for real international support and I look forward to hearing from the High Representative on all the dimensions of this cooperation, which absolutely needs to be strengthened.

In the exchange of views I had with the various interlocutors, I sensed the awareness that Tunisia could be an ideal target for a terrorist attack. This country which initiated the Arab Spring is also the most advanced country on the road to democratic transition and the ability of the political forces to create, not without a lively dialectic, a modern Constitution and a unity government, after the elections a few months ago, can only be positively underlined.  For our part, we must be equally aware that Tunisia has been affected precisely because a successful outcome to this experiment would be a point of reference for the whole region and for the whole of Europe, because that would be the greatest demonstration that it is possible to secure a democratic and free future in an Arab country. This is not acceptable to terrorists, because their objective is chaos throughout the Mediterranean region. That is why we can only agree with what the President of the Republic of Tunisia said: terrorism is not just a problem for Tunisia, it concerns everyone. It is also because many European tourists were killed in the attack on the Bardo museum, and this has had a twofold consequence: on the one hand, the raising of the level of fear, which is already very high for the events in Libya, and, on the other, a negative impact on Tunisia's image with objective devastating consequences – I am thinking in particular of the economic revenues from tourism.  If this is clear to us, then we need a few words and many concrete actions. Today, not tomorrow! More than ever, Europe has a decisive role to play vis-à-vis Tunisia on two fronts. Firstly, we need political support for democratic institutions and forces by acting institutionally and civilly, in order to strengthen the antibodies capable of dealing with the increasingly pervasive threat of the Islamic State – and here, as the High Representative mentioned, there is, of course, our task, too, of the European Parliament. And then we need a substantial financial contribution, now, along the lines of what we gave Ukraine a few minutes ago in terms of financial assistance. This is the first test of the new neighbourhood policy, of its ability to be flexible and to identify priorities, and I have no doubt that for us, for socialists and democrats, Tunisia is today the priority.  Madam High Representative, I am aware of your sensitivity, but I would ask you to be involved in our request and to make possible as soon as possible, in addition to the things you have said, a political decision by the European Commission and the Council by giving a concrete follow-up to the Association Council that took place on 17 May, precisely in order to ensure that these events respond effectively to the problems we have in Tunisia today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 211, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Charles TANNOCK", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, firstly on behalf of the ECR I would like to extend my condolences and prayers to the families and the victims of the 18 March Bardo museum shooting in Tunis.

I would like to remind you that the High Representative stated in the same debate that the situation in Libya and North Africa is a priority of the European Union together with that of Ukraine. However, this equal priority does not seem to be reflected ely in economic terms or in political terms. In particular, two-thirds of the funds of the European Neighbourhood Instrument go to the eastern region of Europe, with a population of just over 12 million, while the southern region, with a population of 22 million, is not given the same attention. This highlights the imbalance of priorities.  But the situation in the southern part of the Union is extreme. The European Neighbourhood Policy needs to be urgently revised to ensure in a balanced manner the Union's ongoing and in-depth commitment to its eastern and southern partners.  In the specific case of Tunisia, last week's terrorist attack, in addition to seeking to derail its fledgling democracy, has sought to harm its most important productive sector, tourism. We cannot forget that Tunisia is the only country where the democratic transition has been genuine: in no other Arab country is there an Islamist government that has won and lost power in free elections; there is no other State on the southern shore of the Mediterranean – the southern border of the European Union – other than today a religious or military autocracy, except Tunisia; and the Islamic State, which we are far from defeating, is knocking on your door.

This approach based on the idea that all the evils of the Middle East were the result of the existence of a handful of dictators has generated monsters such as the organization of the Islamic State.

Shortly after the attack, you, THE EU's foreign affairs representative, assured the Tunisian Government of its support, referring not only to security measures, but also to the economic and democratic development of the country, and have once again explained this in great detail here today. It is important that we in Europe show our solidarity with Tunisia at this difficult time. However, we must also translate our words into action and be prepared to provide adequate resources to support Tunisia more than we have done so far. Support must ensure that this attack does not become a setback for the country's transformation process, but that Tunisia can continue to develop into a democratic model of success in the region. Thousands of Tunisians have taken to the streets in the past week. During the protests, a central slogan of the Jasmine Revolution of 2011 was again used in a modified form. The shout \"We are not afraid!\" became \"We are not afraid of terrorism!\". Given the global threat posed by jihadists, this should be a central message not only for Tunisia, but for the entire region and also for Europe. \"We are not afraid of terrorism!\" should also be seen as a warning against hasty measures and overreactions.

I also visited its museums, this wonderful Bardo and its collection of mosaics, which bear witness to three millennia of exchanges and relations between Europe and North Africa. Why Tunisia, then? Because some want to destroy its tourism and its economy, to stifle its democracy and the voice of young Tunisian citizens. To plunge the country into anarchy, defending positions of strength with the flames of violence. To make it seem, with terror, that there is no possible coexistence between Islam and democracy. And that interest is not just that of the terrorists, unfortunately. If we fall into the trap of the clash of civilizations or religions, this fallacious rhetoric will win.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by responding to Mr Mas's report. Borghezio. The issue of border control between Tunisia and Libya was exactly one of the points we discussed with the Tunisian Foreign Minister the day before the attack on the Bard. And he said at that meeting that Tunisia has no interest and no intention of sealing its borders with Libya. I am used, with respect for a country, first and foremost to respecting the decisions of its authorities, especially when it is one of the countries that has experienced a successful democratic transition. So the first basis, the first principle of our support for Tunisia, must be respect for the autonomous decisions that the Tunisian authorities take and will take, because it is clear that the challenge is common.  It is also clear that these are not clashes of religions or civilisations, because the victims were together Europeans, not Europeans, Tunisians, Muslims, Christians and atheist, and it is also clear that the attack was both an attack on Europe and an attack on Tunisia. So here there is no confrontation between north and south of the Mediterranean: here there is a common, patient, difficult and concrete work to be done together between the two shores of the Mediterranean against violence and terrorism.

But we will only win the challenge – and this is what our Tunisian friends tell us – if we can really invest in the younger generation of Tunisia by offering jobs, by offering a place in society, by offering dignity, which was what young Tunisians were asking for by starting the revolution years ago: dignity! I believe that this is our task, that of respectfully supporting a path that is specific to Tunisia, with all the means we have, but with respect and dignity. There have been a number of speeches which have raised a number of specific points, and I will mention two of them. One concerns the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy. This was one of the points that we discussed with Tunisia just the day before the attack. This is the subject we will have on the agenda of a meeting in Barcelona on 13 April with our neighbours on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, as well as with our eastern partners later in May. The review of the European Neighbourhood Policy can be an exceptional tool for us and our partners, if we do not take it as a bureaucratic review, as an internal exercise; it can really be the time to think together, in that spirit of mutual respect, what tools can be most useful to us together, to face the challenges that today are different from those that were there ten years ago.  And in the South there is certainly the challenge of the stability of the region, there is the challenge of terrorism, there is the challenge of the absence or fragility of state institutions and there is the challenge of Libya, which is not just a Libyan challenge because, as some of you have said, the victims are all the same, and I agree. The victims are all the same: we were referring to other attacks that had killed other victims and on which we react less, I agree very much. The victims are all the same and they are all important and I would like to say a word today, here, also about the victims that are in other parts of the world, sometimes very close to Tunisia: I am thinking of Nigeria, I am thinking of what is happening in Yemen. This is not the subject of this evening, but we must be careful first of all not to apply double standards in our condemnations, in our reaction, and we must also be careful that regional crises do not stop – and here I would like to refer to the invitation made to me by one of you to call for answers, not unilateral but within the multilateral framework. Well, I take up this appeal. It is a work that we are doing on a daily basis and laboriously together with the United Nations, together with the Arab League, together with our regional partners. I believe that it is particularly important at this time for all actors, particularly in the region, to act responsi responsi responsily, not only in Libya but also on Yemen.  We need a regional framework that, together with the multilateral and international framework, together with the United Nations, together with the European Union, will be able not only to react but also to act by seeking sustainable solutions in the long term, because it is all too often the case that a way of 'solving', in many quotation marks, a crisis turns into a new crisis years later. Then we must be forward-looking and understand how, starting with Libya, but not only on Libya, we are able to prevent future crises and also prevent terrorism in the region. One last note I want to make is with respect to the allocation of the funds. Some people have referred to an unfair division: two thirds for the East and a third for the South. It is an unwritten rule but it is an unwritten rule in reverse: two thirds of the funds are normally allocated to the South, one third to the East. This is an issue that can clearly always be discussed, but I wanted to clarify this fact, which is the case at the moment, not the other way round.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI", "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 218, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr One of my strongest memories of last year's EU election campaign is a phone call from a priest in Sweden. She expressed her despair at the social distress that prevailed in the large parking lot outside her city. There are rows of trucks lined up, waiting for new runs. Meanwhile, the drivers live and live in their cars. They have difficulty with food and hygiene, make fires in the parking lots or warm themselves in small spirit kitchens in the Swedish winter cold. They have no salary, no collective bargaining agreement – just their waiting. This is unworthy. The haulage industry has major problems with unfair competition. From countries with lower wages and poorer conditions, permanent domestic traffic is operated in countries where higher wages and better conditions apply. People are forced to work in unacceptable conditions, while serious haulage companies are being knocked out. Most Member States have collectively negotiated or statutory minimum wages, including for the transport sector. Some Member States also apply them to, for example, foreign hauliers, in terms of minimum wages and administrative requirements, such as prior authorisation, when carrying out road transport abroad, at transit speed such as international transport or cabotage. I would therefore like to ask the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the following questions: firstly, what regulations of European law and national law does the Commission consider to apply to lorry drivers and other workers providing services on the way through or in another Member State? As regards terms of employment and applicable law in transit or the territory of the host Member State? To what extent can domestic regulations apply to foreign transport activities? Question two: how does the Commission view such transport activities in terms of terms of employment and the law applicable to the employment relationship at the time of the provision of the service, including the Posting of Workers Directive and the Rome I Regulation? Question three: what measures does the Commission intend to take to protect the social rights of workers in the road transport sector? The EU's objective of achieving a liberalised internal market will never be realised unless the Commission also dares to recognise the problems, the very serious problems, caused by the EU regulatory framework.

Each and every symptom of social unfairness and unfair competition must be combatted. However, prevention is the best means of redress. Let me stress that the Commission welcomes the introduction of minimum wages at national level. They are fully in line with the social policy commitment of this Commission. However, it goes without saying that national measures on a minimum wage applicable to the transport sector must be applied in a manner which is fully compatible with EU law, notably the Treaty principles on free movement of goods and freedom to provide services. This implies, inter alia, that the measures should be non-discriminatory, and that any restriction of such freedom should be justified having regard to the principle of proportionality. The Commission understands that the first questions to be raised in that respect concern the recently introduced scheme operated by Germany. The Commission is assessing thoroughly the German rules on minimum wages and their impact on the transport sector and on the proper functioning of the internal market, taking into account in particular the information provided recently by the German authorities’ response to the Commission’s inquiry. Therefore, I am not yet in a position at this stage of the procedure to provide precise answers to Parliament’s questions. The legal assessment is complex, as it involves basic EU Treaty principles, in particular in relation to the freedom just mentioned, but also several pieces of legislation, notably the Posting of Workers directive. In addition, the measures also need to be analysed in the context of regulations which liberalise the road transport market, Regulation nos 1072/2009 and 2073/2009. The Commission will decide on further steps based on the results of this comprehensive assessment, and will inform Parliament of its position as soon as possible. Mr President, honourable Members, let me turn to the third question and share with you the Commission’s vision for improving social and working conditions in transport, in particular road transport. The Commission is fully committed to promoting fair social standards and fair working and business conditions. These three elements are crucial to creating a sound framework for more and better jobs in the sector. It is also of the utmost importance that the current legislation at both EU and national level is fully and equally understood and applied across the EU. This concerns all stakeholders including Member States, shippers, drivers, freight forwarders and other operators active in transport. With a view to completing the existing framework in line, notably, with the aspects just mentioned, the Commission is currently considering new measures which could be presented in a ‘road package’ in 2016.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 231, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "David CASA", "mepid": "28122", "text": "  f'isem group PPE. – Il-kwistjoni li għandna quddiemna hija waħda li tippreokkupa l-isfera Ewropea minn żmien għal żmien.

No one in the whole of Europe is questioning this. The same must apply to minimum wages. Where Europe-wide rules are lacking, the Member States have the right to take matters into their own hands. This is clearly confirmed by the Posting of Workers Directive, the Rome I Regulation and also numerous ECJ rulings. We Social Democrats want equal pay for equal work in the same place in the transport sector, but also in all other sectors. Then there is the accusation that minimum wages would ruin companies. No, wrong! Companies are ruining businesses. Namely those who engage in wage and social dumping on the backs of workers and at the expense of responsible companies. This greed for profit is to blame for the fact that everything must also be controlled. This has nothing to do with bureaucracy, but it protects honest companies from fraudsters and workers from exploitation.  I have been in close contact with truck drivers for many years, with transport companies all over Europe. What I am experiencing is partly modern slavery. Drivers who drive criss-crossing Europe, stay in the trucks, meet their daily needs at rest stops, and are away from home for months. There were already wages of up to 300 euros a month. This must not be the common business model in Europe. That is why minimum wages must apply everywhere and for everyone, without exceptions, without loopholes.

Germany may have forgotten that 10 years ago he was the sick man of Europe, but if Germany decides to damage its economy, it is its problem and its business. However, Germany is abusing the minimum wage to foreclosure its market: this is contrary to the single free market. The Minimum Wage Act is discriminatoryly set because it unfairly burdens only foreign carriers, not domestic carriers, who do not have these obligations, by over-administration. Moreover, diets must not be part of the minimum wage, which means that in the end a foreign carrier has to pay more than the German one – this is further discrimination. Such a practice is incorrect, especially from a country that has strong exports because it benefits from a weak euro at the expense of economically weaker countries.

Each state is entitled to its own minimum wage law if it wants to, but it is not possible for the application of such a law to be contrary to EU principles. This is clearly about moving against the fundamental principles of the free market and the free movement of people and services. Unfortunately, the German measure fits into the current trend of increasing protectionism within the EU. What is particularly dangerous is that if Germany defends the application of the law in this form, a chain reaction in other countries can be expected. In addition to the financial burden, we cannot forget the huge increase in bureaucracy, which is contrary to the adopted European principle of smart regulation. In the 21st century in Europe, can we really require companies to send documentation by fax somewhere in Cologne or detailed work records of their employees kept only in German?  However, I see, in addition to the legal and technical aspects, that the German minimum wage is a fundamental political problem for Europe, a step backwards. Instead of further unification, an invisible barrier is being built between states in Europe. This, after all, belies the meaning of the EU's existence and the meaning of our work. This afternoon, in front of the Parliament building, I met representatives of Czech carriers who, together with carriers of other countries, are protesting against German law. The demonstrators asked me what information I had, how the situation was evolving. They're worried about survival, especially the little carriers. And what could I have told them? Nothing, Commissioner, nothing. After weeks of asking questions and waiting for the authorities responsible to comment, we still do not have a solution. You know, the worst uncertainty for any entrepreneur is, and for me, that uncertainty is unacceptable. This legal uncertainty has been going on for 3 months.

Mr President, in a Union of sovereign states, Germany is free to introduce such legislation. My party also wants this freedom for the Netherlands, if it is needed.

And, dear country, there is one more thing that is very important in this context. After all, in most Member States the right to a minimum rate of pay is protected by national law, so it is in no way acceptable for one Member State, in this case Germany, to impose its wage conditions on other Member States.

Normally I am very proud of our German thoroughness. But in this case, the German government has gone far beyond the mark with its obsession with detail. It is indeed the case that I am not at all against minimum wages as such. The Commissioner said this: every country can decide for itself, that is national sovereignty – perfectly okay. In this case, however, it is the first time – we are not the first country to have a minimum wage law, many others have already had it – that the transport sector, including the transit sector, has been described in such detail, until then – as my colleague has said – that faxes should be sent in advance to German to the German Government, the German authorities, when exactly which company is on German soil for how long. , and that you should make sure that you pay the German minimum wage. I believe that this goes well beyond the target, and it is also against European law. The examination is not yet complete, as you said. But how can we be in favour of the internal market, where we have different living conditions in different countries, and, of course, different wage levels? That's just the way it is! We certainly do not want lorry drivers to be treated badly. There is also a lot in the wrong. That is exactly what I admit. But I believe that , as Mr Ujhelyi has also said, this also applies to the petition and the demonstration – this is the wrong way to remedy this. We really need to do something different in order to create better conditions for lorry drivers. In fact, I believe that Germany has opened a barrel with it. This is the first time that logistics and transport have been included – a European policy. Now France has followed suit. France now wants to do the same. If other countries join, what should a freight forwarder do, please, who travel through five different countries? In Poland the wage is relatively low, at 1.95 euros or a bit more, in Luxembourg 11.10 euros, in France 9.61 euros, in Germany 8.50 euros. How can this be dispersed, and who is to control it? In this case, I believe that this is clearly about the objective of making people better, and absolutely against Europe and against the internal market. I do not think we can tolerate that at all. Finally, I also fear that small and medium-sized enterprises, which we always want to protect, will now have to give up and lose jobs. That is not Europe's will either!

Commissioner, everyone in this Chamber agrees that we have a real problem with social dumping in transport. Yes, let's do it! Let us create a European labour inspection agency to monitor and punish unscrupulous employers. Let's put together a blacklist of these companies. Let us put in place minimum standards for working conditions and wages. This is precisely an opportunity to introduce the minimum wage throughout Europe. As for transport, it is true that we need to move faster: strengthening the rules of coasting in the road transport sector, clarifying, in particular, the problem of national flags in the maritime transport sector.

In Sweden, the market is flooded with cars driving for compensation that is far below the limit of what a Swedish company can do. The cars are manned by drivers who can have as low compensation as 500 euros a month. That is what you, ladies and gentlemen, have in per diem for two days! You even have more in per diem than they have in the month. What is happening is scandalous – and everything is happening under the protection of the EU cabotage regulation, which is riddled with loopholes. What is happening on our roads is simply not decent. Are minimum wages perhaps a way to go? I don't know, but Swedish companies are going bankrupt on assembly lines. Drivers are made redundant, tax money is lost. Fair competition is not feared, but that situation does not exist now. Then you hear the defense that the drivers of foreign cars have a salary that is quite ok compared to what they earn in their home country. What good is that? They are not in their home country. They have completely different cost of living. Now the question is what the Commission intends to do to put this problem in order. Some call it protectionism and nationalism when trying to protect their country's businesses and employees. I call it morality and decency when we demand fair conditions on our roads and workplaces.

Mr President, I too share the concerns expressed by this question. Especially in the area of European road transport we have many examples of exploitation of workers and complete circumvention of their labour rights. Unfortunately, however, the problem is not limited to that. We have complaints where employers are pressuring drivers to work long hours of gruelling driving exceeding human endurance limits. There is also no second driver, as provided for in long road trips, both in freight vehicles and in tourist buses.  This situation poses an increased risk of road accidents.  The way in which the Common Market has been structured gives opportunities to those who do not care about labour rights and allows labour exploitation. In order to stop these phenomena, therefore, we need radical solutions, which will demonstrate European solidarity in practice. We must therefore move towards a fair policy, both in pay and working conditions throughout the Union.

I believe that it is important for a social Europe that all the Member States of the European Union should be given a minimum wage. These minimum wages will differ, but they will grow together in the long run - and I know it will take too long for many. But if we all have a minimum wage, then at least we know what we are talking about. The second point. Like Mr Marinescu, I have problems with the maintenance of the German minimum wage for transit traffic. I think that you are making things unnecessarily complex and that this involves an extraordinary amount of administrative rules. I am also curious to see what the European Commission's procedure entails in this area and will teach us. Let's talk about the domestic cabotage in Germany. I assume that the German minimum wage will be paid for transport in Germany by non-German companies. This is another step towards a fairer playing field. Again, I know that things are too slow for some, but a socially and competitive Europe must do so. Then there are the other problems in the sector. Also in the Netherlands we have parking spaces where at weekends 50, 60, 70, mainly Eastern European drivers cook their potty, do their need. That is a distressing social problem. I hope, Mrs Bulc, that you will pay attention to this in the road transport package, because workers in Europe have the right to a fair wage and fair social services.

It also shows, in essence, that this is the result of the different standards within the European Union. I believe that this is the essence of the debate. We must also be honest among ourselves and address it in this way. Lower wages lead to lower costs for entrepreneurs. Lower costs for entrepreneurs ultimately also means lower offer prices when it comes to getting a contract. This is, of course, a clear competitive advantage for countries that have lower standards. I am also surprised by those who say that the German minimum wage is higher and would not apply to others. But the same entrepreneurs from these countries ultimately set their offers or prices according to german, French or Italian prices, but no one complains about them. When it comes to wages, yes, but if the entrepreneurs collect the money, then no.  That is why I will give you an example from my own country. I am a representative of the East Bavarian region in Germany. I am on the border with the Czech Republic. What do German companies do? And that is why the German FDP's criticism comes from being driven by the lobby. These companies outsource their businesses, 50 km further east. They form a letterbox company there with employees who are ultimately Czech citizens, possibly have other nationalities, to their low standards. But the work – and that is what it is all about – is ultimately done in another state, such as .B in Germany. Now we can take a different view. However, we must be honest, and we must ultimately also ask the Commission to actually get a European approach to the definition. What is cabotage? Above all, what is transit traffic? And above all – I have not heard this today – what is cross-border transport? That is also crucial. What about trucks that drive .B from Prague to Munich, unload and immediately drive back? We need to define these points in more detail. Then we can also reach a compromise.

Since 1 January 2015, a statutory minimum wage of EUR 8.50 has been in place in Germany.

It is not essentially a question of EUR 8.50 – that is not the problem – but of the bureaucracy that is involved. The EUR 8.50 also applies to the transport industry and should also apply to transit through Germany. The displeasure and uncertainty in other Member States about the German regulation are there, as we have heard today. The fact that something seems to be wrong with the law is shown by the frantic reaction of the German Minister of Labour. Although it initially ruled out changes, it suspended the minimum wage for transit-only journeys until further notice when brussels began its examination. For example, our neighbours – especially from Eastern Europe – do not have to send their drivers' operational plans to German customs. Here, Brussels has indirectly reduced red tape.

The issue we are dealing with today is not a purely national problem. Nor is it a question of introducing a minimum wage in a particular Member State. Nor is it a question of the level of the minimum wage. Although wage policy falls under the principle of subsidiarity, the minimum wage is a European matter. It touches on areas such as competition, social dumping, the internal market and freedom of movement. And that is where the problem lies: national circumstances, subsidiarity and yet a European matter. That is why the Commission must take a clear position on this issue. I am in favour of a statutory minimum wage and Regret that in some Member States there is still none or that it has not been sufficiently implemented in some Member States. Social dumping in the field of road transport has reached alarming proportions. There is legislation, and this has been mentioned several times: the Posting of Workers Directive, Rome I, Directive 1071 of 2009. But this is circumvented or not controlled.

However, these truck drivers are not entitled to the same minimum wage or social protection as their colleagues in the country they cross. However, the activity is very similar and is well conducted in the same territory. In my country, France, the most caboté country in Europe, French truck drivers are therefore directly competing, on their national market, by other European truck drivers, which has led France to lose 21,000 jobs in fifteen years. We will soon vote on two million euros in aid for the licensed truck drivers of the carrier Mory Ducros. There really needs a European solution to fill the existing legal vacuum.

This debate has not only legal but also social aspects. Carriers from other countries will have virtually two options, both unfavourable: either they will break German law and pay drivers so far at country of origin rates, which threatens to result in high penalties, or they will pay at German rates, which could even lead to the bankruptcy of some companies and the loss of jobs by hundreds of drivers in Europe.  Companies cannot afford to do business below cost. The differences in the economic levels of each country are obvious and will not be equal in a few years.

So, as we prepare to celebrate International Roma Day on 8 April, it is opportune to reflect on the situation of Europe’s largest ethnic minority, on their circumstances, and on progress made and the challenges ahead. Not only is it opportune, but it is also necessary because Europe’s success in improving the situation of Roma communities is a measure of our ability to promote integration and tackle social exclusion everywhere. That is why four years ago the Council established the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies. This Framework invited Member States to come forward with strategies to promote Roma inclusion in four key areas – education, employment, healthcare and housing. And just over a year ago, on 9 December 2013, the Council added fresh impetus to this drive by adopting a recommendation on effective Roma integration measures. There has been progress. Member States have stepped up their efforts and are taking action. The European Parliament has been very instrumental, by keeping the topic on the agenda, by assisting with ideas and discussion, as well as by reminding the Council and its Member States of the need to further progress on the issue. But this is a long road and major challenges remain. It is regrettable that in 2015 many Roma still live in conditions that are simply unacceptable. They still face deep poverty and social marginalisation. Many lack basic access to housing and healthcare. The unemployment rate is above the EU average, and Roma children are less likely to finish school. According to the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, as many as 54% of Roma still experience discrimination when looking for employment. Too often, Roma are the victims of prejudice, intolerance and social exclusion. Joint EU and national level action is helping, but genuine progress, the sort that will help not just future generations of Roma but also this generation, requires something much more fundamental than what is in place today: a change in public attitudes towards Roma communities. That is far easier said than done. There are three concrete steps that we can take to improve public awareness and understanding, all of which are included in the Council’s recommendation of December 2013. First, tackling prejudice and discrimination head on. This is a no-brainer and true for every group facing intolerance. We must take effective measures to combat anti-Gypsyism, negative rhetoric and hate speech. We must fight against racist and stigmatising language. Second, raising public awareness about Roma people. As we all know, intolerance is a common product of misunderstanding. So improving understanding of Roma communities, not just of the problems they face, but also of their history and rich culture, has to be part of the solution. Roma culture is an inherent part of the cultural diversity of the European Union. How aware, for example, are ordinary Europeans of the Roma genocide during the Second World War? Fostering public awareness of Roma history and culture, especially the traumatic and tragic events of the Second World War, is one of the most powerful ways in which we can support social cohesion and fight exclusion. This learning must start in our schools and universities and be nurtured across our societies. That also includes the media, which has a vital role to play. Third, and perhaps most urgently, we need to empower the Roma community, to give them a real platform to speak out for themselves, and to actively engage in public life as full EU citizens. These steps are key strands of the Council’s recommendation of December 2013. I note with great pleasure that they are also important issues for Parliament. Being a politician myself, I am convinced that parliamentarians play a significant role in shaping society’s attitude. The European Parliament plays a particularly important role in promoting tolerance. With International Roma Day almost upon us, we must celebrate the contribution made by Roma to Europe’s cultural and historical tapestry, and we must redouble our commitment to tackling the social and economic challenges they face.

On 2 August 1944 almost 3 000 elderly people, women and children – the remaining Sinti and Roma of the so-called Zigeunerlager in the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau – were murdered in the gas chambers. The atrocities against Roma and Sinti during the Second World War must not be forgotten. This debate is a very small acknowledgement of a terrible debt. A moral debt to the Roma and Sinti people, wiped off the face of the earth during the Second World War, and wiped from our memories after the Second World War. Commemorating the Roma and Sinti victims is our duty. And we have to remain vigilant. Extremists are becoming more visible and their audience bigger. Hate speech is getting louder, hate crime more frequent. Europe’s old demons are attempting a comeback. We must confront them. Fifteen years ago we put in place anti-discrimination directives, yet Roma are still victims of discrimination. We have legislation in place combating racism and xenophobia, yet Roma are still victims of racism and xenophobia. I agree that anti-Gypsyism, as a specific form of racism, must be of serious concern to all of us. A lot has been done at national and European level over the past few years to foster the integration of Roma. In particular, the adoption of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies in 2011 initiated a change in Roma integration policies in the Member States. But although we have put in place comprehensive integration strategies and made funding available, and despite our efforts to promote diversity and to highlight the benefits of Roma integration, Roma are still victims of economic and social exclusion and we still see very few real improvements on the ground. We need consistency and coherence in our action. The Commission monitors Member States’ compliance with the Racial Equality Directive, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin in a number of specific fields, including education. The Commission is ready to take action whenever Member States are found to be in breach of their duties under the directive. Deeply rooted stereotypes and prejudices link Roma to criminality, anti-social behaviour or benefit dependency. But how can we dismantle such stereotypes and prejudices? First, by applying the principle of equality before the law. Roma are EU citizens, and as such they should enjoy the same rights and have the same duties as the rest of us. Second, by ensuring equal opportunities. This is the fundamental objective behind our action – to build societies which offer equal opportunities to all, including to Roma. The 2013 Council recommendation on Roma integration requests that Member States implement measures to combat discrimination and anti-Gypsyism. To be effective, fighting discrimination should be mainstreamed into all policies, including on education, employment and access to services. It starts with basic education. Roma children must not be segregated. Teaching Roma children from socially excluded communities to read, count and write is necessary, but it is not sufficient to create that special feeling of belonging to a society. I expect the Member States to raise awareness about the benefits of Roma integration, both in Roma communities and among the general public. They could address the inclusion problems that Roma face in public curricula and teaching materials. We will carefully monitor these aspects in the Member States’ reports about their implementation measures at the end of this year. There are policies and legal and financial tools in place, both at national and EU level. We need to work on their combined enforcement in order to achieve sustainable results. We need to join forces and assume our roles and responsibilities in this process. We need to ensure that the solutions are discussed and implemented at local level, since this is where the exclusion takes place. This is, at least, what I take as the main message from last week’s European Platform for Roma Inclusion meeting. Another outcome is the importance of building trust among stakeholders in Roma integration at national level. Therefore, national Roma platforms should be set up, and we will work on this together with the National Roma Contact Points. Europe’s tragic past serves as a reminder of our duties and responsibilities towards the future. I believe our debate today will raise greater awareness and send a strong signal against anti-Gypsyism and all forms of racism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 330, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "György HÖLVÉNYI", "mepid": "124715", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – The upcoming International Roma Day gives us the opportunity to learn more about the social situation and culture of the Roma. In Hungary, the official day of remembrance is the International Day of Remembrance of the Roma Holocaust on 2 August. To this day, very few people know about the Roma Holocaust, porrajmos, despite the fact that it has claimed the lives of 500,000 Roma and Sysans. The Roma genocide is a crime against all humanity, for which there is no explanation. The legacy of this is carried by all of us here, whether in our country, in wider Europe, or anywhere in the world.  I would like to recall that, Hungary 2011 European Presidency of the European Parliament, the Member States adopted the European Roma strategy, also mentioned by the Secretary of State. Its main objective is to help roma catch up and improve their living conditions. To this end, the Hungarian National Social Inclusion Strategy is looking for comprehensive and effective solutions. I stress that you are looking for and supporting him, but let us be aware that it is necessary to make up for a centuries-old backlog. From crèches to universities, it seeks to help the integration of the cumulatively disadvantaged, including Roma youth. Hungary, my country, has started to work, yet its Roma policy is being unjustly attacked by many.

The situation of Roma within the EU Member States is, as it is today, under all criticism. Every day we violate fundamental human rights and the fundamental values of the European Union. Tens of millions of people live daily in great exclusion, in all areas. Discrimination, hate crimes and poverty are the effects of anti-Gypsyism. This is based solely on Roma ethnicity. Anti-Gypsyism, anti-Gypsyism, which targets the Roma, has been doing so in fact since the early 15th century. It is time to take a strong political stance in this very pressing situation. We should be ashamed of ythemselves. It is not ok that today, in a modern society because of ethnicity, people still cannot have a vision of their future, but only have a daily survival strategy. A first step in the fight against anti-Gypsyism is that we in this elected Chamber vote with common voice in favour of a resolution on the recognition of 2 August as a day of remembrance for the Holocaust of the Roma. This day is already being noticed by the Roma community. Zigeunernacht – between 2 and 3 August Auschwitz/Birkenau was emptied of the remaining Roma. At 9.00 a.m. on the morning of 2 August, the list looked as follows: 2 987 people. At 9:00 a.m. on August 3, it was 0. Witnesses say that the smell and stench of the crematorium never wanted to end. During the Nuremberg trials, roma were not mentioned. No Roma could testify. This year we celebrate 70 years of the liberation of the Auschwitz/Birkenau concentration camps. I think it is high time to recognise the Roma on 2 August. It is of great symbolic value to Europe's Roma, but also to democracy itself. It is about recognising history and aiming for a future built on europe's fundamental values. I would like to point out that this resolution has no political colour.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today’s debate. These discussions are always very inspiring for me, with the flow of – mostly – good ideas which we use in our work. I would like to react quickly to what Ms Záborská said about humanity. This is very much what I feel in my heart, and we must be strong in combating the increasing intolerance we now have in Europe. We had a discussion about this last week with Vice-President Timmermans. We are planning a big conference for October this year, where we want to gather together with all important stakeholders in the European Union to discuss how to combat not only anti-Gypsyism but also anti-Semitism and other forms and signals of increasing intolerance in Europe. I would like to add something regarding the Commission policy: I would like to call the policy we want to have a practical policy. We do not need big new legislation, new committees, big glossy conferences. We already have legislation in place, so what we need is stronger enforcement of the existing legislation and very precise insistence on observing the law. This is our main principle: that we are all equal before the law. This is something we need to use in the Member States, in everyday policy and everyday action. We are now assessing the national strategies which we collected from the Member States. I appreciate the Hungarian input, because I know it was the idea of Hungary in 2011 to start to work on the national strategies, which enable us to look at new methods and the new instruments we are going to use in the Member States and to help best practices to be shared by all. So, for instance, I spoke to the Deputy Minister in the Romanian Government who presented to me the new policy the Government wants to start in Romania to help not only Roma citizens but all those who are in need, people suffering from poverty, to overcome these problems. I asked them, please, to implement this as soon as possible, and then in one year’s time I would like them to share their experience with others. It is part of the role of the Commission to help ensure that best practices are transferred and to coordinate these actions. In the newly—submitted national strategies we see a lot of innovation, a lot of good ideas, a lot of effort to get rid of the things that do not work, and not to waste time, energy and money, and a really big effort to solve the problems. I hope the strategies will be as good when put into practice as they look on paper. In all the strategies we see ways of combating unemployment and poverty, ways to increase education and access to services, including housing – very practical things. A last comment regarding financing. You said here that well—targeted funding is necessary. It is not only the European Social Fund which should be used in the most practical and effective way. In this respect the Commission – and I personally, because I was very active for four years in EU funding – are helping to share best practices and to share information on what works and what has been funded from the European Social Fund. But there are also governments financing projects and programmes for Roma integration and combating poverty, because most of these programmes concern not only Roma citizens but also all those who suffer from poverty. Here we see increasing interest from governments in using their resources to help the situation. A last comment regarding the NGOs. I very much appreciate the work of NGOs and activists working on the ground because they are doing the right work and the proper work to help the situation. I am convinced that if we find a way to introduce multiannual financing of these NGOs – which, in fact, work in place of the state doing the work which the public sector should otherwise do – they should have more stable financing. This would, in turn, save time and energy for the real work, as they would not be spent chasing money to survive.

Many of you have made the suggestion that there should be a commemoration date of the Roma genocide. I must say that the Council has not yet taken a position on this subject. At the same time, I find it symbolic that we are having a discussion on the possibility of a memorial day to commemorate the Roma genocide on the day when my country, Latvia, commemorates victims of the Soviet totalitarian regime. Without prejudice to the Council’s eventual position on the matter, as a representative of a country whose people suffered a great deal from totalitarian regimes, I understand the historical, political and educational value of having such a date. Irrespective of when we celebrate International Roma Day or when exactly we commemorate victims of the genocide, there is an urgent need to address the poverty, marginalisation and discrimination faced by Roma communities. As part of the EU and national action, we have a duty to ourselves, to our values and of course to Roma, to tackle public misunderstanding, raise awareness and fight intolerance because, as we look back, so too must we look forward to ending stigmatisation, to properly integrating Roma – and indeed all minorities – into European society and to showing that every European has a place in Europe.

After all, as Mr President-in-Point pointed out, Juncker, Greece's over-indebtedness is due to illegal actions by the European Union's supervisory authorities, who, although they knew that Greece was over-borrowed, in breach of the Maastricht Treaty, turned a blind eye to continuing the seamless export of German and French products and industrial equipment to Greece.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 376, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Martina ANDERSON", "mepid": "113959", "text": "   – Madam President, 20 years has passed since the celebrated Arafat-Rabin handshake on the White House lawn, 20 years since the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority, and 20 years since the formal start of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.

In education, the reforms adopted have led to a great inequality of the Spanish education system; public health has ceased to be universal and free; pensions acknowledge that there is already a reduction in the amount of pensions with the consequent reduction in purchasing power'. The report concludes by saying that the austerity measures taken by the Rajoy government have led to growing inequality in Spain.

Dramatic events, such as that of Attica Broadcasting, with the redundancy of 928 workers by 16 television companies, or the case of Attica Publishing, with the redundancy of 705 workers employed in 46 companies in the advertising sector, require commitment and solidarity.  The two events have common origins, the economic crisis, and common responses: closures and mass redundancies.  The fall in family income and purchasing power and the cut in business credit have bent Greece, opening up serious scenarios for territories such as the Attica region, one of the poorest in the country, and leading to the renunciation of services such as information, which are considered superfluous. This is all the more serious in view of the closure of the public broadcaster RTF at the behest of the Troika, and the democratic vulnus due to the lack of a plural information system.

In particular, it has tried and sought to resolve the loss of certain jobs and its negative effects. As a result of the government's successful economic policies, there is currently an increase in jobs in Hungary, not a decrease. Despite our objections, the European Union is treating the European tobacco sector quite harshly. Tobacco grown in Europe for centuries provides a livelihood for 80,000 farmers and employs 350,000 seasonal workers a year, most of them in the poor regions of Bulgaria, Spain, Greece, Italy, Poland, Hungary and Romania. It is known that European production differs from that of large exporting countries in the developing world in that, although in smaller quantities, it is of higher quality, more stable and more traceable. The latter properties contribute to alleviating the public health consequences of smoking. Despite the Opinion of the European Parliament during the reform of the CAP, the Commission has achieved a complete end to EU support for tobacco production from 2015. European tobacco production under controlled conditions will be significantly reduced, thus significantly increased imports of less controlled tobacco products produced outside the EU and illegal imports. Due to these measures and effects, there is a significant risk that many jobs will be lost in the tobacco sector.

The case is related to a complaint filed against Ivan Jakovčić by businessman Georg List, an international businessman, who has been trying to build a polo field in the Motovun area (Croatia) since 2002.

In the opinion of that report, I voted in favour of this Decision, which maintains the decisions of 21 May 2013 and 24 February 2014 of the European Parliament, not to defend gabriele albertini's immunity and privileges and not to follow up on her request for review with regard to the civil action brought against him.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 974, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Inma RODRÍGUEZ-PIÑERO", "mepid": "125043", "text": "  in writing.

What should be taken into account when talking about the macro-financial assistance granted to Ukraine? Firstly, according to the National Bank of Ukraine, the country's external debt has reached 96.5 percent of GDP and is now 126 billion dollars. Ukraine's economy continues to shrink and a large budget deficit is expected. Consequently, it should be noted that Ukraine is unlikely to be able to return the credit granted today in the near future. Secondly, it is not a non-repayable grant, it is a credit that the Ukrainian Government will have to give back.

The proposed envelope is the third macro-financial assistance programme for Ukraine since 2010. In 2014, Europe provided EUR 1.36 billion in aid under existing programmes. The payment of the last tranche of EUR 250 million is due to take place shortly, subject to the successful implementation by Ukraine of the agreed measures. Indeed, European aid is not unconditional: in order to benefit from it, Kiev must meet a series of criteria for reform, in terms of budget, banks, energy or the judicial system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1131, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  in writing. ‒ I voted in favour of the proposal is to grant an extra EUR 1.8 billion in macro-economic aid to Ukraine.

In addition to ensuring an increase in revenue - which could lead to further investment for growth - the Union and its States must strive to create a global system of legal certainty and taxation, as a basis for real growth in SMEs which, unlike the large multinationals, are incapable of taking advantage of the 'illicit' benefits of being able to move their tax offices to 'havens'.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1188, "date": "2015-03-25.json", "name": "Miriam DALLI", "mepid": "124970", "text": "  in writing. ‒ I abstained on this report because, whilst it underlines the importance and necessity of fighting tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning and tax havens, I believe that it is imperative that taxation remains a Member State competence.

I believe that good agreements have been reached with regard to the exchange of information and the fight against money laundering. I would like to highlight two other issues on this subject. One is member states' practice of secret tax unifications to international companies; and the other is the foreign flight of European companies for tax avoidance. In recent months, several Member States have been found to have tried to win over multinational companies by offering them special preferential treatment, including tax reductions. The fact that there is competition for the favor of international companies between Member States is a fact. At the same time, in solidarity between states such as the EU, it is impermissible to maintain such practices. Moreover, this is unfair to other entrepreneurs, who expect clear tax rules to be fairly predictable and sustainable. I believe that a coordinated EU strategy is needed to address this problem, which is why I am looking forward to the European Commission's action plan on this issue.

However, operational conditions for enterprises across the monetary area are not the same, because in the real world things shape up differently. Physical endowments are an obvious example of this. When the monetary zone operates as a federal system, or a so-called transfer union, mechanisms exist to ensure that those who are less well endowed with competitive attributes receive compensation for their handicaps. This is done by financial or other transfers, automatic or politically directed. None of this is possible in the euro zone. So calls for the harmonisation of tax structures, or even for ‘fairness’ in so-called tax competition, could inhibit even further the competitiveness of areas which find themselves at a disadvantage compared with better endowed areas within the monetary zone.
