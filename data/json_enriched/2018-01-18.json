This is a picture that varies greatly from country to country — ranging from 76 regulated professions in Lithuania up to 543 in Hungary — and involving 22% of the European workforce. With the report we present today for debate and vote in this House, Parliament intends to respond to the Communication from the European Commission on recommendations for reform in services professional. This initiative should be welcomed, having the merit of providing an overall assessment of the state of implementation of that directive and an overview of the rules applicable in the different Member States to architects, civil engineers, accountants, lawyers, industrial property consultants, real estate agents and tour guides. The communication shows first of all the need to fully implement the provisions of the Directive. In the world of professions, there is a need for greater mobility and more competition, and the Commission document undeniably emerges relevant areas for manoeuvre in the legislation of the Member States. On the other hand, I believe that any assessment of the effectiveness and proportionality of national legislation should be taken taking into account not only economic and quantitative factors, as is all too often the case and emerges from reading the documents of the European Commission. The direct link identified between reform and economic growth, between deregulation and the creation of new jobs, cannot and should not be the only polar star for policymakers. Instead, it is important to reiterate that the quality of professional services is one of the key factors in preserving our social and economic model and to ensure the competitiveness of our economy. For this reason, it is necessary to promote rules which, on the one hand, support young people's access to the world of work, growth and innovation but which, at the same time, protect the quality of the services provided, public interest targets and consumers. In order to assess the regulation of the professions, a combination of economic considerations and political assessments in defence of the general public objectives is therefore necessary, while respecting non-discrimination and proportionality provided for in the Treaties. In order to preserve a high quality of professional services, we need not only an effective and proportionate regulatory framework at European Union level but also active policies to support of professions, especially in relation to the challenges posed by globalisation and digitisation. The freelancer should be considered in a double dimension: that of professional in the strict sense and that of a small entrepreneur. We therefore need lifelong training, services to promote greater intra-European mobility and greater propensity for internationalisation, a reduction in bureaucratic burdens and easier access to funding. In particular, strong attention should be paid to the impact of digitisation on professional services. On the one hand we can certainly emphasize opportunities, on the other hand, the aspects of employment and quality of the services provided should be carefully assessed. Dear Members, Europe's competitiveness and the preservation of our social, economic and cultural model also pass through the protection of the quality of professional services for the benefit of citizens, enterprises and authorities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-01-18.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Danti for his report underlining the fundamental role of professions and the need for high-quality professional services as well as an effective regulatory environment.  Professional services do indeed play a crucial role in Europe’s society and economy and as Mr Danti said, they employ 22% of our labour force. They also account for almost a quarter of the value added in the European Union. That is precisely why we in the Commission have taken such a big interest in them.  But several studies have shown that the European professional services sector is seriously underperforming and its productivity is lagging behind. They conclude that a modernised legal framework could bring as many as 700 000 new jobs to the EU and increase EU GDP by up to 1%. In other words, the same order of magnitude as the EU budget.  This is not a minor matter. This is a call for action that we cannot ignore. We must create the best possible regulatory framework for professional services, a framework that does not restrict professionals’ freedom in an unwarranted fashion, but one that allows them to contribute maximally to the welfare of our society. I trust that this House shares our objective to deliver this framework. Nearly five years ago the Council and Parliament asked the Member States to screen their professional regulation as part of a comprehensive mutual evaluation exercise, foreseen in the revised Professional Qualifications Directive, because even where legislation aims to improve social welfare the resulting rules will not always best succeed.  Indeed, even by the time they are adopted rules can be outdated or inadequate. They can be disproportionate or the accumulation of layers of rules can lead to an overly restrictive legal framework. National legislators may not always take into account the external effects on competitiveness, social welfare and the single market. So constant modernisation of the legal framework governing professional services in the EU is crucial.  We welcome the efforts by Member States since the adoption of the revised Qualifications Directive to increase the transparency of the regulation and assess the substance of the rules in place. This has helped to create a database at EU level offering both an important source of information for professionals and making it easier for them to move.  We continue to work hard to improve the functioning and user-friendliness of that database but sadly, Member States’ substantive assessment of the professional rules in place was often of a poor quality or even absent. Moreover, many failed to grasp this opportunity for reform to improve their regulatory framework, although experience with such reforms in the Italian pharmacy and Polish legal sector, for example, clearly show that removing unnecessary burdens creates benefits for all.  The evaluation showed that there are big differences in the way in which Member States regulate very similar professions. Variance in itself is not a problem. Differences in regulatory approaches can sometimes be the reflection of different circumstances, but there are also instances where the variance does not reflect differences in national specificities or preferences and where the design of the rules could be improved.  To get a better perspective on how restrictive the regulatory framework for a specified profession in a specific country is, we developed the so-called ‘restrictiveness indicator’. This allows us to measure the accumulated burden of different regulatory requirements for some important professional services sectors. It is based on a solid analysis of regulation in place in all Member States. It refines the parameters of the well known and widely used OECD PMR indicator.  Of course, this indicator is only intended to measure the restrictiveness of professional regulation and, as is pointed out in the report, this indicator is not intended to assess whether a restriction can be justified because it pursues a legitimate public interest in a proportionate manner. This is a separate exercise which the Member States have to do in line with the Treaty, but it is still helpful in indicating where Member State regulation is especially restrictive and where they have an interest in examining that regulation more deeply.  Differences in the level of restrictiveness may not be problematic in and of themselves, but they do indicate that other countries might have found other less restrictive ways forward. This could serve as an inspiration. In order to assist the Member States with the removal of specific unjustified restrictions and to identify possibilities for improving the regulatory environment, we have put forward reform recommendations for seven professional services sectors. They are based on the restrictiveness indicator combined with a qualitative assessment. They target those instances where regulation is found to be particularly restrictive.  These reform recommendations are also important in the context of the European Semester exercise, which has addressed the issue of regulation of professions in several instances. While the indicator may not tell the whole story as it is referred to in the report, this does not mean that the rest of this story should not be based on strong evidence. Indeed, the Professional Qualifications Directive reinforced the obligation for Member States to ensure that the restrictions they impose are truly justified and demonstrably proportionate.  Based on the experience with the mutual evaluation exercise, it became clear that Member States may have difficulties in conducting such a proportionality assessment. Also in some cases the readiness to revisit existing regulations seemed limited. The uneven scrutiny of regulation of professions called for a coherent legal framework, so we put forward a proposal for an ex ante proportionality test for new regulations on which trilogues will start at the end of this month. It fully respects Member States’ responsibility for the regulatory decisions they take. It does not impose an obligation of result, it simply proposes a common EU-wide framework to conduct a genuine proportionality assessment before a new or amended regulation is proposed. Finally, these two policy initiatives will complement and strengthen the Commission’s enforcement policy rather than replace it. In this context we take due note of Parliament’s call for infringement proceedings to address discriminatory, unjustified and disproportionate regulation. We stand ready to act to address the issue.  We count on the sustained support of honourable Members to keep the reform of professional services high on the political agenda. It is only with their active commitment that we will be able to unleash the potential of this important sector for the benefit of our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-01-18.json", "name": "Andreas SCHWAB", "mepid": "28223", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, I would like to thank Mr Danti and all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation on this very sensitive issue. I believe that the report that is being discussed and voted on today has provided a good basis for entering the so-called service package. Commissioner Vella, I am delighted that you are here this morning. I am sure that Commissioner Bieńkowska will be there herself when we discuss the service package here. The essential principles that should guide the European legislator, as well as the Commission, in the regulation of service professions, require great sensitivity, because, of course, there is a high willingness of the parties involved to give themselves rules, which are often relatively far from the level of professional management. what is being discussed in the European context are gone. That is why, from the outset, I would also ask the European Commission to act with skill, flexibility and sensitivity among the relevant stakeholders in the professions, so as not to unnecessarily smash porcelain, because in principle there is already a willingness and the will to ensure compliance with European law in the profession. occupational regulation, for example, in the self-management of the liberal professions or even in the craft sector, which is not always easy in practice. That is why, in this report, on the start of the service package, we have been guided by the idea that sensible regulation can also provide incentives for competition. I am grateful that the Commission and Parliament have adopted the principle that regulation per se is a mistake. In this respect, we simply have to rely on sensible regulation. I also believe that if the Member States and the Member States and the Professional organisations work closely together, occupational regulation does not have to be a market obstacle, but we just have to make it — unfortunately, we have to be patient for this because things are only slowly evolving — and that the internal market is more likely to succeed if we can do this together accordingly. Thirdly, Commissioner Vella, as you pointed out: in the end, the Commission will not fail to initiate infringement proceedings on a case-by-case basis, because we cannot legislate on all professions simply because very few have opposed the rules of the European internal market.

This large majority is gathered because, precisely, we are in a logic of balance and compromise, which takes into account all our main principles, but also tries to anchor ourselves in the reality of economic activity and the reality of consumers throughout the European area. This is not a small feat in a context where we are dealing with a more global climate around the services package, which I find particularly emblematic of the disconnection of a number of the proposals that can be made here with the reality of businesses, SMEs and consumers. Indeed, we are always talking about unjustified barriers, regulatory obstacles, but it would nevertheless be worth remembering that regulation, regulation and obligation meet — if they still exist and if the Commission has done its job correctly — to objectives of the general interest, that these regulations are there to preserve the health and consumer safety, food safety and environmental protection. These are not thin goals and they deserve careful attention before they are obligatory to question them. This is what Nicola Danti's report points out, the need for balance. In this regard, I regret that our Liberal colleagues, once again, are demonstrating this great deregulatory dogmatism by simply removing the reference to those objectives of general interest, which must be the basis of any regulation.

On the one hand, we have the right of Member States to regulate those professions where they believe that the public interest is required. On the other hand, we have the right of workers to pursue their profession in any Member State. I therefore consider it essential that national regulation of occupations always correspond to the principles of non-discrimination and proportionality. And that the Member State clearly defines the public interest it pursues by regulation. I am pleased that these principles are also highlighted on several occasions in the report presented. As is apparent from the Commission communication to which the report responds, Member States also impose regulatory conditions where we would seek the public interest in vain. However, we could easily identify the protectionist interest in protecting our own regulated market from competition. I would therefore also like to call on the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to actively enforce compliance with the principle of non-discrimination and proportionality from the Member States. The basic rules of the European Union are essentially well set out in its Treaties, but the problem is that they are not respected, also because the Commission is insufficiently enforceable from the Member States.

I believe that today we are taking a step towards achieving our vision of a functioning single market for services, of which professional services are of course a cornerstone. Around 50 million people in Europe are working in these services, so they are extremely important. Too often, regulation in the Member States still operates against this goal, while the evidence shows us that the EU countries that have fewer obstacles to cross-border competition are actually performing much better than the Member States where the restrictions are still in place. We believe that the regulation, at European and national level, of professional services should be proportionate, justified and non-discriminatory. Member States should identify and remove the unjustified regulatory barriers in the interests of the citizens to enable them to benefit from the new professional opportunities. If I made an effort to become a lawyer, a doctor, an architect, whatever, then it’s reasonable to expect to be able to exercise that profession, even outside the walls of my city. We believe that this professionality should not be optional, but impossible to avoid, and that is why that we need transparency and legal clarity. This is the reason I tabled amendment on behalf of my group about it.

In fact, I believe that the Member States' established obligation to notify the Commission of what changes they have made to their national arrangements within regulated professions is directly contrary to the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality. Each country must, for itself, be able to determine what prerequisites and qualifications must be fulfilled for the exercise of a particular profession.

Freedom of movement for professionals in the single market is a practical example of the functioning of the European socio-economic model. Of course, the regulation of professional activities is an essential condition for ensuring the quality of public services provided and protecting the public interest, and therefore the quality of education must be a very important priority for all Member States. As the rapporteur rightly pointed out, the experience of implementing the directive is not unequivocally encouraging. We have many examples where professionals wishing to be employed in another Member State face logically inexplicable obstacles: administrative requirements, long procedures or simply an open obstacle to obtaining the necessary information. We, the Group of the Greens, supported the proportionality test proposed by the Commission for the new professional requirements. It was supposed to be a good tool to solve the problems faced by citizens. Unfortunately, it is regrettable that Member States do not always boast of applying transparent professional requirements. This can be confirmed by many people working abroad. The document under discussion is an excellent opportunity to remind Member States of their commitment to enabling all European citizens to employ according to their qualifications. I would like to point out that the principle of good governance requires, first of all, to address the gaps in the implementation of the existing regulation, especially since the problems arise mainly from the scope of implementation of the provisions of the directive, which the Commission must carry out in its day-to-day activities, and therefore the need for to welcome the Commission's ambitions that have just been expressed to tackle these loopholes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 12, "date": "2018-01-18.json", "name": "John Stuart AGNEW", "mepid": "96897", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Madam President, good morning to you and the 25 brave Members prepared to turn up this morning.

The aim of opening up professions in order to create more jobs and improve the economy is honourable. Very few people would disagree with this. However, I believe that Member States are more than capable of carrying this out themselves, if and when it is necessary. It is certainly not for the Commission to become involved with.

It's just enough to say that years have passed and Directive 2005/36/EC to today by many countries is not implemented, including 6 countries have not presented their national action plans at all. It is also evidenced by numerous regulations. These are, please, tens of thousands of regulations, tens of thousands of regulations, on the scale of the European Union The very fact that 1200 national bodies deal with this topic shows how confusing and complicated everything is. 5500 professions in Europe are regulated.

This Parliament has said that repeatedly, including in the report I did on non-tariff barriers in 2016. We often hear that restriction is essential, but what that really means is we want to stop other Europeans from offering services. It is discriminatory and it is against the principles of the treaties. Mutual recognition is at the heart of many aspects of the single market: it is what makes the single market unique. Yet it is under threat more than anywhere in professional services. From hairdressers to ski instructors, we’re all aware of, frankly, ridiculous examples of protectionism that are dressed up as protecting the public. They do no such thing. Consumers pay more and get worse services, Europeans are denied employment opportunities, new businesses never develop, and as a continent we struggle to innovate.

The role played by the professions is a vital component of the European economy, upholding our common objectives. Unfortunately, as Commissioner Vella pointed out, this area is underperforming.  The Professional Qualifications Directive is important as it upholds the fundamental EU right to the free movement of labour by enabling the free movement of professionals. It sets out the rules for automatic recognition for a number of professions, based on harmonised minimum training requirements, a general system for the recognition of professional qualifications, a system for the automatic recognition of professional experience, and a system of cross-border provision of services in the context of regulated professions. In 2013, we introduced Article 59 of this Directive, which provides for transparency and a mutual evaluation exercise for all regulated professions in Member States, whether they are regulated on the basis of national rules or are harmonised at EU level. Unfortunately, not all the provisions of Article 59 have yet been fully implemented by Member States, even after the passing of the deadline.

As a result of migration, internal migration and the unresolved euro crisis, real estate prices and rents have already been going through the ceiling in recent years. This development is expected to intensify, including through well-intentioned reports such as those here. In other reports, such as the Posting of Workers Directive, we already find hidden protectionist measures today.

In the framework of breaking down barriers, it is important to make professions easier to compare with each other across states. Improving the database of all regulated professions would contribute to this. The obligation of the State to assess the proportionality of introduced requirements before adopting new regulation is also beneficial. However, this assessment tends to be carried out differently in the Member States. In order to really eliminate unreasonable requirements and prevent protectionism, there is a need to ensure the same practice in all states.

We believe it is completely in its place that the consideration of the patient in the hospital, the consumer in everyday life and our all nature of the same is allowed to take precedence.

Indeed in many cases the regulation is justified on the above-mentioned grounds.

At the end of this debate, I would like to emphasize one word: balance — has been underlined by multiple interventions. We are dealing with a market that has very often been perhaps the most closed of all European markets, sometimes not only nationally but also locally. The professional has often been singled out as the one who operates on the territory, on a local reality, and we need — and this is the European directives that ask for it, and the work we are doing We reaffirm in this report — to expand intra-European mobility of the professions, give greater opportunities for inter-European mobility to young people, improve the quality of services, increase the supply of the internal EU and competition. But at the same time, we also need to ensure that national regulations guarantee proportionality, are proportional for access to these professions, to protect citizens, to protect the public and consumer protection authorities. However, at this final stage, I would like to emphasize one aspect. I believe, Madam President, Commissioner and ladies and gentlemen, that the competition will not be among European professionals. The digital market is opening our market to the world: now in the world you can find online platforms offering professional services from all over the world, barriers have been broken down. And then I think that the qualifying point we want to work on and that we have included in this report is that we need stronger, more capable professionals, more able to stay on the market international, and this is done with training, with digitization, with collaboration between the system national professional and within a European system. This is what we have in front of us.

It's about the climate. People are forced to look for fertile land in the south with their livestock, while others have their plants and crops. If we in Europe want to understand this and interfere, we must not simplify it into a religious conflict between Muslims and Christians. Because then we do exactly the same thing that is happening in Nigeria, where politicians use the difference in religion to give this battle a different connotation. If we are looking for conflict resolution, we must recognise that we are dealing here with a climate problem, with a problem between two lifestyles, with a scarcity problem. Another issue that the Greens call attention to when it comes to human rights, conflicts and Nigeria is the situation in the Niger Delta.

On the same day, a Canadian and an American citizen were kidnapped in Nigeria, and two policemen were killed in the exchange of gunfire with the kidnappers. It is a sad reminder of how volatile the security situation in the country still is and how crucial it is to address the situation in order to unleash Nigeria’s immense potential.  Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country and its largest economy. It is a country of great natural resources, but even more so, it is a country of entrepreneurs, artists, scientists and a country of innovation. We, as the European Union, are investing strongly to help the people of Nigeria bring their country forward. We invest in innovation, for instance, with the Digital4Development initiative, in energy efficiency, in local entrepreneurship, in the Green Economy and in the fight against climate change.  The European Investment Bank is about to increase its portfolio in the country. The visit of Vice-President Ansip to Abuja last year is a good illustration, among others, of this broad partnership. Yet, an unstable security situation is holding back Nigeria’s potential. Boko Haram continues to carry out frequent attacks in the northeast of the country. The attacks have mostly affected the majority Muslim communities in the region, with little regard to the religious or ethnic origin of its victims.  Nigeria is now engaged in a major counter-offensive, alongside Niger, Chad and Cameroon. We have supported their multinational Joint Task Force since the very outset, both politically and financially. There is, however, a long way to go to secure peace, security and long-term stability in the country.  We are also firmly committed to the protection of human rights in Nigeria, including in conflict situations, and we have mobilised all our tools to achieve this goal: diplomacy, development cooperation and humanitarian aid. Let us not forget that Nigeria is now home to 1.7 million internally displaced persons. The EU has already mobilised over EUR 155 million to address the humanitarian crisis, and an additional EUR 250 million for development in the northeast.  There are other violent conflicts in Nigeria, including in the southeast, the Biafra area, and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Clashes between farmers and herdsmen in the so-called middle belt have caused hundreds of deaths. While the herders are mainly Muslim and the farmers mainly Christian, the conflict reflects the limited access to land fuelled by climate change and demographic growth. We, however, share the concern that conflicts can turn more religious with time, with dire potential consequences.  The situation of minorities and vulnerable groups is also a concern to us, and a key subject for discussion. The European Union has made its views very clear that discrimination against certain religious, ethnic or gender groupings should not be tolerated and that it is the responsibility of any state to protect its citizens.  The upcoming elections in February 2019 will likely add to the complexity. I wish to thank the European Parliament for the pivotal role it has played in our election observation missions, cementing the role of the EU as a key political player. High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini hopes to visit Nigeria again in the near future for the next ministerial dialogue, in order to raise our shared concerns and to push our cooperation forward.

This conflict has escalated in recent decades as a consequence of population growth, climate change and associated waves of drought and the progressive desertification of northern Nigeria, and more recently also as a result of activity by the terrorist group Boko Haram. These factors force predominantly Muslim herding peoples to move towards the south, thus coming into conflict with predominantly Christian settled ethnic groups engaged in agriculture. Christians, who have lived in these areas for centuries, have to contend with the aggression of influx groups seeking areas to graze cattle. As a result of the accompanying clashes last year alone, more than 1.5 thousand people were killed and 100,000 were displaced. I appeal to Nigeria's president, Mr Muhammadu Buhari, to fulfil his declarations and take firm steps for stabilisation in central Nigeria, as well as intensifying action against Boko Haram in the north. It is crucial to create economic opportunities for herding groups deprived of access to pastures, as well as to speed up work on a regional Great Green Wall project to curb the progressive desertification of the northern part of the country.

China has made significant progress in its development over the past 30 years on the economic rights and social rights of its citizens. But, unfortunately, we note that the opposite has been the case in political rights and human rights in recent years: there is a backward step, there is much more repression, there is much less freedom of expression. I agree with colleagues who say that this is actually contrary to the Chinese Constitution. China should take seriously its own constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression and the protection of minorities. This is not the case today — neither in dealing with the people of Tibet, nor in dealing with the Uighurs and other minorities, and certainly not in people who have a different view from the prevailing opinion in the country. We have to defend ourselves against this, and that is the expression of this urgency. The EU understands human rights as an integral part of its foreign policy.

Lee Ming-cheh has recently been sentenced to five years in prison for exercising his freedom of expression. This right should be guaranteed under China’s constitution, and not punished. We call for the release of all the individuals mentioned, not least of Tashi Wangchuk, who is still on trial and is facing up to 15 years in prison for allegedly inciting separatism. The main prosecution evidence against him appears to be a video published by the New York Times where he did no more than advocate the rights of Tibetans to study in their mother tongue.  The Tibetan monk Choekyi was reportedly arrested for celebrating the Dalai Lama’s birthday in 2015. The news of his deteriorating health situation is troubling. We urge the Chinese authorities immediately to grant him parole on humanitarian grounds and to allow him to receive the necessary medical assistance. Already last summer at our human rights dialogue with China, we emphasised the deteriorating situation in relation to civil and political rights in China. Such deterioration contrasts very starkly with the significant improvements in the Chinese people’s standard of living. We have witnessed improvements in the sphere of some civil rights and we have welcomed the commitment by the Chinese authorities to ensure legal representation for greater numbers of criminal defendants. The Chinese authorities have committed to promoting law-based governance and to the creation of a modern and prosperous society, but these goals are impossible to achieve when the full range of human rights is not guaranteed. There can be no sustainable development without a fair justice system and without freedom of expression for all. This continues to be our message to the Chinese authorities and we will keep raising all these individual cases until justice is finally done.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 89, "date": "2018-01-18.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": " — The debate has ended.

By means of all kinds of delay manoeuvres, President Kabila is still sitting on his throne, and unfortunately blood continues to flow through the streets of so many Congolese cities. At the end of 2017, this bloodshed reached absolute low, when a demonstration led by the Congolese church was crackled down. Particularly tragic, especially because the church has always played a conciliatory and constructive role. The European condemnation of violence was appropriate, but it was simply too short.

We have been regularly discussing the DRC here, every six months since mid-2016, and you have passed resolutions expressing grave concerns, which have unfortunately been growing with time. The international community has been worriedly watching, over the past couple of years, one of the largest countries in Africa edging towards collapse due to a compounded political, security, humanitarian and socioeconomic crisis. The Council has also been paying attention to the DRC. On 11 December 2017, Foreign Ministers adopted EU conclusions that assess, without any indulgence, the situation in the country and clearly set the strategic course for the months to come. In the meantime, the Commission, through its humanitarian aid department ECHO, is responding to the growing needs of the 13 million Congolese affected by the humanitarian crisis, including 4.35 million internally displaced persons and 1.9 million undernourished children.  The EU is very aware of the importance of monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation in a country in crisis. It has repeatedly emphasised that human rights monitoring and reporting is a crucial part of the mandate of United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and especially the UN’s Joint Human Rights Office in Kinshasa. The EU promotes regular coverage of DRC issues at the UN Human Rights Council. We were at the forefront in pushing, at the 35th session of the Council in June 2017, for a resolution on the investigation into the events in Kasai. The EU has also internalised in EU law the EU—UN sanctions regime, targeting perpetrators of human rights abuses in the Great Lakes Region. Development aid is carried out through projects which are constantly evaluated and in which funds are set aside for specific purposes. They are currently focusing on food security, health and infrastructure development. EU aid is indeed already focused on supporting the population of the DRC. It should be noted that the EU does not provide budget support to the Congolese Government. Having recourse to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement would create huge transaction costs for alternative delivery mechanisms. National systems delivering basic social services cannot function on NGO support alone. The impact of EU support to the health system and to rural development benefits the poor, ordinary people of the DRC, who should not be victimised. As you know, there are complex and entrenched causes for the chronic fragility in the Congo, not least linked to the governance of strategic natural resources. There is, however, international consensus around one issue. Elections are needed to end the current political situation, whereby President Kabila has stayed one full year beyond the end of his mandate. In that context, the European Union has chosen to work closely with the United Nations, the African Union and other essential partners so as to speak and act as one in this direction. There is now a calendar, with elections planned for 23 December 2018; there is a budget; voter registration has made progress; and there is a wealth of technical support provided to the Congo. Yet many possible hurdles could still emerge, representing as many occasions to divert the country from this key objective. Security threats have recently resurfaced in Kasai and with the unprecedented massacre of 15 Tanzanian UN peace-makers in the east on 7 December. We have to be careful and ensure that, while MONUSCO is empowered to respond and neutralise negative forces, there is no manipulation and no distraction. For elections to be credible, full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms is also needed, as well as clear confidence—building measures on the part of the Congolese authorities. The incidents of 31 December 2017, with the disproportionate use of force by security forces, constitute a sombre development that you rightly stigmatised in the resolution tabled, as did the international community, including the African Union. In conclusion, I reiterate the EU’s commitment to contribute to the stabilisation of this crucial country in Africa. In order to do so, we shall be ready to use not only dialogue and constructive support but also the sanctions instrument, if and when that proves to be the only effective way to create incentives for an environment conducive to elections.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 115, "date": "2018-01-18.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": " The debate has ended.

I would like to present this major interpellation on the snow crab fishing conflict with Norway on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries. Today, after the last round of negotiations with Norway and after the Council of Ministers, we already have the answers to two of the three questions I posed before. First of all, the European Commission never truly intended to include the snow crab as the sub-protocol to the EU-Norway Agreement and nor did some of the Member States that are beneficiaries of this agreement support such an idea at all. Also, having no other recommendations from the European Commission, the Council has decided to roll over its decision from last year about the creation of a European snow crab fishery sector. I presume such a decision was again based on the formal recommendation of the legal services of the European Commission and the Council. So again, this new sector has been included in the tax and quotas regulation, but just on paper for the moment. This decision cannot be implemented by Member States because European fishermen are being prevented from operating by Norwegian authorities. This is not only the result of the unilateral action of this third country but also because the European Commission failed in the negotiations with Norway and also failed in internal dialogue with the Member States. The Commission failed to find a practical solution that would let the European fleet start catching snow crab immediately. As a result, European fishermen continue to lose out and Norway is still disrespecting the European Union as a partner. In this situation, the first of the three questions addressed to European Commission still needs a very clear answer. Let me repeat it again. How does the Commission intend to proceed to obtain a fair solution allowing EU vessels to fish for snow crab in Svalbard? Taking this opportunity, I wish to address one additional issue. Following very carefully this case for years now I cannot resist the impression that all the parties participating in this discussion are focusing on the legal side and their own interests only, and are forgetting the environmental aspect of this matter. According to scientific researchers, the self-producing population of this invasive species is migrating from the eastern to western part of Barents Sea towards Svalbard. The biomass and density of the snow crab is increasing and is expected to reach a level close to the estimated carrying capacity of the Barents Sea. Snow crab is spreading and may threaten the Barents Sea’s fragile benthic ecosystem. The conclusion seems to be obvious. It would be wrong to take a purely political or business-driven approach to the present and future commercial exploitation of snow crab. Appropriate and exhaustive measures should be agreed and based on the most recent scientific and catch data. By blocking the European Union’s efforts to enable European vessels to collect catch and scientific data, Norway is increasing the risk of damaging this ecosystem. Having mentioned this, I insist that all parties to today’s discussion should seek common ground for cooperation and compromise to enlarge necessary knowledge about the snow crab population, for the sake of the necessary protection of the Barents Sea ecosystem. To conclude, I would like to add one more thing. We have to respect the law, that’s the bottom line. We have to respect the law that is in place. According to international procedures, international treaties, I think, we have the higher ground, we the Europeans and Member States who are party to the Paris Treaty, which is in effect. That being said, I believe that if we cannot reach the proper conclusions in a very short time, maybe it will be time to move forward with legal action against Norway. I would like to avoid this situation, but maybe it will be the only way to convince our partners in Norway to respect and uphold the law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 148, "date": "2018-01-18.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Wałęsa as well for his remarks. The Commission concluded its annual consultations with Norway on 2018 fishing opportunities at the beginning of last December. On 13 December, the Council reached an agreement on tax and quotas for 2018, which also reflects the agreement with Norway.  Today’s debate on the snow crab fishing disagreement between the EU and Norway is therefore particularly timely. It gives me the opportunity to reassure you that the Commission has been working very hard to try to come to a practical arrangement with Norway which would allow the unblocking of the current situation. Several contacts with Norway took place at different levels, even since the seizure of the Latvian vessel ‘Senator’ in January 2017. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, no satisfactory solution has been reached so far. Let me now reply precisely to the three questions raised in your major interpellation. You first asked the Commission how it intends to proceed to obtain a fair solution allowing EU vessels to fish for snow crab in Svalbard; secondly, you asked what action the Commission would recommend to the Council for 2018; and thirdly, you asked whether we would include snow crab in the annual EU-Norway consultations. I think the three questions are very closely linked, so let me start by confirming the EU’s legal position. Our position is that the parties to the Treaty of Paris have a right to non-discriminatory access to snow crab in the waters of Svalbard. As you know, this position is not shared by Norway. Norway’s legal position is that the continental shelf around Svalbard is part of the Norwegian continental shelf and only Norway can authorise fishing for snow crab there.  Since the seizure of the Latvian vessel in early 2017, we have firmly defended our legal position. We remain convinced that the right solution would be for Norway to allow EU vessels to fish for snow crab in Svalbard under the same conditions as Norwegian vessels. However, our Norwegian partners see this differently. Therefore, what the Commission has been trying to do for more than a year now is to come to a pragmatic arrangement with Norway that would allow the resumption of fishing activities for snow crab without prejudice to the EU’s legal position. All this while still maintaining our good working relations with Norway as a key partner for fisheries. One of your questions suggest that we could have included snow crab in the annual EU-Norway consultations. These consultations took place during the last week of November last year as part of the preparations for the December Fisheries Council. This possibility was indeed explored with Member States ahead of the consultations. During the Fisheries Council in October, ministers exchanged views on the upcoming annual consultations between the European Union and Norway. However, no request was made to include snow crab fisheries in these consultations. I have to stress that linking Svalbard to our bilateral agreement with Norway – which is essentially about exchanges of quotas and access rights – would imply giving up the European Union’s legal position. Under the Treaty of Paris, there should not be any compensation for access to snow crab around Svalbard. As a part of these consultations, Norway did indeed offer 500 tons of snow crab which could be fished on the entire Norwegian continental shelf. Member States, however, rejected the idea of an exchange. Consequently snow crab was not included in the agreed quota exchanges for this year 2018. So, what action has the Commission recommended to the Council for 2018? Our proposal for the fishing opportunities regulation maintained the same language concerning snow crab as the regulation for 2017: namely, it contains a recital asserting our interpretation of this Svalbard Treaty and the provision granting 20 fishing authorisations to EU vessels. On 13 December, the Council reached a political agreement on the basis of this proposal. However, the Commission has also emphasised that the position of Norwegian authorities on this matter is unlikely to change in the near future. Therefore, operators wishing to operate in this fishery in 2018 should be duly informed of the risks that this may entail. Member States should warn interested operators of the risks involved before issuing the licenses for this fishery. Indeed, Norway has already reacted to the inclusion of fishing authorisations for snow crab in the 2018 fishing opportunities regulation. They reiterated their protest, repeated their legal position, and argued that any license issued without Norway’s consent is without legal effect. The Norwegian Fisheries Minister has also publicly stated that he considers this the end of the informal talks on snow crab. Considering the Norwegian reaction, it is now unlikely that we will find a solution soon which would allow for the resumption of fishing activities for snow crab in the area in the near future in line with our position on Svalbard.

This is an eye-catching headline that perfectly summarizes the situation and makes it current again, even a year later. And I think it's not quite fair — you said it. I want to think that the European Commission is trying. But it's very alarming. European fishermen feel totally discriminated against foreign operators and abandoned by the same authorities that we constantly ask them to comply with strict European Union legislation. Twenty vessels, having made large investments following the European Union's decision to authorise them to fish in 2017, have since remained in port, among others, the Spanish vessel Adexe Primero, while Norwegian vessels continue to catch this valuable resource. Many jobs and families in the European Union are directly dependent on this activity and have no alternative. Norway's aggressive attitude and intimidation, which provocatively refuses to comply with international agreements, are politically and legally unacceptable. The Norwegian courts have also said that they are illegitimate and contrary to Norway's international obligations. I understand that the Commission is trying to find a pragmatic solution — said the Commissioner — with Norway that will allow us to continue fishing without questioning the position on the interpretation of applicable international law. However, while it is important to maintain that position of the European Union, it is equally important to find a viable solution for our operators. The Commission must certainly continue its efforts towards such a pragmatic solution, but it cannot be passive and, above all, it cannot be so precarious. Actions should be carried out at the highest level. The situation is very serious and urgent action needs to be taken.

In practice, the question is not just about snow crabs, but also about control of Arctic mineral resources As a signatory to the Svalbard Treaty, the EU has the right to issue licenses for the harvesting of snow crabs. In 2016 the European Commission explicitly issued such licenses to 11 Latvian vessels, more than to any other EU Member State. This practice will have further implications and will go further than just crabs. Soon we will have to speak about petroleum, minerals and gas on the continental shelf surrounding Svalbard. Climate change will lead to changes in the Arctic landscape and will uncover new resources. In addition, new maritime routes will appear in the region, which will affect the major economic interests of all the signatories of the Svalbard Treaty. Colleagues, if you fail to arrive at a sustainable agreement with Norway on snow crabs we are going to have much more important disputes with Norway and other signatories of the Svalbard Treaty, like the United Kingdom and Japan, for example. A lot has changed since 1920 when the treaty was signed, and the time has come to create new arrangements. In many aspects, Norway is closely integrated into EU policies. Despite not being a Member State of the EU, Norway is a part of the EU variable geometry and represents many characteristics we require from our European Member States. Losing this balance would mean jeopardising the close partnership and relations constructed during the last decades. The EU urgently needs an agreement with Oslo on a specific legislative scheme for snow crab fishing, otherwise strong confrontation will arise and others will take the EU’s position as an international trading partner. In addition, this situation calls into question the importance of the EU regulations in fisheries sectors. We cannot deprive our businesses of new opportunities related to snow crabs just because our legislative framework is incomplete. The European Commission must guarantee the legitimate rights of the Member States granted licenses for fishing snow crab in Svalbard waters. The situation where EU vessels stay in ports out of fear of being arrested is unacceptable. (The speaker continues in Latvian) 2017. gada janvārī saistībā ar sniega krabju zveju Norvēģijas teritoriālās Svalbāras (Špicbergenas) ūdeņos arestēts Latvijas zvejas kuģis “Senators”.

Saskaņā ar 1920. gada Špicbergenas vienošanos arhipelāgs atrodas norvēģu suverenitātes zonā, tomēr valstis, kuras parakstījušas vienošanos, ir tiesīgas izmantot dabas resursus, tostarp arī tos, kas atrodas teritoriālajos ūdeņos.  Eiropas Savienība nav veikusi nekādus pasākumus sakarā ar Latvijas kuģa arestu un nepievērš lietai praktiski nekādu uzmanību. Latvijas krabju ķērāju zaudējumi sasniedz ap 100 miljoniem euro, un kopā ar nesaņemto peļņu tie ir mērāmi aptuveni ap 200 miljonos euro.  Latvijas minētais precedents ir ieguvis arī diplomātisku nokrāsu. Esam nonākuši pie tā, ka norvēģi uzskata Latvijas zvejniekus par maluzvejniekiem, bet mūsējie norvēģus — par pirātiem. Man ir ļoti žēl, kolēģi, ka Eiropas Komisijas neiesaistīšanās dēļ šīs problēmas risināšana starp Latviju un Norvēģiju notika divpusējā kārtībā un tikai aiz slēgtām durvīm. Norvēģijas pozīcija ir izskaidrojama ar bažām, ka neierobežota sniega krabju zvejniecība Špicbergenas ūdeņos var radīt precedentu, kas ļaus pēc tam ārzemju kompānijām patvaļīgi izmantot resursus. Tomēr sniega krabju jautājums nav jāizskata kā spiediena mēģinājums uz Norvēģiju.  Eiropas Savienībai ir jāieņem stingra pozīcija un jāaizstāv Eiropas zvejnieki no turpmākiem zaudējumiem, un ir jāgarantē Norvēģijai, ka tālāka resursu ieguve tiks saskaņota atsevišķas vienošanās ietvaros.

If we do not agree about snow crabs now, it will be extremely difficult to arrive at a beneficial agreement on the EU’s resources.

It seems to me that the problem presented in the interpellation is of purely legal nature. Under Article 2 of the Treaty of Paris, it is permissible for States as parties to the treaty to be able to fish and hunt freely in islands and territorial waters, which also applies to crabs. The treaty also states that the Norwegian Government has the right to take legal action and actually to protect nature and fishing grounds, provided that the restrictions introduced cover each of the countries covered by the treaty in an equal way. The Treaty also gives the possibility of organizing enterprises that may be assumed by entities originating in the countries that have ratified the Treaty, where the principle of equality with the prohibition of organizing monopolies is also in force. All countries that are parties to the treaty have the right to both fish in territorial waters and to possibly extract oil or gas under the seabed, however they should abide by Norwegian law. It is worth pointing out that the European Union as a whole does not constitute a party to the treaty and the fact that almost all EU countries have ratified this treaty does not change anything from a legal point of view. The Union, as such, is not an entity of any rights provided for in the treaty, which is probably the reason that Norwegians oppose fishing made there by vessels of Member States that had licences issued by the European Union, rather than by the State in question as a party of the treaty. Each of the countries that ratified the treaty can use the opportunities, as exemplified by the action of Norway and the Russian Federation, which mine coal there, or Poland, which has its own research station on Spitsbergen.

Norway is our partner and friend. In many ways we have intertwined interests and of course I can understand sometimes some situations that mean one kind of isolationism and egoism and their own protection. However, she does not comply with anything. That's the main problem. That is why we expect you, Mr. Commissioner, we expect the European Commission to protect the interests of fishermen, European fishermen, in that area, in that sea that is close to our continent, near our shores and that our fishermen be protected and that the snow crab is part of the right to fish and in the area Svalbard. I, Mr. Commissioner, cannot be abducted by the impression that the fines received or received by the Latvian fisherman are somewhat similar to what is happening, unfortunately, between the two members of the European Union, between Croatia, from which I come, and dear, friendly, neighbouring Slovenia. For the last few months, Slovenian police, the Slovenian authorities, have been issuing fines to Croatian fishermen. It is between the two members of the European Union. The European Commission is unresponsive, it is mute and it is not good for fisheries policy, good neighbourly relations, friendship between member states. We have to do something here. We expect you, Mr. Commissioner, and of you from the Commission to act and react, because this is an unsustainable situation at this time in that part of the Adriatic. Also, when we talk about an important topic that is directly related to fisheries, which is a question of ecology of the sea, it is clear that in this case when we talk about snow crab we have a situation where invasive species that come mainly from the east almost eat everything they come across. However, we, on the other hand, must also have an answer to such topics because we have not done enough to protect our seas. The other day we had a report from Mr. Mato in which any variety of environmental themes from the protection of underachievable fish. I voted for the possibility of fishing nets to swimmers, I voted for many things that are directly related to ecology and help ecosystems in the sea. However, I think that we have to put our hand on our hearts and tell ourselves that we have not done enough, even in the case of Norway, the Adriatic and many situations we have found ourselves in and that is why I expect you to react really quickly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 153, "date": "2018-01-18.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "   – Mr President, this, in many respects, is extraordinary. Here we have a situation where we have an international agreement going all the way back to 1920, where fishing boats from the European Union are entitled to equal access to the Svalbard fishing resources and they are being denied it. And it seems that we cannot or will not do anything about it. This just isn’t acceptable, especially with a country like Norway, which while not being in the European Union has all the benefits, as such, of the European Union. You would, therefore, imagine it would be obliged to uphold the rules and laws, especially in relation to a treaty that, as I said, goes back to 1920. If another country decided something else: let’s say within the European Union, if a country said: ‘we don’t believe in the free movement of people, we’re not going to do it’, our legal advice is that this shouldn’t be the case, and yet they just continue on. This is where I agree with my colleagues Jarosław and Mr Mato, that the European Commission has to be stronger in this. It is not their fault. It is Norway’s fault, but we have to look to them to solve the problem. And, with respect to the Commissioner saying that Norway is unlikely to change in the future, and therefore the 20 vessels that Mr Mato spoke about should really not bother going up there, because they could be, like the Latvian vessel, Senator, arrested, ordered to pay a seizure fine of EUR 100 000 and fined afterwards. So that is your advice to them? Who stands for these people? These are people who want to have a livelihood. Snow crab fishing is their livelihood, and we are saying ‘oh, we’re the powerful European Union which represents 500 million people’, but when a little country like Norway won’t comply with us so our advice to you is ‘sorry lads, wait until Norway changes its mind’. This is ridiculous and I think that there must be some way outside of the confines of Commissioner Vella’s portfolio to broaden this issue, and to say to Norway ‘you have benefits in the European Union, now if you don’t comply with this agreement, we’re going to have to look at those’. That is the only way, because if we wait for them to change their mind, as the Commissioner said, we will be disappointed: they’re as happy as Larry now because they have what they want. Our boats will not go there. We tell them not to go there because Norway won’t accept it, and that’s just what Norway wants. So either we decide to do something about it or we stop talking about it. One or the other. I’m not blaming Commissioner Vella; we should be supporting him and using all the powers of the European Union to get this solved, because the European Union is about everybody, big and small.

I understand that we are involved in a big legal battle with Norway, and I believe that we can find enough good lawyers to win this battle. If we cannot we can fire the existing ones and find better ones. In the meantime, our fishermen are losing jobs and money, and the small Latvian company which owns the ship, which has been held for more than a year now, has incurred direct losses of more than EUR 2 million. This undermines our trust, and the trust of our citizens, in the European Commission’s work and the European Union. For a long time now, they have been unable to solve this issue or implement their promises. If we are, through our regulation, giving a permit for licenses we should implement this law and abide by it. While you are waging these battles and trying to find a pragmatic solution, you also have to find the courage to pay money and compensation to these fishermen. We will sort out who will ultimately pay whom afterwards. However, besides the legal issues, there is also the necessity of covering those expenses which people are seeing every minute, hour and year.

To protect the interests of our fishermen, we have been working at each stage of the process, in close cooperation with Member States. Every step has been prepared and established by consulting all Member States and keeping them regularly informed. We were not able to conclude successfully, partly because of the narrow margins of manoeuver defined by Member States, and partly because Norway focused on one single solution, which is a quota exchange for the entire Norwegian continental shelf.  You should nevertheless appreciate that we managed to preserve our position on Svalbard, as requested by Member States, and that we managed to avoid an escalation. In particular, we were able to conclude successful bilateral fisheries arrangements for 2018 to the satisfaction of Member States and Norway.  I think a number of you, including Mr Wałęsa, asked why the European Union was not taking Norway to court. Here I would like to underline, as MEP Krupa, mentioned that the European Union is not party to the Paris Treaty and therefore it cannot take Norway to court for non-compliance with that treaty. Mr Pabriks also mentioned the issue of compensation. Direct compensation for such losses is not possible under any of the EU funds in this case. However, the EMFF can assist fishermen who want to seek other fishing opportunities to adapt their vessels and gears so as to avoid staying idle in port.  The issues, and this has also been pointed out by Mr Mamikins, at stake around Svalbard go beyond fisheries interests and are too important to allow the conflict to drift towards an escalation, so prudence is important. From our side, we are prepared to continue the talks with Norway, but obviously we will need to wait for a new window of opportunity.  I would like to conclude by thanking you very much for your kind attention and, as Mr Kelly mentioned, your support as well.
