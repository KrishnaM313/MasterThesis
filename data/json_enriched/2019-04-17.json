It is indeed necessary today to considerably improve the situation concerning the freedom of movement of workers in the European Union, since we are faced with the following paradox: a market allowing freedom of movement, but very different social systems, therefore fragile situations for workers in terms of rights protection and portability of rights. That was, and still is, the whole point of this review. We worked for over a year in Parliament and we have made, I believe, three major breakthroughs. The first, which is absolutely essential, is the strengthening of the applicable legislation, that is to say, knowing what is the applicable law for a mobile worker - posted workers, for example, but they are not the only ones. For this, one question is essential today: to ensure that a worker is effectively affiliated to a social security system and that he enjoys all of his rights. This is why we proposed that there be three months of prior work before being able to be sent to another country, to ensure the affiliation link between a worker and a social security system, and that of course to avoid the fraud we know is so massive. Likewise, another proposal was accepted: the prior notification by a company of the dispatch of a worker to another country. This is absolutely essential today because, as we know, a large part of the workers sent to another country are not even known in that country. Certain national laws, in particular, admit that within a certain period, there is no need for any document to go to work in another country and that no control can be done. This is, I believe, a serious attack on the dignity of workers, their security, their right to be affiliated to a social security system. This is the reason for this notification proposal. The improvement of cooperation between states was also desired by Parliament, in particular through a very original system which combines coercion on Member States by posting a deposit and freedom of movement. This provides great flexibility, especially in the ability of workers to move from one border to another. Social justice measures are also proposed, in particular through the six months of exportation of unemployment benefits, because how can we imagine that someone can work for years in a country and that when he leaves, he does not only entitled to three months of exporting unemployment benefits? Six months is better; it may not be enough, but it already is. We had obviously also imagined, for frontier workers, this freedom of affiliation to the social security system, which is a big step forward. I want to say the following, especially and mainly to the right, to the right, but not only: do not think that it is by imitating populism and nationalism that you are going to respond to populism and nationalism. It is even sometimes such a paradox that some nationalists have become wiser than you on matters of the coordination of social security systems. Stop this permanent parliamentary obstruction, let the debate take place, let us vote so that we, as Parliament, can have a strong position for the next term. So, yes, let's vote for this proposal at first reading. For the future, I would like to give the Commissioner - whom I thank for all the work she has done - my full agreement that the coordination regulation will henceforth be revised by a simple majority in the Council, in order to remove the blockages observed, in particular no later than two weeks ago. This would be a major step forward for European workers, who could finally be protected against national egoisms.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am pleased to be here for this debate on the revision of the regulations on social security coordination. Fifteen years after the last revision, this Commission has proposed a new and necessary modernisation. That modernisation is much needed to address new challenges and opportunities in the fields of long-term care, unemployment benefits, family benefits and the rules on applicable legislation for posted workers. We adopted our proposal more than two years ago in order to ensure fairness in the free movement of workers and citizens in the internal market. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Guillaume Balas, and the many Members of the Parliament who deeply invested in this file, to bring about the improvements that our citizens, our workers and our businesses are waiting for. Facilitating parental leave allowances for mobile citizens, clarifying the right of citizens in need of long-term care, giving job seekers more opportunities to find work abroad – these are some examples on how the proposed modernisation would improve citizens’ daily life. For me, honourable Members, it has always been essential to coordinate social security systems with rules that are clear, fair and enforceable. This is indeed the only way to secure continued support for our internal markets. Fairness means that the rules are equitable to all and not designed to benefit one category of stakeholders to the detriment of the others. It means taking into account the interests of both the Member States of origin and the receiving Member States. Fairness means rules that allow mobile citizens and workers to move to another country in proper conditions and take into account the interests of taxpayers and the interest in maintaining adequate social security systems. Fairness means for me also preserving the business opportunities for all the companies and the self-employed that make use of free movement in good faith to serve clients across Europe, be it businesses or consumers. And fairness also means preserving and improving tools to fight abuses and fraud. These are the principles on which we have based our proposal.  These have also been the objectives that have guided us throughout the interinstitutional negotiations with the Parliament and the Council. The provisional agreement that we reached in trilogues has not been confirmed, because there was no sufficient majority amongst the Member States. But I believe that the compromise that we reached should inspire us for the work that remains to be done.  Mr President, dear rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs, Members of Parliament, this Parliament now has the opportunity to agree on its position in first reading and thereby open the way for further progress in this important file. I count on your constructive spirit and on our shared motivation to make good use of this opportunity. This is what our citizens, our workers and our businesses expect from us.

In my view, one of the most important laws is the coordination of social security systems. That has really taken Europe a long way. In doing so, we are essentially regulating the free movement of workers, one of the basic ideas of our united Europe. In my opinion, however, too little time was given to us MEPs for this important and very extensive law. The Commission also presented the legislative proposal relatively late. It is of course difficult to get a fair result before the European elections. We had to vote in committee under great time pressure, and there was not enough time for the trialogue either - obviously too little time to find a result that the Council could also have agreed to. But there are positive things that we also achieved in the trialogue. For example, we now also have coordination rules for long-term care, we have an important exception for secondments, namely the exceptions for business trips, so that we also continue to enable short-term secondments. But there are also downsides. I don't like the idea that, according to the European Parliament, you should in future unsubscribe from every posting. The idea is actually well meant, but can probably only be implemented with modern technology and digitization. An example: If you as a teacher are planning a school trip to a neighboring country - is that already a posting or not? The committee's report also goes too far on the issue of unemployment benefits. The export services have already been mentioned, or the topic of cherry-picking, which we can get if we introduce the right to vote on the topic of cross-border commuters in the future. We did find out in the trialogue result, but the trialogue result is not up for voting here. I think we could get a better result. We need more time for this in the new parliament, after the European elections.

In the Netherlands we have seen two major cases of organized fraud involving unemployment benefits in recent years. Employees must be able to be sure that everyone contributes and that no one receives an unfair benefit, because the employees pay for it through the contributions. In this proposal, the obligation to apply for a job and being available for the labor market will in practice disappear. The extension of the transferability of unemployment benefits also contributes to an export carousel. One half year employers hire people, but the other half year the contract is not renewed and people are referred to benefits.

In addition, there must be a minimum period of days worked before foreign workers can claim our unemployment benefits. It is perfectly logical that non-Belgian workers have first contributed sufficiently to Belgian social security before they are entitled to unemployment benefits. That is why I stand by the Commission proposal of at least three months of work before people can receive benefits. Six months work requirement would be even better. But the opposite is true: the left would like to limit the work requirement to one day, which is utter madness. In this way you undermine support for our social security. The left also wants to allow jobseekers to take their unemployment benefits with them when they move back to their country of origin. But this makes the control of activation completely impossible. This encourages abuse. Statistics also show that a significant number of people who return to their own country do not find work within three months. Why should they also search?

The draft agreement at trilogue had a number of positive elements, but the Council could not support it.

We do not agree that frontier workers can choose which social security system they will benefit from. This would cause huge uncertainty for Member States and undermine the social contract between cross—border workers and national workers. We don’t support one aggregation.

It seems to me, after listening to you, that some of my colleagues here in Parliament do not want to understand the basic principle of the coordination of social security systems. The point is that claims that have been acquired are recognized when you move to another country - nothing else. Anyone who says: You can only get entitlements if I have paid into the respective national system in which I work, is precisely misunderstanding this basic principle. We can then stop even wanting to talk about a social union. Please finally commit yourself! Stop using all kinds of tricks to prevent a debate about the position of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee in the vote. I think that's undemocratic. We can change it if the majority want it. But simply ending the debate and not wanting to have a vote in this legislature has nothing to do with parliamentary democracy. This cherry-picking is destroying the European Union. Free movement must apply to all people in the European Union. It must be socially secure for everyone. That's what we're talking about here. The majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has reached a very progressive position. We put them up for debate. This can be voted on. On the left, we are voting in favor because there should be a longer export of unemployment benefits - six months. We are voting in favor because loopholes for social security fraud in posting will be closed. And we also vote in favor because care services are coordinated as an independent service. But we are particularly against the fact that some - especially conservatives and right-wing extremists - are trying to enforce child benefit indexation. Eastern European women - in Germany, for example - should receive less child benefit if their children stay at home in Poland or Romania. These people are supposed to be discriminated against - people who work hard, who have paid up, who pay for their benefits, who pay taxes and social security contributions, and who also want to visit their children at home. We will reject this indexing. Finally, on the question of social equality: we must defend social equality for all EU citizens in Parliament. Nobody should be treated as a second class EU citizen. That must apply to unemployment benefits. If someone has deposited in one country, it has to be recognized in another.

We voted through that agreement, now Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, in the final plenary week of that parliamentary term. I had hoped by the time I had finished my time in Parliament to be voting through a similar agreement with Council on the latest update, but unfortunately that’s not going to be the case due to big divisions in Council. And why not? Because I believe this file has become a mix of narrow national political interests and people trying to use the regulation to fix problems which are not its core business.  My political group has tried to keep the citizen as the person concerned in the language of the text at the centre of that approach, and those citizens are not only workers, family members, students, travellers, but anyone covered by a social security system and in a cross—border situation. We welcome the clear inclusion of long-term care in the updated regulation, but we start from the belief that the overwhelming majority of citizens and their employers want to stay on the right side of the rules and thus protect their entitlements, so it helps if the rules are clear and as easy as possible to follow, with a degree of flexibility that reflects and assists daily life. It also helps if there is an effective administration that responds quickly and assists people, rather than acting as a bureaucratic barrier that pushes people to take chances.  Generally, we support the committee report. The only amendment – Amendment 197 – that we’ve reintroduced concerns this blessed A1 form, an attestation and not a permission, and we’ve proposed the issuing of an open A1, valid for three months, so that an individual who travels often on business doesn’t have to make multiple applications that are time-consuming for the person concerned and the administration.  As regards the other amendments tabled, we don’t support the indexation of family benefits.

I regret any attempt to put artificial obstacles for Eastern European workers in their access to social benefits in the old Member States.

The Brexit drama that we are currently witnessing in Great Britain did not start with the referendum just three years ago. For decades there was really systematic hate speech against the European Union, and especially in the last few years against EU citizens who live in Great Britain. This debate was very often based on a discussion about the indexing of child benefit - a debate of envy that does absolutely nothing to social equality in Great Britain, but only poisons the social climate and divides society. I want to be very clear: indexing child benefit would not solve a single problem of social injustice in Great Britain or in other European countries, it would only result in inequality of workers and create more bureaucracy. Therefore: if we want to live in a united and social Europe, then we must reject the indexing of child benefit. At the same time, however, we must also realize that we have to do a lot more for social justice within the European Union. Because the regions in Great Britain that are hardest hit by social inequality and poverty are also the ones that voted most in favor of Leave in the referendum. For a long time the EU has not done enough to prevent workers and citizens from being played off against each other. We have to realize that the conditions for a Brexit are in place in all member states of the European Union. Growing social inequality combined with agitation against the European Union is an absolutely explosive mixture.

It is also important for migrant workers to extend the period during which they can export acquired unemployment benefits from three to six months.

In the case of posted workers, we should avoid significant changes. Companies providing services abroad are facing huge administrative burdens and new regulations resulting from the new Posting of Workers Directive.

That will be a thing of the past. Still, I will abstain tomorrow. I do this because of a specific Belgian situation. I do not agree with the scheme that only up to one month of unemployment benefits would be paid. I agreed more with Commissioner Thyssen's proposal.

The three biggest problems are the following: firstly, the right to unemployment benefits from day one. How much connection do you really have with a country's labor market if you have only been employed there for a short time? I think that the connection to the labor market you came from is greater, therefore a longer earning period, preferably 3 months. Secondly, the right to export unemployment benefits for 6 months. There are varying degrees of labor market policies that are very negatively affected by this. And there is no evidence that an increase in the export of unemployment benefits increases the number of jobs. Therefore, we determine to stick to 3 months export.

That's because of unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are important. People who receive them must be returned to work as soon as possible. That is good for them and for society as a whole. So good for all of us. So there must be enough real incentives to actively look for work. We see that those incentives are simply lacking in the export of unemployment benefits. To give an example: in the Netherlands we export about 4,000 unemployment benefits per year. Of those four thousand, 0.6 percent actually find a new job during the period of export. 0.6 percent: that's an absurdly low figure.

Britain’s social security system is based on need, and not on contributions as it is on the continent. In France, for example, you can only draw out what you pay into the system. If you have not paid in, you can’t draw out. This is why migrants queue at Calais to go to the United Kingdom but they are not queuing at Dover to come to Calais. This is because the social security system is more open to people who have just arrived.  There’s nothing wrong in that. Our system is good for the system we’ve got. Your system is good for what you have. But the trouble is, the two systems are utterly incompatible. Any change to that system could bankrupt Britain’s social security system, which is one of the major reasons we voted for Brexit. We are basically concerned that it would bankrupt our social security system and put enormous stress on our health service, which is also free at point of use so people can just turn up and use the system.  This creates problems. It means that we could never have a true integration of these systems. And why should we? Why should we not have competition throughout Europe? Why should we all have some monosyllabic Soviet system which is decided by the European Council or decided by the Commission? That really isn’t going to work.  We need to have competition in wages. We have to have competition in everything. That’s what makes a vibrant economy and why the British economy is booming, despite Brexit, and the European economy is not doing very well at all. The euro looks as if it’s in a very bad state. Even Deutsche Bank is having problems and the Italian banks are all on the rocks. So, all in all, our system does seem to be superior.  Any attempt to try and make all the systems in Europe exactly the same is going to lead to one thing: a form of, I don’t know, Soviet communism, whatever.

Sure, it may not be the best option, but let's compare - nothing with what this report brings new. It's a compromise, I say. We must stop having cases like Austria, which has diminished and is now in violation.

We proposed a modernisation of the rules on social security coordination two and half years ago, so well in time, and we launched the proposal because we need to preserve the social protection of the increasing group of mobile citizens.  In the context of increased labour mobility and major demographic changes, the existing rules must be updated to adequately protect citizens’ rights. Free movement of workers only exists if mobile workers preserve their social protection.  The modernisation will provide the national administrations with better tools to fight fraud and abuses. Citizens and employers will greatly benefit from the clear deadlines that we wish to introduce for cooperation between national administrations, national authorities, and I also mentioned the legal certainty that we owe to our citizens, to workers and businesses that exercise their free movement.  These are all reasons why we cannot afford to postpone the modernisation of the coordination of social security rules and the Commission therefore counts on this Parliament to adopt a position in first reading that shows our citizens and workers and businesses alike that we care about social security rights and that we care about a good functioning of our internal market, because indeed coordination of social security systems is crucial for free movement, and free movement of workers, the self-employed and companies is crucial for the internal market. I trust that this Parliament will show citizens, up to the last day of its mandate, that their rights also count. That this Parliament will show Europe’s businesses that it understands their needs, and also the needs of the SMEs, and that it will show to all that Europe can deliver.  And if you will allow me, Madam President, to use one more minute of your time: this is my last intervention in a debate in this Parliament and the cooperation between the Commission and the Members of the Parliament, especially the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), has always been excellent.

I wanted to thank you for that. You know what Gandhi said: we think the enemy is hate, when in fact it is fear. I heard a lot of fears in the speeches this morning. Lots of fears which lead to say anything, for example by asserting that allowing the export of only six months of unemployment benefits acquired by working 20 years in a country, it would be a gift which some workers in the Eastern Europe would benefit to the detriment of those in the North or the West. We know that a study by the European Parliament has shown that exporting six months of unemployment benefits makes it possible to integrate better into the labor market and to find work more easily than with three months, but we systematically hear the reverse here! MPs from Northern Europe, Western Europe, do not say a word about the big companies which, for their part, organize social dumping - because it is not the workers of the East who organize the social dumping, it is these very large companies - and do not seek at any time to coerce these large companies in order to ensure effective protection for workers. I can see, then, that it is fear that is ruling, the fear of these large multinationals that you do not dare to confront today, and I find that eminently sad. I am particularly sad to hear some people speak first of the workers of their country rather than of all European workers - and say that among these voices, some, fortunately in the minority, say they are leftist! How can we first talk about our country, the interests of our country, because there are European elections, without first looking at all the workers who share common interests in the face of precisely these large companies, which we know are putting workers in competition with each other to weaken our protections for all? So yes, I appeal to all progressives in this Parliament, to all those who believe that Europe can be synonymous with progress, even that Europe only has meaning if it brings progress for all citizens , regardless of their nationality, that it is on this principle that Europe is founded. So yes, I appeal to them, not by saying that this text is perfect, that it solves everything, but that it is a sign today of unity, progress and peaceful relations between employees, to fight against the unfair competition that we are trying to create between them, in short to ensure that at last Europe and progress are two words that rhyme together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 43, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  Thank you to our rapporteur.

Priekšsēdētāj Junkera kungs! Cienījamās deputātes! Godājamie deputāti! Dāmas un kungi! Draugi! Man ir patiesi milzīgs prieks šodien jūs uzrunāt par tik nozīmīgu tēmu — par Eiropas nākotni. Kā jūs zināt, es gandrīz desmit gadus esmu strādājis šajā parlamentā kā parlamentārietis, un es šo to šajā laikā arī varbūt paguvu iemācīties. Die eine Sache, die ich gelernt habe, ist, dass, wenn man hier eine Rede halten möchte, man sich mindestens in drei Sprachen ausdrücken können muss, sonst geht es nicht. Also das ist jetzt die zweite Sprache. Le français est trop difficile pour moi, malheureusement. Je comprends la langue, mais pour un discours, c’est un petit peu trop difficile.  But I’ll continue in English. This is language four. This is a time of change: the end of the term, the coming of the elections. It really is a time for reflection. But, before we look forward, I want to go a little bit back in history to give a little bit of context. Latvia. Europe. What binds Europeans? Really, when you think about it, it is the shared history coming from Ancient Greece and Rome, through Christianity that spread throughout Europe. As Christianity and this culture had spread throughout Europe, the last remaining outpost were the Baltics that still had not become part, shall we say, of this common shared cultural and religious heritage. It was only at the turn of the 12th and 13th century that the Pope in Rome said ‘OK’ to a crusade against the non—Christians in the Baltics. Since that time, our country has gone through all of the cultural developments, changes and upheavals that the rest of Europe went through, whether it is the Renaissance, the Reformation or the Enlightenment. Today, our country is predominantly, at least historically, a Lutheran country with strong Catholicism in the south east. It is very clear that, through our history, we have been part of the northern European cultural area. We view ourselves as being rather pragmatic, very patient, and – we’d like to think – rational and law-abiding as well. In culture there’s a strong creativity and personal enterprise that always presses its way through. For hundreds of years after the introduction of Christianity, our country faced various periods of political and military occupation, coming at times from Germany at times from Poland, at times from Sweden, and at times from Russia. Throughout this time, of course, we maintained our identity and our language and culture. It was not until the end of the First World War in 1918 that we finally declared our own independence. And it took two more years for the War of Independence to free the country of the remaining German and Russian armies which was still there at the time. If you want a personal family history, my father’s father – my grandfather – entered the Tsarist Army as a soldier for the Tsar, then he became a Bolshevik soldier, fighting the Revolution against Tsar, and then, when his unit heard that our country had declared independence, he came home and became a freedom fighter for independence. A typical history at the time. Our country developed between the wars. Then the Second World War came. It did a lot of damage throughout Europe. That’s where I come into the picture. I am the son of refugees, wartime refugees. My parents were children in 1944 – my mother was eight and my father was 14 – and fled in small boats from Latvia to Sweden. About 5 000 Latvians came to Sweden and about 200 000 fled to Germany as the advancing Soviet army was coming a second time, devastating the country. My parents grew up in Sweden, met and married, and then they emigrated further to the US, where I was born, together with my two sisters. I first came to Latvia in 1984. At the time, I was a high school student in the last refugee school, the Latvian Refugee High School, in Münster in Germany. That’s when I first came to Latvia. It was a different world, a different country. Everything was grey, people didn’t smile on the streets, Soviet soldiers on leave, but everywhere, everything was in Russian. You could see a visible lack of investment in any kind of infrastructure, whether they were buildings or roads or bridges. You could see decay. As Solidarity came in the late 1980s in Poland and the Berlin Wall fell at the end of 1989, change happened in our country as well. We finally regained independence in 1991. In a very short amount of time, we developed democratic institutions, we developed free enterprise, we developed a banking system, and we developed a market economy, basically from scratch. In 2004, only 13 years after regaining independence, we joined the EU and NATO. In a couple of weeks’ time, we’re going to celebrate 15 years since we joined the European Union and I can say, on behalf of my country, we have not regretted a single day since we joined the EU. (Applause) So what is the EU? Well, first of all – and it must be stressed – it is a union of values, freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Historically, in Europe, how were disputes settled? With soldiers, with guns, with rifles, with tanks, and with destruction. How do we do it today? Tiresome debate, discussion votes, but it is a heck of a lot better than the way it was done before. The EU is also about economic development, and at the core of that, is the single market. By opening up our borders to one another, we have created one of the largest markets in the world: over 500 million people, in sheer economic size roughly equivalent to the United States, which is considered the world’s strongest economy. But all is really not well in the EU. All of us know, as politicians, that there’s a lot of anti-EU sentiment going around. There are politicians who are offering very simplistic answers to very complex issues. Generally, they are referred to as populists. My simple message is: don’t fight the populists – it is a worthless endeavour – but try to understand why people are listening to the populists, and why people are unhappy. So why are people unhappy? What happened? Go back 10 years to 2008—2009. A bank collapsed in the US. Ok, they collapse every once in a while. That led into a chain reaction of a banking crisis around the world, especially in Europe. That led to an economic crisis, the biggest we had had since the Great Depression. My own country’s GDP fell by almost one quarter, one of the steepest drops in about a year and a half. Other countries fell as well, maybe not so badly. As we were coming out of the economic crisis, what happened a few years ago? The migration crisis. The unrest in the Middle East. It started as peaceful revolutions that turned into bloody revolutions and then refugees, migrants. The result of all of that is what I would call a political crisis, people losing faith in the system. It’s understandable that they have lost faith. We have to help them regain it. If you look at voters, what are their main concerns? I say there are four: jobs, the way of life – translated into immigration – the environment; and safety and security. To talk about the future of Europe, you need to address all these four issues. So what about jobs? The EU has a mechanism to foster job growth and it is that which is simply referred to as the single market. I think of a story I remember as a child – it may have been one of Aesop’s Fables – where a father has three sons. He gives a stick to one of his sons and says, ‘break this stick’ and the son breaks the stick. Then he gives another stick to the son. The son breaks the stick and he says, ‘well, what’s the difficulty?’ Then he gives the son a whole bundle of sticks together. He says, ‘now break the stick’. He tries and tries again, gives it to a brother, can’t. The third brother – can’t. The simple moral of the story is, when you’re alone, you can be broken easily, like a stick, like a twig. When you’re united, you’re powerful, and that is the beauty of the single market. We have challenges to the single market coming from the outside. There is a rising China and there’s a US whose administration seems to be faltering a little bit in its belief that it has a leading role to play in organising world affairs and world trade. Now, what about China? A country that openly subsidises its huge industries. These industries are coming into Europe and competing with an unfair advantage. At the same time, European companies don’t have equal access to Chinese markets. What’s the answer? I say the answer to unfair competition is not protectionism. We cannot go the way of the Chinese. We should not become more like the Chinese, but demand that the Chinese become more like us in terms of opening up their market. We have a lot of clout as a union and as a single market. This is what we need to use, not as individual sticks, but as that bundle that cannot be broken and can change things in the world. Inside the EU we still have hurdles to overcome and this has to do with the internal barriers still to the single market, especially in the digital sphere, as well as is in the services sphere. Ask yourselves: why are the largest internet companies coming from the US? Why aren’t they European? I think the answer is pretty obvious. The US has a dollar zone, it has a federal government and a federal budget, and it has zero barriers between the states in terms of trade. They have a truly united single market, smaller than ours – 330 million. We have a larger one, but we have too many hurdles. So, if we talk of wanting to have national champions, I don’t think that we should bend our competition laws to artificially create national champions. I think we have to tear down the barriers within the single market to let those champions grow themselves and they can take on the world, they can take on the US, and they can easily take on China. (Applause) One of the cornerstones of the single market is the financial system, the banks. Ten years ago, the biggest threat to the banks was liquidity, so we created a banking union to make sure that the ECB is overseeing the largest banks and to make it safer and ensure that the banks will be there tomorrow morning when we wake up. The world has changed since those ten years. Liquidity is not the main problem. A new problem has emerged, which is terrorism in Europe and the financing of terrorism. How does that often happen? Through illicit funds moving through the European banking system. So where are we on anti-money laundering (AML)? In this House, I was the co—rapporteur, with Ms Sargentini, on the last two AML directives. I learned a thing or two about policy. Anti—money laundering legislation is all about risk assessment and reducing the risk of dirty money entering the system. To the east of Europe, we have a country, a big economy, Russia, and, for the past 20 years, money from Russia has been wanting to flee that country. Why? Because Europe is safe. Europe has the rule of law. In Europe no one takes their money away without going through the courts. You can’t do that. That money wants to come to Europe. Some of it is clean, maybe most of it is clean, but some of it is not clean and those who are working with unclean money, the criminals – I’m not talking about people looking to optimise their tax returns and itemising something that may be an expense or not, I’m talking about hardened criminals that are moving millions of euros – are flying like hawks above the ground and they’re looking at the weak links in the chain: in this country, you can do that, in this country, you can do that, in this country, you can do that. Our country was also part of this chain and not alone. Money laundering is a European problem. Since becoming Prime Minister, I don’t have the patience to wait for all of us to get our act together so I’m cleaning up my house. (Applause) We’re going to have the cleanest and the most resilient banking system in Europe. In one and a half years’ time, we’ll gladly consult anyone in this room in and in this House on how to clean up a banking system, but it is a little bit like fighting rats. I can make sure that I get the rats out of my house and my house will be clean, but what about my neighbours? The criminals may have left Latvia for now, but they have unfortunately – I’m convinced – not left Europe. So we have to clean the whole neighbourhood. That means that anti-money laundering supervision has to be centralised, just as prudential supervision, a very strong and important step forward. (Applause) Another concern of voters is immigration, the way of life. There are no simple answers here. I don’t have them. I don’t think anyone does. The truth is that Europe is a fantastic destination to come to live and to work. We have stable economies, we have stable democracies, we have the rule of law, we have individual freedom, and a lot of our neighbours do not. As autocracy grows, the pressure on wanting to come into the EU will only increase. It will not go away. So we have to learn to deal with it. My country has dealt with a little bit of immigration as well. During the 50 years of Soviet occupation, more than 700 000 people – migrants – arrived in our country. That’s one third of the population. We’re only two million and 700 000 came in. Our government had no say over this because we had no government. It was Moscow making the decisions: fully making the decisions, no co—decision, no say. After regaining independence, how have we dealt with it? With the one big ‘I’ word: integration. You have to work with the people, you have to work on your educational system, bring the people into our culture, bring the immigrants into your cultures. This is the way forward. We cannot fight that. You cannot stop people wanting to come into Europe. We are a preferred destination, but we have to work on integrating these people. But we can do something to mitigate the flows and the obvious answer to that is the outer border, Frontex. This is a wonderful programme that needs to be strengthened. (Applause) Because, if we can show our voters that we control the outer border, then we can have free inner borders and we won’t have the situation of a few years ago where, within the Schengen zone, we remember going between Strasbourg and Germany – those of us who stayed in hotels there – that the bridge was sometimes closed or they were checking every car. This is not the way forward. We need open internal borders for a single market to work, which means we need firm borders on the outside. We will have to fund refugee camps, it is inevitable. We will have to fund development of economies and the rule of law in third countries. This is inevitable. And we have to work on integration. Europe is still a Union of 28 sovereign countries with their own national identities. It’s extremely important that we maintain our national identities, cultures and languages, and we do this through the process of integrating people who have come in. The arrivals have to adapt to our countries because that’s the way of the world, and this is what we need to work on. If we can show that we control the outer borders and we can integrate the arrivals, the voters will become much more relaxed about the entire issue. The third concern: environment. Climate change – I won’t go into it deeply – is real. Mankind’s coal, oil and gas burning is contributing. We need to stop this. So the legislation, the direction, is absolutely correct: reduce CO2 emissions, increase renewables, increase energy efficiency. All of this has to be done. But we have a difficulty, which is that not all Member States have the same kind of energy mix. My own country is just behind Sweden. We are almost at 40% of renewables. We’re way ahead of the curve, but not everyone is ahead of the curve that way. Some countries are very coal-dependent and we cannot just wish fossil fuels away. Someone has to pay for the transition. So we need a little bit of time. Regardless of how quickly we want to move, there’s one structural change that we need to make to make that change faster, and that is again – I’m a single market kind of person – opening up the market in energy to competition. You have to have competition for renewables to advance. I’ll just take one example: the electricity market. Many countries have regulated electricity prices. Consumers pay the same Monday morning, Monday evening, Monday night, Sunday morning, Sunday evening, Sunday night, so no one is motivated to think about when to turn on the dishwasher or the washing machine. It doesn’t matter: you pay the same all the time, so you are not motivated to save. But in those markets where competition has been opened up, you have service providers that help you automatically regulate when you’re buying electricity based upon the price signals. In this way, we can reduce the overall needed capacity to supply the demand peak hours because, during the peak hours, you will be motivated, say, not to have your refrigerator go warmer by one or two degrees. If you can do that for millions of households, the savings are enormous. But you have to have deregulated markets. If you want renewables, you have to have deregulated markets. Competition everywhere. (Applause) The fourth concern: safety and security. It means different things to different Europeans. I think, in the south of Europe, when people think of safety and security, they are thinking about the threat of uncontrolled immigration, migration, terrorism – that’s another threat that people feel – and, in the west of Europe, maybe the biggest threat right now is of an uncontrolled Brexit, not only for trade but also for peace in Northern Ireland, a very, very real concern. I come from Latvia and it is no secret to anyone that, when Latvians think of safety, we think of Russia. Russia is our eastern neighbour – as it is for all of Europe. Russia has a government that has one basic policy: it feels and it is convinced – and it is in their policy papers – that they are surrounded by enemies and always under attack. That is their dogma. That is their belief. So the way that they fight back is to make their enemies weaker. Right now in Europe, the biggest threat from Russia is not military. It’s a threat, but it is not the biggest threat. We have NATO and we have our own preparedness. The biggest threat is the threat of false, misleading, and downright lying information. We live in the world of these wonderful devices that all of us have in our pockets or on our desks. I thought, as many of us did a few years ago, that this information is the age of having unlimited access to knowledge, to facts. Preparing a speech, you can go on the internet and find all kinds of crazy, good things. But it also turns out that social media is a fantastic way to disseminate propaganda and downright lies instantaneously. As more and more people move away from getting their news from the mass media, from educated journalists that have certain ethics in checking their sources, and as more and more people are getting the news from social media, we have to do one important thing, namely to think seriously about legislating the responsibility of platforms, providers on the internet, of the content that is being disseminated. It’s a slippery slope, I admit, because it is a fine line between looking for responsibility and introducing censorship. As a Latvian, I will never support censorship. There is too much history there. But we have to find that fine line, because this is an attack on our way of life. What are they looking to do? To divide society, to make us fight one another and to make us dislike one another. Think of the debate about vaccination. Where in the world does this argument come from that vaccination leads to autism? You can trace it back to the Russian outlets. They are disseminating this. They are still making people not be vaccinated and it is resulting in very serious health repercussions throughout Europe. Immigration, the immigration debate behind that: also Russia. Brexit: very involved. We even have this bubble throughout all of Eastern Europe of George Soros as some terrible person who is somehow undermining our way of life, we’re being told. It all comes from one single source and, if we do not accept that fact, we cannot begin to address it. But I say, for safety and security, militarily, my country invests two per cent of its GDP into the military. We are part of NATO. We think everyone should be doing this. But military is one part of the equation. The second part – equally important – is combating the dissemination of false and misleading information, and there we have to consider legislation. (Applause) Finally, I wouldn’t be a Latvian politician if I didn’t mention at least a couple of things about the multiannual financial framework (MFF), the seven—year budget that all of us are in the midst of trying to come to terms with. I completely agree, as this Parliament does, that we in Europe need to invest more in research and development, and into the clever young minds that are going to really create the jobs and the growth in value and in wealth in the future. This is extremely important. (Applause) But it is equally important that, as we’re investing in R&amp;D, we don’t just do it in one, two or five select capitals, but that investment moves throughout Europe. Why? Clever minds are everywhere in Europe. Everywhere in Europe needs growth. If we think of excellence only concentrated in a few countries, we actually do ourselves a disservice. So ‘yes’ to R&amp;D, but it really has to go around Europe. That is very important. Clever cohesion: cohesion is still important, but it has to be clever. We have to make sure that the poorer regions are converging upwards, a very important aspect of that. Last but not least, the farmers in Europe. We know that historically the European budget has been all about the common agricultural policy (CAP). It was years back and it is still important, but, as a reminder. We have a historic chance to write a historic injustice. All farmers in Europe compete in the same market so, if you sell grain, whatever, you sell it on the market. The price is what the market gives you. We subsidise, through direct payments, our farmers in Europe, but there’s a catch. We don’t subsidise our farmers equally or even close to equally. The three countries that are near the bottom of the pile, well below the average, are the three Baltic countries, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, for obtuse mathematical reasons dating back to the 1990s. Our farmers are competing with everyone else’s farmers. The only way that they can compete is at the cost of their own well-being. They are forced to be poor to compete in the same market. So, if we subsidise – and I am open to not subsidising anyone, but I don’t think we’ll get there in the next seven years – we should do it equally across the board for everyone. My speech comes to an end. You can breathe easier. Friends, the EU is not, and never will be, perfect. It’s not. But it is the best damn thing that I can think of. In Europe for hundreds – really thousands – of years, differences were settled through the force of muscle. Who was stronger prevailed, who was weaker: tough luck. No. The way that we work is by far better than anything that anyone has come up with to date. Member States have joined of their own free will and with the consent of their citizens. Member States can leave the EU, but we see in Brexit that actually none of us realised how difficult that would be. But it is a testament to how Europe works – and also as a member of the Council I can say – that the goodwill and the unanimous position, the sticking together, of the remaining EU 27 is a testament that we can get through difficult times, through discussion, through debate – sometimes very long debate – without resorting to any kind of violence. This is the key to how the EU works: that we talk with one another and do not fight one another. So what about the future? To sum up, I say we need to strengthen the basics. Strengthen the single market, tear down the barriers, control our outer borders, and bring down the threat of uncontrolled immigration. Have a clever transition to clean energy, bringing in more market forces to play, and focus on our common security, not only through the military, but also through the security of the information world that we live in. Don’t fight the populists. Address the causes of people’s malcontent. Left alone, we’re like Aesop’s sticks. We’re just individual sticks and we can be broken one by one. Even the large European countries are small in the world, but united, as that bundle of sticks, the European Union is a major force in the world and we can bring our core values – freedom, democracy and the rule of law – to take bearing on other countries.

Je suis d’autant plus heureux de le voir que je me rappellerai toujours de la première présidence lettone du Conseil des ministres. Je m’en rappelle parce que ce fut la première vraie présidence de cette Commission, après deux mois de cohabitation avec la présidence italienne. Je me souviens en particulier du dernier jour de cette présidence lettone: dans la nuit du 29 au 30 juin fut adoptée la directive sur les frais d’itinérance, qui garantit l’accès libre et sans discrimination à l’internet. Cela prouve par ailleurs qu’en Europe, il faut avoir de la patience et la garder jusqu’au tout dernier jour. Nous discutons souvent, comme si nous n’avions pas d’autres choses à faire, du Brexit. Avant les élections, il serait peut-être recommandable d’attirer l’attention des citoyens sur ce que nous avons su réaliser au cours des dernières années, notamment la décision utile sur le roaming. Le Brexit est important, mais la vie quotidienne des citoyens l’est plus. (Applaudissements) Nous avons voulu être la Commission du dialogue et nous l’avons été. Nous avons organisé des rencontres avec les citoyens: 1 600 dialogues citoyens, ce qui prouve d’ailleurs que les commissaires ne s’enferment pas dans le bunker du Berlaymont, mais circulent à travers l’Europe. Ce qui prouve aussi que la Commission n’est pas une bande de putschistes, d’illégitimes, mais que nous sommes quotidiennement au contact des citoyens. L’Europe ne peut pas se faire contre la volonté des peuples ni sans les nations: les nations sont importantes. Ceux qui pensent que les nations sont une invention provisoire de l’histoire se trompent lourdement, les nations se sont installées dans la durée et par conséquent il ne faut plus, me semble-t-il, parler des États-Unis d’Europe, car cela donne l’impression que l’Union européenne est en train de s’étatiser. L’Europe ne sera jamais un État copiant le modèle des États-Unis d’Amérique, jamais! Nous voulons être Lettons, Allemands, Bavarois, Bretons, Français, Luxembourgeois, tout en étant aussi Européens. Il n’y a pas de contradiction entre le patriotisme responsable et l’appartenance à un ensemble plus grand que constitue l’Union européenne. Notre Commission a voulu cesser d’interférer dans toutes les petites choses de la vie quotidienne des citoyens et se concentrer sur les grands enjeux de l’avenir. Tel fut le contrat que la Commission a passé avec vous, représentants élus de l’Europe, lorsqu’en juillet 2014, je vous ai présenté les grandes priorités politiques de ma Commission. Ce ne furent pas des propos en l’air. En mai 2018 déjà, nous avions présenté toutes les propositions et initiatives annoncées en 2014. À ce jour, 350 de nos propositions ont été adoptées et 164 restent sur la table des colégislateurs. Elles portent sur des réformes importantes, notamment le régime d’asile – j’aurais souhaité que nous puissions adopter toutes les directives qui gravitent autour de la nécessaire réforme du régime d’asile. J’ai tout de même une satisfaction: jamais, dans l’histoire parlementaire de l’Europe, autant de progrès n’avaient été accomplis en matière sociale. Le domaine social fut, pendant de trop longues années, l’enfant pauvre de la construction européenne. Je voulais remercier les députés d’avoir accompagné avec volonté et détermination les progrès sociaux que la Commission a initiés. Language number two, Mr President. Latvia is a country that knows better than most what it takes and what it is worth to be part of our Union – the Prime Minister made this clear in his excellent speech a few moments ago. Your country, Prime Minister, has always taken its destiny into its own hands. You have lived up to the words of one of your famous poets, who said: ‘We will be as great as our will’. And you are, because your will is great. (Applause) You have fought for your freedoms in difficult circumstances – by far, more difficult than Western Europeans can ever imagine. You have made history, instead of being the victims of history imposed by one of your biggest neighbours. You have said ‘no’ to the guns and to the tanks, and you have fought for your liberty, for your freedom, and it is one of the best events in recent history that Latvia and others have gained freedom and have fought for their place in the sun. The place of Latvia was not in the dark and in the shadow; the place of Latvia is in the sun, and we are happy that you have joined the European Union. Not a single day did we regret that Latvia became a member of the European Union. (Applause) You have joined the Schengen area, and I fully agree with what you have said about internal borders and the protection of external borders. The Commission has proposed coastguards and border guards of 10 000 people, men and women. The Council was postponing this to 2027, whereas the Commission had proposed 2020, but everyone is saying we have to protect our external borders. Let’s do it. The proposals are on the table.  (Applause) You are helping to make Europe stronger and safer. You are one of the 25 Member States that launched Permanent Structured Cooperation on defence matters in December 2017, and I am delighted that you are playing a full role in a number of European projects, from making cross-border military mobility easier – that’s important for Latvia, military mobility – you are making cross-border military mobility easier, and you are countering the threat of sea mines.  In doing so, you have become the embodiment and living proof of how Europe enhances national sovereignty and influence. Take energy – you mentioned this very important dimension of European policy. Your history and your geography meant that Latvia and the Baltics were an isolated energy island cut off from the rest of Europe. When we took office, we made it clear that the European Union will never leave its citizens out in the cold and will never leave a Member State in the dark. For me, this was a Baltic issue, yes, but not only a Baltic issue: it was a European one. This is why, when we took office, we created an Energy Union and made it a top priority to provide Latvia and its Baltic neighbours with stable, securer and cheaper energy they need. Today, we are well on the way to synchronising the Baltic electricity grid with the rest of Europe by 2025. We are investing in infrastructure, and we now have the world’s most ambitious and advanced climate and energy framework. I’m delighted that we turned the Energy Union vision into reality and I thank you, I’m grateful to the Prime Minister for his leadership and work as a Member of this Parliament, and as a Prime Minister today. Herr Präsident, language number three: Lettland bringt seine volle Kraft in Europa ein. Deshalb ist es normal, dass Europa auch in Lettland investiert, denn in Lettland zu investieren, heißt in die europäische Zukunft zu investieren. Die Letten wissen aus erster Hand, welche Wirkung dies haben kann: 50 000 lettische Arbeitssuchende und fast 9 000 Beschäftigte konnten seit 2014 dank europäischer Mittel neue Qualifikationen erlernen, um auf dem Arbeitsmarkt durchzustarten. 300 Kilometer neu gebaute oder instandgesetzte Straßen, aus EU-Mitteln finanziert, werden dazu beitragen, das Wirtschaftszentrum Riga mit den ländlichen Regionen sowie den Nachbarn Litauen und Estland zu verbinden. 960 Millionen an Investitionen wurden dank des sogenannten Juncker-Fonds in Lettland mobilisiert. Die lettische Zukunft betrifft unser aller Zukunft. Deshalb schlagen wir vor, im nächsten EU-Haushalt 100 Milliarden Euro in Innovation und Forschung zu investieren. Wir wollen in die großen Herausforderungen investieren, denen wir uns nur gemeinsam als Team stellen können. So wird beispielsweise die Finanzierung für stärkere Grenzen und Sicherheit verdreifacht. Wir werden sicherstellen, dass jeder vierte Euro des Haushalts unsere Ziele für Klima und nachhaltige Entwicklung unterstützt, und die Mittel für das Erasmus+-Programm werden auf 30 Milliarden Euro verdoppelt. Ich danke dem Premierminister und seiner Regierung für die anhaltende Unterstützung, um uns auf diesem Weg aktiv zu begleiten. Ich würde aber auch gern etwas zu Ihrer Bemerkung die mittelfristige Finanzplanung betreffend sagen: Es ist richtig, dass wir in Innovation, Forschung, Jugend und Verteidigung investieren. Das können wir aber nur tun, wenn wir in bestehenden Politiken einige Kürzungen vornehmen: Agrar- und Kohäsionspolitik. Ich bin darüber nicht glücklich. Aber wenn wir alles so belassen, wie es ist, plus die neuen Prioritäten, auf die sich Rat und Parlament verständigt haben, auch finanzieren müssen, dann brächten wir den europäischen Haushalt auf ein Niveau von 1,4 %. Das will niemand – mich würde das überhaupt nicht stören. Europa ist mehr wert als 1,4 % seines Bruttonationalprodukts, aber sogar das Parlament – in Haushaltsfragen weniger zurückhaltend als der Rat – hat das obere Limit für die Festlegung des europäischen Haushalts auf 1,3 % festgelegt. Wenn wir als Kommission 1,4 % statt 1,1 % vorgeschlagen hätten, dann hätten sogar Sie dem nicht zugestimmt und viele hier im Hause auch nicht. Insofern muss man Prioritäten setzen, ohne die bestehenden Politiken in der Mottenkiste unterzubringen. Denn Agrar und Kohäsion sind wichtig und für einige Länder wichtiger als für andere. Lettland hat schwierige Jahre hinter sich, nicht nur wegen seiner geografischen Lage und wegen der historischen Belastung, der es unterliegt, sondern auch, weil die Wirtschaftskrise in Lettland voll zugeschlagen hat. Aber fünf Jahre nach dem Beginn unserer Amtszeit geht es der lettischen Wirtschaft deutlich besser. Das ist auch das Verdienst eines Ihrer Vorgänger, Valdis Dombrovskis, der Lettland auf Kurs gebracht hat. Und deshalb habe ich mich sehr darum bemüht – mit Erfolg, wie man sieht –, dass er Vizepräsident der Europäischen Kommission wird und zuständig für Euro und sozialen Dialog. Valdis, ich danke dir für deine Arbeit! (Beifall) Also mir fiele vieles ein zu dem, was du gesagt hast. Aber du hast so lange geredet, dass ich jetzt Schluss machen muss. Lettland – mag ja sein – ist ein kleineres Land – ich bin Spezialist für kleinere Länder –, aber es ist ein Land mit großen Ambitionen, und es ist ein Ort, an dem West und Ost aufeinandertreffen. West und Ost dürfen nicht auseinanderdividiert werden, sondern sind die zwei Lungenflügel der Europäischen Union. Und wenn Europa gern eine gute Zukunft hätte, dann muss es mit beiden Lungen atmen. Dies ist die letzte Rede, die ich vor diesem Parlament halten darf. Mit schwerem Herzen sehe ich einige Kollegen sich aus der Politik oder aus dem Parlament zurückziehen. Ich habe die Arbeit hier sehr gemocht – habe viel gelernt, habe viel gestritten, aber wir haben auch einiges geschafft. Es bleibt so, wie ich am ersten Tag meiner Amtszeit gesagt habe: Europa muss man lieben. Wenn man es nicht liebt, ist man zur Liebe nicht fähig. Ich liebe Europa, es lebe Europa!

I first want to thank our President for organising this format of the Future of Europe discussions and it’s great to have Krišjānis Kariņš now as the final speaker here in this plenary, with a great contribution, with a forward-looking vision for Europe and, we all can feel it, with your knowledge, Krišjānis, about how Europe works, how the European Parliament works. I probably can say that it would for the future be a great thing to have more prime ministers in office with the background of being a former Member of the European Parliament. That is what we really enjoyed today, thank you so much.  (Applause) What I really like is that you started first of all with optimism. When we speak about Europe, about the future of Europe, it’s your country, about Latvia, the success story economically in the last years, all of this with the support, the contribution of Valdis Dombrovskis under his leadership. It’s a great economic success. It is a great success for the country when it is about the investments, which Jean—Claude Juncker mentioned, and about the security feeling, that Latvians feel protected because they are part of this strong union of the European Union, and it is about Russia and the external threats towards us.  Success stories when we speak about our mandate at the European level, which Jean—Claude underlined. In the last five years what we managed, what we have brought to the people of Europe, the success stories on management of the external border, the millions of new jobs created with the Juncker Plan, the sustainable growth and the front-runner to be at the front on the question of the fight against climate change on a global level. So we can be proud about what we did in the last five years under the leadership of Jean—Claude Junker.  Generally speaking, I’m 46 years old. I’m the first generation of this continent who can say that I live all over Europe in peace and freedom. My father’s generation enjoyed peace, but half of the continent was locked up behind the Iron Curtain and my grandfather’s generation was in war, and that’s why the first generation, and this broader historic perspective, to have this in mind when we go out of this plenary and do our campaign. It must start with optimism. It’s a great Europe we are living in today and we will protect this against all the egoists and nationalists. (Applause)  The second point you mentioned is about the concrete issues on the table. The answers on the demand, the questions, the concerns of the people. You mentioned migration – we fully support your idea about protecting our borders. The state decides who is on European soil and it is not the smugglers who decide. We need a resettlement programme, an ambitious one, and we need a plan for Africa, with probably in the future also a Commissioner for Africa who combines all the efforts we need, all the activities we do in regard to our neighbouring continent.  The jobs question – research is key. The regional funds are key, especially for the poorest regions in Europe. Trade is key, and the single market. I like your appeal to strengthen the single market because that’s the home base. Looking for new jobs, we first of all look to our strengths and not to the strengths of the others. And then climate change. All these things are on the agenda, but when we are speaking about the future of Europe you also have to be frank, because one thing is the content, the political approach, but the other is the method: how we come to results, and you know the problems.  On a lot of fields where we need a stronger Europe, we have the problem of the unanimous vote. I call it the problem of the unanimous vote. When it is about the Russian policy, we always need all 27 countries on board to come to conclusions and that’s why we have to stop. If we want to make the European Union into a strong political actor at global level, then we need the majority-making decision process in external affairs. That’s why the methods must be changed.  When I speak about methods, I think keeping the bridge—building approach alive is needed. I tell you on migration: my own country Germany was, in the migration debate, against all the Commission’s ideas in regard to a binding quota on the question of distribution of migrants – until the year 2015, because then the migration problem arrived in Germany and immediately, in one, two, three months’ time, Germany changed its mind and immediately started asking for a binding quota mechanism on Europe. And what does this tell us? This tells us: don’t look from an egoistic point to Europe. We have to learn that we also have to take into account the problem of the others when we want to have a strong European Union. (Applause)  Finally, on the method: a Europe which is democratic. We all know what we speak about. It’s a question of right of initiative here in this House, strengthening the investigation capacity of this House. The implementation of the rules must be checked also by this institution, and Krišjānis, I’m really grateful that you support the idea of the Spitzenkandidat, the idea that you have to show up before the elections to tell people, ‘I’m a candidate from all the parties in this House, and we have programmes and we ask for this support’. So a democratic Europe. And finally, the future of Europe means that we have to protect the essence of Europe. We spoke about the European way of life, about democracy, independence of our judiciary, equal treatment of men and women, and, as a title, freedom: freedom of expression, of religion, of the press. We have to guarantee these rights for the future with an upgraded rule of law mechanism, give the world a positive example of how to manage positively society in a human way; that Europe is an offer, the European way of life is an offer to the world – that’s the future of Europe.

An even greater honor because you are not only the last head of government before the next European elections, but also for having enunciated in your speech, and we thank you, important perspectives on the Union that we will have the duty to build after May 26 and, for these reasons, I welcome you on behalf of the Socialists and Democrats Group. As the last head of government to visit this Parliament, which is now winding down its eighth term, your visit is also an excellent opportunity for us to discuss your country, Latvia, and the role within the country. European Union. For us MEPs, it is always a positive event to meet one of our former colleagues, as many have recalled, in the guise of representatives of a national executive. We are pleased, we hope they will increase. Having said that, we are spokespersons in this Assembly of a common and concrete aspiration of European citizens, that of building together a strong Union to be able to face the challenges of our time, since, alone, a Member State that is small size like yours or with a larger population like my country, Italy or France or others, not only did you remind us of this, you cannot do anything against the negative effects of globalization or climate change, but neither can you to secure his own defense or to guarantee economic development for his country of some importance. Incidentally, President Juncker, like you I love Europe, but I am for the United States of Europe, states in the plural, not in the singular, therefore, not a great European state but a truly European United States and therefore I don&#39;t see where the problem is. However, thank you for your commitment to Europe, including from my group, as today, as you recalled, is your last presence in this Parliament. We appreciated your commitment, if not for the United States of Europe for a united Europe, which is perhaps even more so than the United States of Europe. Prime Minister, let us hope that what you have told us represents a greater European commitment from your government, which up to now has shown some signs of ambiguity regarding its pro-European color. In a context in which the European states are no longer able to weigh individually in the international arena, it would not be the time, as your colleague also recalled, to put an end to the unanimity rule in the decisions of the Council, which you also support and accepts, a rule that unfortunately only values the individual and particular interests of the Member States to the detriment of the general interest of the Union? He wants to continue playing the function of watchdog of a European conclave where necessary decisions are continually postponed or even not taken, just when the need for a strong Europe is so necessary and imperative, you reminded us. In which chapter do you want to find yourself in the history books, on the side of the interests of European citizens or of those who have defended the interests of moderately and lukewarmly pro-European elites? I take the liberty of insisting, he wants to be on the side of those who made the European project profitable, protecting the reserved domain of a group or an elite or on the side of those who gave the same project the useful tools, including a budget to develop to their full potential? For us socialists and democrats, Europe is built through the law and through respect. Human rights, of course, but also civil rights, as well as respect for the word given to the community. Since January the statements you have expressed in Europe and your country have raised numerous questions which we would like you to give some answers to. Firstly, with regard to compliance with the European commitment for the relocation of refugees to Europe. You have stated that you are against this resettlement. But how to do the redistributions? What can we do if we have, as you said, a common border? This position contradicts the principle of solidarity that you recalled to us and which applies to all our Community policies, including for example cohesion policy. So what can you concretely tell us about this issue? Secondly, what about your refusal to support the launch of the infringement procedure under Article 7 against Hungary and Poland. How do you explain your refusal, with your just criticisms of Vladimir Putin&#39;s policy and your support for the far-right axis that goes from Salvini to Orbán? Can you tell us your views about it? Don&#39;t you think this is a contradiction? Last but not least, what are the measures implemented by your government in the face of increased discrimination against LGBT people? In the European Commission&#39;s report against racism and intolerance last March, this Commission points to serious dysfunctions in the implementation of measures to protect these minorities. Our Union is a Union under the sign of tolerance and you and your country, as you reminded us, are part of it and share its values.

Komisijas priekšsēdētāja kungs! Premjerministra kungs! Prieks jūs šeit redzēt un paldies par enerģisko un ļoti saturisko runu kā lieliskam valodniekam, politiķim un arī labam kolēģim, ar kuru mēs esam strādājuši gan Latvijas politikā, gan arī šeit, Eiropas Parlamentā, roku rokā daudzos jautājumos. Un es gribētu arī kolēģu uzmanību vērst uz lieliskajām dāmām, kas ir Krišjāņa Kariņa komandā. Jūs redzat tajās pirmās rindās ap viņu. Es domāju, ka mēs varam lepoties visādā ziņā ar mūsu diplomātisko korpusu Latvijā. Un paldies par jūsu darbu! Es arī nenožēloju nevienu dienu ne iestāšanos Eiropas Savienībā, ne eirozonā, bet tai pašā laikā es varu teikt to, ka es esmu ļoti daudzas reizes nožēlojis to un nevaru lepoties vai piekrist tai Eiropas Savienības politikai, kas šeit tiek realizēta, un arī par viņas tēlu un seju, ja tā varētu teikt. Un es par to arī runāšu savā tālākajā runā. I am really and glad that your speech didn’t include so simple an approach. Everything is all right here in the European Union, and so let’s peacefully evaluate our achievements and let’s make an ever-closer Union. I’m very thankful that you did it more in detail and with more analytical suggestions. The European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR) is always a political family which supports a pure, real single market in any sector of the economy. I think we have here some doubts, which partly you shared already. You said you are not very happy with European champions, which should be created. I trust you, but national champions are European Union champions, so we can see a bit of disagreement with your Spitzenkandidat Mr Manfred Weber, who some time ago said in the media that you would agree to change some rules on state aid and competition in the EU to allow the creation of such champions, which I think is the wrong message to the economy, because also the message ‘Europe which protects’ sounds good – but to protect from whom? From the outside world? Okay, for a short-term it works, but in the longer run, it’s a wrong way. Even more dangerous, I think, is protection inside the single market, and here I can give an example, which you partly already said on the basis of the US, with zero barriers between states in the US, if you would like to see a similar situation in the European Union. We recently approved Mobility Package I with a very controversial procedure, I would say. After this vote, it’s clear that it was the Latvian government, the Lithuanian, Polish governments, Romanians, Hungarians: many countries were against it in Council, and MEPs from different political families from those countries were against it. Then it’s a question if it’s bad for those countries and it’s good for Europe, where is Europe? This, I think, is a bad signal. If you can imagine the US doing the same Mobility Package I approach in the road freight market in the US, for example, to return an empty truck from New York to Wyoming, I think it would be a disaster, and I’m not even speaking about the things for the budget. We are fighting here for around 1% of GDP, and we will fight after the new Parliament as well. But, at the same time, we forget that the US federal budget is over 20% of GDP, and that’s why people also living in the same Wyoming. I think we have to think about these things if we really would like to create some more kind of a federalist approach – not the ECR, but other Groups, you have to remember this. I fully agree with the AML function, which is the tax arrears report also here evaluated Latvian achievement on definition in the legislation about shell companies, which are very big points in anti-money-laundering issues, and at the same time there was not named in the TAX3 report about Latvia, but there was named some country which is not very far from here, and it’s between Brussels and Strasbourg. I also would like to say that it’s good that you touch a point on R&amp;D. Of course, research and development innovations are very important as well, and it’s good that it’s growing. You rightly said ‘but’ – but how it is distributed – and it’s a very important point, not only what you named but also from a demographic point of view. It means if we will continue or even with a widening programme – the Horizon Programme – which is a good programme, but it’s still not working enough. So we will expect that the demographic situation in the European Union will be even more divided if we continue like that, because the best researchers, the best brains and best young people should go to those centres, to those countries in the EU Member States, and it means peripheral countries will have a lot of demographic problems. Some countries will solve in the medium term the demographic situation in the country and also achievement in economy, but disparities in the European Union will be even greater than they are now. I just made a few points which partly agree with you and partly, I just like to continue on this problem. In general I think in the new Parliament we can have a good, reasonable political family cooperation between different Groups on a pure, real, single market, keep as a core principle in the European Union in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 54, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, let me welcome the Prime Minister back to the European Parliament. Prime Minister, you made a comment at the beginning of your speech that you had learnt a few lessons in the European Parliament. I cannot resist drawing a parallel, a fake one in fact, because under that assumption I would like, even though I would never vote for him, the Czech Prime Minister to be a Member of the European Parliament and maybe then we would have a different policy by the Czech Government on European affairs.  But apart from that of course, you had one advantage. You had knowledge and you had attitude. I’m afraid that these are absolutely necessary otherwise you cannot evolve. So I’m afraid that that doesn’t go hand in hand with the parallel that I’ve made for the Czech Prime Minister.  Now you also mentioned the question of languages. I’m sure you speak a number of languages and understand quite a few. I don’t think that you speak or understand Czech, but I must say that what you have said is like reading the election manifesto of my own political movement, Voice or Hlas, and that is positive news, because that means that regardless of the fact that you’re in the PPE and I’m a Liberal, there are a number of questions on which we can and we should seek European solutions, on a number of issues that we can also agree with other parties, and I think that this is what we need to be aiming at after the next election. So I’m sure there are a number of points where we would have a large degree of coherence.  Let me pick up on a few points that you raised. Simplified solutions: you referred to nationalists and populists. I agree entirely. We should be tackling the cause of these, the cause of the concerns and also the concerns of those that we have lost somewhere in the process of globalisation. But then we also need to be honest and fair and say that we also have some homework to do, that even in our own political families, in our political groups, in political parties, we will find those that are providing these simplistic solutions. So I think that we need to tackle this across the political spectrum and I’m definitely ready to do that. Now on the points that you raised. You spoke about the internal market. I think that there is hardly anyone in this Parliament that would say that the internal market is not successful. That we need to evolve it, yes, In fact, only 35% of the internal market is really open. That means that we have a potential of 65%. How come we do not manage? And you have said it clearly. There is a reason to go and do business in the US because you have an internal market in the US. If you invent an application, you go to the US because you will have one authorisation and three, let’s say, contracts with mobile operators. We need 28 still. So the question is: if we want a true internal market, are we ready to go for one regulator, a true internal market? You made the parallel also, or let’s say the connection, with the unfair competition from China and elsewhere, and again I agree and we should not lean towards protectionism. But we need to understand that if we open up the market – and I’m all in favour – then the advantage is on the side of those that cheat and also of those that are big. So let’s not fool ourselves that we will establish an internal market and suddenly our start-ups will be in the same position as Huawei or Microsoft, or whoever.  So that means that we need to work also on the standards, on the norms, and also on competition policy. We need to have a fair environment inside and the question is: do we have the courage and the willingness to go and establish a true internal market, and not at 35% but 100%. I’m all in favour. If you are, let’s work on it. Now you spoke also about the question of external borders. Absolutely! I mean this is absolutely key but we still are failing in this respect. I’m afraid, if I look at the Czech Republic, there are a lot of statements on the side of the political elite and again they lack the courage, the ability, the vision to understand that we will have an internal market, we will have free movement, if we really secure the border. Final two remarks: on climate change, and again this is just a sign that on climate change we have an ability to work across the political spectrum. And the very final point. You touched on the common agriculture policy and fair treatment for farmers. Yes, indeed. We do not have a common agriculture policy because from a number of national budgets we have additional subsidies that go beyond. So we need a free and, as well, a fair treatment of our business people, of our entrepreneurs, of our consumers, and again also of farmers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 55, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, today&#39;s debate is very important, because in a few hours the work of the European Parliament will be completed. This is President Juncker&#39;s last speech before the plenary and we welcome the Latvian Prime Minister, who has also been our colleague in the European Parliament for nine years and is the twelfth Prime Minister to come here to discuss the future of Europe. Forty days before the important European elections ahead of us, I do not think it is time to praise ourselves and point out some positives that have been made. We need to look at the future, the challenges of the future and what we have not done or what we have done wrong, to understand that this is the way to deal with it. of Aesop with the rods — one rod breaks easily, many rods together do not break. That is right, but we must see in the European Union, ten years after the Lehman Brothers crisis. Inequalities, social and regional, have grown, the rule of law and parliamentary democracy have receded in Europe, the European Parliament and the Commission have called for Article 7 to be activated against the governments of Poland and Hungary, and nothing is being done in the Council. for violations of democracy. The European Parliament and the Commission have completed a proposal for asylum policy reform, a total of seven dossiers, and in the Council of Governments you are doing nothing. The Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Parliament some governments, such as Germany and the Netherlands, have effectively vetoed it. So if we want Europe to move forward and make political integration stronger, political transparency stronger, social cohesion stronger and do more to tackle climate change, as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg called us yesterday, then The European Union must stop, Mr Weber, from being a group of countries where twenty-eight are debating and in the end the Germans are deciding. That needs to change. And I want to note that I agree with President Juncker&#39;s remark that in order to serve the goals that have been set, we also need a stronger Community budget with more money in the common fund. Why should they not be cut but, on the contrary, be for youth, Erasmus +, employment, research and innovation. And I ask you, Mr Kariņš, as a representative of the Council, but also as an old MEP: why have you thrown out the Monti Commission&#39;s proposals to increase own resources? How can Europe &#39;s political unification, EMU economic integration and monetary integration go without looking at the social issue? Mr Juncker and Mr Kariņš, the social agenda was adopted in Gothenburg, but it remains a simple label. It has not acquired content and, as inequalities increase, the populism of the far right, which wants to dismantle both Europe and democracy, will gain ground. Eighty years ago, the political ancestors of Mr Salvini, Mrs Le Pen and Mr Orbán — who hold him badly, Mr to defend democracy, in the next European elections, the view that we need a more politically united, democratic and social Europe that reduces inequality and does not increase it must have a strong majority in the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "mymemory", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš, welcome back to a parliament you know very well indeed. We’ve not always been of one mind on economic affairs, but I have always been very impressed by the strength of your commitment to our common European project, and again today was a testament to that. And actually you are quite typical of that commitment that you find in the Baltic republics. I believe that the three Baltics and the Benelux countries should cooperate much more deeply, because if they can find agreement between them, I think they could be bridge-builders and foster unity in Europe maybe better than the Franco-German duo, which seems to be a bit at odds at the moment. I liked very much your speech. I liked you reminding us that the European Union is a peace project solving differences through dialogue rather than sheer force. This is not just a justification for the past century. It is today’s justification for the European project. I liked very much the metaphor of the bundle. Like you, I come from a small country, but even big countries in Europe, as you said, are actually small as a yardstick globally. I liked very much also what you said about the single market. The single market is the ultimate free trade agreement. But it is very specific, because unlike all other free trade agreements, it is governed by democratic institutions: the European Parliament, the European Council. You don’t find that elsewhere in other free trade deals. I liked also very much the fact that you were upfront about money laundering, and I think that you found the right words, and we like to hear them, because I know that your commitment on that is very strong. However, I’d like also to beg to disagree, not necessarily with what you said, but with a number of positions and actions of the Latvian Government. First, for us Greens the European project must resolutely choose to be a leader: the engine of the ecological transition of our societies. If we can’t make them fit within the boundaries that nature sets us, it’s the survival of humankind that is at stake. It’s also a matter of leadership: if we Europeans don’t lead in that transition, others will, and we will be left with buying their solutions rather than providing ours to the rest of the world. One case in point, and you mentioned it, is agriculture. The common agricultural policy is the EU’s largest budget. We should make sure every euro-cent spent on it is used and contributes to the transformation of our agricultural model so that it reduces CO2 emissions and restores biodiversity and the quality of our soil. Arguably, the CAP predominantly promotes a productivist model that goes against these goals – and your government supports it – and actually you find it already too green for your taste. I understand that your country – and I agree with that – wants its fair share of the CAP. We are convinced, though, that the best chance of achieving that target is actually to fight for a greener CAP that moves away from the productivist model and to industrial farming. The second aspect relates to citizenship. You mentioned the European values, and actually if you read Article 2, the first value that is mentioned there is human dignity. Human dignity cannot be divided: it is for all, present and to come. Latvia’s history as an unwilling part of the Soviet Union has resulted in a significant part of your citizenship originating from former Soviet republics. While we understand that the wounds of the past cannot be ignored, we believe that, as a member of the EU, Latvia is strong enough not to keep more than 10% of its population stateless. Similarly, we believe that your country could and should do more to promote minority rights and fight discrimination, especially when it comes to age, disability or sexual orientation. Thirdly, we have welcomed – and again, today you managed to avoid this – the fact that all three Baltic republics have avoided the toxic grandstanding that we have seen on the topic of asylum and migration. I really appreciated your words on that. However, recently your government opposed any binding relocation scheme – which is actually the only way to organise European solidarity. It has also refused to sign the UN Global Migration Compact, which, contrary to the allegations of the national populists, is simply providing guidelines as to how to handle this challenge. You and I know that it is not legally binding and that it is grounded in values of state sovereignty, responsibility-sharing, non-discrimination and human rights, and it recognise that only a cooperative approach will allow us to meet this challenge. Latvia’s signature should be on that document. With the European elections now upon us, this is the last debate on the future of Europe in this European Parliament. Count on us to relentlessly defend the first-ever attempt at building a transnational democracy. But equally, count on us to make it work for everyone, by putting human dignity rather than short-term economic profits at the front and in the centre. A more just, more sustainable, more free and democratic Europe is what our citizens want. We will ask that they trust us to deliver just that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "David COBURN", "mepid": "124967", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, a Happy Easter to you all, when it comes. Public outpouring of distress about the destruction of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris shows how deeply we care about the cultural and religious heritage of Europe. Any unity the continent of Europe has, based on its philosophical and religious heritage deriving from Roman law, Greek philosophy, Christian faith and, dare I say, British democracy (as a more recent example), while it was drawing up the constitution of Europe, later the Lisbon Treaty, which we didn’t like very much, the EU rejected any reference to God or Christian religion in Europe. Well, this is something alien to the continent of Europe. The EU itself, with its project of aggressive secularism – as Roger Scruton called it, oikophobia – is the rejection of our own heritage and culture, which is the basis of our current cultural weakness and why many people throughout Europe are more and more rejecting the European Union. The European project is like a terrifying religious cult, something invented by Mr Robespierre or something of that ilk. The Prime Minister, Mr Kariņš, with all due respect, said Russia had something to do with Brexit. Sorry, sir. The British people, who stood alone in 1940 against authoritarianism, are quite capable of making up their own minds about Europe. What they don’t want is bureaucratic authoritarianism from unelected European bureaucracy. I mean, let’s be honest, this Parliament is a bit of a eunuch. They want to be ruled by their own sovereign parliaments. At the moment our own parliament is dominated by an establishment which has been infiltrated over 30 years or more by members of the Euro-cult, who are preventing a simple Brexit – something that could easily be done; we could have easily just said we’re leaving with WTO rules or give us a better deal. And if they didn’t, we could have left with WTO rules. But the Euro-cultists decided otherwise, including, may I say, our own Prime Minister, Mrs May, who has misled the country in many ways. Dreaming up lots of nonsense about unnecessary backstops in Ireland, which seem intended to break up the EU for daring to leave the Euro-cult, the establishment at Westminster are out of touch with their own voters, and this is seen increasingly to be the case. If the EU and its UK-establishment allies force Mrs May’s grossly unfair and ludicrous deal down Britain’s throats (which is actually worse than actually being in the European Union), to avoid a European election (which I think you’re all trying to do at the moment; Mrs May certainly is – you probably want it too), because it will be won by Mr Farage’s Brexit party. And if not, may I tell you, if you don’t have that election, the following general election in great Britain will be won by Mr Farage’s Brexit party. Evidently, we need to clean out the Euro-cultists out of the parliament of Westminster to get a proper Brexit. I told Mr Barnier (sadly he is not here with us today), who I think is an excellent negotiator – I wish he was on our side – to his surprise, may I say, that the British Parliament cannot bind its successors. If you don’t give us a fair deal, it won’t stick, so you’re wasting your time. However, it seems more important to the Euro-cultists to make sure that they get their cult together, that they keep the project going, than a profitable deal with Great Britain, which benefits the citizens of not only Europe, but great Britain. The European Union must govern by consent, not punishing, like a modern inquisition, those countries or individuals who do not share your faith. Learn from history, especially people in the Low Countries – Mr Lamberts, for example – learn from history. The free thinkers of the Spanish Netherlands in the Low Countries overthrew the Inquisition, which was dominating Europe and stopping people thinking and acting for themselves. Their rebellion against the Spanish Inquisition led to free-thinking democracies in the Low Countries and in the United Kingdom. Thank God for them. The free thinkers of today are what you call populists. Personally, I’d rather be a populist than an un-populist, but there you are. What you dismissively describe as populist will be elected shortly, from all over Europe to this next Parliament, and they will dominate it. They will dominate it and they will change radically the EU, or they will break it. Bend with the wind or be crushed, I think is the thing you’ve got to think about. The EU is as much a threat to European democracy in the same way the Inquisition was in the 16th century to free thinking and democracy. Prime Minister Kariņš said, we do not have to worry about migration, and that many people want to come to a stable, democratic continent. I don’t blame them. If I were living in the third world or any other part of the world that wasn’t Europe, I’d want to come here too. Who can blame those people? If I were in their position, I’d want that. But if the numbers change, the philosophy and the democratic nature of the European continent, that is neither in the interests of the people who live here or the people who are coming here. It will be a disaster. So the other thing to worry about is the crushing of their health service. So Europe can only survive by rule by consent, not the force they have used on the UK.

To see one of the most beautiful jewels and the most beautiful symbols of our European civilization ravaged by flames has bruised the hearts of the French and Europeans. Fortunately, the admirable action of the firefighters made it possible to save a large part of the building, which could thus be restored and regain its splendor. And what a joy to learn that the treasure of Notre-Dame, the crown of thorns and the tunic of Saint-Louis have been saved! But this tragedy must provoke a start, an awareness of the need to protect, to pass on our heritage, of course, but, more generally, our heritage of European and Christian civilization. Mr Prime Minister, earlier you mentioned those you call the Eurosceptics, considering that they would be opposed to the very idea of European construction. You are making a total mistake: we believe in Europe. We are convinced that there is a European civilization, a common culture, and that there are immense challenges to be met together. But this will also requires lucidity. You said earlier, with regard to immigration, that you had no solution, that we could do nothing to prevent this immigration. The reality is that we can act and Matteo Salvini in Italy shows it every day. But there are clearly two choices: on the one hand, Mr Avramopoulos, the European Commissioner, who told us that immigration was needed to compensate for the demographic deficit and, on the other, courageous governments in Italy, in Hungary, which are implementing major policies - social, fiscal, family support, encouragement of the European birth rate. Clearly there are two visions that clash, between those who accept or encourage immigration and those who want, on the contrary, firmness in migration and encouragement of the European birth rate. In terms of the economy, the European Union has been characterized by the abolition of all protections: inside, with the common market, with unfair competition, with posted work, and outside, by increasing free trade agreements and lowering customs tariffs. Today, China or the United States are protecting themselves, are able to put in place all the protections useful for their internal market and, obviously, are conquerors, offensive, in the rest of the world. They very often use the European continent as a space where they can act economically very freely, often to the detriment of our real economy, our production units and our employees. Here again, clearly, two political visions clash, between those who consider Space European economy as a completely open playing field and those who, like us, want a Europe which is economically and commercially protected. With regard to its institutional organization, Europe must also return to democracy. Faced with the exorbitant power of the European Commission today, I heard Mr. Weber, the Socialists, but also the supporters of Emmanuel Macron in France, tell us that we had to go even further by removing the unanimity rule - a new ratchet in federalism. The same people, moreover, will ask tomorrow for the abolition of the qualified majority, then the end of the simple majority to finally lead to an increasingly opaque and more and more authoritarian operation. Clearly, there again, two visions clash: the Europe of nations, the Europe of cooperation, or the Europe of the Commission with the acceleration towards federalism. We are five weeks away from the European elections. The European construction is obviously at a crossroads. The European continent holds within itself the capacity for a start and renewal to ensure the influence of our nations once again, collectively, on the world stage. But for that to happen, it is necessary to break with the current great dogmas of the European Union and finally to free oneself from technocratic logic. Europe will protect its economy or it will become the lackey of the other great powers. Europe will put nations and peoples back at the heart of its project or it will fall apart.

In addition, they are convinced that they have a mandate to manage all aspects of the political, economic, social, cultural, even sexual life of 500 million Europeans.

It is necessary to organize the cooperation of the free nations through precise, quantified programs, in concrete fields whose citizens could measure both the costs and the benefits.

Right here we brought down the walls lies and disinformation that prevented patriots from various countries from communicating with each other.

There’s another way to do it – something that my country experienced for a very long time under the occupation of the Soviet Union. That is, you have no say, you have no right to express your opinion, there is no vote, someone else decides, and they push you out of the way as they’re moving forward.  It’s clear which is the best way. I am happy and willing to engage with anyone who believes that the way forward is to work with one another. This is the strength and the power of the EU. The fact that we have been able to maintain individual, sovereign, national countries with strong identities, distinct languages, unique cultures, independent and interrelated histories, and yet at the same time that we can work together, to open up the markets to trade, to find a way to pool our common resources into a single and strong and powerful voice in the world. The EU, for someone who does not know what the Soviet Union is, has nothing in common with the Soviet Union. Absolutely nothing.  (Applause) This is a union of free will. Free will of participation by the Member States, free will of participation by the citizens, and we see that if citizens change their mind, no one is standing in the way. It truly is a free union. It’s a unique experiment in the world. The United States is a country based upon immigration. The original Americans are not a people who have tremendous rights in the United States. The people that we call Americans, generally speaking, have come from Europe, have come from Africa, have come from Asia, have come from everywhere, with the acceptance that they leave something behind and become something together. But in Europe, none of us has to go anywhere. We can maintain our languages and identities, yet come together on a political level and an economic level to further the interests of our own citizens.  So this is the way forward: we don’t have to give anything up. We can pool resources and be stronger as one individual. We’re much stronger as a collected unit.

It has been a burning, everyday political problem for the last 19 years.

But it’s not only about one person. In fact the Soviet Gestapo in corpora has usurped power from the Russian people, establishing a Mafia state.

You come from a country with a difficult history, your personal history is also presented as the history of a migrant child, so I am impressed by this affiliation with the European Union, the idea of a common market, single development, common power, and freedom and everything that has been said. I support what has been said, that Europe needs to be developed at all ends, including research, jobs, so my question is linked to the multiannual financial framework. Is there enough understanding among the prime ministers, especially those who are net payers, that the institute of solidarity, which we implement through the agricultural and also cohesion policy, worth paying 1.3% into the European Union budget, and that this binder of the European Union will continue to keep Europe connected and make it more prosperous and beautiful?

I have lots of notes that I’ll be processing in the next while. The topics: security, energy, cohesion, agriculture, immigration, money laundering, social justice, China-EU, Russia, etc., etc. I think if I truly tried to answer them my second speech would even be longer than my first. You don’t get to the votes and then you really turn, so I won’t do that.  But what I do want to do is to say a couple of things.  First of all, as a former MEP, I want to thank each and every one of you for the opportunity, the pleasure and the honour that I had of working with you. The past almost 10 years, and also this past term, has been a tremendous time for me – even getting a little emotional it seems – but I really want to thank all of you for the great cooperation. (Applause)  Many of you are saying that this is your last speech in Parliament, but for me, I can say this is my first speech in Parliament as Prime Minister. So I’m very pleased about that indeed.  To sum up on the debate.  Colleagues, the EU is not perfect. It’s not perfect, and when voters are telling us that something is wrong, we need to listen to the voters. We don’t need to say: no, everything is fine, you’re wrong. No, we need to listen to them because people have real concerns. Whether it’s about their jobs, whether it’s about immigration, whether it’s about the climate, whether it’s about security, these issues are real. But we also have real answers to these. We can work forward in the future as a Union of sovereign and independent nations, not giving up one square centimetre of our national identity or pride or languages, but pulling together to fight and to pull as one. We are a Union of values: freedom, democracy and the rule of law. As a Latvian, I can say that we know what it means to live without freedom, to live without democracy and to live without the rule of law.  (Applause) This is not something that anyone should ever need to experience.  We have a key way to unlock economic growth within the EU and this is the simple thing called the single market. What we need to do is to tear down the barriers of the single market within the EU, to create the environment so that our own companies, national companies, can grow to become European companies, can grow to be real, tough and successful players on the international stage. This is in our power.  (Applause) We can address the tough issue of immigration by strengthening our outer borders. This has to be done, because when we strengthen the outer borders, we can keep the internal borders open and not hamper the single market. We can have a clever transition to clean energies, again the key is to make sure that market forces are at play. Let the market in, deregulate prices, green energy will take off, smart technological solutions will take off, consumers will participate, and the market will help us make this transition. And regarding our common security, I see no contradiction between membership in NATO – my country is – and stronger EU security and defence cooperation. (Applause) We need to work as a union to strengthen ourselves as a member of the NATO alliance. There is no contradiction. But in terms of our security we need to go one step further than military security. This is security of our information, the information environment our citizens are living with, and as I said previously, I think it’s time to consider seriously legislation to look at the responsibility of social media platforms concerning the dissemination of false and misleading information which is a hamper to our democratic development. (Applause) Colleagues, we don’t need necessarily to fight the populists. The populists are being listened to because people are unhappy. We need to address the root causes, remind them that as a union we are stronger. Like the bundle of sticks. You take any one stick, you break it, break it, break it, like our little nations. All nations in Europe on the world stage are small, but united we’re like that bundle of sticks that cannot be broken, and we can take our way of life, our idea of free trade and push it on other markets, not have them push themselves onto us.  (Applause) We have a great responsibility, which is to take the values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, with the single market and to move it forward. We do this in a peaceful way. We do it through debate. We do it in a way that includes citizens, and we move forward.

Because only cooperation between the EU and the Member States will help us to overcome the trauma that Russia caused to our peoples through the policies of Stalin and his descendants. And only because of this can we start thinking about Russia in other ways than trauma. Only the EU can support us in this. But we like him also think in this key that the Kremlin has succeeded in creating more and more radical opponents of the EU in the member states, and in Estonia these forces are also part of the governing coalition.

Respect for human dignity and compliance with laws and rules must not only be promoted but also practiced. On April 6, the Ukrainian authorities refused entry to the country by Kelemen Hunor, the DAHR’s federal president and a member of the Romanian Parliament traveling with a diplomatic passport, and provided no explanation. He was simply informed that he could not enter Ukraine. In retrospect, Ukraine’s ambassador to Romania said that the Kiev authorities had already banned Clement Hunor from the country in 2017. All this is done by Ukraine, whose citizens can travel to EU countries without a visa! The actions of the Ukrainian authorities exceed our tolerance. There is a well-founded suspicion that Kelemen Hunor may have been placed on the ban list because, as President of the DAHR, he acted decisively against the legal attacks on the Hungarian community in Transcarpathia. We will do this in the future, all of us, DAHR politicians, when the rights of our Transcarpathian brothers are trampled on by the Ukrainian state.

This is precisely what is required for interpretation. It is the same proposal that, as an amendment to the Rules of Procedure, did not reach an absolute majority in this House last January. Indeed the proposed text raises new, crucial legal questions, which would remain open, giving rise not only to different interpretations but also to highly discretionary assessments. What are the parameters for defining the substantive, distinctive and genuine character that are required for a Group’s political statement regarding the common political orientation? Who decides whether these are respected? The President of Parliament alone or with the consent of the Conference of Presidents? By majority, by consensus? Again, what are the consequences of an assessment of non—compliance? Finally, what are the legal remedies? There are no answers to any of these questions. Once again, at the end of the parliamentary term and in a hurry, we witness an attempt to change the rules about group formation, definitely a most sensitive issue. The proposal not only leaves important legal issues open, but above all jeopardises the democratic functioning of our common House.

This text will be given to the services of the European Parliament. Commission statements (in writing) Configurations of the committee:  “As regards the introduced by the co-legislators configurations of the committee (within the meaning of Regulation (EU) N0 182/2011), the Commission notes that the Member States remain free and solely responsible to choose their representatives in the committee and the Commission does not interpret this provision as conferring on it any power to indicate or select the right experts for a particular configuration.” Member States’ participation in SST and related implementing act:  “In the understanding of the Commission, its empowerment under Article 56(4) of the Regulation includes inter alia, as indicated in recital 65a, establishing whether offers submitted by Member States under Article 56(3) should relate to all or some orbits. The Commission furthermore understands that Article 56(3) allows the presentation of several joint proposals, each of them by at least 5 Member States and that the Commission may select several offers to maximise the participation of Member States in SST.” Access to space:  “As stated in recital 4, in view of the limited budget, activities under Article 5 on access to space should be without prejudice to the main implementation of the programme components indicated in Article 3 (a) to (e). The Commission therefore intends to prioritise the implementation of the programme’s components.” Security configuration committee for security: “The Commission emphasises that, due to the sensitivity of the security aspects of the programme and in accordance with Article 3(4) and Article 6(2) of Regulation (EU) 182/2011, it is particularly important that the chair of the Programme Committee meeting in the Security Configuration makes every effort to find solutions which command the widest possible support on the security aspects of the programme within the Committee.” Copernicus Market Development as core task of the EU Agency: “The Commission regrets that additional tasks (Copernicus market development) will be given to the EU Agency while it would not have the resources to cope with them. Bearing in mind the overall resources constraints, the Agency may have to cope with these new activities by means of internal redeployment, notably through seeking further synergies and efficiencies.”", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this vote confirms the commitment to implement for the first time a European approach for building up digital capacity and infrastructure in strategic areas, such as, for example, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and of course it will support also the digital single market.

We have not only created but also installed and strengthened the European Border and Coast Guard in record time with our joint work and efforts. Knowing very well the complexity of the legislative procedures, we all agree that it is indeed an achievement. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to our rapporteur, Ms Metsola, and all the shadows and the Romanian Presidency as well, for having found a well-balanced compromise on this proposal. This agreement highlights once again that, when working together, we can bring real results and show to our citizens that the Union is willing and able to act. When the crisis, as you all remember, peaked in Europe in the summer of 2015, Europe was taken by surprise and was not prepared. Confronted with an inflow of irregular arrivals through our eastern and southern borders (the Mediterranean Sea), we knew that we had to take resolute action. There was no consolidated European borders agency, no hot spots or an operational presence on the ground at the EU level. The European asylum system proved not to be fit for purpose. Our information systems did not talk to each other, and our approach in engaging with third countries was fragmented. We were forced to take both immediate and long-term measures and to work on all these fronts in parallel. Now, four years later, anyone trying to cross our external borders irregularly is identified, fingerprinted and thoroughly screened. Today we have an up-and-running European Borders and Coast Guard Agency and reinforced migration, border and security information systems, which are progressively becoming interoperable. With the new regulation that we are debating now, we will be able to achieve more. One of its key elements is a European border and coast guard standing corps, which will be gradually and swiftly established in its full capacity of 10 000 by 2027. However, we will be able to observe the first deployments already on 1 January 2021. The other key element of this proposal, and an important game-changer, is that the agency’s own statutory staff will also be team members with executive powers. This means that they will carry out border management and return tasks in their own right. Of course, the competent authorities of the host Member State will remain responsible for, and have command and control of, the European Border and Coast Guard activities taking place on its territory. While remaining under the authority of the host Member States, some of the tasks will include the possibility to check identity documents, to authorise or refuse entry at border crossing points, to stamp travel documents, to patrol borders and stop persons who have crossed the borders irregularly, and to assist in the implementation of return procedures, notably by preparing return decisions or escorting non-EU nationals who are subject to forced return. The operational staff of the standing corps will also receive common training to ensure that the highest professional standards are applied and respected and a common operational culture is developed among the staff. The compromise will ensure that the agency can better and more actively support the Member States in the area of return in order to improve the European Union’s response to persisting migratory challenges. I welcome also many other developments agreed by the co-legislators as part of this regulation, such as streamlining of the monitoring of the fundamental rights within the Agency’s operational activities. The respect of fundamental rights is at the heart of all Commission initiatives, including this one. All of the activities of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the Member States’ competent authorities will respect the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter. The Agency will work closely with the future EU Asylum Agency to ensure effective access to asylum procedures. The Agency will also help to ensure that those that are not in need of international protection are returned in full respect, I repeat, of fundamental rights. I hope that once the next Parliament is in place, the proposal to set up the EU’s Asylum Agency will be quickly adopted. I hope so. I also want to add that I regret that the possibility of a monthly differential payment to the statutory staff members was not retained in the final agreement. This aimed to improve the attractiveness of the Agency as an employer, to ensure timely recruitment of statutory staff. We will forward a declaration in this regard to this Parliament. Last but not least, a new political steering for the implementation of the European integrated border management will be put in place as well. This will include a planning of capabilities for the European Border and Coast Guard as well as ensuring coherence and consistency with the European Union’s overall external policy. Indeed, with this new regulation, both the Agency and the Member States will have the tools to anticipate and respond to future crises at the EU’s external borders. Ultimately this will also help preserve the long-term viability of the Schengen area of free movement. Thank you very much for your attention, and I’m looking forward to your views. Commission statements (in writing) “Acknowledging the challenges faced by the EBCG Agency in the coming years to fulfil the exceptional needs for recruiting and retaining of qualified staff from the broadest possible geographical basis in the view of building up the Agency’s Standing Corps, and considering the substantial mobility of these staff members and the need to ensure equal treatment among them, the Commission proposed concrete arrangements. These proposed arrangements were of a temporary nature and subject to a review clause, in order to assess their contribution to the objectives pursued and to take account of other ongoing processes having an impact on staff remuneration, including the continuous monitoring and improvement of the statistical methodology used to calculate correction coefficients under Annex XI to the Staff Regulations. In this context while taking note of the joint statement by the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission strongly regrets that the Co-legislators decided not to retain its proposal to allow the Agency's Management Board to temporarily grant a monthly differential payment to the statutory staff members. The Commission believes that this decision may be detrimental to the attractiveness of the Agency as employer and to create optimal conditions for the timely recruitment of statutory staff as a prerequisite for the swift establishment of the standing corps in coming years. Moreover, in response to the joint statement by the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission notes that it has neither obligation nor intention at this stage to present any proposal for the revision of the Staff Regulations. The Commission notes that the co-legislators recently amended the rules for updating remuneration and pensions under Annex XI to the Staff Regulations and included a clear timeline for a possible subsequent review, on the basis of a report to be submitted by the Commission in 2022. The Commission believes that the latter report should provide an opportunity to assess the existing system and notably its impact on the attractiveness of EU institutions and agencies as employers. The Commission also notes that, within the existing legislative framework, Eurostat and national statistical institutes have initiated discussions on the possibility to update the statistical methodology of correction coefficient calculation in order to take into account expenditure incurred outside the place of employment.”", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 132, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Jens GEIER", "mepid": "96833", "text": "Draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen!

First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Roberta Metsola, for her constructive and open cooperation, without which we would never have been able to prepare this proposal. I also thank Commissioner Avramopoulos and his staff for their continued support. As the number of refugees arriving in Europe increased unexpectedly and dramatically in 2015, ensuring the protection of Europe&#39;s borders became an important and urgent task. To this end, a new Frontex bill was born in 2016. The present report is a further development of this law. The current proposal gives the agency wider powers than before, provides more financial support, and provides more professionals to carry out its tasks. It was particularly important for me and my group during the negotiations to ensure that rescuing refugees at sea remains a fundamental task for Frontex. About this humanitarian the Agency may never, under any circumstances, waive this obligation. We cannot allow far-right governments and ministers to play with people’s lives out of selfish political gain. At the same time, the current proposal gives the Agency significantly greater powers than before to repatriate legally rejected refugees. However, this can only apply to refugees in the territory of the European Union, and the Agency has neither the political nor the legal possibility to take part in actions to return rejected refugees from a third country to a third country. I also consider it important from a moral point of view that the report strongly reinforces the agency&#39;s commitment to respecting the human rights of refugees, fundamental rights. Finally, I find it extremely unfortunate that, while we have made legitimate efforts to protect Europe&#39;s borders, the Council has been unable to reach an agreement on a common European border. asylum system. Political short-sightedness and selfishness prevented the reform of the Dublin system, or even the acceptance of the asylum agency’s pre-agreement since the summer of 2017.

That is why we really think it is welcome that the Commission - here 17-18 years after the introduction of Schengen work - took the initiative to create a real border agency. The reason why we, on the part of the ECR Group, cannot support the compromise that has emerged from the trialogue negotiations is that we are simply again afraid that it will be too little, too late. We are concerned that there are so many safeguards in the game that it will not have the desired effect on Europe&#39;s security.

I think we really had a very constructive position in Parliament, especially when it comes to search and rescue. We here in the House all voted to make sure that Frontex has a stronger mandate in search and rescue because of the humanitarian crisis that we see unfolding in the Mediterranean every day. So I’m really happy that there was a majority in this House for that.  But the Member States saw it very differently. They have blocked the rapporteur’s attempts to put search and rescue more strongly into the text of this legislation, and that is really a problem. So Frontex can now still only rescue people within the limits of border surveillance operations and that currently means just 30 sea miles off the coast of Sicily.  That’s a very small area. That is not the place where we have the problem. People are drowning in the Mediterranean Sea right now, while everyone is watching. We know where they are. Their coordinates are clear. They are known to Frontex. But no one is coming to rescue the people in need. Operation Sophia is not running any more. NGOs are being criminalised and their ships are being taken away.  Also Frontex monitors the Mediterranean only by plane and refers search and rescue cases to the Libyan coastguards, but in Libya there is a civil war going on. No one there is picking up the phone. Nobody rescues from there. With that, Europe is violating its obligation to save lives by shifting it to a non-existent Libyan rescue centre. In the long term, we do need to have a civil sea rescue in the Mediterranean organised at European level because Member States are not willing to act. But we cannot wait until then. We have to use the means available. Otherwise, we are letting the values of Europe drown together with the people in the Mediterranean.

Thanks for all the good cooperation we have enjoyed throughout these years. Thanks also to the Commissioner for this excellent proposal. When I fly over Europe, I see no borders. These words were attributed to the first president of the free Czechoslovakia, Václav Havel, and the great success of European integration: the removal of the internal borders rests on having strong external borders. Let me be very clear. It’s not about building a fortress Europe. It’s not about turning away people, it is primarily about exercising control over the flows of people going in and out of the Union. It’s about making sure that we conduct proper screening, security checks and process in an orderly manner all those who arrive here seeking international protection. Proper border protection is also crucial to fight the influx of counterfeit products, narcotics, weapons and other items and substances that we do not want in the European Union. The report we are adopting today does not go towards a fully federalised competence. In my view, that is the way forward, but this is a very important step in the right direction. And allow me – I have been a Member here for 10 years and this is one of my last speeches in plenary after the 10 years – to thank every colleague and everybody that I worked with and remember that where politics ends, friendship remains and to make an end is also a chance to make a new beginning.

But, having said that, surely the solution to this is simply the rule of law. If people seek to enter the European Union illegally there should be a very firm and stern rule saying: I’m sorry, but you must be sent back. However, on the other hand to that, there must be a defined legal route for people to claim asylum because all civilised nations accept the right to asylum for those who are being persecuted.

I’ve worked with NGOs and taken every opportunity to listen to people who have been forced to migrate because of conflict and unsustainable lives.  We have a tragic situation whereby people are willing to risk drowning in our seas in order to start new lives here in Europe. So there are elements of this regulation that I welcome. I’m glad that the European Border and Coast Guard Agency will conduct searches to prevent people drowning. Those who are rescued must then be treated with empathy and humanity, and I particularly welcome the commitment to fundamental rights when working with third countries.  However, more than managing borders and documenting migration, we should take responsibility for and tackle the inequality and deprivation that forces so many to abandon their homes and risk dangerous journeys. We must uphold European values, protect the vulnerable and ensure our communities welcome those who, in a different moment of history, could, indeed, be us.

That was our ambition: for Europe to be better prepared for the future because we don’t know what the future will hold for us. This is a major step forward and we – all in this room – can be proud of what we have achieved. It is part of our common legacy. Both the agency, and of course the Member States, will have the tools to anticipate and respond to future crises at the EU’s external borders. I strongly hope that you will support the final outcome of the negotiations during the votes later on.

This report on EU visas is another example where the EU desperately tries to pass itself off as a state. It does it when it legislates on fishing. With the passage of the Lisbon Treaty, it has done it on international affairs, and now it does it on border policy. A simple trading bloc it is not. Where it says ‘harmonisation’, it really means ‘centralisation’, one—size—fits—all and, sadly, there is no more subsidiarity.  The EU’s track record on border mismanagement should give Member States pause for thought. What is given to the EU is seldom given back, and we in the UK are finding that out. Visa requirements should be a competence of Member States, not the European Union. This report politicises visas and attempts to bribe or threaten selected third countries to take back illegal immigrants, or their own citizens will face higher fees as a result. These, we might add, are people the EU called to Europe at the beginning of the so—called refugee crisis and the waves of illegal immigration coming to Europe’s shores. The EU is trying to dig its way out of the hole it dug itself. Well, keep on digging. You’ll see where it gets you.

It was not so much about the Visa Code as goodbye from many colleagues. But, on the Visa Code, let me thank the rapporteur for this ambitious agreement to modernise and simplify the procedure for obtaining short-term visas, on which many colleagues have commented.  May I also just do what other colleagues have done, with your indulgence. This is my last speech as Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). I wasn’t going to do this – I promised that I wasn’t – but I did notice there are many colleagues here from LIBE and, after hearing Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, there is one particular thing that I wanted to say to them, which is that, if you’re reading the voting list, you’ll see one report after another from our committee. What you have seen in colleagues who are assembled here are experts on Schengen, visas, borders and Dublin – Ms Wikström is scribbling away – and on the asylum package, and, while you see many reports being voted on – you can thank Commissioner Avramopoulos – you will see that many of our reports are frozen and blocked. This is because we are something of an extraordinary committee, the most prolific legislative committee in Parliament at the moment, but we are dealing with some of the toughest issues because we are dealing with a very tough political climate.  I want to thank from the bottom of my heart all of the members of the LIBE Committee who I’ve had the privilege to work with. They have been producing high-quality legislation. It is my greatest hope that, in the next term, this legislation will be unfrozen, and that the Member States will understand what has been produced in this Parliament – the quality of the legislation, the vision that has been produced – and understand that this European Parliament is not a rubber stamp. It is full of high-quality legislators who had vision and passion. It’s been my absolute privilege to work with them and to learn from them, and I will never forget this experience.

In that way it will contribute to the European Union’s economy and growth, people-to-people contacts and cultural exchanges.

That should also be because this is the final climate legislation that we are adopting this term so this means that, after this, we will have to have a lot of improvements for the next term. But, on this one, we can celebrate this because it is the first time that the European Union is going to regulate CO2 emissions from heavy—duty vehicles. It was – as it was with the CO2 and cars legislation – a tough fight with a lot of resistance, but I think we managed, in good cooperation with the different shadow rapporteurs and all the different groups, whom I would like to thank for their contributions. We did not always agree, but I think, in the end, we have come to a deal which everyone can support and feel that we are touching the importance of this file, which is putting a CO2 reduction of 15% in place for 2025 and, by 2030, a binding target of 30%, and especially that long—term prospects will give a very clear signal to the car manufacturers and the truck manufacturers that they will need to invest in new technologies. We also managed to close all the loopholes, mainly around the super credits, and shift that to a 2% benchmark of zero-emission vehicles, which also gives a clear signal to the manufacturers that they will not be able to stay only improving current combustion engine technologies, but that they also need to invest in new technologies for the future, which can be zero—emission, e—mobility and also hydrogen. That is still open, but this is a clear signal now to the manufacturers that this is the direction to go in. As I said, it was a hard fight. Clearly, from a Green perspective, we would have loved to see higher targets on the table, but I think what is very important is that now manufacturers have clarity for the longer term so that they know where their investments need to go in order to make sure that the transport sector is also cleaning up and working towards decarbonisation. Because when people ask you about heavy—duty vehicles and how important it is, I would just remind you that it is 6% of the total European emissions, and of the road transport emissions, it is even 25%. So we are talking about a very important category, which is, on top of that, even increasing, whereas we know that, by 2050, we should have decarbonised our economy. That’s why it is so important to put this legislation in place. We will have reviews in place by 2022 and I can promise you that, by then, we probably will look at the targets that we agreed upon, tomorrow, and we will conclude that we can do more because of the signals we gave to the manufacturers and the investments that will go into zero-emission vehicles so that the market is also finally changing and we get new jobs and job creation also within the European Union. Because on heavy—duty vehicles it was really high time that, as Europe, we started to regulate this because countries like the United States, Japan and Canada already regulated that before us. So we are catching up and making sure that innovation and these new technologies will be done within Europe, creating the jobs within Europe and, at the same time, delivering a decarbonisation of our transport sector, which is so badly needed if we want to achieve the Paris Agreement with that. I think that is a good achievement and, once again, I would like to thank all the shadows and also the Commission and the Council – which is not there – for their close cooperation in getting this deal done, and I look forward to the vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, it’s a pleasure to be here today for the final debate on the legislation setting the first ever CO2 emission standards for new heavy—duty vehicles. The agreement reached by the European Parliament and the Council is a very important achievement and it marks the completion of a comprehensive legislative framework on climate and clean energy for 2030. A swift agreement on this regulation has been possible thanks to the constructive efforts and spirit of compromise of the negotiators from both institutions. I would like very especially to thank the rapporteur, Mr Eickhout, and all the shadow rapporteurs and congratulate them on the very good result achieved in such a short time-frame.  The agreement reached is both ambitious and balanced. Its most important elements are that for new heavy—duty vehicles the European Union fleet-wide average CO2 emissions will have to be 15% lower in 2025 and 30% lower in 2030, compared to the reference period, which covers July 2019 to June 2020. The targets cover the largest vehicles, which account for about 17% of the total CO2 emissions of the heavy—duty sector, and a technology-neutral incentive system will stimulate manufacturers to deploy zero and low—emission vehicles in the next decade, starting in 2019 with super credits and followed by a benchmark system from 2025 onwards. A strong governance system will make sure that the emission reductions occur in reality and not only on paper. A comprehensive review in 2022 will evaluate the effectiveness of the legislation. This new legislation completes the picture required to put the road transport sector on a clear pathway towards clean mobility and a broader transition to a climate—neutral economy. Let me highlight its main benefits. Without action, emissions from heavy—duty vehicles would represent almost 25% of road transport emissions, which are set to increase by almost 10% by 2030 compared to 2010. With the targets agreed and with the post—2020 targets for cars and vans, greenhouse gas emissions from road transport will be reduced by 24% by 2030 compared to 2005. This will help Member States to reach the binding targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation and the European Union to deliver its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Transport operators will benefit from fuel savings of up to EUR 25 000 in the first five years of use of a new truck bought in 2025 and around EUR 60 000 for a new truck bought in 2030. This will help in particular 600 000 small and medium—sized enterprises that operate in the European Union freight transport sector and employ almost three million people. The legislation will also contribute to modernising the European Union economy, and especially the automotive sector, to channel investments and strengthen innovation for clean-vehicles technologies. In particular, the incentive system for zero and low—emission heavy—duty vehicles will reward the frontrunners in developing and deploying such innovative vehicles. The legislation also provides a signal for investors in refuelling and recharging infrastructure so that the enabling conditions for the deployment of zero and low—emission vehicles are created. Finally, it is also projected to have positive impacts on economic growth and employment and to lower European Union oil imports.  Honourable Members, let me conclude by inviting you to support this ambitious and balanced agreement when voting tomorrow. This new legislation will put Europe on track towards the necessary transition towards clean  mobility. I would also take the opportunity to inform the Members of this House that the Commission has tabled two statements to accompany its full support for the overall agreement. They concern the continuous development of the Vehicle Energy Consumption Calculation Tool (VECTO) simulation tool and the transposition of a specific provision related to the maximum authorised weight of zero—emission heavy—duty vehicles. Once again, I thank all honourable Members for their support.  Commission statements (in writing) \"Commission statement on Article 20 - amendment to Directive 96/53/EC with regard to the maximum authorised weight of alternatively fuelled or zero emission heavy-duty vehicles The Commission notes the agreement of the co-legislators relating to Article 20 of this Regulation, which amends Directive 96/53/EC without setting an explicit time limit for its transposition.  The Commission also notes that other provisions of Directive 96/53/EC are being modified by the Decision [2018/0130(COD)], which provides for an application of those new provisions as of 1 September 2020. Given the situation, the Commission calls upon Member States to carry out as soon as possible and at the latest by the same date, i.e. 1 September 2020, any necessary adaptation of their national legislation to Article 20 of the present Regulation and to inform the Commission thereof in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 96/53/EC. This would obviate any need for a further legislative proposal by the Commission on this issue.\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 217, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Henna VIRKKUNEN", "mepid": "124726", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

I know that this was not an easy file, and it is very positive that we have yet another policy in place to reduce CO2 emissions, because for far too long we had no standards for heavy duty vehicles, fully aware that these trucks have a major impact on global warming and that their climate impact is expected to further increase if we remain with the ‘business as usual’ scenario. It is high time that the EU adopts binding CO2 targets for heavy duty vehicles. Now moving from the Commission’s original position, and agreeing to binding targets was a tough job, and negotiating with the Council about introducing a ZLEV benchmark was definitely an achievement. I know this far too well. Allow me also to thank our S&amp;D shadow rapporteur, Damiano Zoffoli, for his strong contribution and for his role in ensuring a good compromise was reached. Parliament’s position set the right ambition, something that we strongly need in order to be in line with our climate commitments, and I believe that the future for cleaner vehicles, including trucks, will be driven by innovation. It is only strong incentives for the production of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles that will ultimately push this change.

I would like to start by answering a direct question that was raised by Mr Sośnierz. He raised a question about what this Parliament has done for climate change. My answer is: quite a lot. What has the European Union done for climate change? Quite a lot. Before 2020, we established ambitious targets and, in 2017, we reduced our emissions by more than 22%, compared with 1990, while GDP grew by 58%. We have reduced emissions, we have developed renewables and we have increased energy efficiency. But this Parliament, in five years, has delivered a formidable legislative framework on energy and climate. I have been in politics for 38 years, and I have served in regional, national and European parliaments. In any period in my life, I don’t recall such intense legislative activity as we have seen in these years, and I have to thank the chairmen and chairwomen of the committees – Jerzy Buzek, Adina Vălean, Giovanni La Via – and all the rapporteurs, starting with my friend, Bas Eickhout, who did impressive work, not only here, but also making my life difficult in the Renewables Directive.  It’s really true, because what have we done? We have established a substantial number of pieces of legislation, which will deliver a reduction of emissions in 2030 of 45% and, if they are unchanged (but they will be changed), in 2050 will deliver a 60% reduction of emissions. So we have a substantial package. One of the most important things is the average level of political support for these proposals. In the Energy Package, 80% of the votes in each package were in favour, and on climate, without taking account of tomorrow’s vote, 76%. There has been substantial political support for the legislation we have implemented for 2050, and in this House that is not so frequent. That means there has been dialogue and understanding. We have given up positions, we have negotiated and, for me, I can say it has been a formidable experience. I have participated in 71 trilogues and I have spent more than 350 hours of my life in difficult dialogues. It has been a formidable experience, and I want to thank all of you, because this has been a wonderful job that, without the involvement of the Members of this Parliament, would have been impossible, because the Parliament has raised the level of ambition of the Commission proposals. I am happy about that. This is the gain. This is the institutional way of going forward. I think that we have a cumbersome procedure, but it has the fundamental value that the legislation will be applied in the next ten years, and we will have review clauses to increase ambition over time. And the next Parliament will have to take the responsibility and increase ambition. But this Parliament has not finished its work. In the last opinion poll, published last Wednesday, I saw that 77% of potential voters identified global warming as an important criterion when deciding who to vote for in the May European elections, and that’s a very important issue. I think when we have the European elections, climate change policy has been one of the main factors to be discussed within them. I encourage all of you to do two things. First, I want you to explain to the European people what we have done during these five years and also to say what you want to do in the next five years. I think that will bring more people to the polling stations and will give bigger support to the next Parliament. We will have the position that, in the next five years, we will complete this package, we will make further progress and we will work together towards making the European Union the first major economy to become climate neutral in 2050.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 238, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Bas EICKHOUT", "mepid": "96725", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, first of all, since we are all in a thanking mood, I would like to thank Commissioner Arias Cañete for all his work. Of course we had our moments when we didn’t agree. I spent some of those hours together with you and I have to say that at all times, we had a good dialogue. We did not always agree, but there was always mutual respect and I think that’s also the way forward. You’re absolutely right. We achieved quite a lot on climate, on mobility, and on energy, but the work is not done, as you said. We are not on track yet for our climate-neutral economy and we need to act faster; Greta Thunberg also made that point very strongly yesterday. Indeed, that’s one of the reasons why the elections in May will be about climate change. It will be a climate change election.  Just to conclude on this subject, Mr Peter Liese, thank you very much for coming back. Of course I can tell you where we, as a Parliament, improved the text and made it more ambitious, and it’s on three very important issues. First of all, the 2030 target is now legally binding, which it was not in the initial proposal. That is very important because it’s a very clear signal for where to go. Secondly, we closed quite a few loopholes in the proposals, the most important one being super credits, which are weakening when it comes to getting to your targets. We replaced them with a benchmark for low- and zero-emission vehicles. And thirdly, we improved the on-road in-service conformity to make sure that what we agree on paper is also going to be achieved in reality, which is very important, as you should know after dieselgate.  So those three elements are crucial. On top of that, there are a lot of technical improvements and a review clause etc., etc., but these three things give a very clear signal to investors, and to manufacturers, that the future will be about zero- and low-emission vehicles and that just continuing with your current technologies will not do. That is a crucial element. It is an improvement compared with the initial proposal, so I had to give you that answer.  Thank you very much. I’m looking forward to the vote, and let’s see what we can do afterwards, especially in the run-up to the UN summit in September in New York. I expect that the European Union will increase its national determined contribution when we head off to New York. I see the Commissioner praying, so, for once, I will pray along.

As you said the cooperation was not always easy, but it was open, very dedicated and we delivered. Thanks to the commitment and the determination of all three legislators really, we got a successful conclusion on this file. The clean mobility package. The public sector through that got an important role to play in the overall decarbonisation of European transport, especially in the bus segment where public procurement represents 70% of the market. By mobilising public procurement to accelerate the deployment of clean vehicles, the directive will help us to take an important step towards zero—emission mobility. In our view, the text that was agreed at the trilogue on 11 February 2019 represents a good compromise between the different positions and requirements. It ensures a good level of ambition, while leaving sufficient flexibility in the implementation so that the directive’s objective can be achieved without creating substantial administrative burdens for public authorities. With the adoption of this revised directive we will introduce a clean vehicle definition and set minimum national targets for their public procurement, including specific targets for zero-emission buses. I’m confident that the agreement reached in the trilogue sets a stringent enough definition and realistic, yet ambitious, national targets. The text also leaves full flexibility in the way the effort is shared within a Member State, thus allowing for a cost-effective implementation that will not create excessive burdens on individual public authorities. Many of our cities – I can mention Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris, Warsaw, Barcelona, Hamburg, Milan, Ljubljana and Munich, among others, but there are many more – have already made voluntary commitments, going even beyond what will be required by the directive and we will now help other cities follow their example. The revision will also expand the scope of the directive to cover public procurement through practices such as lease-hire purchase and rentals. This will ensure that the directive better reflects current practices in public procurement and it will help to achieve the expected impact on the market. Together, these measures will help provide clear, long-term market signals and will allow public authorities, manufacturers and investors to better plan for the transition towards zero-emission mobility by mid-century. The adoption of this directive would therefore represent an important step towards the decarbonisation of our mobility and towards our clearly defined vision zero by 2050.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 244, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Markus PIEPER", "mepid": "28224", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

Mr Grzyb, you are a very fair rapporteur, and I mean that most sincerely. You have conducted the negotiations between the different groups very well, and I congratulate you on having done so. This file is a really good example of the kind of things that we were elected here to do – to up the ambition when it comes to tackling climate change, to increase the action that we take when it comes to cleaning up the vehicles that are on our roads, which are the single leading contributor not only to CO2 emissions but to the poor quality air that we see in far too many of our cities, and that is affecting far too many of our citizens. Public procurement alone accounts for some 14% of the GDP of the Union and 75% of new bus registrations. It is a great and noble thing at that we will be coming together here to provide money for clean vehicles that will deliver public goods and help Member States achieve the climate and energy targets. By 2030, 65% of buses will have to be clean as defined under the directive. it is now up to the Commission and Member State governments to ensure that local authorities are given the sufficient means. But I have to say, in response to my colleagues in the EPP, we need this ambition. We cannot simply sit back and hope that things will somehow evolve over time and that we will get there in the end. We have to take the tough decisions now. We are seeing protests, not just in some Member States, but in all Member States, by young people, by concerned citizens. We have to take that action now and that’s why I’m very proud that we have done so. But I must also say it is Parliament and it is the cities that always want the more ambition and it is the Member States that always push back. This is the lesson of my five years in this Parliament, I very much hope I will return to this Parliament, being a Brit, that’s a slightly precarious situation. Who knows? But let me just say thank you to everyone that I’ve worked with here. If this is my last speech in this plenary, you are all wonderful and you come here to do the right thing and I’m very, very pleased to have learned so much from you and I hope to come back to learn even more.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 246, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Mark DEMESMAEKER", "mepid": "117477", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

I would like to once again thank the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs for what has been a very constructive negotiation. This has allowed us to complete the process in time for this Parliament to adopt the text before the recess. Together with other elements of the mobility package 1, 2 and 3, the revised directive will play an important role in helping us achieve the substantive emission reductions in the transport sector that are required in order to comply with our obligations under the Paris COP 21 agreement and beyond. Adopting it under this Parliament will ensure a timely contribution to these objectives by as early as 2025. But before I conclude, allow me a couple of comments based on your comments. First regarding the level of ambitions. Yes, this package, this proposal is an ambitious one. That’s exactly what we need. At the same time it is a very realistic one and it is in line with the market forecasts. I think it is important to recall that major city networks, police, Eurocity, then local governments for sustainability, the Council of European Municipalities and Regions, have recently written to the European Parliament and to the Romanian Presidency expressing full support for the Commission’s proposal. So yes, local levels are ready to engage. The purchase cost of zero-emission electric vehicles, whether with batteries or fuel cells, is currently high, that is true as well. But total lifecycle costs are already close to those of conventional vehicles and are expected to become even lower within the time frame of the proposal’s targets and with the growing demand. Economies of volumes and scale will bring the costs down. Where financial support is needed we are ready to use existing instruments such as EFSI, ESIF, CEF, as well as similar future instruments to help facilitate the transition to low- and zero-emission mobility. Let me just recall the instrument for electrical buses that is being used by many of the European cities already. So having clear targets on public procurement in clean vehicles will really facilitate this. Just a quick note also on some additional information regarding the industry. Last June, in 2018, a group of leading industry representatives, ABB, ALSTOM, EDF, Skoda, Solaris, Ursus and others, sent an open letter to the Council asking for higher ambition than that proposed by the Commission, and confirming that they are ready to deliver. So we have encouragement on both sides: on the demand and on the supply side. Last but not least, let me just confirm what was also mentioned by you. Many leading cities are indeed already going beyond the requirements and many have committed to using only zero-emission buses already in the next five to ten years. The aim of the directive is to encourage other cities to follow this example, while recognising that many small and medium-sized cities might not yet have the resources and expertise of Amsterdam or Paris. But we are ready to engage and pool orders, and they can then together negotiate a better price with the industry. Therefore I am very much looking forward to the adoption of Mr Grzyb’s report in plenary tomorrow. I think that this file again proves that if we recognise a clear need and join our forces, we can deliver very concrete benefits for European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 254, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Andrzej GRZYB", "mepid": "23785", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

Companies will save time and money when they launch a new business or branch and update information available on business registers. And all this with strong security standards.  I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Tadeusz Zwiefka, and the Council presidencies for the fast work on the proposal and for the excellent cooperation. The Commission is pleased with the result. In particular, the political agreement on the directive on digital tools and processes further clarifies that Member States can maintain their existing national systems, procedures and requirements, while making possible online procedures for formation of companies, registration of branches and filing of documents. As an important safeguard against fraud, the directive will specify in which exceptional cases Member States can require physical presence in the procedures.  I am also delighted that the co-legislators have agreed on the rules concerning the exchange of information about disqualified directors. It is a very important step towards a more transparent business environment and the prevention of fraud. Finally, more information from business registers will be available for free to stakeholders, especially on who can legally represent a company. This will help to bring more trust to business transactions. The Commission therefore fully supports the compromise reached by the co—legislators and is looking forward to tomorrow’s vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 260, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Emil RADEV", "mepid": "124850", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

I have had so many over the five years. Working on many different topics, with Ms Evelyn Regner, Mr Pascual de Grandes, and many others, I always felt the necessary, useful and so vitally important portion of synergy and political will: synergy of expertise and common sense and a synergy in understanding what it is necessary to do. This company law package is, I think, a very good example. It is very complex and, according to what I heard from knowledgeable people, many of them didnʼt believe that we would come up with it and push it through. So at this moment we are at the end of a very difficult but – I believe – successful road. The EU’s single market offers many opportunities for companies to move and grow. However, often companies cannot make use of them in practice. The Commission proposal responded to long-standing calls from the European Parliament, trade unions and business organisations for rules in this area. And, of course, I have to very warmly thank the rapporteur, Ms Evelyn Regner, and the Council presidencies for their constructive approach and efficient work on this very important and complex proposal.  I am very pleased that the European Parliament and the Council found a good and pragmatic compromise which can considerably improve the situation for both companies and their employees. The directive will enable companies to move and reorganise in the EU single market while providing necessary safeguards for employees and other stakeholders. The Commission welcomes the mandatory character of the anti-abuse measures, an important issue for the European Parliament and many stakeholders.  The Commission also welcomes the agreed provisions on employees’ rights, which include many of the issues raised in the European Parliament’s position. The four-fifths threshold for starting negotiations in all three cross—border operations, the mandatory character of such negotiations and the provisions to protect the negotiated solution in the event of subsequent operations provide a very complete and comprehensive package of safeguards.  In addition, the new article on information and consultation emphasises and specifies the employees’ rights to have a say in a cross-border operation, which was also essential for this House. Remembering the divergent positions when the negotiations started, the Commission would like to congratulate the co-legislators on the solutions found. The compromise strikes a good balance and represents a huge step forward compared with the current situation. It provides solid and fair rules for all parties involved in cross-border operations, while not making the procedure too cumbersome in practice. Therefore, the Commission can fully support the compromise and is looking forward to tomorrow’s vote.

Indeed, this is what we wanted. We wanted to come up with enabling legislation combining safeguards against abuse with safeguards to guarantee the rights of employees and shareholders, and guaranteeing that no letter-box companies and no tax avoidance or tax evasion will be allowed by means of this legislation. This was complex work. It required a lot of our expertise and a lot of our, as I said at the beginning, political will. I also appreciate the fact that we not only worked together in a spirit of good compromise, but also worked under – let’s say – time pressure at the end of our terms and we managed. So thank you very much for the cooperation. I think that we are together presenting a very good and balanced proposal and I do hope that tomorrow it will be rubber-stamped by a positive vote in this House.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 276, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Evelyn REGNER", "mepid": "96998", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

It will be a game—changer for a much-lacking defence cooperation in Europe. Since the proposal of the Commission in June last year, the work has been very intense, both in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) and then in the trilogue. Today we have a partial agreement at first reading for which I hope the Chamber will vote tomorrow. Agreeing on the main parameters of the fund is really a key milestone towards defence union.  I would like to sincerely thank at the very beginning, the negotiating team of ITRE. All of you were very dedicated negotiators; so the rapporteur Mr Krasnodębski, Ms Grossetête, Mr Riquet, Mr Martin, Mr Bütikofer, and of course not forgetting Mr McAllister. Thanks very much all of you.  The EDF will on one side enhance Europe’s strategic autonomy in supporting the development of key defence capabilities, but on the other it will help increase the efficiency of public spending on defence by increasing cooperation. With the EDF we are using the EU budget to co-finance defence industrial projects, incentivising cooperation in defence, increasing the competitiveness and innovative potential of the European defence industry, enhancing Europe’s technological autonomy and, ultimately, positioning Europe as a true security provider, of course not in contradiction with NATO but in complementarity with it.  EDF, as partially agreed, will include many features for which this Parliament has fought hard. Let me just name a few, they were mentioned by the rapporteur, but let me look at this from the Commission perspective.  So first, EU rules will apply; no (inaudible) based on competition with a clear EU—based governance. This was an important element for the Commission as, of course, the EU budget is involved here. As supported by Parliament, the Commission will directly implement the fund. Second, we collectively maintained and even strengthened the question of the eligibility of the fund, and here the rule is very clear: we will only finance EU-based companies, companies which respect clear security conditions, so the security of supply, security of information and no transfer of knowledge from Europe.  We are not excluding anybody from our alliance; however, we are just setting the conditions for participation to make sure that Europe’s interests are preserved. These conditions, as I keep repeating, are similar if not identical to the ones EU companies are facing when doing R&amp;D in third countries. Third point, cooperation, which is of course at the core of the fund. We are incentivising it by specific rules, also promoting the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises and mid-caps. The EDF is not only for the big defence industrial groups, it is also for the smaller actors across Europe. With specific bonuses we hope to open up the defence supply chain. Fourth point: it has been made clear in the legal text that actions have to comply with relevant national, Union and international law, as well as with the ethical principles reflected in there. As asked by Parliament, the Commission will issue guidance on the ethics to applicants and to the independent experts that will carry out the ethics screenings and assessment. The fund also clearly excludes actions for the development of lethal autonomous weapons without human control. Fifth point: the EDF will support disruptive innovation, as up to 8% of the budget will be allocated to disruptive technologies and both the Commission and Parliament are on the very same page here. I believe that the compromise text offers a satisfactory solution, while the annual work programme, as was mentioned by the rapporteur, shall be adopted by the implementing act. The list of priority fields was introduced to frame the content of the work programme and the Commission is ready to come to Parliament each year to discuss the content of the work programme.  This approach, as you know, is not specific or unique to defence. There are other funding programmes, programme proposals, which make use of implementing acts and they were accepted by Parliament and I wanted to underline that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 282, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Alain LAMASSOURE", "mepid": "1204", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

The EU keeps evolving towards a totalitarian union and eventually towards a military one. The EU Commission is trying to present this evolving project under a peace perspective, but it is clear that the EU and its supporters have in mind an EU army. French President Emmanuel Macron recently encouraged the creation of a European army to defend Europe. How can anyone think to create a federal military project that involves 27 nations and 24 languages? Like our great former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher used to say, you have no source of money other than the money people themselves earn. In a moment when the euro is in crisis and there need to be tax cuts to encourage growth, Europe should worry about major citizens’ concerns, such as industry’s lack of competitiveness, carbon leakage and unemployment. A pan-European army would be the ultimate EU disaster. Unlike Russia or the US, Europe is not a unitary actor. Also recent historical events, such as, of course, the vote for Brexit and the elected anti—EU Government in Italy, would discourage federalist integration. I find it utterly unreal how a bunch of unelected bureaucrats are making decisions about defence, about war and peace. My colleagues and I are strongly against the creation of an EU army and we hope that Member States will soon realise that giving more power to the unelected EU Commission in Brussels in the defence field is a mistake. In conclusion, as my final speech in this parliamentary session, I implore you to move away from creating this European superstate, including an EU army. No good will ever come of it and I hope the MEPs elected for the new Parliament will start to reverse this and respect the nation state and democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 289, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Jerzy BUZEK", "mepid": "28269", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

As a European pillar of NATO, this force should be used to defend the European Union in times of threats and direct attacks, hence I do support Mr Krasnodębski’s report on the conditionality that further steps towards this force will be taken.

What I want to say is that by no means was this an easy file to be agreed upon by all of us, by all three European institutions, and again, I would like to thank all of you who really, with great devotion, tried to find a good solution to different, difficult aspects of this file. Let me refer only to two of them. First, on cooperation, because many of you referred to the amount of money. Let me say it again: the lack of cooperation in the defence industry sector has its cost, and this is something between EUR 25 billion and 100 billion annually. This is the cost of no cooperation in the defence industrial sector. The second point concerns the export of weapons, because it was raised by some of you. The Treaty here is very clear: we discussed it a lot. It is a very unique competence of the Member States, and we will not change it in any way through this regulation. We are not increasing weapons exports; what we want and what our intention is, is to decrease our technological dependence on third countries, and the cooperation and this decreasing technological dependence are some of the most important features of the fund. I’m very sure that defence will become one of the engines of European integration. We are still talking about defence industrial cooperation – nothing more, nothing less than this – and again, I would like to stress that the Commission very much welcomes the agreement reached during the trilogues. I hope for a positive vote tomorrow, and again, let me thank all of you – the rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs and the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), Mr Buzek (because I have not mentioned him before) – thank you very much for all your hard work on this file. Again, I know it was not easy, but the agreement is, I think, satisfactory.

They fared well during the crisis, while other sources of funding dried up. They are very popular in some Member States and in others they are barely news. So the Commission proposal seeks to develop this market further by drawing on the high standards and good practices of national systems. It is a key building block of the Capital Markets Union to encourage investment and lending in the EU. The new rules will establish a pan-European covered bond market that supports lending to the real economy without disturbing already established and well-functioning national markets. They will boost the issuance of covered bonds also in Member States where markets are less developed. These rules will help banks access a broad range of safe and efficient funding tools which in turn will allow them to finance companies and households. We estimate that the potential saving for borrowers will be around EUR 1.5 billion a year. The new rules also set out to harmonise prudential rules for these instruments in order to contribute to financial stability.  The new framework is based on two pillars. So, first the directive provides a common definition of covered bonds. It outlines the features of the instruments and it identifies the high-quality assets that can be eligible to back a covered bond.  The directive establishes sound supervision for covered bonds as well, and sets out the rules allowing the use of the ‘European Covered Bonds’ labels. And the second, a regulation, strengthens the conditions for granting preferential capital treatment to covered bonds purchased by banks. As promised during the trilogues and set out in the Commission’s statement accompanying today’s acts, the Commission is willing to amend the liquidity coverage ratio, delegated act, in order to cater for the specific situation of covered bonds. This amendment will address the overlap between the cover pool liquidity buffer set out in the directive and the liquidity buffer foreseen in a liquidity coverage ratio. For this purpose, a declaration from the Commission will be transmitted to the Parliament before voting tomorrow. I wish here to thank the Parliament for this successful outcome, in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lucke, and all shadow rapporteurs. The objectives of the Commission proposals are largely maintained thanks to the effective approach of the Parliament negotiating team and the good cooperation with the Council. The transposition and implementation of the new rules on covered bonds should now proceed rapidly. This will ensure that this important source of funding can be used in all Member States, thereby promoting jobs and growth throughout the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 307, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Dariusz ROSATI", "mepid": "28394", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

If we think about mad cow disease, tax fraud on cigarettes, dieselgate or the Panama Papers, we understand that it is fundamental that Parliament has a solid and sharp power of inquiry. Ramón Jáuregui said that the Council and the Member States systematically refused to sit at the table and have a real discussion on the content of the European Parliament’s proposal. Their argument was that the proposal of the Parliament did not take into consideration their fundamental concerns. But this actually means ignoring the nature of the special legislative procedure established by Article 226 TFEU. This procedure implies that the institutions exchange views and search for a compromise acceptable for all of them. The Council demanded that the initial proposal of the European Parliament should already contain the text acceptable for the Council. This is not the way the consent procedure functions. How would the Council or the Commission react if the European Parliament refused even to discuss possible ways to reach an agreement on, let’s say, the MFF, using the pretext that it does not like the proposal of the Commission? Moreover, this attitude is not compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation between the institutions that we all should respect and cherish. At stake here is a fundamental question of respect for the prerogatives of the Parliament and for the institutional balance. It is fundamental that the Council and the Commission understand it.

Let me start by assuring you that the Council has always shared the view that committees of inquiry are an important instrument, allowing the European Parliament to exercise political control in a Union founded on the values of respect for democracy and the rule of law, as required by the Treaty. Since the Martin report in 2011, the Council has been examining a series of proposals in a very constructive spirit and in the respect of its duty of sincere cooperation. However, as is well known, the Martin report raised serious legal and institutional concerns in the Council and in the Commission with regard to the limits imposed by Article 226 of the Treaty. Indeed, this proposal for so far-reaching an extension of the rights of committees of inquiry was considered contrary to Article 226. Despite subsequent efforts to reconcile the diverse positions, such as the more recent work by the experts of the three legal services at technical level which held so many meetings, the progress made on some less problematic provisions resulting from this work did not match and did not solve the most complex issues of a legal and political nature. As was stated in a letter sent to Ms Hübner on 25 October last year by the Austrian Presidency, the Council therefore welcomed the non-paper prepared by the rapporteur, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, representing a new attempt to revive the political dialogue among the three institutions. The non-paper indeed contains a number of improvements compared to the proposal of 2014. It meets some of the concerns expressed by the Council on previous occasions and takes up some of the solutions which are jointly suggested by the legal experts of the three institutions. However, the non-paper still contains a number of provisions which give rise to serious legal and political concerns for the Council, which were raised on many past occasions. In substance, the Council’s position on these fundamental issues has not changed since the Martin report, and to be more specific, let me mention, among the most problematic issues, this power to summon individuals who are not officials as witnesses and to enforce such a measure by sanctions; the hearing of officials and other servants of the Union as witnesses; the power to request documents from natural or legal persons who have no role in the implementation of Union law; and the imposition of sanctions in the event of non-compliance. And finally, the provisions on sanctions. Let me recall that criminal law in the rules on criminal procedure are matters for which the Member States are responsible. The competences of the Union in that field are very limited. I will not go into more detail here, as you are, I hope, very familiar with the Council’s concerns, which I explained in a detailed manner in the letter I have already mentioned. Since the beginning of its term, the Romanian Presidency has been ready to continue to clarify the respective positions, also in the Commission, building upon the Austrian Presidency’s engagement in the many informal contacts between our predecessors and Mr Jáuregui and Mrs Hübner. I can assure you that the Council continues to be open to a constructive dialogue with the European Parliament in order to explore ways forward on this legally and politically-complex file. Should the new Parliament wish to carry on the work based on the progress made so far, the Council stands ready to do so in full respect of its duty of sincere cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 319, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Danuta Maria HÜBNER", "mepid": "96779", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me first welcome this occasion offered by this oral question to set out the Commission’s positions regarding the proposal for the regulation on the European Parliament’s right of inquiry. While it is of course for the Parliament to make a proposal, the procedure also requires the consent of the Council and of the Commission. Since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has made several proposals for such a regulation. The latest informal proposal, in the form of a non-paper proposal, was politically endorsed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in April last year and transmitted to the Commission and to the Council in May last year. The Commission acknowledges that the new informal proposal is drafted in more precise legal terms and incorporates several improvements: for instance, as regards the rules on the setting-up of the committee of inquiry, the procedural rules applying to its investigation or the introduction of a central contact point for inquiry. The new informal proposal also contains references to the regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by EU institutions, and to the framework agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission. However, the non-paper proposal still contains a number of legal and institutional concerns that have been at the heart of this discussion with the Parliament and the Council since 2012.  The most important concerns are: sanctions for non-compliance with the provisions of the regulations; certain aspects of the investigative means which would be in the hands of the committee, such as on-the-spot investigations, hearings of Commissioners and former Commissioners, hearings of officials and former officials, as well as hearings of natural persons; the newly introduced rule regarding remedies in the case of violation of the provisions of the regulation by a committee of inquiry, its members and officials and other servants of the European Parliament; and last, provisions which seem to grant discretionary power to the Parliament with regard to the suspension of the committee proceedings during the related court procedure.  Notwithstanding these concerns, I would like to stress the Commission’s continued willingness and commitment to engage in a constructive trilateral discussion, with a view to finding appropriate solutions to the divergences that still exist between the three institutions.  The future regulation of the right of inquiry should provide the European Parliament with the appropriate instrument to fully respect institutional prerogatives and the relevant legal frameworks of the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 320, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Maite PAGAZAURTUNDÚA", "mepid": "125038", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

The Commission again recognises the work done by the institutions so far and acknowledges that the non-paper represents certain progress compared to the earlier proposals. At the same time, as I mentioned earlier, the Commission still finds that the latest informal proposal contains a number of legal and institutional concerns, such as sanctions, investigative means and legal remedies.  The Commission acknowledges the need to have an adequate instrument which fully respects institutional prerogatives and the relevant legal frameworks of the Member States.

Exercises have been carried to understand how and why such maladministration and breaches of EU law have been happening and subsequent policy options to tackle them have been proposed. The first TAXE Committee set out ideas for transparent taxation across the EU and called for a legislative proposal on country-by-country reporting of companies’ profits, tax and subsidies, about which the Commission announced its plans a few months later. One would have expected this Parliament, especially with regard to the recent TAXE 3 committee, to deploy the best available methodologies and proceedings in its evaluation of taxation policies and financial services. Rather, it has given in to facile stigmatisation of certain countries, notably my country Malta, business sectors and professions. In such a case, the limits of this House’s investigative rights were quickly reached as soon tax populism and generalised statements replaced objective proceedings.

On behalf of the Commission, let me thank you for your support. The partial agreement you have reached with the Council on InvestEU, in a record time, will allow for preparatory work to proceed quickly. This will ensure a smooth and timely implementation on day one of the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), allowing for a seamless continuation of investment support. InvestEU will simplify our existing set of financial instruments and, under a single guarantee, rule book and brand, cater for sectors that are experiencing investment gaps and sub-optimal investments situations. Digitisation, social housing, research, energy efficiency and urban transport are just some of the key areas that today don’t find adequate financing on the market. The InvestEU guarantee will unlock such financing and crowd-in private money for the public good. To deliver its objectives, the fund will be supported by InvestEU’s advisory hub that this House wants to strengthen. The Commission welcomes this emphasis. The Commission also highly values the fact that the co-legislators have upheld its proposal for an opening of access to the EU budgetary guarantee. While the European Investment Bank’s strategic role is now enshrined in the regulation and its expertise is better recognised, other actors such as international financial institutions like the EBRD or the Council of Europe bank, but also national promotional banks and institutions, will have the opportunity to become implementing partners. This will ensure we are using all available expertise in a complementary manner, improving their geographical outreach and taking into account local needs. The preparation of the InvestEU programme and its implementation will bring those actors together, require them to set up the system, but also give them the opportunity to take ownership and co-shape the Union investment programme. This will result in a community of strong, long-term investors supporting the EU’s policy objectives. During the negotiations, the Parliament has had a key role in maintaining the focus of this instrument on policy steer, in strengthening the accountability and transparency provisions, and in raising ambitions for the climate targets. The Commission believes that all of these points improve InvestEU. Let me conclude by expressing our appreciation for the tremendous effort of the rapporteurs, their shadows and all associated committees in reaching a position within a very ambitious timeline, with a view to enabling an agreement before the European elections. I would also like to take this opportunity to extend this appreciation to the Romanian Presidency for their dedication and effort.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 332, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Elena GENTILE", "mepid": "124847", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

In that sense, we celebrate the increase of the climate spending targets for the sustainable infrastructure window and the need for climate proofing. We definitely have to be determined to accomplish the Paris Agreement and SDGs. We expect InvestEU to abide by the principle of sustainable investments. With this in mind, this Parliament has made it clear that coal, nuclear and gas infrastructure cannot be considered sustainable investments. It’s therefore imperative that we find the political will to encourage the financial sector to help finance projects that are key to the transition towards a green economy.

I was elected in 2014 on a Brexit mandate and we won the 2014 European elections. I’ve tried my best to remain true to that mandate. The 2015 general election in the UK mandated a referendum on Brexit. The 2016 referendum mandated Brexit, and the 2017 general election confirmed it. Four times the British people have made their views crystal clear.  So I find it somewhat surreal that three years on we are discussing the InvestEU project, another EUR 40 billion in taxpayers’ money and another EUR 500 million on top for the technical side, and yet we still do not know whether or not the UK will end up being part of the next MMF, the next seven-year financial plan for the European Union. It can’t be guaranteed – 29 March, 12 April, 30 June, 31 October? – and for that, frankly, I do blame the intransigence of the British Government.  And so tomorrow this House will rise for the European elections. The British people have told their politicians four times already to leave the European Union, and on 23 May they’ll tell them a fifth time. That’s why the Brexit party is surging in the polls.  I’ll finish with Frank Sinatra’s famous words: ‘And now, the end is near. And so I face the final curtain’. But as that curtain draws, we need only to be able to say this: that we didn’t do it ‘our way’, I didn’t do it ‘my way’, but that we did it the way that our constituents told us to, and that is what future politicians must, and should, do.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 341, "date": "2019-04-17.json", "name": "Ivana MALETIĆ", "mepid": "119436", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.
