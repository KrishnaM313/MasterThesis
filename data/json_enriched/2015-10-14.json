Our thoughts are with the nearly 100 people who have been killed and more than 500 injured, whom we wish a speedy and complete recovery. In these difficult days, we stand by the victims and their families. This brutal terrorist attack on peaceful demonstrators was an attack on democracy. It is quite clear that these criminals want to stir up discord and spread fear in the run-up to the elections. The perpetrators must not win! At present, the EU and Turkey are in close contact to find a common solution to the refugee situation. The dramatic events and developments also, of course, influence the current debate on Turkey's status as a safe third country. In my recent talks with Turkish opposition politicians and with the Turkish President, I have also expressed our concern at the escalating violence and polarisation in Turkey over the last few months. That is why free and pluralistic media must be defended by the state as an indispensable pillar of democracy. I have also made a strong appeal for a return to a ceasefire and a political process with the Kurds. The European Parliament has made it clear more than once that reconciliation is the only way to lead Turkey into a secure and prosperous future.

Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council which will meet tomorrow and Friday will once again be marked by the refugee crisis. This crisis is a challenge for all of us and for the Union as a whole, and we must provide the common answers that are needed. No Member State can manage migration flows on its own. We have become aware of this, perhaps sometimes painfully, hence the need for true European solidarity fully assumed. I think that in the last few weeks, things have changed in a positive way. The European Council has been dealing with this issue since the beginning of the crisis. President Tusk told you about it last week. The European Council must decide not only on emergency measures, but must also develop policy guidelines on the whole of migration and asylum policy. Tomorrow, he will discuss three fundamental issues. Firstly: to cooperate with third countries to prevent migration flows. Secondly: to strengthen the protection of the Union's external borders. Thirdly: responding to refugee flows in Europe and ensuring a return policy. Let me go into these three areas: first, cooperation with third countries. Mr President, I would like above all to join, on behalf of the Presidency and the Council, in the words you made earlier. The murderous and criminal attack in Ankara shocked and shocked us all. We are of course with the Turkish people, we share their sadness and we express our sympathy, our solidarity and our deepest condolences. But beyond that, we also share what you have said about the importance of dialogue, about all the efforts that must be made to organize the elections, to give Turkish democracy the strength it absolutely needs in these difficult times.  I return to the part of cooperation with third countries, particularly with countries of origin and transit, which is a top priority for good management of migration flows. Until conditions in these countries improve, too many refugees will risk their lives to leave and nothing will stop them.  On 8 October, the high-level conference on the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route was held. It marks the beginning of a process that will allow us to strengthen cooperation with all our partners, for the benefit of all, for a more efficient management of migration flows. Solidarity with the Balkan countries seems to me to be of great importance in this regard. These countries also face challenges, including economic difficulties: we must help, support and support them. The Valletta summit with African countries, scheduled for mid-November, will need to forge a stronger partnership and lead to concrete measures. A few weeks ago, we had a discussion here in Brussels on development, on all facets of development and also about migration, particularly from Africa. We must realize that development and migration are often two sides of the same coin, the medal of underdevelopment and poverty. These two major meetings are tangible proof of the Union's determined willingness to engage in constructive dialogues with the countries most concerned. Strengthening relations with Turkey will also be on the agenda of the European Council, with a view to adopting the joint action plan that I believe we already discussed last week in Strasbourg. The second part is the strengthening of the protection of the Union's external borders. The treaty is very clear: we need to gradually put in place an integrated system for managing external borders. The European Council will work to provide concrete guidelines in this direction, for the Member States, which are responsible for protecting their national borders, but also for European agencies, in particular Frontex, whose tasks in this area should be reviewed and strengthened. Thirdly, the response to refugee flows in Europe and the return policy. It is our duty to help refugees, but among those who cross our borders illegally, we know that not all need international protection under the Geneva Convention. A coherent, credible and effective policy on the return of irregular third-country nationals, which fully respects the human rights and dignity of the persons concerned, and the principle of non-refoulement, is an essential part of a comprehensive European Union on migration. This starts with identification and registration. In this context, the first \"hot spot\" was set up in Italy. Of course, we must continue to do so. Much remains to be done, particularly with the active support of the Member States. Decisions taken at the Council on relocation are being implemented and must be implemented to the end. Another part of our migration and asylum policy will be discussed tomorrow: the external component. As many have said, the causes of these human tragedies that produce these migratory phenomena must be eradicated. We need to actively look at our role on the international stage and what is happening in Syria and Libya. These topics will also be on the agenda of the European Council. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, the Presidency has ensured that the Council works tirelessly on the responses to one of the great crises we are going through. We have achieved significant and significant results in extremely short time frames, including in September the adoption of decisions, on the basis of the Commission's proposal, to relocate 160,000 refugees. More recently, on 8 October, the Council adopted conclusions on the future of the return policy, which provide an accurate overview of the work to be undertaken. The Council also had an in-depth discussion on the management of the Union's external borders; it has adopted financial measures to enable policy monitoring through rapid action on the ground. The interior ministers were also briefed on the latest developments on the implementation of relocation decisions and welcomed the first relocation operation that took place on 9 October. On this occasion, my colleague, the Minister of Immigration, Mr Asselborn, visited Italy and Greece. Finally, I would like to express once again our gratitude for the responsibility that the European Parliament has taken on the issue of migration, particularly for relocation decisions. You have been extremely fast, engaged and effective, and this cooperation has been very valuable. As you will have understood, the meeting will be dominated by this major challenge. But I would like to add, as President Tusk's invitation letter indicates, that the European Council will also take stock of the next steps in the process leading up to the British referendum. He will listen to President Hollande on the preparations for COP 21 in Paris, which you will talk about here later. Finally, work on the report of the five presidents continued in the Council, particularly under the Luxembourg Presidency. The European Council will now take stock of the work being done, based on a report prepared by the Presidency and to be presented by Prime Minister Bettel, knowing that deepening economic and monetary union is a priority for the Presidency.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I was in Passau last week – Bavaria, Germany – talking to refugees and, above all, talking to those who care for refugees. The most beautiful pictures are when you talk to refugees; the most interesting conversations are with those who care – very often on our behalf – about refugees and their fate. I would like to say once again – and I have said this repeatedly – that I am full of admiration for the life achievements of the people who care for refugees, who do not ask how much clock it is, and who can hardly make a difference between day and night. This applies to the volunteers, and in particular to the police forces deployed. The police are not often praised. However, I would like to say here at this hour and after this visit, which I did not complete, but did, together with the chairman of the group, Manfred Weber, and other colleagues, but went through: you can sometimes thank the police for the most difficult tasks they have to carry out, and that is what I wanted to do with this. (Applause) Now the refugee drama will once again dominate the agenda of the European Council almost integrally. It would be good for all of us if we were to tell the people of our countries that this refugee crisis will not be over for Christmas. It will last for years, perhaps decreasing in density, but will remain as a phenomenon. Ergo is not only important, but above all, short-term action, but it is also important that we talk about the fight against the refugee crisis for years – not with composure, but detached from understandable but ultimately stupid passions. That is why the Commission has proposed a permanent relocation mechanism. I believe that the Member States would be well advised to follow this approach quickly by the European Commission. We need to define short-term answers, but because the phenomenon and the problem will continue, we also need to know that we also need to have a permanent mechanism for dealing with this challenging refugee issue. That is what we, as the Commission, will do. Moreover, the Commission does not abandon the intention I expressed when presenting the European Commission's priorities to present a legislative proposal on legal immigration. I agree with others that the short-term problem cannot be alleviated by such a proposal and decisions in this regard. But we need to know that Europe is an immigration continent, and we must face up to this challenge and this opportunity responsibly, and I hope we will. I would like to say the following about the situation, and I try to be brief because I have an appointment with the President of Latvia at five o'clock: the hotspots – a terrible word, we should try to describe these places more tenderly – are making good progress. Italy has identified the location of four hotspots, Greece five. I had sent the Director-General responsible for structural reforms in Greece to Athens. He spent a week there talking to everyone. He reported on this at the Commission meeting today. He is directly subordinate to me, because I do think that the migration problem is a problem that concerns the President of the Commission in the first place. He tells me that greece has had very impressive success esstify in terms of installing the hotspots and dealing with the refugee issue in general, which I am of course pleased about. What I am less pleased about is the fact that the European Council took decisions on the refugee issue on 23 September this year, including budgetary decisions. Now the European Union is being criticised without interruption. I don't really like to turn on German television anymore, because every television programme – but not only in Germany – criticises the European Union as such. Europe must do this, Europe must deliver, Europe must deliver, Europe must not deliver. Europe, the institutions of Europe, Parliament and the Commission have delivered! We took decisions in the European Council on 23 September, and the budgetary implications that have arisen from this were immediately taken into our own hands and budget proposals were made for 2015, for 2016. I am extremely grateful to the European Parliament and also to you, Mr President, for the speed and brevity of you, with the necessary speed and brevity. have responded to these proposals. European Council on 23 September, we arrived today on 14 October. What was expected of the Commission and the European Parliament has been done. We must stop criticising the European Union and its institutions. It should be noted that the institutions have delivered. Member States have not done so in the same way as the European Union has done. We were promised that the European Agency for Asylum would recruit 774 additional officials, eASO demands. So far, the Member States have delivered 81 men. Frontex has requested 775 additional posts, to great applause from the European Council. So far, the Member States have committed 48 posts. We are in the process of redistributing the 160 000 refugees, although I did not like every staging in this regard. Nineteen refugees being brought to Sweden and 160,000 refugees to look after say it all. However, the beginning has been made. I would like to praise the Luxembourg Presidency in general, but I would also like to commend the decisions taken by the Luxembourg Presidency, in particular Foreign Minister Asselborn. This was a very impressive achievement by the Luxembourg Presidency. Nevertheless, we must now continue with the development of the national contact points, which are necessary for registered refugees to find an address from where they can move to other countries. All but three Member States have designated such contact addresses. I would like to express my astonishment at the fact that it seems difficult to get enough refugees in Greece to seek their happiness in Luxembourg. Luxembourg is one of the richest countries in the European Union and it seems extraordinarily difficult to find enough candidates, if I may put it that way, to move to Luxembourg. Now I can understand that many people think that Juncker is no longer in Luxembourg, so Luxembourg is no longer the same country. Nevertheless, please, it is not an imposition to ask people who are on the run to move to Luxembourg. That is why, although they are not listening to me, I would like to campaign very much for the fact that there are enough candidates to take this journey, which seems to be confident in the end result. I have drawn attention to the fact that the Commission and Parliament have taken the budgetary implications of the Council's decisions of 23 September at an unprecedented rate of speed, first Parliament and the Commission. We have provided EUR 1.7 billion in additional funds via the 2015 supplementary budget and also in anticipation of the 2016 budget as the Commission, in such a way that a total of EUR 9.2 billion is available to allow us to deal with this refugee crisis in a reasonably adequate manner.  As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, I would like to commend the work of The High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Guterres, here, and the Commission has made an additional EUR 500 million available from its budget for world hunger aid. All the Member States agreed to a declaration on 23 September which stated that the Member States should make precisely this contribution from their own budgets. So far, however, only 275 million have been announced. That is of no value, because of this EUR 275 million, the United Kingdom alone accounts for EUR 225 million. I would like to express my praise for the commitment of the British Government and the British Parliament: this is lived solidarity.  Not only are the British talking about this, they are also acting. I think that deserves the utmost recognition. (Applause) Of these 500 million humanitarian aid, 225 million are therefore missing. I would like to see the European Council bring in this 225 million tomorrow! (Applause) It is not enough to make promises. You also have to deliver by proving the deed. That is what I expect from the European Council, which will meet tomorrow. For the Syrian Trust Fund, the Commission, together with Parliament, has put together an additional EUR 500 million from its own budget – hardly anything to the Member States. In this respect, 492 million are missing in direct comparison with the Decision of the European Council of 23 September. I would like these 492 million to be made available tomorrow by the Heads of State or Government. (Applause) For the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, the Commission has made EUR 1.8 billion available from its own budget, that is to say from the budget allocated by the citizens of Europe – it is not ours. money- come. At the European Council on 23 September, it was agreed that the Member States would also set up EUR 1.8 billion. To date, nine million euros have been pledged: Luxembourg three, Spain three and Germany three million. I really wanted to see that explicitly confirmed here. There are 1 791 000 000 missing in direct comparison with the decision of the European Council of 23 September! I would like what was promised on 23 September to be delivered by the Member States tomorrow at the European Council. It is not enough to make promises. Deeds count! (Applause) En ce qui concerne la Turquie, Monsieur le Président, je voudrais tout d'abord m'associer vos paroles de condoléances et de compassion, tant il est vrai que condoléances et compassion doivent aller de pair. Nous avons re u, avec vous-méme, Monsieur le Président, avec le président Tusk et d'autres coll gues, notamment Mme Mogherini, le président Erdogan il y a peu pr s une semaine. Nous avons eu des entrevues séparées avec lui, puis nous avons eu une réunion de travail avec lui et les trois présidents des institutions. vrai dire, ce fut une réunion fructueuse. Je n'ignore rien des probl mes qui caractérisent la situation actuelle en Turquie et je voudrais m'associer vos appels en ce qui concerne le processus de réformes démocratiques, la liberté de la presse et les autres grands principes que vous n'avez pas manqué de mentionner. Toujours est-il que je me suis senti obligé, apr s en avoir référé votre Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, de présenter un programme de coopération entre la Turquie et l'Union européenne sur la question migratoire, qui fut tout de m me bien re u par le président de lapub Rélique. Chacun d'entre nous a ses idées propres sur les processus en cours en Turquie, mais nous avons besoin de ce pays, comme ce pays, sur d'autres points, a besoin de l'Union européenne. La Turquie abrite 2,2 million de réfugiés, et fournit ce titre un effort semblable celui du Liban et de la Jordanie. comparer nos chiffres, notamment ceux qui concernent l'obligation ardente de relocalisation, avec les réalités turque, libanaise et jordanne, je suis, pour le moins, un peu géné. Les pays non européens font plus que les Européens. Faut-il en étre fier? Non, mais nous devons en étre conscients et placer ce constat sur notre radar d'analyse du probl me migratoire. Je suis fermement résolu, en dépit des doutes, en dépit des hésitations, en dépit des interrogations que nous pouvons avoir et que j'ai, mettre la Turquie sur la liste des pays s érrs. Sans cela, la Turquie serait le seul pays candidat ne pas figurer sur cette liste. De deux choses l'une: si on estime que la Turquie n'a pas sa place parmi les pays s érrs, il faut arr ter les négociations d'adhésion. On ne peut pas faire les deux choses en m me temps et en parallle. Par conséquent, je plaide pour que nous mettions la Turquie sur la liste des pays sérs. Je plaide aussi pour que nous accélérions le processus de libéralisation des visas. J'ai envoyé, avec leur accord, bien s ér, le vice-président Timmermans et le commissaire Hahn en Turquie aujourd'hui. Il était prévu que le vice-président Timmermans se rende en Turquie dimanche. Cela n'a pas été possible puisque la Turquie, pour des raisons bien compréhensibles, avait décrété un deuil national. Frans Timmermans et Johannes Hahn se rendent donc en Turquie aujourd'hui et négocieront les détails du programme d'action qu'au nom de la Commission, et avec l'accord de votre Président, j'avais soumis la réflexion du président Erdogan, notamment sur la libéralisation ce régime.  Je pense tr sinc rement qu'il faudrait au moins commencer par libéraliser ce régime pour ce qui concerne le monde économique et puis voir, suivant les r gles qui doivent étre appliquées, comment on peut progresser plus rapidement sur ce dossier que ce  Nous devrons déclarer notre accord de principe pour ouvrir d'autres chapitres dans le processus d'adhésion. La Turquie est un partenaire utile mais difficile, mais nous devons pouvoir alle de l'avant avec elle parce qu'elle est devenue la porte d'entrée vers l'Europe pour des centaines de milliers de réfugiés.  J'avais proposé au président Erdogan, en présence de votre Président, de mettre en place des équipes communes gréco-turques pour surveiller la mer entre la Turquie et la Grace. La Turquie était d'accord. Je viens de lire aujourd'hui que la Grace ne l'est pas. Il s'agit de l'Europe, ici, pas des relations gréco-turques! Je voudrais donc demander au gouvernement grec de revoir cette position, parce qu'il serait tr s utile que, sous commandement européen, les forces navales des deux pays coop rent pour faire en sorte que cette porte d'entrée soit raisonnablement fermée. Avec la Turquie, nous avons donc essayé de progresser.  Le Conseil européen de demain aura conna tre d'autres problémes: le rapport des cinq Présidents ... je ne vais pas m'attarder cela. Lorsque nous ferons rapport des travaux du Conseil européen nous pourrons évidemment évoquer ce prob me. Tomorrow I will have a visit (that means a working lunch) from the British Prime Minister in order to discuss relations, as our British friends say, between Britain and the European Union. I repeat here what I have been saying since March 2014: I want – we want, the Commission wants – a fair deal with Britain and we are working in that direction. I cannot give details, but our negotiating teams have been in close contact for weeks now. I cannot say that huge progress has been achieved; I cannot say that nothing has been achieved – but it takes two to tango. As some here know, I am not a splendid dancer, but I do at least know the rules that have to be observed by others, and it needs two to tango. And so we have to dance and our British friends have to dance, but for sure, I am 150 per cent in favor of having Britain as a constructive Member State of the European Union. We need Britain. Personally, I do think that Britain needs the European Union, but that is a matter of conviction. Others may have a different feeling about that; They would have the same feeling if ever Britain were to leave the European Union. But that is not the assumption under which I am working. So, Mr President, these were the brief words. They weren't that short, but it still took 23 minutes. I have to apologise for this, and also for the fact that I have to dilute myself here at some point, because I would not like to let the Latvian President wait. I would like to thank you very much for your attention.

First of all, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats very much welcome the fact that the Five Presidents' Report is being carried on, that we are committed to deepening monetary union, and we also welcome the statements made by the President of the Commission towards the United Kingdom. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also wants to play its part in getting the fair deal, and so we wish you a lot of fun dancing, Mr President of the Commission! Ladies and gentlemen, the most important issue today, of course, is the issue of migration, which has been moving us for weeks now. And when citizens perceive us, our European politicians, the focus is on: does politics in Europe have orientation on how to respond to the challenge? I believe that we must keep giving this orientation. The first principle is solidarity. If Jordan can do something, if Lebanon can do something, then Europe must also make a difference.  We must help and we must show solidarity in burden-sharing within Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, this also includes – as the President of the Commission has said – that the refugees do not have the right to choose the country, but that they must help in the partnership work of solidarity. The second principle is that external borders must be protected. This is an important point for my group. All models depend on the question of whether the state gets back to action, and we even believe that the European Council should have the strength to take great steps and, for example, to really tackle the establishment of a European coastal protection agency or a European border management agency that really deserves the name, with its own staff, Minister Schmit. Not only small and small – we need big steps! The third principle is repatriation, and this is important to my group. It is an unpleasant subject, but it is one of them! Last year, two-thirds of all applicants were rejected under a constitutional procedure. And then we must also ensure that these rejected refugees leave the European Union and are repatriated. These are the points of reference in the answer. Tomorrow at the European Council, i.e. much will surely revolve around the question of the countries of origin, the real reasons for the problems that are on the table. And here I would like to ask explicitly that, hopefully, tomorrow we succeed in bringing about a common wording of the Member States of the European Union on the Syria issue.  It is not acceptable for one to say: we must talk to Assad, and the other says: I am not prepared to talk to Assad. This only leads to confusion. Europe is not able to speak and we will not contribute to resolving this conflict on our doorstep. We need a diplomatic initiative!  And the second is Libya, which is not talked about enough. We talk a lot about Syria, but we also need to talk about Libya. And here we need a package to send a signal to the disputed parties there: if you agree – and there are also positive signals, not just negative ones – then we are also ready to help you with a package. These are the two points that surround the countries of origin there, and the transit country of Turkey is, of course, important. We support the initiative of our President of the Commission to extend Turkey's hand and to consider together how we can meet the challenges. The visa issues, the issues of mobilising more money, are on the table, and I would also like to signal support for the Group of the European People's Party on these points. In spite of all this, I believe that we are all driven by the fact that Europe must not forget the principles behind it. We must continue to speak plainly on the Kurdish issue, we must continue to speak plainly about human rights in Turkey, because we are only a good friend of Turkey if we treat each other honestly.  Ladies and gentlemen, last but not least, as we prepare the Council, I would like to go further in what the President of the Commission has clearly expressed today, namely the anger and frustration that we have here in Brussels at European level towards the behaviour of the Member States. The examples were mentioned: providing staff – big announcements, nothing delivered; Provide money - big announcements, nothing delivered. The question of simplifying and improving procedures, the slogan 'safe country of origin Turkey', proposed by the Commission, supported by the European Parliament. The Interior Ministers can rely on nothing to agree on. And that is why we ask you to stop deporting all the black Peter to Brussels! It is not Brussels that fails here, it is not the European institutions, the Commission and Parliament that are failing. What is failing here is national selfishness, and this must clearly be answered by the Member States. Finally, and this is again emotionally important to me, ladies and gentlemen, we had a debate last week in the European Parliament, where the leaders of our Member States were present – the Spanish King, Francois Hollande, Angela Merkel. And I would like to address myself to the right side; there are only a few of the right-wing populists of EFDD and ENF present today. But it became clear in this debate that they do not actually have points that are important to them, because the right-wing populists – who always hold the nation so high – even with the Spanish king were not even able to stand up and applaud, were not even able to treat heads of state with respect. And that is why it was said last week that many of these right-wing populists have absolutely nothing to believe in – neither in Europe nor in the nation states. You only believe in yourself, and that is shameful, ladies and gentlemen! Today, someone is standing at the microphone wearing a traditional dress era because the Oktoberfest is opening in Brussels this evening, and I would therefore like to say for myself: I am a proud Bavarian, I love my homeland. I am a German Member of Parliament and I am a convinced European. Because we want us to do it together, to get it together to answer the question of migration. We do not want to divide further, like the right-wing populists.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 15, "date": "2015-10-14.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Thank you, Mr Weber.

Mr Smith, tomorrow's Council should give two answers. The first is to implement emergency measures on refugees, the relocation triangle, hot spots – we do not like the word either, which seems to be the title of a hard magazine, but they must be made – and repatriations. Italy made the first \"hot spot\", it also gave the money together with Germany to the Fund, everyone does it. The famous greed of governments should give way in the face of an emergency as serious as that of refugees. The second answer that tomorrow's Council should give is to go to the roots, to the causes, because, as Juncker said, this is a structural phenomenon and not a cyclical one. It is not resolved in three months, but it takes years and therefore we need a broad strategy.  What are the pieces of this strategy? One is Syria, which is one of the main causes of the flow. The European Commission, Juncker and Mogherini, are working towards a common European position on Syria and I support this position. This is not a time for military action, we must support the efforts of the UN and promote a political transition and the defeat of ISIS, daesh. Iran is an essential component of a strategy to stabilise the Mediterranean. Iran can and must also help us on the Syria case.  As far as Turkey is concerned, the more demanding and rigorous we are in demanding respect for human rights, the more demanding and rigorous we will be in calling for the fight against terrorism, the more intransigent and rigorous we will be in demanding that the elections be held in a transparent and correct manner, the more we will have the strength to tell the truth, namely that Turkey is an essential partner of the European Union. , a candidate for accession, a partner to whom we must send not only a financial message, but also a political message. Turkey is a political interlocutor and we must say to the Turkish people that we are opening the door to visa liberalisation.  Finally, as far as Africa is concerned, there will be the Valletta Summit. We need to strengthen dialogue with African states, we need to work on the return of migrants, we also need to open the file of regular migration – thank you, Mr Juncker, for the proposal you announced today on legal immigration – and I believe that Africa must be the European Union's political priority.  If we do these things, which are concrete, non-rhetorical and demagogic things, we may not care so much about the caricature of some media towards Europe, nor about the anti-European offensive that will deflate as a blood pressure meter deflates.

So when the five Presidents ask what caused the crisis we face in the euro: was it because we did not have enough centralisation of the euro area? Was it because we did not have enough responsibility? Was it because we did not have the right rules in place? No, it is because the rules in place were flagrantly ignored. For economic and monetary union to work, we all need to be honest that richer euro-area countries will most likely need to make fiscal transfers to poorer euro-area countries for the foreseeable future – and probably for ever. So, instead of highly complex rules for monetary union that powerful countries flout when politically expedient, how about a few rules that we actually follow? Because yet again, political capital is being spent talking about ever closer union instead of delivering ever-growing economies and an ever more competitive Europe. Renegotiation and reform is not something that growing numbers of people in only one EU Member State want. In my last five years here in Parliament, my political group has grown to be the third-largest group – representing not people from one country, but from 16 different Member States – because people realise that the EU cannot go on as it is. The EU has to change. The EU has to reform. So of course, ahead of the EU referendum, David Cameron wants a better deal for the UK. But all of us here should want a better deal for the EU. To all my friends here in this House, if you really want the UK to remain a member of the EU, help the British Government to achieve these reforms. Dance, tango with us. But if you want the UK to leave so you can continue to construct a United States of Europe, tell the UK to stop wasting its time and close your mind to reforms. On the refugee crisis, let us get away from polarising the debate: telling people that you are either pro-immigration or you are anti-immigration; saying ‘let them all in’ or ‘let no one in’; or ‘we should do something’ or ‘we should do nothing’. It actually achieves very little. Therefore, in preparation for the summit, I hope leaders look to ensure that the basic foundations of a functioning and cooperative asylum system are in place: humane and fast processing; immediate returns for failed asylum-seekers; establishing hotspots – I am not quite sure what magazines Mr Pittella reads – or crisis points to quell the current crisis; and combining all of our expertise, willingness and resources available to achieve it – not opening a door and then closing it again; not causing confusion by acting unilaterally. What we need is to put the foundations of that cooperative system in place so we are better able to offer help to the most vulnerable people escaping this conflict, taking them directly from the camps and bypassing the traffickers. It may not sound as poetic as saying that the EU has a solution to every problem, but it is a responsible way of delivering a solution intended to help people who want to fulfil their dreams and a better future in their own homes. Tackling this issue at source in Syria and Libya needs concerted action, not only at European level but at international level, to get the various militias and their proxies around a table to seek a political solution. Otherwise the only alternative is a military solution in a powder keg, and the alternative is starting something that nobody knows how it will end. So these are tough and challenging times. But it is time to agree on what we can all do, not order others – or command others – what to do. Time for people to lead with their heads and not their hearts. Time to drop the fanciful wish list and to deliver serious solutions.

The Council draft conclusions open with a very encouraging sentence saying that tackling the migration and refugee crisis is a common obligation which requires a comprehensive strategy and a determined effort over time in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility. And I thought, yes, this is a radical change of strategy in the Council: ‘Wir schaffen das’. Unfortunately, the determination of the Council ends after the first sentence. The decision on the 160 000 was already inadequate and everybody knew it, and many more people will come our way. But the Member States have not even properly delivered on their previous pledges, never mind for additional refugees, and the only response of the Council seems to be: let’s keep our eyes closed and maybe the problem will go away. But citizens are concerned, not just Members of Parliament.  I see the ‘remain’ or ‘leave’ campaign has already started in this room. But citizens – I can see that the Presidency of the Council is on the phone to a citizen right now – are concerned. They see the images of large numbers of refugees coming this way. They also see refugee centres being established in their neighbourhoods, and they are anxious. But the majority of European citizens, I am convinced, want to welcome refugees and they want Europe to show solidarity. But they also want to know that Europe is able to cope with the situation. They want to see leadership, but instead the government leaders are dithering and hesitating and ducking the issue and coming up with half-hearted and inadequate solutions. How can you expect citizens to be confident that Europe can handle the situation if government leaders themselves do not show that they are up to the job? The Commission and Parliament have put forward proposals repeatedly for a comprehensive strategy, but the Council is silent. But we urgently need a comprehensive policy here that includes legal avenues for migration, a real EU asylum policy with a permanent distribution key and a real EU border control system. On the talks with Turkey, I think that is very welcome and it is essential. But I wonder: the Commission, and in particular the Council, are making promises about financial support without actually specifying where the money will come from. Earlier promises of funds, as Mr Juncker just set out, have not been delivered upon, so how can you promise more money to a country if you have not even delivered on your earlier promises? It is very clear that the current financial framework does not allow for these kinds of exercises. And besides, I would like to echo the words of other speakers who ask themselves: how can we be sure that the human rights of refugees will be guaranteed in Turkey? The Council draft conclusions also mention the aim of developing safe and sustainable reception capacities in the affected regions and providing lasting prospects for refugees. I was a little mystified by that, because I wonder exactly what ‘lasting prospects’ means when you are in a refugee camp. I hope for your sake that refugees have the same notion of ‘lasting prospects’. Reception in the region and cooperation with third countries mainly means outsourcing our problems, and I think it is a bit bitter that we applaud the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Tunisia, and at the same time expect them to solve our problems and receive the people we turn away. Finally, the draft conclusions do not remotely constitute an answer to the current situation, so the ALDE Group expects you to go back, do your homework and come up with a realistic and comprehensive strategy, so that we can truly say to European citizens: ‘Wir schaffen das’.

Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Europe, as Minister Schmit has said, must show solidarity, but it cannot have a short-term view on migration and asylum issues. This is likely to be a lasting phenomenon that must be tackled more boldly, considering that our planet is common and that refugees are human beings forced to leave their land because of misery, repression, wars and the wound of terrorism. Yes, the humanitarian emergency must first be addressed. You are right, Mr Juncker, to deplore the lack of budget today, but at the same time you cannot advocate budget cuts, as you do. I believe, on the other hand, that we should support the project of an international conference on refugees. The solution is not to make our neighbours border guards, even if we have to help countries that have taken in millions of refugees.  As for Turkey, I say yes to compassion and solidarity with the Turkish people, but I will instead urge caution with Mr Erdogan. We have already had terrible experiences and terrible setbacks with Tunisia and Libya, which played a bit of this role as border guards.  The causes of migration must be tackled: poverty, repression, wars and terrorism. This would require greater coordination for large-scale diplomatic initiatives and for an international un-sponsored coalition against the Islamic State group. It would also require an end to the plundering and exploitation of Africa, an end to free trade agreements that destroy African agriculture and services, and the fight against fraud and tax evasion, which reach $50 billion a year for Africa! This is exactly the amount that would enable Africans to meet their needs for infrastructure and services. That, I think, is what could be discussed at the Valletta summit. I would still like to say two words about economic and monetary union, which you have not had time to talk about. The reason should, I believe, lead you to put an end to the current leak in companionship with the financial markets. Now we are reviving this dangerous idea of financial securitization. We are being told to further strengthen control of national budgets and to put pressure on wages with what you have called the 'competitiveness authorities'. Instead, listen to the Nobel Prizes in economics who repeat, every day, that we must make social recovery, thus raise wages and social minimums and be bold on investments for the coming century, i.e. ecological conversion, digital, and above all social and human development in education, health and social protection! Listen to the International Monetary Fund, which says greek debt needs to be restructured!  Let's discuss these topics! Let's make new decisions! We propose to create a social and ecological development fund dedicated to these new projects of the future. What we are advocating is a re-foundation of the European project, a humanist and solidarity project.

I think it is very good, as Mr Juncker said, that we are talking about a problem that we will be dealing with for a long time. We have already mentioned this with Mr Hollande and Mrs Merkel last week. I just believe that this view of the long-term nature and the dimension of the problem must not lead to the fact that we are taking as much time as we have been allowed to deal with these pressing problems in certain measures that must now simply take place in the European Union.  And I think it is very right, Mr Juncker, that you said that it is a disgrace that the Member States cannot even implement the emergency aid programmes for Africa, Syria and support for the United Nations World Food Programme – not even these commitments – from one summit to the next. If this continues, Then I wonder how we are going to build confidence in the European Union's ability to act.  In order to combat the causes, i am able to say for my group that we are never really opposed to holding talks if that serves to achieve peace, a ceasefire, whatever. I only have the impression that we have to talk to Assad, or that you have to talk to Putin, that this is now becoming a banality if we do not know what and with what purpose these talks are supposed to be. And unity against ISIS – that is one thing – but that unity, which is not enough, is not enough to have a long-term plan for how this region, where we have so many major problems, should develop further. In order for the European Union to deal with the refugee challenge, the focus is on recognising that Dublin, as we have done, has failed. The first to express this was the Chancellor. In my view, this means that we need to do exactly what you said very quickly. We must ensure not only better management at the hotspots, but the connection of a lasting, solidarity-based distribution of the people who are fleeing to us and arriving there, that is what we must ensure. And for me, this is not a step that can take place next year, but that is something that needs to be decided quickly.  We have often argued about safe third countries. For the Balkans, I must say that I think it is right to set priorities in this current situation. But I also think that you have to work on what you said in the State of the Nation speech and come up with something. What does this mean in these countries to guarantee the individual right to asylum? The Europeans must then be clear about this.  Recognising Turkey now as a safe third country would, in my opinion, be a recognition of President Erdogan's policy – and that is not possible! Erdogan has led his country away from democracy, Erdogan has trampled on the rule of law. And I think there was just a moment to talk to him. The chancellor will go there and talk to Erdogan; I hope that this is not just about refugees, but also about how Turkey should develop. And I would like to see, even if Europeans are going there now, that we not only talk to President Erdogan, who has a great responsibility for the whole, for all this bad development, but also to talk at least to the families and those who had to mourn this insanely large number of victims at the weekend.

After the days of façade emotion, of the now clumsy and now angry management of the emergency, Europe is revealing its strategy, which consists of welcoming a handful of people and showing themselves with the most inflexible, to the point of the use of force, simply because they have no right to exist for this model of Europe if not at home. The fact is that they will come anyway, also because of a Europe that is always lagging behind in understanding the great dynamics of the world. So now the imperative is no longer to accept them, but rather to reject and expel them, and few know exactly what the rules of engagement of the police forces engaged on this new front are. This Europe is paying Turkey to keep 2 million refugees in its belly who, as we are told, will have access to health, education and work thanks to Europe's money. Pay the states from which people arriving in Europe flee to force them to take them back home, while knowing that they are encouraging an increase in the ranks of jihadist fighters. In the chaos of the Syrian conflict, this Europe does not exist, or acts by proxy – usa – or suffers action – Russia.

It could, but does not, create a credible European army as an instrument of deterrence from war. And I come to the summit that will take place tomorrow.

It is clear that the loyalty of the Turks in Europe lies not with their host country but with the Sultan of Ankara, who is bombing Kurdish Turks, supporting IS and counting Jews and Christians among its great enemies. This country can't be trusted. If the EU gives in to blackmail and gives Turkey money for refugees, but at the same time opens the door to the EU, we will still be overwhelmed by millions of migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria in a few years' time. Nationalised to Turk, they still enter the European Union. The Commission – and I give an immediate answer to Mr Juncker – must stop negotiations with Turkey on accession and on the abolition of the visa requirement once and for all.

Tomorrow's European Council will be devoted to pressing issues, of course, but now is the time to also assess the medium- and long-term consequences. The exodus of refugees we are witnessing today is unprecedented, but it is only the first of a phenomenon that will characterize this century and it will force us to review in depth at least three of our major policies. Firstly, the budget: in 2013, the European Council wanted to reduce the European budget for a period of seven years. He'll find out tomorrow Thursday that the shackle he's set has exploded. We cannot finance both cohesion policy, agricultural policy, Horizon 2020, the Juncker plan, the strengthening of border control, the retention of refugees in Turkey and the 100 billion aid promised to developing countries for COP 21. It's a prank! Secondly, foreign policy: the migration issue must be placed at the very top of our foreign policy priorities. President Juncker rightly cited the case of Turkey. Finally, the policy of development cooperation. The Euro-African summit in Valletta should mark the beginning of a new kind of partnership between Europe and the African continent: the control of migration and the common interest of our old continent and the one that embodies the youth of the world.

I will leave this aside from the issue of accession negotiations because I think that these are two somewhat partly interlinked, but still separate, issues. Let me say that I am quite happy that it seems that we have left the point when the EU was polarising itself over the migration crisis. I leave aside who has contributed more or less to it, but I think that, in the words of Nicolas Schmit, the word ‘common’ is important, and ‘common’ is what we should remain. It should be a common effort and with a common effort we can succeed. The European Council’s agenda is, I think, the right agenda. Let me just emphasise a couple of points. I am sure that we will comply with the principles and values of humanity, but the Valletta summit will also have to address, in an efficient way, the return and readmission policy of the European Union. That is why I welcome those words: ‘this is the expectation of the citizens’. Breaking up the criminal networks has, of course, to be sufficiently addressed as well, as does the prevention of illegal migration. Finally, I will make two very brief remarks. Regarding Frontex, I understand that we want to enhance the mandate. I would just underline that this is not sufficient. We really need to significantly transform the Agency, Frontex, into something that will have competences, people, a unified command, so to speak, and will be able to address the task.

That would be a first point. Secondly, on the issue of refugees and, in particular, the situation in Turkey. I think we have to act with great urgency at the moment and therefore we already have to make some emergency intervention and then it makes perfect sense to use the Platform of Turkey and the agreement we have with Turkey to ensure the situation of these refugees, to ensure that they are welcomed and, in particular, that there is no invasion , let's say anarchic-chaotic, of the European Union.

Now it only merits one sentence in the Draft Declaration. I realise that is due to the pressing refugee crisis, but there is also frustration at the lack of detail from the UK Government. To use Mr Juncker’s analogy, David Cameron seems like a dad at the school disco reluctantly trying to dance but an embarrassment to everyone – and that embarrassment is shared by many Brits.  Cameron has taken many months to provide any inkling of his demands. Some of what he suggests is sensible and in line with what the Labour Party has been arguing for for many years, but he has been ambiguous in other areas, not least when it comes to workers’ rights.

Mr President, honourable Members, we all agree that the issue of refugees will accompany Europe for years to come. This is not a problem that has arisen and will disappear on its own. So let's be honest, some have just said this, and let's acknowledge that Europe has had a difficult start. We did not take the real, the right measure of the problem; hence the procrastination, hence the hesitations, hence the withdrawals. We can, we must regret it. However, I see that things have changed since then and that Europe has recovered. We have, in a short time, taken a number of important measures, which may still be insufficient, but it is a fact that Europe has reacted. One may, of course, ask why we did not foresee the problem or why we underestimated its magnitude. I think we all bear some responsibility, I say all, for not seeing the forces behind this phenomenon.  Today, it is clear that the time for action has arrived. As I said in my first speech, we need to act on two levels. First, the urgency. We cannot leave the refugees to their own devices, especially since winter is upon us, as some have said. Nor can we abandon the Member States or the countries, such as those in the Balkans, which are also hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees. We need to act urgently, and above all we need to plan for the future, to act in the medium and long term. I believe that this is precisely where Europe is struggling to move forward. It is like Greece, as you said. But the Greek crisis has made us grow a little bit. The refugee crisis poses the same challenge to us. We have to respond to it, we have to build what we have failed to build for years, because we thought that such a crisis could not happen.  On budgetary issues, I would like to rectify somewhat what has been said. At the end of this debate, you will adopt budgetary acts on the basis of the Commission's proposals. I believe that, as a co-budgetary authority, the Council has done its duty and approved these budgetary acts. That is to be welcomed.  With regard to the commitments made by the Member States, I believe that the message must be reiterated in order for the promises to be kept, so that all the commitments that have been announced are also followed up. But we also know the difficulties that some Member States are struggling with, and we know that things do not always happen as quickly as we would like. This is the case with the provision of public servants. This issue is extremely important if we want better border control, if we want hot spots to work better. I have been minister of immigration, and I know those situations where, suddenly, the number of asylum seekers is increasing. Look at Germany, which is expected to welcome hundreds of thousands of new arrivals. Look at Sweden, which is facing the arrival of tens of thousands of refugees. What can I do? You need officials on site. It is not enough to send a few to manage the \"hot spots\". So there is a complex organisational problem, which puts real pressure on the Member States. Again, the commitments that have been made must be implemented without delay.  As for other subjects, I will not return to Turkey, which I believe is an essential and fundamental partner. Therefore, the dialogue that we must have with this country must continue actively, in particular, but not only because of refugees. There is another aspect that we should not underestimate the importance of. This is the report of the five presidents and the deepening of EMU. Let us not believe that because the crisis situations have calmed down a bit, all this can wait, that there is no more urgency. Are we going to wait for the next crisis? No. When we look around, we see that the situation in the global economy is not very encouraging, not very positive. It was heard in Lima at the last meeting of the International Monetary Fund. There is now an urgent need to work to deepen the governance of the Economic and Monetary Union and to improve the governance of this EMU, extending it to areas where citizens are waiting for us. And where are they waiting for us? They are waiting for us on employment, they are waiting for us on social protection, they are waiting for us on their living conditions.

The next meeting of the European Council is the fourth meeting, in just six months, devoted to the issue of migration. It is now clear that the management of this crisis cannot be left to the individual responsibilities of the States that are under constant pressure from these flows. \"Hot spots\", the points of crisis, are already a part of the response and Italy was among the first countries to implement one, but this measure must be followed by a common effort in the reallocation of refugees. In order to manage such a delicate situation, it is necessary to dwell on what is happening beyond our borders and to look at the origins of these phenomena – I am referring to what is happening in Syria and also in Turkey.  As Mr Juncker said today, what Europe is facing is a structural crisis that certainly needs immediate responses, but above all a long-term perspective.

Unfortunately, the direction of the proposed changes deepens the shortcomings of the current euro area (and the EU itself): on the one hand, the liberalisation and integration of the banking and financial sector into the European economy, without an even development of regulation, nor a harmonisation of European rules that ensures its control; on the other hand, the primacy of neoliberal and regressive economic objectives, with no greater mention of social objectives than that of granting a varnish of democratic legitimacy to the ordoliberal project. The direction of EMU reform should be another: ensuring public funding for States wishing to develop, democratically, policies other than those imposed on them by markets, using ECB support in secondary markets where necessary; strengthen the separation between credit activity and speculative activity; and ensure that the costs of bailouts fall on shareholders and not on citizens.

Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, we say this and we must repeat it: we are facing the fight of the century. Yes, the fight of the century, for several reasons.  The first, if nothing happens and we fail to limit the rise in global temperature to a maximum of two degrees by the end of the century, we will see more droughts and floods, melting glaciers, and a decrease in agricultural land. It should also be remembered that climate change will be an aggravating factor in the migration problem. Today, year after year, we count 24 million displaced people and refugees, because of wars, dictatorships, but also because of climate change and climate change. Again, if nothing is done, we will have a temperature increase of 4.5 to 6 degrees by the end of the century and we will have 200 million climate refugees in the world.  We must overcome the failure of the Copenhagen summit at the end of 2009. This failure has been a trauma for all of us. We must therefore make the Paris conference a success. I believe that the report I am proposing for your review this afternoon, on which we will be voting this evening, is a report that will enable this success, which will enable Europe to be a model and a driving force at COP 21 at the end of 2015.  In this report we propose a universal and binding agreement. We have known Kyoto, where some, like the United States and China, did not want to be signatories. We have included ambitious climate targets for the planet and for Europe in this report. Firstly, the total elimination of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but also the reduction of at least 40% of these emissions in Europe by 2030. We also aim to increase the share of renewable energy in Europe to 30% by 2030, as well as increase our continent's energy efficiency by 40%, again by 2030.  Without such goals, we will not trigger the paradigm shift we so desperately need to address climate change. Colleagues, as Laurent Fabius, French Foreign Minister and President of COP 21, recently said, I believe that the financial issue is and will be the cornerstone of the Paris Agreement. This is therefore a major focus of my report. We call for a clear roadmap from the states to see how each government intends to fund the $100 billion annual Green Fund from 2020. Public and private commitments currently generate $62 billion a year. States must now be clear about how they plan to reap the remaining $38 billion that will be missing each year within five years. Another proposal is the awarding of a global \"carbon price\" to ensure that the least polluting technologies are the most attractive to investors. We are also making proposals on the use of ETS funds to finance the fight against climate change. The price of ETS credits has fallen dramatically in recent years in Europe, rendering it unable to finance effectively the fight against climate change. As part of the ongoing revision of the directive, Commissioner, we must ensure that the price of a tonne of CO2 is raised significantly. Let us be well aware that we must give pledges to developing countries, which are most affected by the consequences of climate change.  In my report, I also wanted to highlight other avenues of success in Paris, including the revision of the Memorandum of Understanding every five years.  I would like to welcome the commitment of the French Presidency, but also of all parties, and I would also like to recall how climate change is an opportunity to initiate new economic growth in the world but also in Europe, green growth, and to put in place a new energy policy in favour not only of jobs but also of the purchasing power of the 500 million Europeans.

The Paris Conference is a historic milestone in the international community's efforts to combat climate change.  In his State of the Union address to the European Parliament, President Juncker stressed that the European Union will not accept any agreement. As responsible for the European Union negotiations in Paris, my job will be to ensure that the European Union leads the negotiations and is not a passive spectator. And with this new global agreement we must start a dynamic process that allows us to effectively combat the risks of climate change and accelerate our global transition to a low-emissions and climate-responsible society. Ladies and gentlemen, a key challenge this year has been to ensure that the Parties to the Conference submit their national contributions on mitigation and adaptation. Today, one hundred and fifty Parties have submitted their respective contributions covering almost 90% of global emissions. The European Union was one of the first to do so with an ambitious emission reduction target of 40%. We have set an example for our partners and others are following us, but we have also carried out extensive international awareness work throughout the year, encouraging third countries to engage in global climate action.  In this context, we are witnessing a fundamental transition from the action of a few to the action of a majority. Comparing the contributions to date presented with the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, which runs until 2020 and covers only about 12% of global emissions, progress towards the Paris summit is remarkable.  Today we find that there is an obvious global political will at the highest level. I have just returned from the Forum on Adaptation and Mitigation Commitments that we have organized with Morocco's collaboration in Rabat, involving more than forty countries. I was particularly pleased that Mr Pargneaux took part in this forum, which has shown participants the importance this Parliament attaches to the Paris Summit. While we have found in this forum that the contributions presented to date are not sufficient to achieve the goal of limiting global warming below two degrees Celsius, the good news is that these contributions are already a big step forward and put the goal at our fingertips.  These contributions are more than just the drafting of mere numbers, they are real strategies developed at the highest political level and, moreover, if we take into account that many countries design and implement these climate plans for the first time, we realize the progress we are experiencing globally in climate action.  But the main question is how we make sure we get an ambitious agreement in Paris and how we define its success. In my opinion, the answer to these questions comes down to three essential elements. First, set a long-term goal.  Secondly, ensuring that the Paris agreement includes the flexibility to strengthen its ambition over time. Therefore, the new agreement needs to include a review mechanism that allows us to assess progress and strengthen emission reduction targets on a regular basis in the light of the latest scientific data available to us. Third, the agreement has to include provisions to ensure transparency and accountability because these rules will be the foundations of a credible international regime. Marking the goals we have a hard work ahead of us. Next week begins the last technical negotiating session in Bonn. In this session we will discuss a draft agreement which the co-chairs of the negotiations presented on 5 October. The good news is that the new text is shorter and more understandable. The least positive news is that the text is un balanced, lacks ambition and specificity in many respects—including transparency and accountability—it lacks a mechanism to dynamically increase mitigation ambition over time, and some key political issues remain open. That's why it's going to be a crucial negotiating session. Ladies and gentlemen, in order to be effective in these negotiations, the European Union must stand together and act with one voice. That is why I am pleased to note that in the draft Resolution, and after discussions in committee, there is a common basis between the institutions and the Member States. In this sense I consider it extremely positive that the draft resolution recognises the need for an ambitious agreement, of universal validity and legally binding. I share with you the conviction that the Paris agreement should promote an objective assessment system based on common and transparent standards that include provisions for its monitoring, notification and verification. And I strongly support the sustainable and dynamic draft Paris agreement. Finally, Parliament attaches great importance to climate finance in the fight against climate change in order to achieve the $10 billion target by 2020. Climate finance will be a key issue where the European Union also has an excellent track record. Important resources of the Multiannual Financial Framework will be earmarked for climate change-related projects abroad. We expect financial contributions to increase by more than double, reaching the amount of two billion euros per year.  And with regard to progress towards the overall target of one hundred billion dollars, I am pleased to note that the most recent estimates show that climate finance reached $62 billion in 2014, as indicated in the recent OECD report.  Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by stressing how important the European Parliament's support for the European Union's negotiating position is. The legally binding agreement must be ratified by Parliament. The outcome of the negotiations will be presented to this House for consideration and it is therefore essential that Members are associated and aware of the progress of the negotiations. In Paris, I will report personally to the Delegation of the European Parliament every day and instruct the Commission's negotiating team to provide Parliament with all the necessary assistance. But beyond the negotiations, experience in recent months shows how important it is for the European Union to remain the global leader in the fight against climate change. And that's why we need credible and effective national and European climate policies. And Parliament's role in this regard has been very valuable.

When discussing future actions aimed at keeping the rise in global average temperature below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, we cannot ignore the fact that the least developed countries are not able to cover the costs of necessary investments in cleaner technologies. This is why it is important to keep in mind that the international community will have to share those costs. The report is right in saying that without the contribution of developing countries, our global efforts will fail. So the fight against climate change must remain one of the top priorities, both in our environmental policy and overall development cooperation policy.

I also think that it is very important that in this own-initiative report we are addressing very clearly the aviation and maritime sector, and directly related to that I have a question for the Commissioner, because next week in Bonn there will be negotiations on the new text that has been published. In that text there is no mention at all of the international maritime and aviation sector, which is something that needs to be corrected and I am counting on you, Commissioner, to correct that in the negotiations in Bonn or later on in Paris. Another thing I like very much in this report is the linking of the revenues to the Green Climate Fund, and that brings another question for the Commissioner. We know that the mandate for climate financing will be determined by the Ecofin Council in November. How can we make sure that Ecofin will deliver predictable and additional financing, because that is key and is also expected by the developing countries? That is something I think this Parliament report gives good suggestions for, so I would recommend that you also let that be picked up by Ecofin in November. Another very important point is to stress the five-year commitment period, which is also in this Parliament report; but I have not heard the Commission very clearly endorsing that. It would be good to hear that for Europe, too, it is indeed important to move to five-year commitment periods for the longer term because we all know now that we will not achieve the 2 degrees in Paris. You have also said this in interviews. So then it becomes very important that there will be reviews very quickly so that the ambition level can be ratcheted up, and I think a five-year commitment period is important and that Europe, for example, does not restrict itself only to 2030. These are some of the issues; there are many more in the report and they are very welcome too. One final point on the long-term target for 2050 – phasing out carbon emissions – mainly to my PPE colleagues. This has been Parliament’s standpoint for two years now.

I believe that this is a good report, even if it goes a little too far for us at one point or another, but we will put them on the right path. I believe that we must remind you once again that Paris is not such a normal climate event, but that we now have the very last chance to get a successor treaty from Kyoto. If we do not succeed in this, then the world community will in fact fall apart on climate policy issues. And then Europe in particular will suffer greatly, because then we will perhaps come back to national regulations. I therefore believe that the responsibility, Mr Caete, as you have just said, is exceptionally great for us, and we must seize this real opportunity now, also in the sense of competition policy. After all, if we do not get proper and ambitious regulation in Paris, carbon leakage will continue to exist in the future. And that is what we want to dismantle. We want to harmonise the competition rules so that Europe remains a powerful location, combined with the desire to achieve the two-degree target. I am therefore glad that we have not been able to present a Wischiwaschi text here now – the danger still exists today, but if we move in the right corner, that will not happen and we will be able to present a goal-oriented text. Of course, we need binding targets. That would be even nicer if we were not to propose binding targets here in Europe, but let us tell the South Americans to agree to a binding treaty, which is really illogical. So what we have written in terms of binding targets here is correct. I do not believe that we will have to change that by 2050, and that one or the other wish from my group will also play a role in this.

The cement producers, the aluminium producers, are all on the mat and want to claim carbon leakage in these areas.  However, we have sectors in the European Union that are completely excluded. That is air transport, that is shipping, and it is precisely in these sectors that we have the greatest increases in CO2 emissions, namely up to 200-300% in the aviation sector.

Apparently there was no agreement yet, when the climate ministers came together in September, among the Ministers of Finance for this very crucial finance.

The extent of this role became painfully clear to me when I heard that aviation and shipping had been removed from the latest draft of the climate agreement, whereas these sectors together account for as much as 8% of CO2 emissions. Moreover, that proportion is only growing. There are more such examples. The same draft shows that we no longer want to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. The fossil fuel industry is engaged in a large-scale greenwash action to divert attention from its major contribution to global warming. And then there are the official sponsors of the climate conference: Renault-Nissan, Coca Cola, GDF Suez, Avril, all big polluters. It seems as if a number of parties do not realize that it is all hands on deck. This kind of company is like the orchestra on the Titanic that keeps playing on to earn an extra pocket money before closing time.

The report itself is a strong signal, and I would like to thank Mr Pargneaux, our rapporteur, for that. Still, there are some important considerations to raise. Being ambitious is not merely a question of restoring Europe’s credibility; it is also a scientific necessity if we want to limit climate change to two degrees. Evidence shows us that we need to phase out carbon emissions by 2050 to limit climate change to two degrees, and it is possible, but without this phasing out it becomes an illusion to put us on a track which keeps us below the two-degree target. That is why I am deeply concerned about the amendment tabled by the PPE Group, because I believe that if we water down our commitment to decarbonisation till 2050, we will step on a track which takes us beyond or above the two-degree limit. Also it is important to mention that the INDCs which we already have are clearly not enough to reach our goal of keeping climate change below the two-degree target. This means that we need mechanisms to raise ambition within the European Union and at global level at the Paris talks.

These are words written in black and white, but they are still words. On the way to Paris we have heard many more and we will hear many more.  The European Union describes itself as a leader in the fight against climate change, but the policies of its Member States often contradict its commitments and declarations. We are afraid of the consequences of global warming – they are now a daily story – but at the same time we are financing its main cause. According to an International Monetary Fund report last May, global subsidies to oil companies are over $5 trillion, $5,300 billion to be exact, $5,300 billion in coal, oil and gas financing, mostly from advanced countries. Perhaps we are not mainly responsible for this huge gift to the oil lobbies, but the European Union is certainly also involved, which provides EUR 330 billion a year in subsidies, but also in financing infrastructure, gas pipelines and deposits through the European Investment Bank. The International Monetary Fund also tells us that if we cut these 5 trillion subsidies globally, we will achieve an immediate 20% reduction in global emissions and free up in a virtuous flywheel resources that would lead to 3.5% growth in world GDP. The real question, then, is whether we are prepared to go against the fossil fuel lobby. We are talking about COP 21, but in the meantime the race to the fossil continues, and indeed the interest seems to be renewed.

Such projects violate the principle of neutrality and undermine the competence of Member States to decide on the structure of their energy demand. The fact that emissions can be changed pragmatically without excluding any source of energy shows the example of Japan, China, India, which are spreading technologies of supercritical coal combustion, which leads to emission reductions of up to 30-40% and significantly improves the efficiency of the blocks. This can be of colossal importance for countries for which emission reductions pose a threat to energy security, as is the case with Polish.

I just want to make four points. First of all, there is a lot of work ahead of us in the 50 days we have before Paris. We are not there yet. It is true that there are indices: at the moment, more than 150 countries have presented their indices. There is a high level of ambition but we are not within the two-degrees objective. Under a business-as-usual scenario, according to the IPCC assessment, the increase in world temperature would be in a range of 3.8 to 4.7 degrees. With all the 150 indices on the table, according to the Joint Research Centre estimates, we are at about three degrees. A lot of work has to be done in Paris, and that means that Paris must produce an ambitious agreement with a dynamic process of review, including transparency and accountability, and with a clear long-term goal allowing us to take stock from time to time and raise the level of our ambition. Tackling and facing up to global warming is not a matter that we will solve at the Paris meeting, but in Paris we have to create the instruments for long-lasting action towards fighting global warming throughout the century. We have to achieve full decarbonisation of our economies before the end of the century, and that requires a lot of effort. I want briefly to answer some remarks that Members made: Mr Eickhout, Mr Groote, Mr Gerbrandy, Mr Liese and Ms Guteland asked what will happen with maritime and navigation transport. The Commission considers that the international navigation and shipping sectors should also contribute to the global efforts for emissions reductions, because if we want a comprehensive and consistent agreement for below two degrees it must cover all sectors of the economy, including international transport. This should entail a mandate to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to deliver a concrete message on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and shipping. Those emissions should also be subject to regular review so that the measures can be enhanced over time, in line with decarbonisation scenarios. There was also a question to the Commission concerning our position on earmarking EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowances for international climate finance. ETS auction revenues are one of the many public revenue sources that Member States may use to mobilise climate finance, and the Commission proposal for the ETS revision actively encourages Member States to use ETS auction revenues to finance climate action. Lastly, there was a question relating to fossil fuels. The Commission is in favour of phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, and in the G20 framework we supported the United States proposal for a target date of 2025.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 2, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 162, "date": "2015-10-14.json", "name": "Gilles PARGNEAUX", "mepid": "96948", "text": "  Rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you first of all for asking the Presidency to take part in this debate that you wished to have on the consequences of the Court's decision last week.  It will, of course, be up to the Commission to tell you its intentions for the coming months. This issue is not only about the Commission, it concerns the Council and it concerns Member States and European citizens in the first place. Let's not forget them. Let me begin by acknowledging that Parliament has regularly raised the shortcomings that existed in the transfer of data from the Union to the United States under the Safe Harbor Agreement. Indeed, even before the Snowden revelations, Parliament had expressed concern about the level of data protection and had called for the agreement to be suspended until its flaws were corrected. The Court of Justice has just declared the Security Commission's adequacy decision invalid. It clearly considered that this decision did not provide sufficient protection for the processing of the personal data of European citizens. The consequences of this judgment must be carefully analysed, including by the Council. The Commission presented an initial assessment of its potential consequences at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 9 October.  The Court's decision concerns a decision of the Commission. It is therefore up to the Court first to draw the consequences of the Court's invalidation of its decision - and I am sure the Commissioner will do so. The judgment also clarifies the powers of European supervisors when transferring data to third countries, which are made on the basis of a adequacy decision. It is important that the Commission works closely with these authorities to ensure that the judgment is interpreted and applied in a uniform manner. In the immediate future, citizens need to be reassured that their data is protected. In addition, companies need to be informed about other legal options for transferring data to the United States in light of the Court's ruling. In the longer term, the Commission will have to decide what will succeed the decision on the safe harbor that has just been invalidated. The answer to this question will have to be through a close dialogue with the US authorities.  Whatever formula is chosen to succeed the Safe Harbor decision, it will have to fully respect the Court's decision. While respecting the principles set out by the Court, the Commission will be able to take into account the importance to the economy of a regular and legal flow of data between the United States and the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the Court of Justice has reiterated that any instrument of the European Union must respect a high level of protection of personal data and be in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly when such data is transferred to third countries.  In this context, the Council and the European Parliament must continue their work on a new strong data protection framework, with the aim of concluding the negotiations by the end of this year. I consider that with this judgment, the finalisation of this reform before the end of the year becomes more urgent and necessary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 194, "date": "2015-10-14.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Last week’s ruling in the Schrems case reaffirmed the importance of data protection as a fundamental right in the EU, including when personal data is transferred to third countries. The Commission respects that ruling and will abide by it, as must all stakeholders. The Court has declared the 2000 Safe Harbour decision invalid, and it can no longer serve as a legal basis for transatlantic data transfers. There can be no ‘business as usual’ approach. Immediate steps have to be taken to ensure compliance with the ruling. These are: that citizens need to be assured that their personal data will be protected; and that European businesses needing to transfer personal data to the US need guidance about the remaining legal ways of doing so, with appropriate safeguards and the conditions to be fulfilled. The Commission is working closely with the European data protection supervisors in Working Party 29. We want to ensure clear guidance so that we avoid fragmentation in the internal market. There were good first discussions at technical level last week, and this will continue in the plenary tomorrow, which I will also attend. The Commission is also in dialogue with business on this issue. Today, together with Vice-President Ansip and Commissioner Oettinger, I met a delegation of business representatives to hear their practical concerns and to stress the need to comply with the ruling swiftly. They are worried about fragmentation, and they need guidance as a matter of urgency. I want to use the opportunity of this discussion today to assure you that my objective remains a renewed and robust arrangement for transatlantic data flows, taking into account the requirements set out by our highest court. The US side also needs to address these requirements in its own legal order and in practice. After my first discussions with Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, I remain confident that this is possible. I am encouraged by reform steps such as the USA Freedom Act and the draft Judicial Redress Bill, which specifically addresses the situation of EU citizens. But we will be clear in our discussions with the US partners: we need guarantees that the right to data protection is respected when data is transferred to the US. Our benchmark is the court ruling. We will immediately resume and step up discussions with the US, building on the work done so far. I will myself go to Washington in mid—November to discuss the issue further with my counterparts there. This is an ongoing debate in the US, as it is in Europe. I would therefore ask you too, as Members of the European Parliament, to engage with your counterparts in the US Congress on this issue and to be a partner in this.

The negotiations as such have not yet made progress on the very point that we in the European Parliament have also criticised, namely because of state surveillance, but not because of data transmission as such. In fact, we have always called for the abolition of Safe Harbour, but in my view it is, of course, always linked to a condition that it be improved, completely abolished, but then also replaced, because for us the free flow of data is also a fundamental thing.

This, of course, puts our companies in serious legal difficulties. It is also problematic that the national data protection authorities themselves suddenly no longer have to follow this important principle of uniformity of European law.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her European fundamental rights, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, are the basis of all European laws, of all European action. The European Court of Justice has made this clear once again. We Social Democrats have been saying for years that the safe haven is not a safe haven for data, it is not a safe haven for the privacy of our citizens. The whole thing finally became a farce with the so-called NSA revelations. European data had become a self-service store for US security services – all in the name of so-called national security, without ever being questioned. It is also not only about metadata, which is already very sensitive, but also about the content of communication. What is clear is that the Commission could never have declared the United States a safe data port, almost in a stroke of the hand. Nor is it possible to completely restrict the control rights of national data protection authorities. A state whose authorities monitor people without cause and across the board cannot be a safe haven. It is now important to carefully examine and analyse the possible impact of this on other legal bases for the transfer of data to the United States. An adequate level of data protection, and this is also clear, must be a high level of data protection. In addition to the high level of data protection, we need a right of action in the event that data abuse nevertheless takes place. There are many consequences to be drawn from this judgment. The Irish Data Protection Authority can and must now investigate Max Schrems' complaint. It is also clear that the US itself must review its legislation and install effective controls. This is all the more so because even US representatives have admitted that their intelligence services have exceeded the already very broad powers. Nor can the Commission simply carry on as before and review the 13 recommendations as part of a review of Safe Harbour; we have to make a fresh start here. For our European data protection reform, of course, this also means, of course, that we must at least re-examine carefully the rules for the transfer of data to third countries. In our Member States, too, we need to re-consider national surveillance programmes in the light of this judgment.

However, I disagree with his statement that it is the Court which is to blame, for upholding the law. That is actually what courts do in a liberal democracy, and I am grateful that at least the Court did it, because the real problem was known for many years. We have known for more than 10 years that the safeguards were not adequate, that compliance was weak if not absent, and that we were applying double standards. We apply different standards to our American friends than we apply to other countries. Fortunately, the Court has stopped this, and now we have to find a solution. We also need to study the implications for other policies and, in particular, transatlantic data flows. That would include the Passenger Name Records agreement, the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme agreement, the umbrella agreement and possibly also public procurement arrangements. I think national governments should also check if their national surveillance laws actually meet the standards set by the Court. I would like to remind people that privacy and data protection – contrary to what I believe Mr Zuckerberg once said – is not a social convention. It is actually a legal right on a par with the right to free speech, the right to life, a ban on torture and all the other fundamental rights. It is a legal right, Mr Kirkhope. It is not something the Court invented: it is actually in the Treaties. We do not want a fence around the European internet. We want transatlantic data flows, but it takes two to tango – as Mr Juncker said in the previous debate – so that means our US counterparts will also have to move.

You asked several times what the Commission is going to do. I tried to explain this at the beginning but perhaps I should go into more detail now.  I think we all understand the complexity of this matter. We Europeans value the right to privacy and the right to the protection of our private data as a fundamental right. In the United States, when we negotiate Safe Harbour and the protection of European data in the United States, we understand that there is a highly valued principle of security and also the fact that the data is a commercial commodity. This is the area in which we are acting and where we want to achieve strong commitments, from the side of the United States, that Europeans’ data will be very well protected – and at least as well as we do it in the European Union. This is our goal. You will understand that this is not easy to achieve because we are in the field of non-European jurisdiction. We also have to work with this fact.  So what are we going to do? I am working intensively on a strategy to find a solution to this situation. I see three stages. The short-term stage is now very much dependent on the strong and independent data protection authorities and on their unified pan-European approach in providing clear guidance to businesses which are expressing very strong concerns that they are in a situation of legal uncertainty. We all understand that this is the case for businesses. This is an uneasy situation.  In the medium term we need to achieve good results in negotiations on the new, safer Safe Harbour and the new adequacy decision. I will come back to this. In the long term – and I also spoke about this at the beginning – we need to put more pressure on the United States towards their reform of national intelligence and a higher level of protection of privacy. This will be for the long term. This is what I wanted to stress at the beginning, asking you to help with your counterparts in the United States at your level. Going back to Safe Harbour, Safe Harbour is a specific system which was created for transatlantic data flows. I am convinced that this system was created for a very good reason because the volume of the data transferred is extremely big and the data transfers are also extremely important for economic and commercial cooperation with the United States. This specific regime was declared invalid and now the conditions which are provided for by the Data Protection Directive protection for international transfers must be applied. This is where we are now. But we understand – and I am convinced – that we need this new requested decision which will represent a new system which is something like a safer Safe Harbour. Members are absolutely right that we need to look again at the 13 recommendations which were defined in 2013 as a reaction to the revelations about the extreme access of the security service to European data. We will look at those 13 recommendations in the light of the court ruling, which is the strong and clear benchmark for us in this retesting of these recommendations, because the Court is in fact giving us new criteria for the assessment of adequacy. This is exactly what we are doing now. We start the negotiations tomorrow after a very thorough analysis of the court ruling. The negotiations will start tomorrow, and on Friday on a technical level with our United States partners. We need to look again at all the recommendations regarding the commercial part and especially at those recommendations which concern national security considerations. We were very close to finalising the negotiations on Safe Harbour before the summer, but we knew that the court ruling would come soon so we waited for the decision in order to continue the negotiations. I can only conclude with the quite positive assessment that all the criteria which the court ruling contained regarding the adequacy of data protection in the United States are feasible to achieve, but we must be much more assertive and much stronger now in the negotiations. We are fully aware of the fact that time is against us and we need to step up our efforts.

Much attention has been given to other pressing problems lately, but Ukraine remains a top priority for the EU. We must not underestimate what is at stake. First and foremost, it is human lives. The latest numbers are appalling: almost 8 000 people killed, 1.5 million displaced, and another 1.1 million have left the country since the start of the conflict. Secondly, basic principles of international law have been challenged: territorial integrity, sovereignty and the inviolability of borders – cornerstones of the European security order. Crimea and Sevastopol have been illegally annexed by the Russian Federation. I want to thank the European Parliament and its Members for keeping Ukraine high on the agenda.  The interparliamentary meetings, the recently—signed Memorandum of Understanding between the European Parliament and the Rada on parliamentary support and capacity building, and recent visits to Ukraine by the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on International Trade, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Committee on Foreign Affairs are just a few examples. In less than two weeks, some of you will travel to Ukraine to monitor the local elections – another opportunity for the Ukrainian people to exercise their democratic rights. All of this strengthens EU-Ukraine relations. Your role cannot be overestimated. The European Parliament ratified the Association Agreement a bit more than a year ago, paving the way towards an era of new opportunities for citizens in Ukraine, based on its political association and economic integration with the European Union. During the last plenary debate on Ukraine in February, you discussed at length the Normandy Format and the Minsk Agreements. High Representative/Vice—President Mogherini stressed then that the diplomatic efforts led by Germany and France are genuinely European, and that we must remain united in our support of the Normandy Format and the Trilateral Contact Group in order to achieve results. A lot has happened since then. During spring and summer, the situation on the ground deteriorated. Nevertheless, Ukraine adopted decentralisation-related amendments to the constitution at first reading, including a provision enabling special arrangements for self-government in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in line with the Minsk Agreements. Since 1 September – following intense diplomatic efforts – the ceasefire, which was first agreed in September 2014, is at last being largely respected. Two weeks ago, an agreement was reached on the withdrawal of tanks and smaller weapons, implementation of which has already begun. The EU-supported Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) special monitoring mission is growing further to its full strength of 1 000 monitors on the ground to cope with all new tasks of verification and monitoring. We know, however, that it is not only the number of monitors but also, and above all, their full access to the territory which can make a real difference. That is why we strongly emphasise the need for it. Demining along both sides of the line of contact has started. The Normandy Summit of 2 October 2015 gave further impetus to the political process, and the separatist so-called ‘elections’ in Luhansk and Donetsk – which would have violated the Minsk Agreements – have now been deferred. Does this mean that the conflict is almost over? Clearly not. Cases of shooting and shelling still take place; people continue to die. Internally displaced persons are unable to return to their homes. The modalities of the local elections according to OSCE standards still need to be fixed under Ukrainian law. The special arrangement for self-government has to be agreed and an amnesty implemented. There should be no Russian forces on Ukrainian soil. Ukraine should regain control over the 450-kilometre-long segment of its border that it has been forced to abandon. Nevertheless, what we have now is a process that is moving in the right direction, albeit slowly and sometimes hesitantly. This is no small thing. The joint support of EU institutions and Member States for this process has certainly contributed substantially.  The EU will continue to support the process, including through financial and in-kind contributions to the OSCE special monitoring mission. Also, the EU and its Member States have contributed over EUR 242 million in humanitarian and recovery aid, including EUR 42 million provided by the Commission to all affected populations, including refugees in Russia and Belarus. In parallel, the Commission is engaging in trilateral talks on energy and on implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. They are ensuring that gas supplies to and through Ukraine remain uninterrupted during the winter season. They are also addressing Russia’s concerns about the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area without amending or delaying the implementation of the agreement from 1 January onwards. EU relations with Ukraine are developing dynamically despite the difficult realities of the conflict which its authorities and, above all, its people have to face. Our goal remains to help them create a well-functioning state and a successful economy. Just a few examples: the Support Group for Ukraine continues to focus EU advice, technical assistance and financial resources on the Ukrainian reform process; over six billion of the original EUR 11 billion support package announced by the EU in March 2014 has already been mobilised to launch the reforms that will secure the future. The EU Advisory Mission to Ukraine is doing important work to assist security-sector reforms. Its mandate is currently under review to further streamline its activities toward Ukraine’s most immediate needs. On visa liberalisation, we are moving towards the goal of visa-free travel for Ukrainian citizens to the EU, an important step to enhance people-to-people contacts. Further progress is needed, notably in the fight against corruption. To sum up, we have reason to be cautiously optimistic about progress on the diplomatic track if we remain united, and we will continue to support Ukraine on its path to becoming a prosperous country. These are our joint objectives, and I look forward to working towards them together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 222, "date": "2015-10-14.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, since the last debate we had on Ukraine, more progress has been made.

I am absolutely sure that, at this juncture, sending any signals to Moscow about the possibilities of softening or lifting the sanctions would be far too premature and therefore harmful.

And I would like to underline what Mr Austreviius said: what is happening at the moment with regard to the implementation of Minsk II is by no means an occasion to talk about easing sanctions; if something happens, it is still the result of a mixed strategy of diplomacy and sanctions. I hope that no decision will be taken in January – without significant changes in eastern Ukraine – to re-decide on the sanctions, but I would actually be in favour of putting an end to this whole debate. That would be much better for those who are involved in the reforms in Ukraine, because they need this commitment from the European Union for their work. And there is light and shadow.

Judging by the Syrian-dominated headlines, one would be mistaken for thinking that all is now well in Ukraine. This perfectly summarises the reactive manner in which the West is conducting itself in contrast to President Putin’s dramatic shift in foreign policy. We are now playing catch-up – always seemingly two steps behind, where he has taken the initiative. Regrettably, President Putin is pulling our strings – from Ukraine to the Baltic and down into Syria, not to mention in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and Georgia.

It is true that European diplomacy in general has taken significant steps towards bringing Ukraine down the European path. From The political statements of Viktor Yanukovych in 2011, when he told both the Russian Federation and the European Union, that \"I am convinced that Ukraine will be a member of the European Union in about ten years\", to the last success of the negotiations between the European Union and the Russian Federation, which last week led to the postponement of the elections for 2016, which were intended to be held in the separatist republics of eastern Ukraine , huge steps have been taken, indeed.  However, it is not enough! As a representative of Romania, a country in the vicinity of Ukraine, I believe that the short respite from postponing elections in the separatist provinces must be used to the fullest to prevent a new conflict in this region.  Basically the organization and ratification of elections in the separatist provinces will also mean the de facto consecration of the independence from Ukraine of these provinces and it will be the moment when conflicting tensions will break out.

However, I would very much like to draw attention to what was said– this internal flow of refugees, which is in Ukraine. We know that the next step could be exactly what we have seen in the south – that the flow of refugees is starting to move out of Ukraine. Which means that we have to deal with these internal refugees in Ukraine, there is a humanitarian catastrophe there! But we must also use the young people there, in the sense that we give them the opportunity to be training, to come here to the European Union, to raise this new young resource, who, even when he goes back to eastern Ukraine, can help build local life there.

Many Members commented on the reform process in Ukraine. Let me give you my update on what is going on in Ukraine in the field of judicial reform and reform of the public prosecutor’s office, and also in the field of the fight against corruption, which you mentioned several times. I can only confirm that the reforms are up-and-running. They are now working very intensively on the reform of the judiciary system and also on the reform of the public prosecutor’s office. They have set up a national bureau against corruption and also the anti-corruption team within the prosecutor’s office. The selection of detectives is ongoing. You know that these reforms also represent the steps forward which are the conditions for provision of the second and third tranche of EU financial support to Ukraine. So part of the purpose of my mission was to look at these reforms also from the perspective of financing. I spoke to the President, to the Prime Minister, to Members of the Ukrainian Parliament and to representatives of civil society, and they all understand that it is not only about the laws to be adopted and institutional changes to be undertaken, but it is also about the enforcement of laws. The reform simply must function and it must work in practice. It is also about the continuous pressure from civil society and from the media in the fight against corruption, because there must be very strong understanding of what corruption is and how the fight against this phenomenon, which is really killing the chances for further development of the country, must continue. I have good feelings from Ukraine and every time we speak of the reforms in Ukraine we must realise how difficult the conditions are under which the Ukrainian authorities are working for these reforms. I also want to stress again the importance of your engagement outside Brussels and Strasbourg. Your visits to Ukraine are important, as are your public statements, your meetings with civil society and, last but not least, your work with Members of the Ukrainian Parliament. In this context, I would like to wish Mr Plenković and the other Members of the European Parliament delegation success in their meeting in Kiev on 4-6 November 2015.

The question is very simple and is in two parts: firstly to ask the Commission to make specific policy commitments and enforcement plans to fight hate speech and discrimination; and, secondly, to ask the Commission to adopt national strategies with clear goals to address anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other forms of racism, similar to the national Roma integration strategies that we already have in place in our community. Behind these questions are some profound truths. We have a very complex situation: in dealing with anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, and indeed other forms of hate, we are dealing with some of the oldest forms of hatred on our continent. To deal with such issues and to think that they are simplistic – or indeed that in each Member State they will be the same – is, of course, naive. But equally, to think that – as a European Union, a union of values – we cannot take action against such a phenomenon would be naive and wrong. So these questions are really asking the Commission to update its action to ensure that we are ready for the new forms of expression of hatred, of anti—Semitism and Islamophobia, which we see today. We are not being naive in thinking that there are always common denominators, but we do know that something has changed. No longer are these attacks anecdotal. Our Fundamental Rights Agency gives us the statistics. They tell us, for example, that 46% have experienced abuse, and 33% have experienced abuse if they are Jewish, in the European Union. We have one in three Muslims, according to the Fundamental Rights Agency in a 2009 survey, experiencing discrimination in a 12—month period. These are snapshot statistics but we know that no longer do we have anecdotal statistics. We know that our police forces and our enforcement agencies in Member States are doing their job so that we can now have proper statistics. What do they tell us? They tell us a very simple truth: that, while we say we are taking action on the basis of the Council framework decision of 2008, we are not doing it in every Member State. The Race Equality Directive of 1999, which was supposed to have been implemented across the European Union, remains untransposed and unimplemented. We have the tools to deal with racism. We have the tools here in the European Union but, sadly, not all Member States have used those tools. In the end, each Member State will have its own issues and its own forms of expression in terms of how to deal with discrimination. Again, no-one is being so naive as to say that each situation is the same. But I repeat that there are two important points here. One is that we must deal with the political messages at European level – we must deal with education at European level and we must send out clear messages from this Parliament – and also we must deal with the practicalities. Yesterday, in my own Member State, a young Muslim woman was doused in alcohol on a train while people sat watching. For that victim it was a very painful situation, but let me say, too, that for the people who were watching it was also a very bad situation. That is why, in my country, there are exemplary sentences for those who commit a crime with racial motivation. The reasoning is that such crimes have an extra effect on society, and that is why you have such exemplary sentences. There is a bigger effect on society through anti—Semitism and Islamophobia, and it is a matter of opinion in this Chamber – and many will have their opinions – as to what has happened in the recent refugee crisis and as to the responsibilities we all have to assume. These things will be matters of opinion, but what is important is that we realise we have to take action. We have the tools in the European Union. We see ourselves as a union of values. We will not always interfere in what Member States do in terms of taking action, but we must send the political messages, we must educate and, most of all, we must require Member States to take action when they are ready. We have the tools at European Union level to do that. We have not taken that action, and Member States must now act and the Commission must now act.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 269, "date": "2015-10-14.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, together with First Vice-President Timmermans, I held our first Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights last week. I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Claude Moraes, and all the other Members who were present for their involvement and steady support. The colloquium drew in part on the public hearing on Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and Hate Speech which was held in the Civil Liberties Committee in June this year.  The colloquium confirmed that anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, like other forms of hatred, are our common concern. We must not leave the communities targeted, or the groups directly affected by hate, to deal with it alone because only together can we find solutions.  And I can promise you that the Commission will play its part. The Commission has published the conclusions of the colloquium, which include a ‘to do’ list – a roadmap of actions to which we should jointly commit and on which we should work. Let me mention some of them.  We will monitor rigorously the transposition and implementation of the EU legislation on racist hate speech and crime. Where necessary, we will launch infringement proceedings, and we will also assist Member States. We will share best practice guidance, reinforce training support and encourage cooperation with civil society so that EU rules are applied correctly.  We have also decided to designate two coordinators with specific responsibility for issues relating to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, respectively. They will be the contact points within the Commission for both communities. Furthermore, the Commission will convene a high-level EU group on racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. Together with Member States, civil society and both communities’ representatives, we will evaluate the added value and the feasibility of dedicated national strategies. Hate speech currently is the main manifestation of anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hatred. It fuels fear, spreads misconceptions and incites violence. I have started to discuss with IT companies and civil society how to address the issue of hate speech as a matter of priority, with full respect for freedom of expression. I briefed Justice Ministers about this at the Justice Council last Friday: they shared our concern and appreciated a coordinated approach to this. We also intend to counter online hate speech through targeted funding, monitoring activities and by identifying the need for further regulatory measures. EUR 5 750 000 has been earmarked in 2015 to encourage the monitoring of online hate speech. Let me be clear: we are speaking of content which is manifestly illegal under EU rules and European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence. So this is not a move against offensive or disturbing content, but against actual incitement to violent acts and hatred. We also agreed to promote further a pluralistic, inclusive and non-discriminatory society by monitoring the correct application of EU legislation on combating racial discrimination. Once again, let me stress the importance of adopting the Equal Treatment Directive.  Fostering inclusive education, mutual understanding and intercultural dialogue are equally important. We will prioritise EU projects promoting European values and history, including Holocaust remembrance, citizenship education and religious and media literacy. We will continue to support youth, student, school and civil-society projects and networks favouring tolerance and intercultural understanding. For example, in 2016 the Erasmus+ programme will prioritise projects that promote inclusion in education, training, youth and sport, and prevent marginalisation and the radicalisation of young people I am also committed to making it easier for small grassroots organisations to identify relevant funding and projects related to intolerance and racism. To this end, I will set up an easy-to-access webpage.

Moreover, the increase in incidents motivated by Islamophobia in the Union is unacceptable. In this regard, I mean that Islam is a respectable religion and Jihad is a pathology of Islam. But we cannot put aside the cruel persecution and also elimination and expulsion suffered by the Christian community in more than fifty countries. Remember the expulsion of two thousand Christians from the Nineveh Plain, twenty-one Daesh-beheaded Christians in Libya in February, Hindu extremists attacking churches in Nepal, or the total flight of Christians in Syria and Iraq. In addition, today, the Daesh has two hundred and thirty Christians abducted. The expression of hatred is a deviation from reason, an aberration. We must ensure a Union and a free and plural world that promotes tolerance between religions and mutual respect; and the protection of Roma, too.

Intolerance and anti-Semitism are strongly regrown throughout the European Union.  There's a contest of concausas and they've been exposed here over and over again. On the one hand, the lousy management of the crisis and the exasperation of inequalities have led to the radicalisation of a Muslim collective within the European Union prone to purely anti-Semitic and therefore persecutory attitudes of Jewish identity. But there is also impunity on the net, cowardly disguised in anonymity, which allows the pathogenic transmission of hate speech and hate politics and direct incitement to criminal violence.  We therefore have an obligation to deal with this matter, and that is the meaning of the public hearing that took place in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 29 June. And above all, to seek an answer based on the data highlighted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights relating to the paris, Brussels or Toulouse attacks, but also with the sense of vulnerability of Jewish communities throughout the European Union.  Therefore, answers are needed. On the one hand, the possibility, promoted by the Commission, of the appointment of a special envoy on anti-Semitism which could be part of the Commission's own organizational structure, with the participation of this Parliament; but above all, the development and implementation of national strategies that take as an example those established in relation to the Roma community – with European Roma – to deal with the multiple variations and possibilities for responding to this execrable phenomenon.

Europe has won this freedom and must continue to win it.  It is unacceptable to deny the Holocaust, to deny what is part of our history and it is unacceptable to glorify all those regimes that we had on European soil during World War II, their symbols, fascist, Nazi symbols that unfortunately we can still see at various gatherings, and young people are often part of these gatherings. That is why I want to emphasize in particular the importance and importance of educating young people so that they are exactly what europe's future freedom will be, the future tolerance of Europe, and of course media such as the internet play a special role.  Definitely together with anti-Semitism we also have Islamophobia in the European Union, we have those who use this refugee crisis in a way to say that there will be an Islamization of Europe, which is really scandalous because we should first of all look up to what the Pope was saying in this Parliament as well and what the Pope has otherwise said and he has spoken about this refugee crisis and I believe that is exactly how , through speech of tolerance, not hatred, we can achieve what we want, more security, more stability, better happiness for citizens living in the European Union.

As has been mentioned, the European Union has employment legislation relating to non—discrimination on grounds of freedom of belief – amongst other grounds – and general legislation concerning anti-discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin.

We are seeing a rise in anti-Semitism, as the US State Department reported today, and we are also seeing a rise in anti-Muslim prejudice, of which we hear far too much within this House.

Now, the rise in anti-Semitism is in direct relation to the rise in fundamentalist Islam. Look at the ideology that inspires it. Let me quote, once again, the Hadith and the sayings of Mohammed: ‘Judgment day will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews. Jews will hide behind the rocks and the trees, and the rocks and the trees will cry out, “Oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.”’ Here is an extract from a more recent sermon by Sheikh Abid al-Rahman al-Sudayyis, an Imam at the al-Haram Mosque in Mecca. He reportedly described Jews as ‘the scum of the human race, the rats of the world, the violators of pacts and agreements, the murderers of prophets, and the offspring of pigs and apes’. Instead of asking the Commission what it is going to do to combat hate crime, the authors of this question should ask the Islamic leaders in Europe to publicly and unequivocally reject these hateful teachings.  As for Islamophobia, my dictionary describes a phobia as an irrational fear. Many people have a perfectly rational fear of the followers of the cult of Mohammed who subscribe to and hold the views I quoted.

The Commission is determined to confront all forms of hatred with equal attention: anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, anti-Gypsyism, homophobia or other forms of hatred. I want to stress one thing: the law must be enforced, and laws in the EU prohibit discrimination. Criminal law is here to punish all forms of hate crime. I want to react to what Ms Kozłowska-Rajewicz said about using these repressive instruments. Yes, I must say we are looking at all ways of tackling the problem, and these are among the instruments which we need to use. You know that we are now enforcing the framework decision of 2008 which was adopted to combat all forms of intolerance and xenophobia. We have been able to enforce this as of 1 December last year. We carried out an inventory of the situation in the Member States and found that in many Member States this framework decision has not been implemented properly, and there are still Member States where Holocaust denial is not punishable under criminal law. That must be changed. I have already alerted the Member States, especially those where the framework decision has not been implemented in a satisfactory way, to the fact that we will strictly require its implementation. Let me add one personal remark. Yes, I agree with all who spoke here about the necessity of understanding the reasons why we are seeing such an extreme increase in intolerance in the EU – be it the financial crisis, or be it terrorist attacks that took place in Europe. There are many, many different reasons which we must understand. My personal view is that what I would term insufficiently smart budgetary policy is part of the problem. Just look at the public budgets: at how much we have invested in our stomachs, how much less in our brains, and how much we have invested in our hearts. In terms of culture, have we invested enough to sustain positive emotions in Europe, as hate is a negative emotion? We must change this, and we must urge the Member States, and all those who take decisions on the use of public money, to change it. We want to be in the lead here, and I am already working on the budget for next year prioritising these painful issues.  I also urged the Ministers of Justice last week to look at the structural funds: at where they are invested and whether they reflect current needs, because we made a horrible mistake with the structural funds in the last programming period. The funds did not reflect the financial crisis at all – it was as if nothing was happening. We should not now repeat the fatal mistake of failing to ensure that the use of EU money reflects our current and very urgent needs. Sorry for taking too long.

His \"pyramid of hate\" consists of negative comments, avoidance, discrimination, physical attacks, extermination. Examples from history confirm the legitimacy of this model.  The Council of Europe, in turn, defined the term 'hate speech' as 'all forms of expression which disseminate, incite, promote or justify racial, religious, xenophobic, anti-Semitism or other forms of hatred resulting from intolerance, including intolerance expressed through aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism, discrimination and hostility towards representatives of minorities, immigrants and persons of foreign origin'.

I believe that the policies of the European Union and the action of its Frontex agency have much to do with the humanitarian emergency situation we are currently witnessing, and strengthening Europe's instruments of strength can in no way contribute to improving the situation.

By reasoning in this way, many parliamentarians could be lifted their immunity for espionage for the benefit of the United States!

We know that extreme weather events will increase. They are forcing people from regions that are already suffering from poverty and strong population growth. 2014 was the warmest year in our history. Despite the challenges, the objectives must be realistic. Europe alone cannot respond to climate change. Our share of the world's greenhouse gas emissions is less than 10%. It is necessary to bring in other countries and regions.  Otherwise, there is a threat that Europe's good ambitions will turn upside down and accelerate climate change. This will happen if carbon leakage from Europe increases as a result of overly tough commitments. At the same time, we would lose jobs. So far, only the European Union has introduced comprehensive emissions trading. In the context of the forthcoming revision, a balance must be struck between free allowances for carbon leakage sectors and actual emission reductions.  There are positive signs that an international climate agreement has been reached. China has said it will introduce emissions trading from 2017 and reverse greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Us carbon emissions, on the other hand, are reduced by the use of liquefied natural gas.  Much has been done in Europe to reduce emissions. In future, particular attention will have to be paid to the transport sector, which produces the second highest greenhouse gas emissions.

I voted in favour of the own-initiative report based on the Commission communication 'Tackling global climate change beyond 2020' with a view to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC COP21). I am convinced that the 2015 Protocol must be an ambitious, comprehensive and legally binding agreement that aim to phase out global carbon emissions by 2050.  I also support the achievement of the target of a 50% reduction, compared to previous levels in 1990, of greenhouse gas emissions within the European Union by 2030. I also believe that, also by the same year, the EU must pursue the improvement of energy efficiency by 40% and produce at least 45% of the energy consumed from renewable sources.
