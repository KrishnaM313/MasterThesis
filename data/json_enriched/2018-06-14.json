Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index shows that there are serious problems all over the EU. But also there are huge differences among the Member States.  We also have to speak about our losses: the cost of corruption. A study commissioned by the European Parliament estimates that the cost of corruption could go up to EUR 900 billion annually. Just for comparison, the EU’s annual budget for 2018 is EUR 160 billion. Theoretically speaking, if we took a tough stance against corruption, the functioning of the EU would be free or almost free for the European taxpayers for the next five years. Scandals related to the misuse of EU funds are revealed on a daily basis. According to OLAF reports, the highest number of investigations have for years been related to Structural Funds, with most of the cases concentrated in a few a Member States, which are mostly the recipients of those funds. In some of the Member States, like in my own county – Hungary – there is systemic political corruption related to the EU funds. In others, such as Slovakia, for example, it seems that organised crime groups are benefiting from EU funds. And these are only the tip of the iceberg. As the Azerbaijani Laundromat case showed, there are serious problems related to corruption even in countries like Denmark. So there is an urgent need for action, and the EU should take an important role in rooting out corruption in all its forms. The European Commission, however, has failed to move forward over the past four years and has even taken a step backwards from its 2011 anti-corruption package by abolishing the biannual Anti-corruption Report. This was capable tool to analyse the European landscape and provided the European citizens with credible, comprehensive and comparative data and assessment on corruption, as well as highlighting the weaknesses and also the good practices of the Member States. Therefore, we regret very much in this house that the Commission decided to abolish this exercise. Anti-corruption recommendations in the European Semester are good additional tools but do not substitute the overall picture given by the report. But to credibly pointing out to Member States, we need stronger anti-corruption activity and control in the EU institutions as well. The 2011 package has also foreseen the EU’s participation in the Council of Europe’s anti-corruption group, GRECO, which could facilitate the independent evaluation of the EU institutions as well. But the negotiations on that are stalled. Still, there are a few promising steps. First is the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). The EPPO, hopefully, will help in fighting fraud and corruption in relation to EU Funds. But it is not a sufficient tool alone. A couple of prosecutors will not be able to fight fraud and corruption fully and in a systematic way, and in fact some of the main beneficiary Member States of EU funds are not willing to participate. The second is the Regulation on the Rule of Law proposed for the new Multiannual Financial Framework. This instrument could actually play an important role in incentivising the Member States to play by the rules. But this proposal is still waiting for approval by the co-legislators. All in all, the balance is rather negative. Therefore, with my colleagues in the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT), we ask the following questions: What was the reason behind the abolishment of the EU anti-corruption report and why did the Commission not present the already-prepared second report? Secondly, the anti-corruption report and the European Semester recommendations are not alternatives of each other. How does the Commission intend to complement the Semester recommendation in order to tackle other aspects of corruption? And last but not least, to improve the independent scrutiny of the EU institutions, shouldn’t they participate in the cooperation of GRECO?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-06-14.json", "name": "Benedek JÁVOR", "mepid": "124721", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the 2014 EU Anti-Corruption Report provided a useful overview of the situation in each Member State: measures in place, outstanding issues, policies that are working and areas that could be improved. The report showed that the nature and scope of corruption varies from one Member State to another and that the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies is quite different. It also showed that corruption deserved attention in all EU Member States. In the past years the Commission has increasingly prioritised integrity and anti—corruption, also in the European Semester of economic governance. Corruption is still a key issue in a number of states, hampering investment, efficient resource allocation, economic performance and growth. The situation calls for continued, persistent and coherent action. It is against this background, in line with the general approach of this Commission to streamline processes and focus on key issues in the relevant fora, that we considered that the European Semester, which is the main economic policy dialogue with Member States, is the most appropriate policy instrument for systematically engaging with the Member States in this area of major common interest. In March 2018, the issue of corruption was included in 14 country reports. For several Member States, the Commission underlined the need to strengthen the effective investigation and prosecution of corruption and enhance prevention. Other areas requiring improvement are whistle—blower protection, lobbying legislation, assets and interest disclosure and verifications, adequate resourcing for anti-corruption bodies, as well as transparency and public access to information. In the country—specific recommendations published on 23 May 2018, recommendations focusing on these aspects were proposed for six countries. Facilitating experience-sharing among Member States in the fight against corruption is a key aspect of anti-corruption efforts at EU level. In 2015 the Commission launched the EU Anti—Corruption Experience-Sharing Programme. It offers anti—corruption practitioners from Member States a forum for exchanging views on topics of common interest and on legislative and institutional reforms and policy initiatives in other Member States. These workshops cover topics such as corruption in the private sector, political immunities, public procurement at local level, asset disclosure, whistle—blower protection, corruption in health care, conflicts of interest, and measuring corruption and its economic and social impact. More than 300 experts have participated in the programme since 2015. These efforts go hand in hand with our legislative activity. The Commission has taken action to ensure that anti-corruption provisions are an integral part of all relevant legislative instruments. Such is the case for the recent initiative on the protection of whistle—blowers. Adequate whistle—blowing mechanisms that codify processes within public administration to allow officials channels for reporting what they may perceive as irregularities or even illegal acts can help overcome detection problems inherent to corruption. The Commission has also recently proposed a package of measures enabling the national competent authorities to access and exchange financial and other information in a timely manner. The measures aim to grant law enforcement authorities, asset recovery offices and anti-corruption authorities direct access to the information contained in the centralised bank account registers. The measures also aim at improving cooperation between law enforcement authorities and financial intelligence units (FIUs), as well as between FIUs. These recent initiatives complement other measures in areas ranging from public procurement and the protection of EU financial interests to asset recovery and anti-money laundering. The Commission also provides financial support for a wide range of projects in the field of anti-corruption under a variety of financial instruments, for example in the Internal Security Fund for Police, European social and investment funds, Horizon 2020 and Hercule II and III programmes, to promote activities designed to boost EU action to prevent and combat fraud undermining the EU’s financial interests. The European institutions have put in place a comprehensive framework of rules on ethics and mechanisms to deter, investigate and punish misconduct, including corruption and associated wrongdoings. These rules are fully integrated inter alia in the Staff Regulations and the rules on financial management and internal control. They include enforcement mechanisms and proportionate, effective and dissuasive sanctions for possible breaches. Transparency and accountability are key principles of the Commission’s decision—making process. President Juncker has established greater transparency as a top priority since the beginning of his mandate. As part of the Commission’s commitment to transparency, the Commissioners, their Cabinet members and Directors—General publish information on meetings held with organisations and self-employed individuals on the EU Transparency Register. Furthermore, on 1 February 2018, a new Code of Conduct for Commissioners entered into force, significantly enhancing the ethics framework at the political level. The modernised rules set new standards for ethics rules in Europe, for example by extending the cooling—off period from 18 months to two years for former Commissioners and to three years for the President of the Commission. As regards the potential participation of the EU in the Implementation Review Mechanism to the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), to which the EU is a party, the Commission is now in the process of assessing the extent of the modifications of the Union’s competence with regard to all the matters governed by the UNCAC after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, as well as the legal and institutional implications of this modification of competences. It is to be recalled that the EU is a unique regional economic integration organisation and, as such, this raises specific and complex legal and institutional questions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-06-14.json", "name": "Julia PITERA", "mepid": "124898", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr Chairman! Commissioner! In 2011, the Commission published data which showed that as many as four in five European Union citizens perceived corruption as a serious problem in their country. Thus, in the same year, the Commission introduced the anti-corruption package, recognizing that citizens deserved access to a reliable assessment of the state of corruption in the Member States. The Home Affairs Commissioner further stated that politicians and decision-makers were not sufficiently determined to take action to combat this phenomenon and that the anti-corruption report could become a stimulus for political will to act. As a consequence, the first report was published in 2014. Unfortunately, in 2017, the Commission did not consider such a report to be the best course of action. Commissioner! Since then, anti-corruption reforms have been halted in one Member State, while another attempted to liberalize existing laws, triggering massive street demonstrations in many cities. Public opinion was also shocked by two dramatic killings of investigative journalists tracking European funds withdrawn by organized crime groups, as well as the disclosure of politicians' ties to the Panama papers scandal. To this day, we probably do not have full knowledge of the interference of a third country in the bribing of European politicians, despite the fact that the practice was described in a report by an independent investigative body published by the Council of Europe in April this year.

Already in 2013, the resolution of the CRIM commission estimated that corruption and organized crime impose an annual cost of over € 650 billion on EU companies. Corruption is not only a crime against the public administration, but I would almost say an attack on the public and private economy, since it alters free competition between businesses, worsens the quality of public services and unduly subtracts funds from taxation. In Europe, despite the recent adoption of important legislative measures such as the PIF directive or the regulation on the European Public Prosecutor's Office, not enough has been done, not even in terms of prevention, de facto delegating the repression of the phenomenon only to the criminal systems of the Member States . The Commission's failure to publish the second report on corruption is perplexing, especially in view of the development of necessary new measures in this area. Among the most urgent measures, given that it has been established that there are around 3 600 criminal organizations operating in the Union and that their illicit interference seriously damages the economy, I would mention the development of a common definition of organized crime at European level. , as well as the introduction of common rules for the protection of whistleblowers' witnesses and collaborators of justice at European level.

Corruption is a cancer that threatens to destroy our democracy and hit the European Union to the core. We have just heard from the Commission how important it considers the fight against corruption to be, but at the same time that it is refraining from regularly publishing these reports in future. The decision to use the European Semester and publish the corruption situation in the country reports is not sufficient. The Member States, of course, do not want to be denounced; I understand that. But the citizens want something to happen. They see how great the damage is that they are ultimately expected to do as taxpayers, and they want this to be remedied. The populists have an easy game. They can promise a lot, they can be generous with money. But when it comes to solving specific problems, they fail. We all know that the EU still has weaknesses. But we also know that corruption is one of the greatest weaknesses we face. We have to do something about it. Member States must not be able to prevent the European Public Prosecutor from investigating corruption cases in their regions in a very targeted and systematic manner. We're just seeing this happening in Malta. The journalist who uncovered cases of corruption was murdered a few weeks ago. The corruption cases are not systematically investigated, nor is the murder itself specifically investigated. One almost has the impression that everything here is to be covered up under the cloak of silence. It can't go like that. In a year we will have European elections. We know that these European elections will, in a sense, be fateful elections that are vital for all of us. We have to see that for most citizens Europe is actually equated with their future. Europe is our future, we have no other. And that is why it is important that we bring Europe back into the minds and hearts of the citizens and especially of the youth. The time for excuses is over. This also applies to the Commission. We must not preach water and drink wine. I can only appeal: start again to systematically publish the anti-corruption reports!

Thank you, Madam President. I have to say that, this morning, I was awake, but I almost fell asleep again when I heard the European Commissioner, because I have rarely heard such a boring story. We are of course familiar with all the measures you mention. We have studied this. I myself am co-chair of a network of the MEPs of the Intergroup for Transparency and Against Corruption. So we know that. What matters to us is a good discussion about exactly what all colleagues here call 'the developments in Europe', which are much worse than what we read in the economic semester, the reports of it, what does not come together and also the complexity of corruption. Corruption is not just about a properly functioning rule of law. It is also about access to facilities such as healthcare, education. It is very heartfelt and it really deserves a separate report from the Commission. And then I hear, 'Yes, we have now streamlined and it's now in the economic semester'. Well, maybe it's all wrong there. And when you hear that from Left to Right in this Parliament we all think the same, that we want a separate report, and we say that year after year, don't come up with a list of things that the Commission is already doing. I actually have the same story with the UN and the Council of Europe. I am in regular contact with the UNODC Secretariat, of the UN, in Vienna, with the GRECO Secretariat of the Council of Europe. And both secretariats say: we have all kinds of practical resources on offer to make it easy for the Commission to participate in the peer reviews. We would also like some financial support - the UN specifically says so - so that the Commission allows us to do our job. And time and time again, the answer from the Commission is yes, we are investigating and there are all legal problems.

Corruption, both political and economic, puts a huge drain on our respective countries’ resources, and we must take every effort to plug the leaks. I cannot, however, support any calls for the EU to make recommendations to harmonise laws at EU level or interfere with Member States’ internal affairs. It should only be our elected and accountable national governments that take measures and propose actions to root it out, not unaccountable EU institutions in Brussels. It is also rather laughable that the EU should lecture Member States on corruption. The irony, I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, is not lost on me, or on other honourable Members in this House. The fact that the Commission discontinued its own anti-corruption report on itself shows how seriously they take this issue. However, even then, the report did not include corruption in EU institutions. There must be more light shone down the dark and mucky corridors of power in the EU. Transparency International shows that corruption perceptions in Bulgaria rank them 71 out of 180, which is not much better than China. This again highlights why the UK voted to leave the EU. We have had enough of corrupt institutions wasting billions of taxpayers’ money at home in the UK without another tranche of it at European level. Why should the United Kingdom be in political union with these countries sending billions of our hard-earned taxpayers’ money abroad while they have lower legal standards and a frightening lack of audit and accountability over their own affairs? This, I’m sure, is quite beyond me and beyond many of you, I should imagine. We should all be working as sovereign independent states to help each other to root out corruption in our own back yards and not be forced to comply with EU laws which do not have proper democratic controls. I will listen intently to what the Commission has to say about the Budgetary Control Committee’s questions and I do hope that, even though we are leaving, the vast improvements of transparency and accountability are made.

This was recognized by the Commission in 2011, and the figures that account for the impact of this scourge exceed the annual budget of the Union. It is difficult to continue to think that corruption can be treated as an issue outside the real economy. This being the case, the laxity with which the Commission is addressing its responsibilities in this matter cannot be understood. By when the second report on corruption? Stop talking about the European Semester. It has already been clearly insufficient. The fight against corruption should be a public policy of the Union, a commitment to the democratic principles that we claim to defend and that should help to reduce the growing distrust of politics. The crocodile tears of a part of the establishment against the rise of so-called populisms is an exercise in intolerable hypocrisy. Unfortunately, I come from a country where the corrupters and the corrupt have viewed the state as a loot at their disposal. Spain - it has already been said - has obtained the worst marks on the Corruption Perception Index. And in the last GRECO report, my country only partially complied with seven of the eleven recommendations of this international body to combat corruption. In both cases, an unacceptable classification, but sadly it is not the only country in Europe that fails with a bang. We know the immense damage that this private colonization of the public does to democracy, not only to the economy.

Let me reflect on the probably three most frequently asked questions during the debate. The first was on the self-standing EU anti-corruption report. While the EU anti-corruption report provided a useful overview of the situation, streamlined coverage in the European semester of economic governance, which is the main economic policy dialogue between the Member States and the European Union institutions, appears to be an equally efficient way to address the matter and is in line with the general approach of this Commission to streamline processes and focus on key issues in the relevant fora. Others raised the question about OLAF activities and the fight against corruption at a practical level. Let me say that the OLAF management will enter into detail of their achievements for the year, where I am pleased to see the office has once again delivered tangible results for taxpayers. 197 investigations concluded, over 300 recommendations issued and significant recoveries recommended to the EU budget, stemming in particular from the conclusion of major under-valuation fraud cases. The money we get back in this context can be used to serve European citizens and to promote growth and jobs. OLAF was also able to further reduce the duration of its investigation to 17.6 months on average, despite its limited resources. This speaks for the commitment of OLAF staff to getting the job done. In 2017, OLAF activities brought a significant contribution to protecting the revenue side of the EU budget, with a string of large cases concerning the under-valuation of goods at import. This is important work; any gaps in the legislative setting or operational capacity of customs administrations to function across borders are quickly exploited by organised criminal groups. In this context, due to its ability to operate transnationally and to gather and share information, OLAF plays a crucial role in preventing and tackling revenue fraud, as well as in assisting national customs administrations in their challenging work. Last but not least, the European Commission’s participation in UNCAC. The review of implementation of the United Nations Convention on Anti-Corruption (UNCAC) plays an important role in the global fight against corruption. The review helps us assess where we stand globally and what gaps need to be addressed. While being fully committed and active in fighting corruption at EU and global level, the European Union is in the process of assessing the full extent of the modifications of the Union’s competence with regard to all the matters governed by UNCAC after entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. One aspect that needs to be kept in mind is that the Convention is binding on all EU institutions, and therefore the scope of the UNCAC review would not be limited to the Commission but would extend to the other institutions as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 44, "date": "2018-06-14.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The debate is closed.Written statements (Article 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 45, "date": "2018-06-14.json", "name": "Laura FERRARA", "mepid": "124833", "text": "in writing. - I am pleased that this question has come to plenary, which reiterates what the European Parliament has already denounced with the resolution on the fight against corruption of 25 October 2016, of which I was rapporteur.

The doubt arises that the current leaders of the European institutions are not very interested in the issue.

According to various estimates, financial losses amount to EUR 120-990 billion per year. Traditionally, the Nordic countries have done well in various comparisons of corruption, but the risk of corruption in these countries should not be underestimated either. Structural hidden corruption and good brother networks based on counter-services in particular are problematic. In addition, too close relationships between politicians and civil servants in business and the associated revolving door phenomenon are harmful activities. Politically appointed appointments are also socially destructive forms of corruption where corruption is open. Such actions erode public confidence in the political system, which contributes to low turnout in the various elections. Uncertainties in election financing also increase the risk of corruption. Large monetary donations to parties and candidates are aimed at influencing the direction of politics and possibly even buying the desired decisions. For example, according to Finnish election financing legislation, monetary donations of up to EUR 1,499 can be made to a campaign of a European candidate without the need to state the name of the donor in the election financing declaration. In my view, this is in some way at odds with the Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament, which requires all gifts in excess of EUR 150 to be reported. Transparency of public authorities and disclosure of information are important in tackling corruption. Reporters of abuse must be effectively protected and have appropriate reporting channels to ensure anonymity.

We often talk about corruption in the use of Eurofunds, about corruption in public administration, there are even reports of corrupt behavior of top government officials. A few years ago, we in the EP plenary talked about the corruption that has affected sport, the sector that should be the most fair play. Corruption is all around us and we are used to many acts of corruption. It is therefore important for the Commission to report annually to the EP, the elected representatives of the EU population, on the state of corruption in the EU, but also on measures to eliminate it. Detecting individuals as well as organized criminal groups in illegally obtaining financial resources is not easy, but the cooperation of law enforcement authorities and mutual information is an opportunity to create such control mechanisms that would detect corruption and consistently punish corruption.

He was sentenced to 20 years in prison for alleged terrorism after protesting against the Russian occupation of Crimea. Salechard was one of the most famous symbols of the gulag before the war, under Josef Vissarionovič Stalin. It has remained so to this day and is proof that today's Kremlin is renewing the gulag over and over again. The dubious glory of the gulag continued after the war. In 1947, Stalin began building a railway in the Far North between the mouth of the Obu and the mouth of the Yenisei. This Salekhard gulag had the numbers 501 and 503. Thousands of people died here, the track was never completed. Even at the turn of the 2nd and 3rd millennium, Salekhard served the Kremlin. Hundreds of tortured Chechen freedom fighters disappeared in the Salekhard gulag in the early years of the 21st century. Today, no one knows how many Crimean Tatars have disappeared here. Sencov is on a hunger strike here for everyone who has done nothing wrong and yet been deprived of his liberty. For those who have been enslaved, abducted and tortured. Sencov and his fellow prisoners need our help. They need our attention. They need us to impose sanctions on the perpetrators of injustice, the representatives of the Russian Federation.

Oleg Sentsov is one of them.  Shortly after the illegal annexation, Oleg Sentsov was arrested in Crimea. After a trial which lacked all guarantees of fairness, and in which he was judged as a Russian citizen and denied the consular assistance of the Ukranian authorities despite clearly be in Ukrainian, Mr Sentsov was sentenced to 20 years in prison, accused of plotting terrorist acts for which the investigators could not find any evidence. As many Members have highlighted, he has been serving this prison sentence in remote regions of the Russian Federation, currently in Russia’s northernmost prison on the Yamal peninsula, often in solitary confinement. Exactly one month ago, he started a hunger strike to protest at the incarceration of all his fellow Ukranian political prisoners in Russia and demand their release. Oleg Sentsov’s case is no longer just a judicial or political one. It is now a matter of human compassion. His health is at risk of rapid deterioration. He should be immediately and unconditionally released on humanitarian grounds. The European Union has closely followed the situation of Mr Sentsov and fellow Ukranian prisoners. It has regularly urged Russia to release all of them, both those who are in Russia and those on the Crimean peninsula. Diplomats from the European Union delegation and Member States’ embassies in Moscow have been present at court hearings related to these cases and are in contact with the lawyers. In addition to the case of Mr Sentsov, we have often raised other cases – such as those of Olexandr Kolchenko, Stanislas Klykh and Mykola Karpyuk – in bilateral meetings with Russian representatives as well as in public statements, including in international forums such as the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation of Europe.  We are also following with concern the case of Ukranian journalist Roman Sushchenko who was sentenced on 4 June in Moscow to 12 years in prison for alleged acts of espionage in what appears to be another attack on the freedom of the press. Our statement on 25 May, focusing on Oleg Sentsov, Volodymyr Balukh, Server Mustafayev and Edem Smailov, reiterated that the European Union expects international human rights standards to be upheld on the Crimean peninsula and that all illegally detained Ukrainian citizens, in Russia and on the Crimean peninsula, should be released without delay. I would also like to recall President Tusk’s call to the G7 leaders last week to show their support for and solidarity with Oleg Sentsov. This is a message that we will continue to repeat to the Russian authorities.

Since 2011 and the crushing of popular protests with the help of the Saudi and Emirati armies, the country has been steeped in repression and a growing denial of human rights. The first victims are human rights defenders, often arrested and sentenced on the basis of confessions obtained under torture. Many are banned from traveling, there are numerous disqualifications and more and more civil trials are being brought before military courts. The UN and the big NGOs also denounce the harassment of the Shiite population, which constitutes, let us remember, the majority of the population. Accused - of course, as others here accuse us - of playing into the hands of the big Iranian neighbor. The fight against terrorism is on the safe side and the National Security Agency has almost a free hand to carry out arrests and interrogations in this context. After a 7-year moratorium, executions have effectively resumed and death sentences are increasing. Nabil Rajab has become a symbol of this struggle for human rights. He was due for release this month after serving a new 2-year sentence in appalling prison conditions, but has just been sentenced to an additional 5 years in prison. Commissioner, I would like to speak here for Adam, his 21-year-old son, who is concerned about his father's deteriorating health and would like one of our ambassadors to visit him. I ask you to make yourself the spokesperson for this request. The dano-Bahraini citizen Abdulhadi al-Khawaja has also been detained since April 2011, sentenced to life imprisonment for peaceful activities, or the blogger Abduljalil al-Singace, and there are many others. All of this in itself would bode badly for the upcoming elections slated for next October, when the two main opposition parties have been dissolved, Al Wefaq, the main Shiite party, and Waad, the secular party. But their members have even just been banned from running for office, like any citizen convicted of crimes.

According to the documents sent to us, in fact, in the country there would be nothing more than a lively climate of political and cultural debate, an independent and transparent judicial system and adequate human rights protection mechanisms, and Nabeel Rajab would be fine and rightly undergoing a trial , obviously a process with all the necessary guarantees. An interesting picture, too bad it does not correspond to reality, dear colleagues, a reality that is quite different and is constantly worsening. The al-Wefaq and Waad opposition groups have been dissolved and their members will be barred from participating in the elections. Human rights defenders have been arrested, tortured and their citizenship stripped, and independent newspapers are closed. Nabeel Rajab has lost his lawsuit appeal and will go to jail for tweets. You have understood correctly, colleagues, for tweets in 2018. I am saddened to see that some groups in Parliament seem to share more the views of the Bahraini authorities and have presented an alternative resolution that is much softer than it should.

While in the past we have been encouraged by progress made, recently our worries have increased with the shrinking of political space in the country. As a result, we have sought to engage Bahrain in a comprehensive dialogue on human rights. This is why we are working hard to establish an informal human rights dialogue, with the third meeting taking place on 15 May in Manama. We have strongly supported the request of the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights to visit Bahrain, and we hope that the authorities will soon give their agreement to permit the visit to go ahead. 2018 is a particularly important year because of the upcoming parliamentary elections this autumn, but unfortunately the adoption on 11 June of an amendment to the electoral law, which bans opposition members from running in elections, is not a step in the right direction. Freedom of expression and association, the right to a fair trial and respect for human rights defenders are among the points which we stress in our contact with Bahrain.  The specific case of Nabeel Rajab has become symbolic of the difficulties being experienced by human rights defenders and by whoever expresses political dissent in Bahrain. This is a case on which the High Representative / Vice—President has repeatedly spoken publicly, including very recently, on 6 June, in reaction to the news that the Bahrain Court of Appeal had upheld a five-year prison sentence against Mr Rajab for comments posted on social media. We call on Bahrain to grant Mr Rajab’s release, including on humanitarian grounds, given the reported deterioration of his health. The European Union will continue to use all available means to further address the human rights situation in Bahrain and hopes that Bahrain will find again the path of dialogue and reconciliation, which it had started to follow so well at the end of 2011 in line with the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry. The European Union remains supportive of Bahrain’s long—term stability and is convinced that it can only be sustained if peaceful political grievances can be expressed freely. We have consistently encouraged all parties to move forward with democratic reforms in a peaceful and constructive manner. Finally, regarding Ms Gill’s question, I would like to say that targeted measures are an essential tool of the European Union’s common foreign and security policy and are used by the European Union as part of an integrated and comprehensive policy approach involving political dialogue, complementary efforts and the use of other instruments at its disposal. The European Union continues to have dialogue with the Bahraini authorities in a frank manner, including on human rights. The European Union will continue to closely follow the human rights situation on the ground, and on that basis, it will decide on possible measures.

In February, we MEPs in the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp gained a realistic impression of the efforts of international aid organizations to provide the Rohingya refugees or displaced persons with essentials. It quickly became clear to us that the demand was significantly higher. The situation is particularly difficult for children, as there is a lack of access to adequate psychological and medical care, as well as access to education and protection from exploitation. The international community urgently needs to make funds available for humanitarian aid, especially in view of the approaching monsoons. The Rohingya live in this dire situation because they have been displaced by extreme violence. The impunity of those responsible must come to an end, also in order to make a return of the Rohingya to Myanmar possible again in the long term.

On the contrary: the situation in the world's largest refugee camp has worsened with the onset of the monsoons. The first fatalities are already to be mourned in Bangladesh. People have also died in the Rohingya refugee camps. Landslides have destroyed the already few sanitary facilities and the drinking water supply, and the meager dwellings have been washed down the hills. The outbreak of epidemics threatens. The worst hit again is the weakest: the children who have now been virtually without schooling for a year and are threatened by abuse and human trafficking. The international community must deliver on its aid pledges for the refugees. At the same time, however, the pressure on the military rulers in Myanmar in particular must be increased, including through sanctions against some of their representatives, so that they declare their willingness to resolve the conflict. China, which has great influence over the military in Myanmar, should be acted upon to help solve the problem. The situation has been exacerbated by the fact that civil war has broken out again in Shan and Kachin states in Myanmar.

The European Union response to this crisis has consisted of five main components. First, immediate and unconditional humanitarian assistance to all displaced persons. Second, condemnation of all forms of violence. Third, continuous constructive engagement with the civilian Government of Myanmar on the basis of an ambitious development agenda, including with a view to addressing the root causes of conflict in accordance with the Annan report. Fourth, the promotion of conditions allowing the eventual voluntary and dignified return of displaced persons to their homes in Rakhine State in safety. And fifth, exploring assistance which goes beyond short-term aid. In all of this, due account has been taken of the relevant resolutions adopted by the European Parliament on the Rohingya crisis. This applies firstly in respect of action on the political front. As you know, the European Union has co-sponsored UN Human Rights Council resolutions to promote accountability and to invite Myanmar to cooperate with a UN fact-finding mission. We regret that Myanmar is not cooperating with this fact-finding mission. There is also continuing cooperation with the UN Special Rapporteur Ms Lee. In April 2018, in the light of the disproportionate use of force by the Myanmar army, the European Union adopted a strengthened arms embargo and put in place a framework for targeted restricted measures against Myanmar military officers. This being said, let me attend to the major issues of today’s debate: the situation of the Rohingya refugees and, in particular, the plight of children. As regards humanitarian and development aid, the European Union co-hosted – and pledged the highest contribution among all the donors at – the United Nations pledging conference on 23 October 2017. Our dialogue with Bangladesh authorities and the United Nations is constant in an effort to address the tremendous challenges faced by Bangladesh in welcoming the refugees generously. The monsoon season, which has just started, brings additional challenges and we are increasing our humanitarian aid in Bangladesh and continuing to provide aid in Rakhine State, but lack of access remains a key problem. Given the fact that the refugees’ return process will be difficult and long, and that the conditions for voluntary and safe return to the Rakhine State are not yet in place, the European Union and the international donor community must be prepared to work further on their humanitarian and development nexus, both for the refugees and for the 11 host communities in Bangladesh. Our humanitarian aid and development system does not specifically focus on children but, given the very high number of children and women in the camps, our aid actually does focus on these vulnerable groups of the refugee population. Let me highlight a couple of specific objectives that we are currently trying to achieve in cooperation with the Bangladesh Government and relevant stakeholders in Cox’s Bazar. The registration of newborn Rohingya babies should be pursued, as per the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Bangladesh and the UNCHR.

Sadly, our usual solution is a collective penalty but in Mobility Package I we have, together, been able to find solutions to the biggest social and unfair competition problems, without a huge bureaucratic burden and without major collective penalties and still keeping a balance in the internal market. Cabotage caused problems inside Member States in national transport. Now, we are limiting it to two days per Member State and it will be posting from day one. Nomadic driving: drivers have a new right to go back home by the end of a maximum of three weeks. We are ending driver misuse and letter box companies. For the first time, common strong enforcement is possible by using the latest technology available. If the national transport is posting from day one, colleagues voting against can go back home and tell drivers that in the future they might not drive for their national salaries anymore. Instead, they could be paid a final country destination minimum wage.  This is a two—way street. You need to understand what it means for the universally applicable collective agreements if you oppose the mandate. Minimum wages might become the new norm and you should all be aware of that. Currently, we do not have a common EU minimum wage level in transport and the posting of the Drivers Directive is not the right tool to do that. That is totally another discussion.

However, nowadays we face several obstacles to cultural access and participation. There are not only structural and financial barriers to access, but also social and digital barriers, and by far the most important problem of educational barriers. To overcome these hurdles it is necessary to develop firstly public funding, then sustainable and long-term cultural tourism policy, then coordination of national cultural policies (I have to say), and digital education.

The United Nations Committee against Torture has denounced Israel's use of torture and illegal and abusive technologies during interrogations by Israeli police and prison staff; Moreover, the Israeli Constitutional Court had also raised this question. However, the so-called Lawtrain project, which receives European funding of more than 5 million euros, involves the Israeli ministry of public security, which manages prisons and decides on entry and exit from the territory. This project aims to improve police interrogation techniques. This therefore places us, as we choose, in illegality or in an intolerable complicity. This is the analysis of the Portuguese ministry and the Belgian University Leuven, which withdrew from the project. We must now get out of the chiaroscuro veil that hides what, in research, is civilian and what is military, when it is known that so-called civilian applications include areas related to security, the national police, border guards, cybersecurity or airport security. There is a need to clarify the role of several Israeli companies that benefit from the funding, such as Mellanox, which is experimenting with the occupation, Elbit Systems, one of Israel's largest arms factories making banned cluster bombs, or IsraTeam, client of the Israeli army. On the other hand, the Union's financial regulations require applicants to be excluded from all European funding - I quote - \"if it has been established by a final judgment or a final administrative decision that the economic operator has committed a serious professional misconduct, by having violated applicable legislative or regulatory provisions or the ethical standards of the profession to which he belongs ”; I am referring here to Article 106, paragraph 1. However, the Israeli Ministry of Public Security, which controls the prisons, carries out the deportation and detention of Palestinian prisoners on Israeli territory, therefore outside the territories of the Occupied Palestine, in violation of Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, yet ratified by Israel in 1951. We ask the European Commission to assess the serious and repeated breaches by the Israeli Ministry of Security of the provisions of Article 106 of the financial regulations of the European Union, of the International Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and of the Fourth Convention of Geneva, before continuing this project.

It certainly has its own big scientific and technical potential, and our program may play a secondary role in the development of the Israeli knowledge-based industry. But for other countries in the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP), this program may be essential. It can help to develop life-saving technologies and substances that the countries of the southern Mediterranean especially need. I am happy that Horizon was included in November 2017 as one of the parts of the ‘ENP plus’ strategy. This will allow us to extend the areas where the interests of the EU and those of the ENP countries overlap. In the case of Israel, this program enables it to, firstly, integrate with the European academic research community; secondly, cooperate with key players in Europe; and thirdly, have access to research infrastructure and attention in order to have an influence on European norms. This is very attractive for our neighbors and profitable to us. Certainly I find it one of the best successes of the EU’s normative power. We cooperate with our neighbors and allow them to have a say in development inside the EU. This is a unique situation. No other power in the world does it. I will continue in Latvian, the language of my country. Sometimes we often hear criticism of Israel, which was also mentioned by the honorable author of the question, but in reality Israel is one of the countries that may not be geographically closest to the European Union, but closest to us in terms of our values. Because there is and Israel is based on the same democratic values ​​that the European Union is based on. I cannot agree that human rights violations are as serious as the author mentioned, especially with regard to prisoners. What I mean by that is that Israel is a country where human rights issues are very carefully respected. However, given the conflict that has been going on for so long in modern history, Israel is actually using our European system to respect human rights. Sometimes, when it comes to my political group, the Socialists and Democrats, we get the impression that we have a 'pro-Palestinian' position. This is partly a fact, because we are actively cooperating with the Palestinian parties, but on the other hand, I would like to say that we very much appreciate what Israel is doing, especially - I will repeat it again and again - in the field of human rights. I can mention that Arabic also has the status of an official language in Israel. This is important when it comes to my country, Latvia, where historically many national minorities live. And the example of Israel, not only when it comes to Horizon 2020, but in general, judging by the level of democracy in Israel, we can learn a lot from the state system, from the level of democracy, from the parliamentary democracy that is in Israel. We need to take this background into account when we talk about further cooperation, and in particular in the area of ​​neighborhood policy. To sum up, I would like to say that we have great prospects for cooperation with Israel, and not just in this area. Israel is a country with a long enough tradition of democracy and enough luggage that Israel has piled up in terms of democracy and human rights.

I regret there is no commissioner. This is an important debate, Israel is our important partner, it is the leader when it comes to innovation in the world, according to Bloomberg, it is in the first place, and the Commissioner should be here. I understand traffic jams, but they are predictable in Strasbourg. Let us leave the commissioner. I have such an impression (and I have been in the European Parliament for fourteen years) that there is a certain fashion here among some circles. The fashion is to criticize Israel, often in isolation from certain facts. I believe that you need to have a dialogue with Israel. You can have different opinions - and you have to have different opinions sometimes - but let's be objective. We are talking about certain regulations that are beneficial to the European Union and also to the area of ​​European innovation and technology. This is a benefit. On the issue of human rights, let me be very honest: it seems to me that a dozen or so years ago Israel had the same policy as it does today, and then it was not so criticized, also here in the European Parliament, and is now often criticized very harshly. . Has anything changed in the European Union during this time? I think so, but I have the impression that it is not Israel that has changed, but that the European Union is changing in terms of its attitude towards Israel. And I don't know if this is a positive change. I think not. We are talking about human rights in Israel here, and that's good. Of course, we can talk about anything. However, I would like to point out that the police in Israel are under judicial supervision, it is not a state within a state. It is worth talking about it, it is worth knowing about it, and not presenting a certain - as it seems to me - one-sided narrative or vision of this situation. In closing, I appeal to us to exercise moderation and common sense here, and to continue these relations. This is good for our side, for the EU side. And it is very important.

I think we need to consider a lot of things before we make our final decisions, because one thing is for sure - I am not thrilled with everything that the Israeli government is doing, to be completely clear. On the other hand, it is certain that we cannot go into a break-up abruptly and in this way as suggested. I agree and want and ask the commission to review all the regulations, whether all the decisions made are based on our regulations that we have made ourselves; never enough control, in fact - let's review everything once again, whether we are doing everything right, but I am not in favor of ending the cooperation in this way and with the arguments presented here. I think that we could do more damage to ourselves, precisely because of the fact that there is excellent scientific cooperation between universities, between scientists, that there is also excellent economic cooperation, we have to talk about it very clearly and openly. So I believe that setting things up like this is not the solution. The solution is certainly to talk to the Israeli government, to politicians in Israel, to warn them of those things that we do not like, but we cannot escape the fact that Israel is not a state governed by the rule of law, that it does not respect human rights, so there are extremists here. , in this Parliament, if you will.

A fault against science: Israel, a small country in size, the only democracy in its region, has succeeded in developing brilliantly in a hostile environment. As tech mogul Elon Musk recently said, Israel has moved beyond a \"start-up nation\" to become a true technological powerhouse on par with the United States. This desire to survive, to innovate and to master its destiny is an example for Europeans, for our States and an opportunity for our researchers and our companies. By ideology, would we like to deprive them of it? You don't stop scientific progress with dark good feelings. This obscurantism which leads us to refuse scientific cooperation which goes in the direction of our interests. Is it because Israel is a successful example of technology and civil-military synergies? Knowing that 80% of civilian innovations come from defense - the RDS system, station search, the internet, ABS - I could name a whole host of technologies that come solely from defense. We would also be committing a fault against peace. By isolating Israel and taking up the rhetoric of the Palestinian radicals, we will not serve peace. We would go along with Palestinian sectarian interests and push them to radicalize. Do we have these same qualms when it comes to the funds allocated by the European Union to the Palestinian Authority, which are also used, it must be said, to manufacture bombs and missiles against Israel? How can we draw the parallel between Israel and apartheid South Africa? We would be committing a third fault against the Member States. Need I remind you that it is not for Europe to tell us with whom the states should cooperate, with what projects? Europe would once again step out of its role of European coordination to take on skills that it does not have, that do not belong to it. The Union is a coup, too often, to weaken member states. Moreover, by playing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we risk stoking the fire in the suburbs of our member states with high Muslim immigration, where anti-Zionism is often the mask of anti-Semitism and hatred of our countries of the world. 'Home. Is it because Israel is such a hated model of a nation-state in this place that we allow ourselves to teach it lessons?
