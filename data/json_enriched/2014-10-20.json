It is a sneaky debt that is emerging and we cannot alter the authority of the European Union by allowing unpaid debts to progress.

The recent heavy floods which have hit northern Italy and claimed at least three lives, causing several million euros' worth of damage, show once again the importance of sustainable investment in better preparedness against disasters. I would like to focus on three main points. First of all, natural disasters have become more frequent and more intense over recent decades, not only globally but also in Europe. Urbanisation, population growth and environmental degradation have very much contributed to this trend. It is estimated that average annual losses over the last decade have risen to EUR 200 billion, with floods accounting for 35% of all losses. If we take last year’s floods in Central Europe alone, these are estimated to have cost EUR 17 billion, topping the list of the costliest natural disasters in 2013. This spring, the floods in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Bulgaria also caused widespread devastation and left more than one hundred people dead and half a million people homeless. Fortunately, the damage caused by the current floods in northern Italy and southern France is not on the same scale, but still reflects the same trend. This brings me to my second point. What is the European Union doing to better manage natural disasters? Natural hazards such as floods cannot be prevented, but the number of lives they take and the damage they cause can be greatly reduced through better preparation and protection. Another major benefit, investment in prevention, is cost-effective. On average, for instance, every euro spent on prevention saves between four and seven euros that would have been spent once a disaster has hit.  So the Commission is implementing the approach across various policy areas, including civil protection, the environment and also regional policy and research and development. The most visible piece of EU legislation relating to flood management is certainly the Floods Directive, which has been in force since 2007 and which establishes a framework for the assessment and management of flood risks. Flood risk management plans focusing on prevention, protection and preparedness should set the objectives and include the measures to achieve flood risk reduction.  Thanks to the support of Parliament, we also have a new mechanism for disaster-proofing the major infrastructure projects covered under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. There are also provisions to disaster-proof new investments funded by the EU’s structural funds. Flood prevention is actually receiving the bulk of available regional policy funds earmarked for risk prevention. For instance, for the 2007-2013 period, funding made available to Member States to invest in risk prevention, including against floods – so this is risk prevention in its entirety but it includes floods as well – in risk management and in climate change adaptation amounted to around EUR 60.5 billion. Now the first estimates for the new 2014-2020 period show that this sum would increase to EUR 78 billion. Related projects include maintaining or developing flood plains such as along the Tisza river in Hungary; cross-border and transnational cooperation on flood prevention; the deployment of early warning systems, as well as support to civil protection. A concrete example of support is the EU Strategy for the Danube Region, supporting projects to develop a common risk assessment methodology for the region.  We have also come a very long way in the area of civil protection, which showed its benefits also during the recent Italian floods – more about this in a moment. And, as of this year, we have our new civil protection legislation in place, with a very strong focus on preparedness and prevention, building up a voluntary pool of disaster response capacities, better response planning, a training network and reinforced cooperation among authorities in the field of training and exercises. Of course, these are the things which have already been done. What else can be done? As regards the floods in northern Italy, since I was referring to the civil protection mechanism, I must say that the Italian authorities saw no need to activate the EU civil protection mechanism, but on 16 October requested activation of the EU Copernicus emergency mapping system.  What else can be done? I think, in conclusion, we also need to engage more closely with industry. We need to put disaster management firmly on the agenda of EU finance ministers because it is cost-effective. By investing euros in prevention, we save much more when disasters actually happen. Let me conclude by stressing that we are now equipped with the tools not to completely prevent, but to mitigate and manage disasters, including floods.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 24, "date": "2014-10-20.json", "name": "Lambert van NISTELROOIJ", "mepid": "28165", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for your summary introduction.  In addition, just before the elections, we adapted the Solidarity Fund, set up the regulation in such a way that we can intervene more quickly in areas where things are going wrong. This is indeed true for northern Italy, as well as for the south of France. I do expect them to be above that limit. The criteria are all set. In any case, this is a very clear signal to the citizens. But there's actually more. You also indicate it, and that is also the title of today's debate. In Genoa, for example, it seems that the drain of the rivers, the capacity, was simply not sufficient. You have to respond very well to things that can happen. I'm Dutch. We are largely below sea level and we know what is happening. I therefore feel that prevention has not been sufficiently on the agenda in practice and that we must now contribute with funds, but that it is not being picked up politically enough. We can indeed engage with the Regional Development Fund – that is to make these ecosystems more restful – but local priorities must be set. And if the water cannot go away, as was the case in Genoa, then the citizens and the companies will end up being the victims.

Every year we spend a thousand million euros on alluvial damage, but only one hundred to prevent it. It is an emergency, as the Commissioner said, which affects almost the whole of Europe. There are many causes: just think of climate change, cementification and the abandonment of the countryside. We need a cultural and political revolution to mitigate the risks, although we have to tell the truth: we will have to learn to live with it in part, because unfortunately there is no such thing as zero risk.  Europe can and must respond effectively, but we need a more cross-cutting approach, because in several territories, for example, aid to small farmers is both combating non-health and is just one example.

The same applies to those affected by the devastating floods that hit Attica in February 2013, when we mourned one of our dead fellow citizens. However, in addition to relieving those affected and repairing damage to households and infrastructure, there should be a modern flood defence policy in all Member States and the European Union should finance the construction of flood defences so that both urban centres and the countryside do not suffer irreparable damage.  Indeed, where the devastating effects of floods acquire cross-border characteristics, such as the constant overflow of the Evros River due to the lack of flood defences in Bulgaria, there should be cooperation between the Commission services with Greece and Bulgaria to finance these projects.

In this context, I would like to warn the European Parliament and the European public that I am convinced that we need to make serious progress so that we can help countries that do not have sufficiently established cross-border cooperation and who still some way resent cooperation.  In this case we had a situation where the damages amounted to hundreds of millions of euros, and maybe billions of euros, we had the loss of human lives - dozens of people died or disappeared. The tragedies are really great, for the citizens, for their property and for their general farming, especially tomorrow, since the fields have also suffered enormous damage.

Structural prevention measures are needed, depreitated in recent years, especially in cities due to the advance of concrete and soil waterproofing. The correction of risk-inducing situations and the implementation of effective drainage plans are two examples.  All this requires huge but indispensable public investments.

As Greens, we call for three elements of a responsible flood policy. First there needs to be adequate investment in the infrastructure that prevents flooding, and we must not allow austerity cuts to increase the risk as our communities become inundated. We also need to take a whole-catchment approach and consider how our farming practices have reduced the land’s ability to absorb rainfall for longer before it drains into the river. Land management that involves maintaining hedges and trees using organic methods that reduce soil run-off should be prioritised in the CAP subsidiary scheme.

Let me first make it clear: the Solidarity Fund exists to pay compensation for damage after the fact. Under the current legal framework, the Solidarity Fund cannot be used to prevent something; it can only be used ex-post facto, and even then it has to be activated by an application from the country concerned. As to the question: is it true that different funds have been allocated to different countries? There is no pre-allocation of funds. It depends on the type of disaster; it depends on the type of damage. For instance, one of the conditions is that the damage must exceed 0.6% of the region’s GDP: in the case of Liguria, for example, that means damage in excess of EUR 660 million. Then, assistance is dependent on proof of the damage. There are so many factors which can differ from one country to another that I cannot give a straight answer except by enunciating the main principles. To take Italy, for example: so far there has been no application by Italy to activate the funds, but once that happens and once it is determined that the damage exceeds 0.6% of the GDP of Liguria then, of course, the Solidarity Fund will pay for part of the damage. I must add, however, that the compromise struck by the European Council in February this year has reduced the maximum annual allocation from the Solidarity Fund from EUR 1 billion to EUR 500 million: a 50% decrease. So no one can perform miracles – one can only do, perhaps, something approaching the impossible with the funds available. I had a question from Ms Moi, if I remember rightly, about allegations of irregularities in the use of the funds, and whether the Commission checks their use. Of course we check their use: there are a number of financial regulations which have to be followed and, more than once, when it has turned out that funds were used for the wrong purpose, or for purposes other than that for which they were allocated, a request has been made for the recovery and collection of those funds. As regards prevention – and I made it clear in my statement how cost effective prevention is – there is no specific fund in the European Union just for floods. There are the structural funds, on which all the Member States can draw, and particularly those states which are liable to natural disasters. I mention Italy, in particular, because Italy has experience of volcanic eruptions, mud slides, floods and earthquakes, so it is a country with one of the best-developed civil protection systems. Because of the realities on the ground, Italy can use the structural funds for purposes of prevention. I would like to finish by saying that funds are important, and government intervention is important, but I was impressed recently by seeing how volunteers – the so-called angeli del fango – also gave their assistance in Genoa. We had seen them before: I was still young but I remember them in 1966-1967 at the time of the floods in Florence. Even then they were called the angeli del fango, which literally translates as ‘the mud angels’. The Commission will continue its emphasis on coordinating the efforts of Member States for prevention. That is why we have the Floods Directive which, although it is not a financial instrument in itself, is a legal instrument for coordination and cooperation between Member States in response to natural disasters of this kind.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 44, "date": "2014-10-20.json", "name": "Olli REHN", "mepid": "2119", "text": "   The debate is closed.

In addition to several Member States, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were devastated by the floods of the century. Climate change and the vagraciousness of the weather have made floods and other disasters more frequent. Humanity's frivolity in terms of environmental protection seems to have perpetuated and systematicised these situations. This also means that the scope and cost of prevention, protection and resolution are perpetuating and appearing permanently in member states' budgets, in most cases further complicating the already sensitive budgetary balance. The EU Solidarity Fund has faced major challenges in recent years, in particular the scarcity of funds, but also the constant criticism of the criteria for authorize the use of the fund. Despite the Commission's best efforts, the procedure is still too complex and the response time is too slow. Humanity's behaviour is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, so the destruction of the environment will continue, with all its harmful consequences.

Meanwhile, the UK Government has cut the budget of our Environment Agency, thereby significantly straining its ability to undertake decent flood risk management.

I know how much havoc the rivers are wreaking havoc on, and I understand the situation of the people affected by this disaster. These experiences point to several important problems. Firstly, the creation of flood infrastructure requires the regulation of rivers and often the destruction of a unique natural environment. In Poland, we often face a dilemma: to protect our belongings or to protect endangered species, which often delays the necessary investments for many years to come.  Secondly, effective flood control requires close cooperation between neighbouring countries. In Europe, very rarely rivers are completely within the borders of one country. Therefore, the action of one country may improve or aggravate the situation in another. The flood risk management plans required by the Floods Directive have not yet been prepared, and this implementation will show whether we can work together effectively.

I was here just less than five weeks ago, on 17 September, and in this short period of time the number of cases has almost doubled. There were 4 963 people sick then, and there are now 9 191. Similarly, the number of people who have lost their lives has almost doubled, from 2 453 to 4 546. Unfortunately, a very high number of health professionals are affected, with 427 doctors and nurses sick and, of those, 230 have lost their lives trying to save the lives of others. If we do not act in a very determined manner, by mid-December we might already have 10 000 cases per week – in other words as many in one week as have been accumulated since 21 March when the epidemic started. The longer the epidemic lasts, not only do more people die, but it is hugely destructive for the economies of the affected countries. The World Bank predicts that it would cost EUR 7.5 billion in losses this year and up to EUR 25 billion – basically wiping out the economies of the countries – in 2015.  But there is also some good news. Senegal and – as of today – Nigeria are Ebola-free. Regarding the case we had in Spain – the first case of infection by Ebola within Europe – we had good news that the nurse may be on the road to recovery. Most importantly, since I was last here international attention and action have surged, including from us in the European Union. We have more than doubled funding to fight Ebola. When I was last here it stood at EUR 227 million. Today it is over EUR 500 million, and more will be coming in pledges in the days to come. Of this, EUR 180 million is from the Commission, which is EUR 30 million more than last time around.  We have addressed a very serious constraint making it harder for more people to go there – and as Europeans we should be proud because there are hundreds of volunteers, doctors and nurses, who want to be trained and sent to West Africa. But to do so they expect medical evacuation. We now have in the Commission a contract for medical evacuation, and Member States such as the UK, Germany, and Italy are also going to join. I am very proud of the efforts of the UK and France in Sierra Leone and in Guinea, as well as Germany and others that are stepping up – not just funding, but bringing teams and beds so we can fight Ebola together. Last, but not least, we have significantly increased our delivery of in-kind assistance – protective gear, equipment. Three planes are leaving within a week to help UNICEF have the necessary equipment and in-kind assistance in the field.

What have we done and what more should we do?  First of all, as regards what we have done, and here I am referring to the internal dimension, because the European Commissioner for Health is of course responsible for what happens as regards health on European territory now.  A network of high-security laboratories has been activated to ensure that all Member States can use them to diagnose Ebola. We have mapped all – by ‘we’, I mean the Health Security Committee which was recently established for cross-border health threats – we have mapped all the health facilities in the European Union which are equipped to treat Ebola patients. We have drawn up together, within the Health Security Committee, joint information for travellers, joint messages and joint criteria to diagnose Ebola. We provide independent scientific assessment and guidance to the Member States through the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Only last Thursday we had an informal meeting of health ministers – about 22 health ministers attended – where it was agreed to strengthen medical screening at exit points in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and to coordinate national measures on entry screening. I am saying this because different countries have different views on entry screening. But, as regards exit screening, we decided to strengthen it and to that end, in collaboration with the WHO, the Commission will in the next few days audit exit screening in those countries and strengthen such screening systems as necessary.  The Member States have agreed to step up awarenes-raising campaigns at EU entry points, and we shall establish a network of volunteer clinicians with experience in treating Ebola patients in Europe as an infection control measure. I am pleased to inform Parliament that the Research and Innovation Commissioner, under Horizon 2020, will approve 25 million euros for research on candidate vaccines.

Towards the end of my training as a doctor, I worked for a time in a crisis area – in Central America. I can feel a little like my fellow Members, the medical staff as a whole and, above all, those affected. But i believe that we have all not yet experienced something like this, which is happening in West Africa, and it is difficult for us to put ourselves in the situation of those affected. I have huge respect for doctors, nurses and others who are involved there, putting their own lives at risk much more than we usually know from other situations. Even if we cannot then rule out a 100% risk to the people of Europe, I think it is very important that we offer our help to the people who help when they infect themselves, and that they are then also treated in our efficient medical centres in Europe. You have to minimize the risk, but you can't rule it out 100%. Thank you to the Commission for everything they have done. Keep going! Keep fighting! Finally, a thought.

As Chair of the Committee on Development, I will limit myself to the issues in West Africa and leave the issues concerning Europe to my colleagues from the Committee on the Environment. Commissioner Georgieva, you have talked about efforts having been stepped up since we last met in September here in the plenary, and that is good, but you have also given us some dreadful figures. It is good that you met today as a council and it is good that we have the pledges, but what worries me is that the big NGOs on the ground, like MSF, Oxfam and UNICEF, are telling me that they are not feeling that effort on the ground – that we are talking about it and pledging money but that nothing is changing for them. My question is: when will this change? Have you got a grid with all these commitments? Is there a list of when the medical facilities are going to open? Who is going to staff them? Do we know which countries have pledged which doctors and healthcare professionals? On medevac, we keep hearing good news from the Commission, but healthcare professionals tell me that it is not happening on the ground. If you have that information, could you share it with Parliament, as it is extremely important. We have a window until Christmas, as you have said. We do not want 10 000 cases a week. We have got to get this short-term crisis under control and then look at the lessons to be learned, and that is what the Committee on Development will be doing, under the guidance of Mr Goerens. Finally, I would just like to thank Commissioner Borg, on what is probably his last appearance here in plenary, for all the work he has done on health over many, many years.

So far the number of cases beyond West Africa has been limited and it is extremely important for strict EU-wide measures to be adopted to ensure that this remains the case. The introduction of screening processes at EU airports and border control points is a vital step and the EU must therefore do more to encourage all Member States to follow the leading examples set by France and the United Kingdom in this regard. Protecting our own shores alone, however, is insufficient and more must be done to support efforts, including exit screening in West Africa itself. Nigeria is a clear success story to be studied, as it has managed to contain the virus after its first known case. This success was largely thanks to the efficient process of contact-tracing that was implemented: a process which made it possible for over 800 known contacts of the patient to be identified, traced and tested. Such work requires relatively strong institutions, efficient cooperation between them and the resources to make that happen. These are all things that, sadly, West Africa is largely lacking and it is an area where the EU can be of assistance. As a British doctor, I am proud that the British Royal Navy is en route to the region as we speak, taking medical equipment, personnel and helicopters by way of assistance. With just under 200 doctors and around 2 000 nurses in Sierra Leone and Liberia combined – the two countries that is – the support from the medical contingent within that mission will be a great asset. With this in mind it is interesting to note that there are currently 108 nurses from Sierra Leone working in the British National Health Service and it is at times like this that we see the difficulties that countries suffering from so-called medical brain drain can face.

Mr President, if we want to defeat Ebola, we must be faster than the virus and we must attack it at the root. In Africa, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea. How many deaths will it take in Europe for things to move a little more at member level?  We must realize that the protection of our populations must be done on the front line, that is, in the aforementioned countries. There's no point in hiding behind walls. In Liberia, where the health system is practically on the ground, but not only, it is important to do two things.  First, we need extra beds, additional doctors, additional coaching staff, transportation logic and money. Because medical personnel are too often lacking, they have to come from elsewhere. Hats off to Cuba, which has just sent 130 doctors to the region. The same is true for the United States, which has committed to installing 3,400 beds in the region by the end of the year. They have already reached halfway, but there is still a lot of medical staff. In Europe, many doctors are still reluctant to volunteer to travel to the region where the virus is prevalent because, for weeks and weeks, there has been no hope of repatriation for those infected. It is essential to resolve this problem in the immediate future. We no longer want to hear pretexts, falsehoods, excuses of all kinds to mask the notorious inability of the 28 Member States to coordinate their actions in this area. Secondly, we must fight against the \"crisis in the crisis\", as Doctors Without Borders calls it, that is, to ensure that patients not yet infected with the virus can be treated outside isolation centres. There is no inevitability in all of this. As the Commissioner has just pointed out, Senegal and Nigeria have become free of the virus.  I have just telephoned Jean-Claude Juncker to invite him to make the fight against Ebola his priority. There are so many things to coordinate, so many obstacles to overcome before you can formulate a response to the challenge. In short, the Union needs a major programme. Let me remind you, before concluding, that David Cameron has just said that Europe needs an additional EUR 1 billion to finance the Union's efforts. Let us have the courage to support this claim and ensure that Europe can now be able to finance European actions. This time, it is not the United Kingdom that should play the role of the preventer of going round in circles.

Despite the early alarms from non-governmental associations, in particular Médecins sans Frontières, international institutions have wasted valuable time confining the spread and saving thousands of lives. The imperative now is to save lives, in the countries most severely affected, and to prevent the development of a pandemic, but a separate reflection deserves something that has been little discussed, namely the possible causes of the resurgence of the viral attack. Frugivorous bats belonging to the Pteroptide family are known to be healthy carriers of the virus. These harmless mammals usually live in less accessible areas of forests, but their deadly host can easily switch to other animals that feed on fruits already bitten by bats or animals themselves. Yet the rapid spread of the virus has another cause- massive deforestation.

If the Ebola epidemic is not brought under control there, then our preventive measures in Europe will not be enough either. So we have to act on the ground and do it more vigorously and decisively than before. I appreciate Commissioner Georgieva's timely response back in March this year, but Member States need to do more. Indeed, it must not happen again that when one nurse from Europe becomes ill, no Member State is able to send a special plane for her, but we must wait for others to do so.

Now is the time to do it. What specifically have we been doing in the last weeks? First, on medical evacuation: we have a contract with three commercial providers, two for the so-called dry cases and one for the so-called wet cases. We can evacuate three international workers per week. Clearly, if we have a surge of medical capacity, this is not going to be enough, and for that reason we are doing two more things. One, we are working with the Member States to have a coordinated pool, with the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy already identifying capacity (by the way, Germany is refurbishing a plane specifically for that right now, and other countries like Luxembourg and France are likely to also join). So our pool of predictable medical evacuation capacity will be based on more than just the Commission’s three a week, and that is what we would be delivering for the safety of health workers. Secondly, we are working to have, in the countries affected, high-quality medical care. The UK in Sierra Leone, France in Guinea and the United States in Liberia are already setting up medical capabilities. The UK told us to guarantee 4 000 workers; in other words, they would have a bed proportionate to risk to 4 000 international workers, and similar proportions are being built in Liberia and in Guinea. We are also very specifically identifying and delivering an increase of bed capacity as well as calibrating training for the volunteers who would like to go. Even military personnel which the UK is deploying have to go to very specific training to be sure that they can face the risks and not cause more trouble than they are bringing down, and this is a very massive operation. Our contribution from the Commission is both in terms of coordinating and providing in-kind assistance on a very massive scale, and I know people say: where is it? But ask UNICEF and they will tell you where it is. Actually only one point I would respectfully disagree on is with everybody who says: what you are in the Commission doing? This started on 21 March. We were the first – ask UNICEF about it – to fund actions against Ebola. For months and months we were trying to get attention drawn to this crisis, but it became visible only when it showed up on the Six o’Clock News. So my plea as outgoing Commissioner is: listen to the voices of the humanitarian community in crises, because we are like the canary in the mind. We smell trouble before the rest of the world gets to see it. Finally, I very much support everybody who spoke about root causes of this problem. Why is Nigeria doing better? Why is Senegal doing better? Because they have better health systems and, of course, in Nigeria we also had 50 international US experts coming to help. But it was the country itself being more capable. Uprooting what causes this tragedy is what we need to do with our systematic development work. There is no point treating people with Ebola or saving them from malaria if they are going to die from lack of safe drinking water.

First of all, it is not only the Commission that said that but also the World Health Organisation. And the choice of words was specific: not that we will not have cases, but that the risk of it spreading once there is a case inside the European Union remains low. In fact, until now there has been only one case of a secondary infection – that is to say, of a person who has never set foot in Africa and still got the disease – and because it was isolated – I am referring to the case in Spain and, thank God, she is on the way to recovery – it was an isolated one and did not spread. So, I do not want the words of the Commission to be misinterpreted in any way. One person criticised saying: why did you not introduce screening at point of entry? First of all, the Commission cannot force any Member State to introduce screening of any kind; that is a sovereign decision for the Member States. Along with Minister Lorenzin from Italy, I convened an informal meeting of Health Ministers which 21 Health Ministers attended. There were divergent views amongst the Member States; most of them were against introducing entry screening even though I gave the advice that it was good to consider entry screening. Some were opposed to entry screening and then introduced it five days later. But, it is not within my competence to order any screening at the airport. So what we did, as there was no consensus, was to enhance the exit screening in these countries in Africa.  As to the external dimension, which Commissioner Georgieva has spoken about: of course the external and internal dimensions are not mutually exclusive because by containing the disease in Africa, one is not only doing the right thing, because we have a moral obligation in that regard, but we are also protecting ourselves. Only three weeks ago, the WHO was requesting half a billion euros from the entire world. The European Union alone has already allocated half a billion euros – EUR 180 million from European funds and EUR 320 from the Member States. I will conclude with this, to show I think it is unfair: we should not enter into some masochistic exercise of saying ‘Europe is not doing anything’, because it is doing a lot.

Member States need to step up infrastructural and operational preparations in the field of health services to be ready for any eventuality and to take all precautions in the interest of the general public and also those prone to encounter the virus, such as persons working in the security and health sector.

And at the EU summit on Thursday and Friday this week, the heads of state and government will not only decide on the 2030 climate targets, but will also address Ebola. So far, Europe has budgeted EUR 450 million for the fight against Ebola. According to the World Health Organization, the spread of Ebola has spread so widely in West Africa, according to the World Health Organization. It had failed to respond to the conditions for the rapid spread of the disease, which were evident from the outset. The WHO also criticized incompetent staff and bureaucratic delays – such as issuing visas – and the focus on the fight against other diseases. 4500 people have died and 9,000 people have been infected in West Africa today, the sad support of the World Health Organisation's findings. And if aid is not significantly stepped up, the WHO expects 5,000 to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in December. Currently, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are the countries most affected by the Ebola epidemic. If Nigeria, Senegal, and Ivory Coast are also affected by the spread of the disease, the World Bank expects economic consequences of USD 40 billion by the end of 2015.

I met with the excellent Médecins Sans Frontières last week and have nothing but praise for their work in tough circumstances. Sixteen 16 of their staff have already become infected and ten of those have died – people trying to help and assist. We as Europe have no shortage of organisations with expertise and people willing to put themselves in harmʼs way, but we have lacked the political will to get involved. We need to do so urgently and provide real support to those organisations already on the ground. In particular we must reassure volunteers that there will be a coordinated EU medevac procedure, and that the operation will be properly financed. We have a humanitarian duty to intervene, but we have a selfish motivation too.

It should be noted that this country was cited as an example in the application of reforms. And so this Ebola virus, with all the human dramas it carries, functions here as a reveal of the effects of neoliberal policies applied in Africa in the past and today in Europe. The WHO, which should be at the forefront of this battle in an articulated strategy to combat the virus, is currently struggling with budgets that fall from year to year, because rich countries determine this. In particular, its budget for 2012-13 has been cut by 13.4% precisely in operations in Africa, taking away operational capacity.

We must be cautious in our daily activities and remain diligent in our efforts to fight this disease. As stated by my colleague Ms Georgieva, we must be proud of the efforts of the many Member States that are lending support and resourses for this fight. The numbers show the shocking speed with which Ebola is spreading; the latest data shows that ʽthere were 4 963 people sick, and there are now 9 191. Similarly, the number of people who have lost their lives has almost doubled, from 2 453 to 4 546. Unfortunately, a very high number of health professionals are affected, with 427 doctors and nurses sick and, of those, 230 have lost their lives trying to save the lives of othersʼ.
