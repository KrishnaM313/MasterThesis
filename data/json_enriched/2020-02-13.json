Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has Agriculture is passion. Agriculture is not just a profession like any other where you do your job, do your job and just want to bring a bit of money home to feed the family. No – farmers have a mission: they want to produce the best quality, sustainable food, and they are already doing so today. They want to equip consumers with the best food, and they want to develop their own farm and they want to develop it so that they can pass it on to the next generation. Often we have stories of generations, sometimes centuries, where people on the same farms cultivate the same area for generations. Let me just use my own story to tell you the passion behind it. I am now 42 and I have been working for over 30 years, and mainly because I worked with my parents on my own farm from a young age: feeding the calves, milking the cows, taking the manure fork in my hand – simply helping to ensure that this farm has a future, that this farm continues to make it possible to produce the best food. I tell you, sometimes it was hard when the others went to the swimming pool in the summer and I had to get on the tractor, help to get the harvest. But I also tell you that it was possible not only because passion was there, but also because there was recognition, because there was appreciation, because I realized that there is respect in the village because of what we can do, what our company can do. And it is precisely this respect, the recognition, the appreciation – which are increasingly lacking. We must be careful in our political debates on agriculture that we do not pillory farmers, we do not talk about polluters, about climate killers, about poison mixers, but that we talk to them, that we tell them: yes, you are doing a great job, but we need to get better. And that we are enabling them to get better, that we do not launch a ban in the next few months, that we do not launch a conditional in the next few months, but that we are incentivising more climate protection: that, for example, we enable farmers to build up humus for more climate protection; that we will enable them to use fewer plant protection products – but with incentives, with the right measures, and not with bans. That we should enter into the debate on how we protect our farmers beyond the European Union – when we already have the highest environmental requirements in Europe. This is also a question that must be asked. How do we manage, Commissioner, for the rest of us to follow us in the world? So that we are developing trade agreements, for example, from product standards to production standards, this is also an issue that needs to be put at the centre.  There is another question at the heart of this agricultural debate and this debate on the farm-to-fork strategy: it must also be about the consumer. If we want to shape this transformation process, we need nothing less than a consumer turnaround. If, in my country, 72% of consumers say: yes, I am prepared to put more money on the table for more animal welfare, for more environmental protection, for more climate protection – 72%!, – but only 16% at the counter are actually prepared to pay more, then there is something wrong. So one is politics, also at European level, but the other is also the consumer and the consumer in Europe – they too must be prepared to pay more. Let us take the farmers with us. I had five farmers' meetings last weekend – I can tell you, Commissioner, that there are great concerns that farmers are being cornered, and we have to organise the opposite, take them with them in this debate, say: 'You are not part of the problem, you are part of the solution'. That is why it is right that this debate should take place today in the centre of this House, on prime time; that we are getting agriculture exactly where it belongs – at the heart of the debate – now that the farm-to-fork strategy is published.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-02-13.json", "name": "Janusz WOJCIECHOWSKI", "mepid": "23784", "text": "   Member. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab I thank President Lins and the Members of the Committee on Agriculture for organising this very important and necessary debate, which our farmers in particular are waiting for.  The field-to-table strategy has not yet been adopted by the European Commission. Work is ongoing and a communication is due at the end of March. However, the main objectives of this strategy have already been identified in the Communication on the European Green Deal. This is an ambitious plan to introduce a sustainable food production system, and European farmers have a key role to play in this plan. The strategic plans will have to reflect more ambitious targets including a significant reduction in the use of chemical pesticides as well as fertilisers and antibiotics. Organic farming and precision farming are to be developing. Stricter animal welfare standards are to be introduced. The quality of soil, water and air is expected to improve. European farmers therefore face a great challenge: producing food in a sustainable way, for the benefit of the environment, climate and human health. This is an ambitious challenge, but it is also costly. Farmers cannot stay alone with this challenge. The European Union must help them, we all need to help them. Less than 10 million European farmers provide food security for more than 500 million until recently, now 450 million of our citizens. We should thank them for this every day. Thank you for being there, that they want to work on their farms, that they want to take care of the land and animals. There are fewer and fewer those who want to do this. We have a big problem in the European Union of farms without successors and depopulation of rural areas.  Food security is as important as defence or energy security. In order to ensure food security, we must take care of our farmers and create decent living conditions for them. This is a task for the common agricultural policy, but also for other EU policies. I would like to thank you very much for the key questions raised in this debate. How will the Commission ensure that people living in the countryside, including farmers but also processors, remain the most important and future challenges taken into account? How will the Commission ensure the competitiveness of Union producers and guarantee a fair income for farmers in the context of additional requirements resulting from new and revised policies? Such questions are also asked by the farmers themselves. I have recently had the opportunity to meet farmers in various EU countries: Croatia, Germany, Austria and Poland. I am now going to meetings with farmers in France and then to more countries. I also meet with representatives of many agricultural organisations from Europe.  Farmers are aware of the need to move to a sustainable way of producing food. If at present part of agricultural production does not meet the conditions for sustainability, if we are dealing, for example, with concentration and intensification of farming, it is not because farmers wanted it, but because economic circumstances forced them to do so. Simply to sustain themselves from their farms, farmers had to increase the scale and intensity of production. But now we need to help farmers change this so that agriculture becomes agriculture again, not turned into an industry. We will not achieve the objectives of the European Green Deal and the field-to-table strategy by coercion against farmers (I fully agree with what President Lins said). We can only achieve these goals through reasonable assistance. This aid is, above all, an adequate budget for the common agricultural policy, appropriate to the challenges facing our agriculture. A strong and fair-divided budget. I am very pleased that awareness of the need for such a budget exists not only in the Commission and in the European Parliament, but also in the Member States. I was very pleased with the joint declaration by the three Agriculture Ministers: Mrs Klöckner from Germany, Mr Glavany from France, Mr Planas from Spain. In this declaration, ministers are firmly in favour of the need to strengthen the budget of the common agricultural policy. On 27th January a majority of ministers from the other Member States expressed a similar view at the Council meeting, which are also in favour of the need to strengthen the budget of the common agricultural policy. And I am also in favour of that. We need a strong, fair budget for the common agricultural policy.  The ambitious challenges posed by the European Green Deal and the field-to-table strategy must have financial security. There must be adequate resources for eco-programmes in the first pillar. This is particularly the case for countries which have a low level of direct payments and are seeking to compensate them. There must be adequate resources for action on the environment, climate and animal welfare in the second pillar. These, in turn, need countries with lower rural development funds.  We will encourage farmers to apply sustainable farming practices, sustainable farming practices, for example to reduce the intensity of farming, to voluntarily introduce higher animal welfare standards, but we must have adequate budgetary resources to do so. It is my duty to talk about this, especially now that the time for important policy decisions on the Multiannual Financial Framework is approaching. This case also has a dignity dimension. We will only achieve the objectives of the European Green Deal and the field-to-table strategy if we treat farmers with dignity. Not as a problem to be tackled, but as partners in the implementation of socially important tasks. I am sure that we will receive the full support and commitment of farmers to the historical challenges we face. Dear! European agriculture must be sustainable, environmentally friendly, climate and animal welfare, but in order to achieve this, agricultural policy must be farmer-friendly, ambitious and fair.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2020-02-13.json", "name": "Herbert DORFMANN", "mepid": "96787", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. It is good that we have this debate today; we had to fight for it. It is true, I have the impression, that some believe that this farm-to-fork strategy could either be developed past the farmers or perhaps even against the farmers. I think we are very glad that you are here today, Commissioner, but the fact that Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans is not here today also shows that this thinking is certainly there in the Commission. I venture a prognosis: if we do not actively involve the farmers in this debate, then this strategy will go against the wall. Driving against the wall – I dare say that. And I think that at the moment it is just the case that the farmers seem to be responsible for everything: for the loss of biodiversity, for climate change, for the excessive use of chemicals, for the excessive use of antibiotics. The reality on the ground is completely different. The vast majority of farmers must see that they continue to get their farms, get on economically, find successors, and they usually think much more sustainably than many, many other actors in our economic cycles. They produce food; and consumers are constantly claiming that they want things even better, want them even healthier, want even more sustainable, and as soon as they go to the supermarket, they are looking for the offer where they can pay one and take three with them. That just doesn't work in this form. There is, of course, a lot to improve. I am also convinced that the strategy makes sense. You can think about plant protection, you have to think about fertilisation, but you have to do it with a hope for progress, with a hope for innovation and research, for more knowledge. This is the only way we will ultimately meet these challenges.  Overall, I believe that we need an alliance: we need an alliance with the farmers, we need to take the farmers with us.

The agri-food sector is ready to get involved in providing even more environmental services, achieving carbon neutrality for the benefit of all European citizens. However, these efforts will have to be matched not only by incentives through a properly funded CAP, but above all by the availability of innovative production techniques, including those of varietal improvement which are capable of replacing chemistry in protecting plant health.

I said that we must not oppose traditional policies, such as the common agricultural policy, to the new priorities, Green Deal, to digital transformation.  And I think that's where we need to start: agriculture as an economic and societal objective is more current and modern than ever, but we need to have the courage to think about how we modernise it and how we put it in line with today's expectations and realities, both of farmers and consumers. Because a Green Deal, a green pact, has no chance in the European Union without the contribution of agriculture. But agriculture can't contribute more to society's expectations if we don't think about income for farmers.  We must therefore start from the expectation of consumers to have quality food, the expectation of citizens to have public services that ensure the proper management of natural resources, and for that we must find solutions so that farmers have a decent income.  And here, beyond the budget of the common agricultural policy, we need to think of an investment plan. And because of this, this 'farm to fork' strategy has no chance and no sense if we are talking only about pesticides, chemicals and only an isolated part of agricultural activity.  This \"farm to fork\" strategy should be a New Deal for agriculture and consumers. That's where we should start. From society's expectations of agriculture, from how we make better, more quality food, how we make agricultural practices, also using investment resources from the Green Deal and digital transformation, help farmers align with the expectations we have.

These are issues that we are all there for. Science is asking us to do so, and the people are asking us to do so. It is perhaps the last chance to really reform the CAP. Of course, the farmers are afraid, yes. But to entrench one's car castle mentality and say, \"What about us, what about us?\" and not to be part of the solution and not to be innovative and courageous ly not afraid of change, that will not help us. We can't hide and say, \"That's how we've always done it, so it's good.\" We know that is not true. We are on an abyss, we need to change.

They are one group of society that do not take well to this. The truth is that, in this issue of Farm to Fork, we do need farmers to be front and centre of it, not to be dragged kicking and screaming. Commissioner, I hope you’ll deliver that message to your colleagues around the table. I hope you’ll include in this Farm to Fork Strategy competition law, unfair trading practices, and how trade policy can impact negatively on European agriculture. I would just say that some of the language used, indeed by yourself and others in the Chamber, can be very emotive: organic is wonderful, factory intensive is evil. I’d like you to be a little bit more careful about the language, because many of our family farms can be medium—sized or they can be large, but it doesn’t suggest, whether small, medium or large, that one is better than the other. What we should be trying to do is make sure that farmers have access to the best research, the best innovation, and the best technologies to allow them to deliver on the things we need them to do. And let’s not forget that farmers are already doing it. They’ve been up before we have. They’re out in their farms and in their fields doing things for nature. We need to help them do that, not restrict them in their efforts. My greatest fear of CAP reform and this strategy is that we will bind them with more rules and give them less flexibility.

The question is, how does this respect come to fruition? In other things, the response to the new challenges does not materialise without the effort of farmers and this means that they must be supported in a supportive, cohesive, fair way. The economic and social sustainability worthy of our farmers depends on the vitality of our rural communities.

If we continue to distribute payments in this way, 70% without conditions, only in terms of area, then we will not be making any real environmental policy. If you are serious about the Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategies, I would be curious to see how you will end up incorporate this into this common agricultural policy.

We have to get down from the large amounts of fertilisers, otherwise we will not be able to control the extinction of the species.

It is only checked whether the farmer actually implemented that measure. It does not look at what the actual result is.

It is certainly not right to talk about our farmers as if they were all criminals. They will take to the streets again if they do not understand your laws, because they do not work and operate on a whim or according to the motto 'a lot of fertilizer helps a lot', but according to the requirements of the EU and the Member States. If Timmermans now wants to drastically reduce pesticides and improve the quality of food – okay, but we don't start from scratch. It is common practice to reduce and optimize the use of fertilizers and pesticides. The latest research results from the official food monitoring confirm that food from Europe is by far the safest in the world. So don't play with the fire of fake news! Look for good solutions and not for culprits! Our farmers are open and ready for innovative ideas. But if the market, the consumer, does not pay and reward additional requirements, restrictions and bans, then it must pay the timmermans' house.

I will use this debate – by participating in the work on the strategy, in so far as it concerns my responsibilities, I will want to use as many of your suggestions as possible in this work. I would just like to remind you that the Commissioner for Health, Mrs Kyriakides, is responsible. I am, of course, working on this agricultural part and we have mainly talked about it today, because farmers are the main ones responsible for the future implementation of the strategy. And I fully agree with these statements, and I have also said this myself, that this must be done with farmers, not against farmers, that we must use incentives. That is why I have talked so much about the budget that, in order, for example, to encourage farmers to have programmes to reduce the use of plant protection products, fertilisers, better water management, other environmental measures, we need to have the resources to do so. They must be sufficient in the first pillar, because they will be eco-programmes, there must be measures in the second pillar of action, different environmental actions. That is why this budget is so important. You have raised the issue of order here, and I, too, would prefer to be in a situation where we have adopted strategies and now we are adapting the common agricultural policy to these strategies. We are in a different situation, these assumptions of the common agricultural policy were developed as recently as 2018. President von der Leyen's committee does not propose a new agricultural policy, because we simply do not have time for this. We want to bring the work on the common agricultural policy to an end as soon as possible by adapting it, and that will be our joint work, cooperation between the Commission, Parliament and the Council, so that these rules of the common agricultural policy are applied to the strategies that we will adopt. The strategy and the measures it provides are an opportunity, above all, for smaller and medium-sized farms, those farms that are disappearing so quickly, which we are losing so quickly. And there is room in Europe for different types of farms – for larger, more intensive, and for smaller, more extensive economies. They are particularly – these smaller farms – prepared for these environmental challenges, it will be easier for them to meet these conditions. The idea is that these big farms don't cause these little ones to disappear, there has to be a balance. This sustainability must also be the case with regard to the relationship between the different types of farms in European agriculture. Organic farming has a great opportunity. As part of this strategy, we will do everything we can to develop organic farms, but not only to increase the area of these farms, but to promote consumption, to reach consumers, to show the value of this food. Moreover, European food in general, and this is our success, the success of European agriculture, is of the highest quality in the world, meets the highest standards and this is an asset when it comes to world markets. We must, of course, protect our producers. Many of your voices here have been about protecting our farmers' imports. Yes, we should require the same standards that are required of us. There are also some restrictions from the World Trade Organisation and the rules that apply there. Strategic plans will be key documents on which we will work. I can give you a fair suing that, when assessing the strategic plans put forward by the Member States, I will do everything to ensure that there is as little red tape as possible, that bureaucracy does not hinder the development of agriculture, and that it does not hinder the lives of farmers, because this sometimes happens. I confirm that such situations are the case. Once again, thank you very much for an interesting, very interesting discussion. I think that not only we in this House, but also our farmers, have obtained a certain assessment of the situation in which we are going. I assure you once again that the European Commission will do everything to ensure that this policy, these strategies, and both the Green Deal and the field-to-table strategy, are implemented with farmers, for their benefit and for the good future of agriculture in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 75, "date": "2020-02-13.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  The debate is closed.

As part of this system, we are all jointly and severally responsible for the environmental impact. There needs to be a change in our thinking as consumers. Are we prepared to pay a higher price for food produced in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way? Achieving the objectives of the Green Pact on zero pollution and reduced use of chemical pesticides depends on our joint work with farmers. If we want results, we need to work together with the farmers, not against them. They should be included in the strategy debate as soon as possible. Instead of constantly ingesting new obligations and ever-higher requirements, we need to think about how to stimulate them in order to implement environmental practices on our farms.

Additionally, outdated farm vehicles contribute more to greenhouse gases and pollution, therefore the CAP should provide financial aid to farms looking to update their machinery to more environmentally friendly models, which will lessen their carbon footprint. Farmers are the custodians of the land. It is in their interests for that land to be healthy and usable. They can and want to be our biggest allies in helping protect the planet, but we must bring them with us, and not alienate them. The Mercosur deal is not good for farmers or for the environment.

However, at this point, I would like to remind you that other factors are also at stake in guaranteeing quality agricultural production. In order for agriculture to be healthy and sustainable, it is often necessary to provide financial support to the sector. However, the current system of European Union subsidies is sowing injustice, as our subsidies in Estonia are much smaller than those in Western and southern Europe. In addition, much higher subsidies in the rest of Europe will harm the competitiveness of our farmers. That is why I am of the opinion that the European Union's agricultural subsidies must either be equalised or abolished altogether. I am absolutely not satisfied with the 'explanation' that the rest of Europe is receiving higher subsidies, as their rates of support were once set out in the ancient criteria before our accession to the European Union.

Mr President, the Republic of Guinea is going through a difficult period, marked by increased violence that threatens democratic stability. Political power and sovereignty are and must remain in the hands of the people. The will of the people must be respected and reflected in state institutions. Since last year, when a referendum was announced to amend the constitution, the political opposition and civil society have challenged this draft and the political climate has turned violent. During the demonstrations, abuses from all sides took place. Police violence has resulted in numerous casualties, which has caused great emotion and even concern in the international community, for example when the police used a woman as a shield to protect themselves from the stone-throwing of protesters. The whole world was shocked by this upsurge in violence. The crucial question that can be asked is: where does this violence come from, what causes it? We encourage Guinea to engage in dialogue in order to find appropriate answers to this crucial question and to establish other participatory processes that allow for peaceful and inclusive consideration of different political ideas. We urge Guinea to do everything possible to put an end to this deleterious situation. It is unacceptable for protesters to be beaten, tear gas canistered and other abused. We deplore the deaths of all those who lost their lives in these demonstrations. The Guinean government has emphasized Guinea's sovereignty and has said that no other state or foreign political actor will be able to make decisions for the country. Yet within the country, we should not exclude or threaten population groups that do not support the political line chosen by the government of the day.

Today, at the end of his second term, parliamentary elections are being postponed and a constitutional amendment is being sought, and he is expected to seek a third mandate. Worse still, demonstrations are being crushed; Demonstrations that arise because this amendment to the Constitution has been proposed, and these are people who say: we do not agree with this, we want democratic elections to take place, as our Constitution provides for in our country. But the government is crushing these demonstrations, arresting opponents and, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow this to happen, and we condemn this in the strongest possible terms at this point. We expect the government to respect human and civil rights; above all, however, that opponents will be released immediately if they have been arrested for political reasons, and we expect the right to demonstrate to be respected so that people can express their opinions.

Yes, violence against protesters is unacceptable, but the violations of public order by protesters, as some documents reveal, are equally unacceptable. So do we just want to continue to have an influence in Africa, or do we want to finally erase ourselves from China, Russia or India? Why, moreover, are we outraged by this constitutional reform, as one of my colleagues said, when, since 2000, more than 10 countries have decided to change their constitutions and certain leaders, to extend their presence in power - may I recall, for example, that in Cameroon it has been the same leader for 38 years?

The country’s stability and prosperity is important for the region, as it is for the European Union. Since the 2018 local elections, the sociopolitical situation has become increasingly tense. The prospect of a new constitution, raising the possibility for President Condé to remain in power beyond the end of his second and last mandate, united opposition forces and the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution and led to frequent demonstrations against a third mandate. These demonstrations have often been severely dispersed by security forces. Opponents have been detained, and fundamental freedoms, in particular freedom of expression, were not respected. Since mid-October 2019, around 30 demonstrators have lost their lives, allegedly killed by firearms by the security forces. The EU has repeatedly called for appropriate investigations to clarify the circumstances of these incidents and to hold those responsible accountable. In such a context, preparations for legislative elections, due on 1 March, only increased the tension. Referring to strong doubts about the credibility of the voter list, two main opposition parties declared a boycott on the scrutiny. Although EU electoral missions in 2015 and 2018 recommended a thorough review of the electoral rolls, which did not accurately reflect the electorate, such a review was only very partially conducted. The recent announcement that legislative elections will be coupled to a referendum on a new draft constitution presented in December, giving ground to President Condé’s intentions, has further divided the country. There is now a clear risk of widespread instability and polarisation, including, dangerously, along ethnic lines. The EU has consistently, together with local partners – the UN, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the US and France – called for calm and has facilitated dialogue among the parties. The confidence of all in a credible and transparent electoral process is the best way to achieve participation and acceptance of the result. While every country has the right to amend or modernise its constitution, changing the fundamental law should build on an inclusive consultation leading to a large consensus, which is absent to date. Holding a referendum months before Presidential elections is not in line with the good practices recommended by the African Union and ECOWAS. In particular, the West African region has gained its democratic credentials upon these principles. It is in this context that the spokesperson of High Representative Borrell last Friday called for an inclusive dialogue to avoid further escalation of violence and to ensure conditions for transparent elections in which all parties can participate. Only a climate where political and civic space is respected and human rights violations come to an end can create conditions conducive for such a dialogue. In order to reach this, all actors should put the unity and the peace of Guinea first. We remain ready to contribute to such a process, working with our partners: the UN, the African Union and ECOWAS. The European Union remains strongly engaged in Guinea, also working with civil society and human rights defenders and with support for the resilience of the population.

We remind the Malagasy authorities of their responsibility to uphold the rights of children and guarantee their safety and integrity. A significant number of children are active in mica mines. The rise in exports of this resource, combined with a significant decrease in the price per tonne, has aggravated the risk of labour exploitation. Working conditions in the mines are usually deplorable and threaten the life, health and safety of children. They are constantly exposed to chronic respiratory infections, severe injuries and dehydration and face psychological and physical abuse. Elimination of poverty is the only way to create the conditions necessary for the eradication of child labour. This requires a comprehensive approach and targeted measures in the areas of education, employment and social protection. Madagascar has made some progress by adopting a new decree reinforcing legislation against child labour and raising the legal age for employment from 15 to 16 years. In addition, Madagascar is revising its mining code, and we call on the government to prioritise the compliance with its international commitments, including in terms of social and environmental standards, decent work and respect of human and children’s rights. However, so far, the authorities have failed to apply sanctions due to a lack of resources for effective monitoring and poor law enforcement capacity. We as the European Union can also do our part. With this resolution, the Parliament calls on the EU to step up its support for projects and initiatives aimed at combating child labour in Madagascar. The EU has been actively committed to the fight against child labour through its development and trade policies, and this approach would be fully in line with the European Commission President’s pledge to have zero tolerance for child labour in EU trade policy. Nobody – and certainly no child – deserves to work in inhumane and life-threatening environments.

We cannot tolerate a situation where children are forced... (The President interrupted the speaker to call for Members to take their seats) Thank you. We cannot tolerate a situation where children are forced to work in horrendous conditions and are deprived of an education. Prompt action is needed, but we also need to address root causes. On the nearly 46 000 tonnes of mica which Madagascar exported in 2018, more than 91% was shipped to China, according to the International Trade Centre. The principal question to address is therefore one of due diligence in the supply chain. However, boosting the capacity and accountability of State institutions in Madagascar, including through our development cooperation will also be key. As many Members will be aware, the EU has already taken positive action to address supply chain risks in relation to the so-called conflict minerals, such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, and the EU regulation covering due diligence for these will come into force next year. (The President again called for Members to take their seats quietly) We cannot stand by while child labour - an oxymoron as Robert Biedroń rightly put it - child labour in the extractive industries continues. There is an urgent need for international companies sourcing mica and mica-based products, as well as the Malagasy government to take responsibility for addressing the problematic conditions, and for contributing to improving the fulfilment of children’s rights. The European Union has a long-standing and clear position on due diligence. Not only governments but also private actors have a role to play. The European Parliament hosted an important event in November 2019 in which the urgency of addressing child labour in mica mining was prominently raised. Commission President von der Leyen made it clear that the EU has zero tolerance for child labour. The EU led the tabling of a resolution on the Rights of the Child, adopted in the United Nations General Assembly 3rd Committee last year, where 2021 was declared the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour. The Commission will shortly publish a study on due diligence requirements through the supply chain. It examines existing regulation and proposals, as well as options for regulating due diligence in companies own operations, and through the supply chain for adverse human rights and environmental impacts, including relating to climate change. In a single market, it is not practical to have different national treatments, and the benefits of an EU-wide framework are obvious in terms of levelling the playing field and creating legal certainty for companies, as well as reaping opportunities stemming from the sustainability transition. The EU is of course also fully behind a multi-stakeholder initiative to address supply chains risk, and in particular child labour. We will continue to work spanning trade agreements, development projects and other international cooperation, in Madagascar and elsewhere, to tackle root causes such as the social and economic vulnerability of individuals, workers and their families that put children to work.

It is our duty to do everything needed to protect the lives and well-being of European citizens. 25 000 people who lose their lives on European roads and 135 000 suffering severe injuries, are numbers which are unacceptable for us and of course we need to do more in terms of action and support. Road safety will therefore be a priority in my mandate and, with your help we can make it a priority for the whole Union.  Let’s not forget though that Europe has made enormous progress in road safety over the last decade. We are the safest region in the world and we have a lot of experience and good practice to share. This is an opportunity for true European leadership. Globally 1.35 million people are dying on the roads every year. In fact, road crashes are the biggest killer of young people worldwide. The global target to reduce road fatalities by 50% - part of the Sustainable Development Goals - is expiring this year, and this target was not and will not be reached.  This must not mean that we are ready to reduce our ambition. Europe needs to be at the forefront of supporting a new ambitious global fatality reduction target and I intend to say this very clearly in Stockholm. The Swedish Minister for Infrastructure intends to present in Stockholm a so-called ‘Stockholm Declaration’, which calls for renewed efforts and a new global target. I very much support this declaration and I hope that it will be adopted as it is planned. The next step will be a resolution at the UN General Assembly. The Commission will also very much support the process leading up to such a resolution, including through our offices in Geneva and in New York. Ultimately, what counts is results.  In Europe, we are implementing the safe system approach, which is a holistic system building cooperation, good governance and shared responsibility. It addresses all areas – infrastructure, vehicles, behaviour and post-crash care.  The Safe System accepts that human error will happen and compensates for it. Drivers and other road users will continue to make mistakes on the road as they do elsewhere, because to err is human and distractions, alcohol and drugs increase the risk of error, but no road user deserves to die because of a mistake.  As you know, the EU transport ministers have unanimously supported our new EU-wide targets to halve the number of fatalities and for the first time serious injuries by 2030, and the Commission has followed up with an ambitious action plan. The first concrete actions have already been taken. Last year, thanks to strong support from the European Parliament, we strengthened the EU rules on both safe infrastructure management and vehicle safety. We’ll continue to promote ambitious legislation in this mandate and I look forward to discuss with you details in the future.  But in the meantime, let us work in partnership which is indeed the essence of the safe system approach to road safety. As legislators you are well equipped to push us all, the Commission, the Member States, industry, NGOs, to deliver on more ambitious targets and of course, to promote ambition in action in our constituencies. Looking ahead, it is clear that mobility is going through profound change. Climate change demands that we reduce emissions, while digitalisation is opening up new opportunities for easier cleaner and safer mobility. As society shifts, so will the focus of road safety. We need to look at new transport trends in towns and cities and what they mean for vulnerable road users, and we need to consider the implications of autonomous vehicles.  We need to drive the change and make sure change does not hamper our zero-victims vision.  I look forward to a good exchange with you this afternoon and I really appreciate the fact that you put this point on the agenda.

Sixty percent of those mortal traffic accidents took place at pedestrian crossings’. I’m also happy that we put this point during today’s session, because road safety is a matter of life and death in the most literal sense of the word, and the situation on our European roads is dramatic. So last year the European Union adopted the world’s most advanced mandatory vehicle-safety requirements, the General Safety Regulation. You will remember that it will become applicable in July 2022 and will reduce the number of deaths on the roads significantly. But many say that even the best technical solutions will not improve the situation on the roads if the road users behave in an irresponsible way. I hear very often that the European Union must educate. But, unfortunately, the European institutions do not have competences in education, TV and radio programmes, the organisation of driving licence courses etc. We must cooperate with our Member States much more closely in order to achieve a significant reduction in fatalities on the roads. Yes, Commissioner, it is our aim to achieve the vision zero goal and we should prepare a detailed roadmap of how to achieve this as soon as possible.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for Commissioner Vălean, thank you for your introduction. 500 people lose their lives on European roads every week. This is equivalent to two passenger planes crashing in europe every week, which would, of course, have been totally unacceptable – and that is also the figures for our roads. Globally, it's even worse. 26 000 people lose their lives every week, mainly children and young people, and mainly also people from low- and middle-income countries. Although the death toll is falling and the number of road injured is falling, the figures are still far too high. We must therefore put the issue of road safety higher on the agenda, both in Europe and globally. It is important that we in europe continue to work on the zero vision presented by the previous Commission, which Commissioner Vălean says he wants to continue to prioritise.  We must also contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, albeit not in time, so later – that we have new targets in place, and that we ensure that we succeed in halving the number of road fatalities and injuries at global level. I am therefore pleased that my party colleague and our Swedish Minister for Infrastructure Tomas Eneroth are hosting the global UN conference on road safety next week.  We must improve road safety for the sake of all of us: motorists, passengers, motorcyclists, cyclists, pedestrians and, not least, road workers. The majority of road accidents are, as the Commissioner said, preventable. We must also include vulnerable road users more in our overall work, as we heard from a colleague earlier in the debate. Everyone should be able to feel safe when walking or cycling to and from work or to and from their school.  With better infrastructure, with analysis of speed limits, roads become safer, but it also leads to reduced emissions. In this way, road safety work also contributes to achieving our overall climate goals.  EU funding and infrastructure investment must therefore always include a road safety perspective. We must have high safety standards and carry out customized tests and analyses on our vehicles. The latter is extremely important. In fact, although half of the world's population is women, studies show that women are currently more than 70% more likely to be killed in a car accident than men, because we do not use crash test dolls that are adapted for women. Such crash dolls now finally exist, but we must also ensure that they are used. Let us now ensure, therefore, that together we make sure that we start using the new crash dolls, so that it is equally safe to drive, whether you are a man or a woman. When it comes to road safety, we need to think about both equality and equality.  I hope that today's debate can send a signal to the UN conference next week that we must work together to achieve our global goals and to save lives. In conclusion, I would just like to say that during my speech in this House, nine people have lost their lives in traffic. There are far too many.

Unfortunately, most of us have probably lost someone close or dear to us at one point in our lives, and surely each of us fears daily for the safety of our children and families. We are in fear because we are aware of the dangers in traffic, but we are also aware of how unnecessary these deaths are, we are aware that they can and should be reduced and completely eradicated. According to a report by the World Health Organization, up to 1.35 million people die annually on European roads, and even more worrying is the fact that accidents are the most common cause of death for young people between the age of 5 and 29. In 2018 alone, there were 25,000 road deaths and 135,000 seriously injured in Europe. And it is an inadmissible and unnecessary human and social cost of mobility. The fact is that Europe's current medium-term target through a vision of zero or halving the number of road deaths from 2010 to 2020 will not be achieved. We have again set ourselves overly ambitious goals that are not attainable. Of course I agree that the goals should be motivating, but also they must be realistic and achievable and the countries that are, unfortunately, the least safe when it comes to road transport are Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia. They are also countries where there are twice as many traffic fatalities as the European average and it is not true that people in these countries do not know how to drive or drive worse than drivers in Denmark, Norway or the Netherlands. It is true that people in Romania, Bulgaria or my Croatia have a much worse fleet, have older and more unsafe cars, older and more unsafe roads that lead, unfortunately, to fatal consequences.  Dear Commissioner, there is no revolution in the transport safety segment without new breakthroughs in technologies to be used in transport and without investment in road infrastructure. And technology exists, technology is being perfected every day and it depends on all of us how fast it will take us to get that available technology and start using it. New technologies such as the sharing economy and autonomous driving are already very much in use and I am sure that they are a great solution for burdened European environments that are also affected by various diseases due to the exhaust emissions that we are fighting here in different European cities. New technologies of robotics and automation in transport can drastically reduce the human error factor that is the cause of over 90% of all traffic accidents, and if we are really going to achieve the vision of zero deaths in 2021-2030, we must continue to build a safe system at Member State level. In addition to designing and maintaining infrastructure, \"fault-forgiving roads\" are essential to significantly reduce the severity of an accident if it occurs, but we must also encourage fleet renewal, reduce excise duties and taxes on cars with Euro NCAP five stars, as this risk of injury is the lowest. Last but not least, let's educate our citizens. I get the impression that we all forget about this extremely important part of the fight for greater traffic safety. This may not sound as attractive as building infrastructure or applying new technologies, but it is very important because most young people in traffic today are a danger because they are unaware of how important it is to be educated.

Every year, road accidents cost an estimated EUR 280 billion. Then there are the human and social tragedies. I therefore welcome the European Commission's commitments to halve the number of road deaths in particular during the next EU road safety policy. This medium-term goal will be the key to achieving vision zero – zero deaths – for 2050. Technological progress and artificial intelligence could significantly improve road safety, as human error plays a role in 94% of accidents. However, an automated road sector presents new risks and challenges that need to be addressed, such as new infrastructures for driverless vehicles, ethical issues relating to liability and data protection, and environmental and health problems. While pedestrians and cyclists are by far the least likely to harm other road users, they are the most vulnerable road users and account for almost a third of all deaths. In order to increase road safety and reduce the number of deaths, we need new urban planning that prioritises pedestrians, cyclists and public transport. We need an EU strategy for safe and sustainable mobility. As you yourself said, Commissioner, and I am pleased about that, you have a strategy. And policies go with action.

Madam President, we are in a state of emergency and we owe it to the victims to design ambitious policies and to remind them at every opportunity that road safety is a top priority for the European Parliament.  In Europe today, we have 500 deaths a week, even though our roads are the safest in the world. This figure corresponds to two air accidents a week in Europe or the disappearance of a small town of 26,000 inhabitants a year. Unfortunately, however, victims on motorways do not activate the reflexes of either the media or our society and our politicians accordingly. This situation must be reversed. Even if we accept that human error will never disappear, we envision the reduction of accidents and — above all — zero losses in human lives. The key is to move from words to practice. We have heard from the other political groups that they too want ambitious policies, but I wonder: if their intentions are sincere, why did they not support our call for a resolution on road safety? It would be an excellent opportunity to put the new Parliament on such an important issue and bring it to the fore, especially in view of the third world ministerial conference in Stockholm.  The European Parliament must be a pioneer in road safety in practice and I call on you, as a first step, to review your attitude and support concrete proposals. For example, reiterate our commitment to the European target of reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries by 1/2 from 2020 to 2030 and reducing deaths to zero by 2050.

To make use of the latest innovations in the automotive industry in safety systems in new and old vehicles, where possible. Set targets to reduce the deaths of vulnerable network users in the context of urban mobility. Establish a regulatory framework for vehicles with automated driving systems. Strengthen the application of road traffic rules both at national level and across borders.  Commissioner Vălean has already expressed twice to the Committee on Transport — as today, here in Parliament — her commitment to actively work for safer roads in Europe and I thank her from the heart for that.

To achieve that, I think we need to take a whole range of options. The European Commission had considered, among other things, and I hope, a review of the reality of the driver's licence; a review also, no doubt, of cross-border cooperation, particularly in the case of the withdrawal of driver's licences; a review of the recommendations, too, for limiting alcohol, drugs or even speeding while driving. These are at least three avenues which I think are important and on which I hope that you will work to bring, beyond one objective, concrete measures to improve the overall situation of road safety in Europe. If we look closely, in recent years we have seen a form of stagnation in road safety figures, and we can regret that. After an improvement that has taken place for many years, this stagnation cannot continue. It cannot continue, moreover, because we have a very strong target in terms of reducing the number of deaths and injuries. May I also ask you to go further, particularly in the correlations of good practice by Member State. We need to be able to ask the right questions together. Of course, infrastructure and vehicles are not the same everywhere in the Member States, but let us recognise that some measures must also be implemented in some Member States to improve the reality of road safety and road safety figures. There are too many discrepancies, and there are very large differences in road safety between the different Member States. I very much hope, Commissioner, that we can work more on these figures and also that you can, that we can together make recommendations, Member State by Member State, so that good practices are disseminated everywhere and that the lot of road safety can be improved throughout Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 149, "date": "2020-02-13.json", "name": "Adriana MALDONADO LÓPEZ", "mepid": "197735", "text": "   – Madam President, thank you, Commissioner, for bringing to this House a debate which I think is essential. And it is true that we often talk about many issues and talk about issues, such as road safety, right now, which is a fundamental issue in the day-to-day life of the European Union and in the day-to-day life also of our fellow citizens. As the Commissioner rightly indicated, more than 25,500 people die on European roads each year. In Spain, for example, around 71% or 91% of accidents are due to human causes. And that is where I believe that we need to focus all our efforts as a European Parliament, as a European Commission and also as a European Council. We must join all our forces from the European institutions and also from the States.  And I believe that new technologies here are going to play a key role; a key role, because we have to take into account that new models of autonomous cars are already being created. We are seeing how that human risk is the key factor in traffic accidents and therefore we need to try to reduce it as much as possible. And we have to be smart and use, from my point of view, new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to make that human risk as small as possible in traffic accidents. Because, in short, we are talking about the lives of many people. And I think we also have to use digitization to be able to reduce that great mortality. It is also true that I believe that it is a real challenge for the internal market. I believe that we need to be able, for example, to create and ensure legal certainty, to encourage investment in the relevant technologies and also to protect citizens and consumers from the new challenges we have in everything related to road safety.

Dear Commissioner, I can speak on this first-person topic as someone who has only recently had a history of road safety. For many people, this topic sounds strange and far from them, however, road safety is not just the wearing of belts and not talking on the phone while driving. Road safety is a system of legislative, educational, enforcement and, in particular, preventive measures. Road safety is the responsibility of the driver of the vehicles and of all direct and indirect road users. In my home country Bulgaria, more than 682 people have died in road accidents in 2018. By the end of October 2019, there are 511. I dare say that these figures are quite understated, unfortunately. This includes only direct victims of road accidents, not people who suffered trauma in the accident and, as a consequence, lost their lives. My country loses more of its citizens in road accidents in a year than countries where fighting is also taking place. That's, to put it mildly, unacceptable. Road safety is therefore much more important than a number of topics we are discussing in the European Union, such as the curved cucumbers or what should be in the dune sauce. Reducing or reaching 0 indicators in road traumatism wants concrete measures. For example, the unification of the road marking, the signs that are affixed throughout Europe, so this must be pursued. Dear Mrs. Valyan, we have a lot of work to do. We must pay attention to the other initiatives and documents for which you, as Commissioner, are also responsible. We must pay attention to this contradictory return of empty trucks, because this even contradicts the idea of green measures in the European Union and Parliament. I just heard comments about not complying with the women's tests. I don't think gender has anything to do with whether or not you can drive a car. I don't think women are better or worse drivers, there should just be strict rules for everyone.

I am very pleased that new technologies will be used in this process, because I think their impact may be what we once achieved with seat belts. It is also important to note the disparities in the number of victims in the various Countries of the European Union. Many people pointed out that there are more victims in poorer countries with less extensive infrastructure.

As I said from the beginning, only working together and putting enough pressure on all the stakeholders on which depends the safety on the roads, will we achieve results. You were mentioning, for example the targets. We have the targets which are expiring as I said, this year, and maybe one would ask why we would have targets if we cannot achieve them? But I do believe that having a target is an important instrument, an important tool, to design policies and enter into dialogue with the stakeholders in order to have a concrete vision for the future from various areas. So I myself I’m favouring keeping a clear target which can guide our action, and we can remember and recall all the time. We don’t need .... all of you mentioned the numbers, and I mentioned the numbers at the beginning, and I said and I want to repeat that actually any number is not acceptable. And that it was said it is also not acceptable that we get used to hearing about this and numbers of deaths on the roads. So that’s why clear action is absolutely needed, and we need to be committed to that. Several have mentioned the vulnerability of pedestrians or other categories involved in traffic. So when we talk about the safety of course the citizens have to be at the core of our action, and we have several categories of vulnerable road users. So we have also the pedestrians as were mentioned, but the cyclists, the motorcyclists are most at risk, especially in urban areas, and we are also looking into the urban mobility package to see ways in which we can improve the safety inside the city. The problem is, and we all know that where all the categories are meeting together, and now the evolution of the technology we see and the introduction of new ways of mobility in cities, I think these kind of risks are higher. So we have to work very early on devising a policy to accommodate all these categories which would meet in the same space. But since we are talking about that, let me refer also to a topic many of you raised. That technology and digitalisation can help us to improve road safety. Many mentioned the fact that we are looking at autonomous vehicles in the future, artificial intelligence - but this comes also with lots of challenges because we have to admit that at the beginning, all these vehicles, well slowly with the introduction of the infrastructure, will need to co-habit with the traditional ones. And this is also something we have to imagine from the very beginning as being a new risk for the safety on the roads. So this is another angle we are looking at. I’m very much favouring the Safe System as a system approach because it looks at all the elements which are making road safety challenging. Many of you mentioned driving licensing. We are looking into this and I think in 2022 we will come up with a proposal, somewhere mentioning the speed. Of course, speed is one of the most important elements, and we have also, let me give you another figure, an estimation from the EDFC, that only one kilometre per year reduction in average speed in the EU would already reduce the deaths by 2000 a year. So this shows that speed is a very important factor. We are also looking and analysing to see how we can convince and cooperate with the Member States in order to act in this respect. We know that in 2017 there was the Valetta Declaration on Road Safety and the transport ministers committed to engage on the possibility of reducing speed limits. So let’s see where we are after this with each Member State. Personalised analysis for Member States is done, and I encourage you to follow, and I’m sure you’re not already, but maybe we will have another chance to discuss the subject after the annual report and statistics, which is going to be published in April. And also I would like to commit with you that after the Stockholm Conference, I would have probably the next day I am in the TRAN Committee, and I can already report back to you on what was committed to in Stockholm and which are the next steps to be taken together with you in the future to increase road safety in Europe - and why not to the leadership for other continents, because we know and we have instruments and programmes for Asia and for Africa and would like to lead there, so that globally we can contribute to the reduction of deaths and serious injuries on the roads.

Unfortunately, in most cases, human factors, drink-driving and speeding are still to blame for accidents, so there needs to be an even greater emphasis on education and prevention. We need campaigns at European level to raise people's awareness of the importance of road safety. The technical condition of motor vehicles is also an important factor influencing it. Fortunately, technologies are now being installed in new vehicles that make a significant contribution to their safety and reduce the number of accidents.
