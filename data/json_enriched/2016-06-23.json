I welcome the high degree of consensus we reached at many of the points in the report, even if the agreement could not be complete in the final vote of the committee.  Parliament should guide the Commission in its assessment of those States which will fail, if they do not change their policies, the renewable development targets by 2020, but it must also help prepare the proposal for a new Renewables Directive until 2030 to maintain the binding targets and strengthen them in order to meet the climate change commitments made in COP 21.  The same proposal for the future appears in the Pieper energy efficiency report. It is no coincidence, since the development of renewables has the same objective as energy savings and efficiency proposals, and encounters the same obstacles in the Member States. And that objective is to contribute to an energy transition to a more sovereign, greener and more democratic model in the face of the interests of the oligopolies that dominate the energy sector today. You do not have to remind the Commissioner, Mr Arias Cañete, of which policies have most adversely affected the development of renewables, as they were carried out by the Government of which he was a part.  First, we must ensure that renewable support systems are stable in the long run and serve as a counterweight to the market in the development of more efficient and sustainable renewable energy. The retroactive elimination of these support models can only hit new investments in energy generation and distribution.  Preferential treatment of renewables cannot be called into question, since the environmental externalities of other energies – and especially the alternatives promoted by the European Union such as nuclear or gas – are discounted, this is an efficient and competitive bet.  Secondly, we must promote generation mechanisms that promote democratic control of energy over large energy oligopolies. To this end, we must support the right to self-consumption and strengthen mechanisms for public participation and planning in the development of renewables, as well as collective systems for generation, distribution and efficiency in energy consumption, both in electricity and heating and cooling systems.  We believe that in the past the Directive has been a useful instrument, although with some unwanted effects that should be corrected. One of them: the negative effects on global sustainability that accelerated bioenergy development has had, be it biomass to burn or biofuel for transport. This is a clear example that the market is not always a good mechanism for ensuring the good use of resources, as seen in competition for agricultural land or the progressive decoupling of transport and production networks from final consumption.  Ended. The energy transition is not only a technological challenge, it is also a social challenge. As we advocate in an amendment, which we hope will be adopted, we cannot allow a disorganized transition to lower labour standards or sever the potential for job creation in the energy sector. That is why, as we have highlighted in the report, it is important to move forward with the social partners in defining a new energy model.  Renewables should also be an opportunity to alleviate energy poverty, adapting market rules and providing social guarantees for those households that cannot access a basic right such as energy.  I hope that the debate will allow bridges to be re-built and support for a report of undoubted importance strengthened.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-06-23.json", "name": "Markus PIEPER", "mepid": "28224", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has It is a memorable day today: a British referendum. Incidentally, this is also about subsidiarity and cutting red tape, and we will certainly have to discuss that here today. Improving energy efficiency is a win-win situation. For the environment, more energy efficiency means less emissions of pollutants and CO2, with equal energy input, and for consumers more energy efficiency means less costs, for energy security more energy efficiency means more security of supply. In this respect, the Energy Efficiency Directive is an investment in Europe's future, if properly addressed. The result so far is correct. We will achieve 20% energy savings by 2020, not only because of European regulation, which is not properly implemented everywhere, but also because of the self-interest of businesses and consumers in reducing energy consumption. Thank you very much to the citizens and businesses of Europe for this. The European environmental record in general is a success story. We are world champions in terms of CO2 savings, the expansion of renewable energies and energy saving. However, consumers and businesses also pay a high price for this. Firstly, electricity prices for commercial and private customers are among the highest in the world. Decades of excessive feed-in tariffs are having an effect in many Member States. Secondly, energy-intensive industries are struggling to survive in Europe. New investments have long been made only outside the EU. Thirdly, bureaucracy is sprawling – ecodesign labeling, pollution control laws, ETS, emission reduction, building directive and so on. Of course, any legislation is justified, but we neglect the interactions, including, incidentally, with the uncoordinated national energy policies. The result is a lot of bureaucracy, but there is also an influence on, for example, the price of allowances in emissions trading. We deplore their decline and then punish companies for the mistakes we have made, including companies with ever-increasing costs. This cannot continue. I have taken this on board with the example of the Energy Efficiency Directive and I am grateful that many points have also remained in the report, namely that we need to move more towards innovation for efficiency and not just rely on the need to save, that the flexibility of the directive remains, so that the Member States have incentives for new measures. The reporting bureaucracy and the need for more coherent legislation are also indicated, at least in the report. Until then, we will agree with the majority in Parliament. What we – or what I do, as rapporteur – do not support at all is a 40% savings regulation, in other words, savings obligations for energy consumption. This is not about efficiency, it is about banning the consumption of energy. We could do that if Europe were in a bad position, but the facts speak a different language. Greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by just over 25 percent since 1990, while Europe's gross national product has increased by almost 50 percent. With 25 percent fewer pollutants, we have generated 50 percent more. If that is not an efficient balance sheet! So anyone who wants a 40 percent ban on consumption now is absolutely supplanting the realities. That is why I would like to ask again, my urgent request to my colleagues in the S&amp;D and the Liberals: support our amendment by which we want a target corridor of 30 to 40 per cent, but not as coercion, but as orientation. If we fail to follow the road, we can still follow up with legal measures, but first of all we want to give people and businesses a confidence boost: the EU is the world champion of the environment, and we all want to help to develop this position!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-06-23.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a satisfaction to be before you today to take part in this debate on two of the most important pillars of energy union: energy efficiency and renewable energy. In addition, addressing them at the same time reflects the important role they both play in meeting the ambitious climate commitments made during the last Paris Summit. And the debate takes place at a very appropriate time, when we are finalizing the revision of energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation, which will see the light in the second half of the year. Let me begin by thanking the two rapporteurs for their excellent work on these important initiative reports. I shall begin with Mr Pieper's report on the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Directive. As you know, we are preparing revisions to the Energy Efficiency and Energy Efficiency Directives in buildings. The purpose is to set energy efficiency targets by 2030 and to ensure that we have at our disposal the right framework and measures to achieve them and, by focusing on buildings in particular, we are prioritizing sectors with the greatest energy saving potential. The report reaches a number of conclusions which we will take into account in the preparation of the revisions I have just mentioned. I fully agree with the conclusion of the Pieper report on the need to systematically include the principle of energy efficiency first in our energy and climate policies. Let me also tell you that Europe needs an explicit target by 2030 that is integrated into the legislation. It will be important when sending a positive signal to investors and legislators and for boosting the long-term investments we need to meet our goals. But the revision of our energy legislation needs to go far beyond an end goal. We need to take compliance and enforcement seriously. In this regard, let me underline the fact that the revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive will address Article Seventh, energy-saving obligations. The recent evaluation showed that Member States have taken this policy seriously, taken necessary measures and established control and verification systems to achieve the savings needed by 2020. It is hoped that by 2020 this article will be able to contribute about half of the savings of the Energy Efficiency Directive. We can say that it has been an effective instrument, but we now need to align it in line with the overall framework for 2030, so that it can contribute to the ambitious emission reduction targets defined at the European Council in October 2014. It will also be important to encourage private investment in our buildings, a sector with enormous savings potential, a key sector not only to achieve our energy efficiency goals, but also to address energy poverty, reduce high energy bills and reduce health risks. The revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive in buildings will pay particular attention to these objectives. I would once again like to thank the rapporteur for having incorporated these important issues into his report, and we have to work closely on these legislative proposals. Of course, this is also true for the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive. This is a policy that has worked well. With a share of renewables of 16% of final energy consumption in 2014, the European Union and a majority of Member States are moving well towards the 2020 targets. All but one country is ahead of their indicative trajectory and nine have already reached their 2020 targets. This has allowed us to cut our fossil fuel imports, reduce emissions and develop a competitive renewables industry. However, some Member States need to increase their efforts to live up to the intense trajectory we need to maintain in the coming years. That is why we are fully focused on the implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive and I know that this is fundamental to the European Parliament. But, as the report rightly points out, we also need to look to the post-2020 period. The revision of the Renewable Energy Directive will be the central pillar of these efforts and will be reinforced by the redesign of the electricity market and the Energy Union's governance initiative. As many of you have asked, we want to put on the table a robust legal framework that gives stability to investors and helps achieve our goals efficiently. Our ambition is that revision of the Renewables Directive, the new design of the electricity market and the strengthened emissions trading system are key drivers to boost new investments in renewables that help Europe become number one in this sector. In the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive we aim to address many of the concerns reflected in its amendments. For example, how to better harness the potential of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector and how to incentivize the role of the consumer. We are also dealing with removing administrative and institutional barriers that delay investment in Europe. Let me give you an idea of the elements we're considering. First, on goals we need to build on the progress made by 2020. That's why we're exploring setting the 2020 national targets as a starting point. Secondly, the Directive will focus on three sectors which will help us achieve our objectives: electricity, heating and cooling, and transport. In particular, we share your concern about slow progress in the transport sector. Thirdly, another key point will be the role of renewable support schemes. In our proposal we will consolidate the shift towards a market-based system for renewable support mechanisms and towards the convergence of national support schemes. As I mentioned, we plan to move towards better market design, which, together with a strengthened emissions trading system, will make it easier for renewable energy generators to make the most of the market profit. And finally, we have seen in this report that the issue of bioenergy sustainability criteria is of considerable interest. The Commission is working on an improved sustainability policy for biofuels and biomass. Biomass is the main source of renewable energy in the European Union and we are looking for a pragmatic approach that ensures significant emission savings, avoids risks of significant environmental impacts and avoids unnecessary administrative burdens, especially for small power plants and small forest owners. Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by stressing the importance to me of this debate and the European Parliament's contribution in the preparation of future legislative proposals. I would like to mention one last aspect which I think is of great importance in achieving the objectives we have set ourselves. I am referring to the need to mobilize investments in these sectors. The European Fund for Strategic Investments has opened the door to new possibilities that we must make an intelligence use of, and I would like to call on local, regional and national authorities to make greater use of this instrument. I will conclude by saying that the Commission is very grateful for these two reports. I assure you that in the forthcoming legislative proposals we will be ambitious and ensure that energy efficiency and renewable energy are the key drivers of our Paris commitments and our transition to the decarbonisation of our energy system, and I look forward to working closely with the European Parliament to make this noble cause possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-06-23.json", "name": "Marijana PETIR", "mepid": "124749", "text": "   Rapporteur on the opinion of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee. Mr. President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report and thank her for her cooperation.

Expected progress is being made in the heating and cooling sector, but I am concerned about the lack of progress in the transport sector.  The lack of progress in this area is caused by the uncertainty of investing in biofuel production, so I expect the Commission to give a clear perspective to producers of advanced biofuels through a new legislative proposal on renewables for the post-2020 period.  I regret that the Environment Committee's position on the need to assess the positive role of European forests as a carbon sink and the sector's full potential in achieving future objectives did not enter the final report.

Mr President! My speech is about the report and the progress report on renewable energy. I would like to thank López Bermejo for good and constructive cooperation in the negotiations, which have not been easy. There are some clear dividing lines between the political groups on this issue. On the one hand, there is the more realistic wing, which recognises that objectives must be achieved, otherwise they are worth nothing. On the other hand, there are the unrealistic ones who simply want higher targets at all costs and believe that an own-initiative report by the European Parliament will move by the agreed objectives.  I think we should recognise that the Heads of State or Government have set themselves sensible, impactful objectives that they have committed themselves to achieving. I would have liked it higher, but the 27% renewable energy by 2030 is a great commitment and shows our investors that the EU and its Member States have ambitions and will deliver on them. I hope that my colleagues in the European Parliament across political groups will remember this when voting on the matter today.  I would like to stress that the EPP fully supports the diversification of EU energy sources with renewable energy centrally placed to achieve a more sustainable energy mix in Europe and deliver on our agreed objectives. We recognise and support renewable energy as a prerequisite for achieving sustainability, growth, competitiveness and creating more European jobs. In the EPP, we think it is important to find long-term and durable solutions. We are working to ensure that renewable energy works on market conditions and we reduce the cost of renewable energy. This is necessary to bring energy prices down, benefit European businesses and energy consumers. I have noted with satisfaction that a number of the PPE's priorities have been included in the report. This includes respecting member states' competences to determine energy mixes, the need for cost reduction and reasonable market conditions, including the gradual phasing out of State aid to market-mature technologies.

The current directive is a good basis for achieving our energy and climate objectives, including those ambitious commitments from Paris. However, this will only be achieved if some of its shortcomings are remedied, in my view, in particular by excessive flexibility. As a result, we are lagging behind the targets set and, if nothing changes, we will not be able to achieve energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020. I believe that MEPs within the ITRE Committee have made it clear that a more effective framework is needed.  I would like to mention at least a few points that I consider important in this report. First and foremost, it is a question of a binding 40% energy efficiency target. I believe that Parliament should repeatedly and clearly support this commitment, because if we make it a discount, we will close the way to higher savings, to promote innovation, and also to strengthen our independence from fossil fuel imports.  Secondly, I would like to mention the issue of energy poverty, which was practically neglected by the original proposal. I am glad that the report is now paying close attention to energy poverty. The report appeals not only to the Commission, but also to the Member States, as both the Commission and the Member States have so far been very distant on this issue. In this sense, we call for the strengthening of Article 7 and also propose that clear targets be set in national energy efficiency action plans.  Finally, I would like to mention an important issue of contradictory legislation. Parliament is currently discussing a revision of the Emissions Trading System (ETS), which is linked to energy efficiency legislation and other legislation and where significant overlaps are currently taking place.

First, it is important that we try to do it with less energy. And there is still a great deal of potential here in the European Union. Almost half of our energy goes to heating and cooling. But this energy is still lost far too often, literally through windows and doors. Moreover, by focusing primarily on energy efficiency, we are ensuring that citizens themselves can reap the benefits of the investments they make in the environmental field.  As far as renewable energy is concerned, we in Parliament should not set targets that are unachievable. Yes, we must be ambitious, but let us also remain realistic.

Two huge energy bids in Mexico and Morocco were won by renewable programmes – not because they were renewable, but because they promised the cheapest energy, and that was renewable. The other report says that Europe is losing its reputation as a renewable energy leader, and that is a very, very worrying report. Last year, investments in renewable energy in Europe plummeted by 21%, while spending in the rest of the world boomed. That is what this report is saying and that is extremely worrying.

In Italy they were all making fun of us, saying; \"you will never make it, without money, without newspapers...\"; everything and everyone was against us. Yet in Italy, after only ten years, the same people now tell us: \"you were right, hold on, continue, represent hope\".

But we, ladies and gentlemen, do not want to stop at Italy, we want to bring the utopia of change to Europe, to these classrooms, to all the Member States. Energy is today's theme. We want the Eu ropean Union to set binding targets of 40 % for energy efficiency and at least 30 % for renewables, which are translated into specific national targets. We want a chapter on prosumers to be identified, which will no longer leave them at the mercy of the dancing moods of the various governments, identifying a shared definition of the term, the rights of self-handling, self-consumption, storage and sale of excess energy, forms of support, investment and the elimination of the main administrative and market obstacles. We simply want the energy union to really have its citizens at its heart and to allow Europeans to escape forever from the constraints of energy geopolitics. We want to respect the Paris agreements and leave fossil fuels under the ground, which is the only guarantee to prevent climate catastrophe. None of us can predict today's vote and, above all, our future, but we know for a fact that nature is giving us signals: floods, droughts, migration, competition for resources. Technological innovation and social innovation will bring about the necessary changes. Politics and the economy will sooner or later have to bow their heads to change and adapt to the facts.

Mr President, Commissioner Caete, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and for his work It is clear, of course, that the previous speaker has a great deal of talk about the outcome in Rome and Italy, but the things we have to discuss today are just as important, namely the two reports before us, which are intended to show the state of implementation in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency. This level of implementation is quite different. Indeed, if Member States are well on track to meet the 2020 targets in the field of renewables – with a share of 15.3 percent in 2014 – the level of implementation of energy efficiency will be less good. Here we see that 27 out of 28 Member States have an infringement procedure pending, that the level of implementation varies widely between Member States and that the 2020 targets in the area of energy efficiency are unlikely to be met. Against this background, I do not know whether it was a good thing to reduce the flexibility provided for in Article 7. Member States were free to choose their mix of measures in the field of energy efficiency in the past, which is no longer possible to this extent. Exceptions should be quantified, phasing-in and early-action measures should no longer be valid. I also consider it unrealistic to increase the efficiency target to 40 percent. It is better to take this amendment with you and then provide for the corridor. We should not set ourselves unrealistic targets.

Because it causes internal tensions between the Member States, between us and we have a great task to do. Namely, we would like the Paris commitments to be implemented worldwide.

From here, I wanted to conclude that we have had the opportunity for these two debates and this whole process in Parliament — not only today — both in terms of energy efficiency and renewable energy, two key elements in achieving the objectives set out in Paris, and I believe that what substantively needs to be done is to achieve those objectives. We are talking about 20% in terms of renewable energy by 2020 and 30% in energy efficiency. Nothing produces more frustration, nothing causes more disaffection towards representative institutions and political institutions in general than promising the unattainable and not achieving what one has really committed onese. So I'm very pleased that we're actually on that path and that's how we have to go on.

However, countries such as those in Eastern Europe are lagging behind in energy efficiency. On the other hand, increasing the percentage of green energy in the mix did not solve the problem of the poorest Member State of the European Union – our energy dependence on Russia. The destruction of the coal industry made Bulgaria even more dependent on Russia. Instead of solid fuel, own production or imports from Ukraine import more gas from just one source.

Then we should find a balance, a balance that these two reports are tentatively trying to achieve. But beware of some risks. The first is that Europe has historically achieved excellent levels of sustainability in the context of economic development that can also protect the environment, without the need for the gun pointed at its temple. It did so because it is in our entrepreneurial culture – with the peace of the opponents of liberal culture – to build a model of development around man, certainly with flaws, but this is how our entrepreneurs work.

Firstly, subsidies for renewable energy have come to the fore here. They are quite a problem for the entire European energy market at the moment. The energy market is a mess and, in fact, no one is investing in energy now without receiving long-term production aid or a guaranteed price. We should get rid of this now. It is justified that subsidies can be directed at renewable energy research, product development and investment, but if renewable energy is based on receiving ongoing support, it is not sustainable. We see that last year Europe invested the least in renewable energy in nine years and that investment fell by 20%. It shows that we need to have more perseverance and that investors also know which way we are going.  The second question relates to the sustainability criteria that we want to speed up here with regard to biomass.

In order to achieve that challenge we do not have so many tools. We have to produce energy in another, different way, and that is renewables, and we have to consume less energy and that is energy efficiency. Those policies work together, and we have to the deliver new policies. In the past, we had regulations in cars, we have many targets, in the past we had national binding targets. The October 2014 Council decided other things on global targets, binding targets in renewables, but at European Union level, non-binding targets in energy efficiency – so now we have to take our responsibilities and deliver the legislation to achieve our Paris objective. For that, we have work in all the areas simultaneously, and Mr Turmes was right: the first thing we must set right is a market design for electricity which is fit for renewables because the current market does not give price signals, it is not fit for renewables, there are not enough interconnections so we must first of all have a new market design which is fit for renewables. Then we have to deliver a renewables legislation which is ambitious and with all the incentives for Member States to go for renewables, with all the innovation support under Horizon 2020 in order to set programmes for the European Union to deliver new technologies and higher performance. 60% of the package of renewables are made in the European Union. We have to have that leadership in technology in the future also, and we have to have ambitious governance to deliver our objectives. In energy efficiency, directives are the most difficult to implement. It is the area in which more infringements are launched in the Commission because the first thing the Commission is doing is enforcing the current legislation to make sure we achieve our 2020 targets. In renewables, we are achieving our targets. Many countries are in their trajectory. It is true that some countries will have to make additional efforts, but we are on track for 2020. For 2030, we have to make many additional efforts with a more difficult framework because we do not have national targets which are binding. So we will have a major challenge, and I appreciate all the support of this Parliament because the debate has been extremely constructive and the members of the Parliament are asking the Commission to deliver ambitious initiatives. The Commission will work on that pattern and I am pretty sure there will be scope for very good cooperation amongst us. Some Spanish Members have addressed the issue of the remuneration regime for renewables. The Commission's purpose is to design a more market-oriented renewables remuneration regime, an electricity market that sees favourable price signals for renewables; access to renewable energy production and distributed production and self-consumption to networks with good harmonised regulation; approaches to more market-oriented remuneration systems. And, therefore, we will work on regimes that are predictable, signal to investors and ensure legal certainty.  I must say that in the current system, Member States have a wide freedom to decide how they support renewables, provided that they meet the objective set out in the Directive. The Commission is currently finally completing its analysis of the reform of the remuneration regime for renewables in the case of Spain and will undertake a dialogue with the Spanish authorities if it identifies a breach of European law.  In this analysis, the Commission is also taking into account the recent rulings of the Spanish Supreme and Constitutional Courts, which have endorsed the decisions taken in turn by the Government.  With regard to State aid, the Spanish authorities have informed the Directorate-General of Competition of both the old and the new remuneration regime for renewables. The Commission has a legal obligation to examine whether they are compatible with internal market rules, and the Directorate-General for Competition is currently at that stage of compatibility analysis.  As regards Mr Benito's speech, I must state — and Mrs del Castillo said this — that I have always been willing to appear before the House, before the committees, as long as I have been invited; and it is true that the Committee on Legal Affairs of this Parliament invited me on 12 July and I will be happy to appear before it.  In my arraignment I will have the opportunity to demonstrate that innuendos and affirmations which Mr. Benedict does towards me are unfounded; and I can assure Mr Benito that, in all the public positions I have held, I have always acted with full dedication, with complete transparency, with respect for legality, with integrity, independently, always defending the public interest and, now, the European interest, developing an ambitious climate policy with a sustainable energy policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 2, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 65, "date": "2016-06-23.json", "name": "Paloma LÓPEZ BERMEJO", "mepid": "125047", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I am once again grateful for the tone of the debate and the contributions of my colleagues. I want to expand one of the points of my initial speech. The issue of the development of renewable energy is also a matter of energy sovereignty. Europe cannot assume a growing bill for its energy imports and expose the Globe's fossil resources. On the contrary, it must improve energy efficiency and savings and promote energy production on the continent itself. In these circumstances, conventional European fossils play a supporting role in the energy transition, but it must undoubtedly pivot on the development of renewable energy. It is also a challenge that is also essential to face for reasons of ecological sustainability, and at this point and these problems, well reflected in today's debate, we are trying to respond in this report. Commissioner, I disagree with your optimism that by 2020 some countries will be able to achieve the stated objectives and the objectives set. And by 2030 we will not give up anything fixed by the European Parliament. Among other things, because this House is sovereign with regard to the Council. First of all, we have tried to give coherence to Parliament's past requests on the development of renewables with the reality of the Member States. But what we cannot tolerate is, under any circumstances, less ambition than has been demonstrated so far. The current Renewables Directive must be implemented in its entirety, and by 2030 we need more ambitious targets than those set by the Commission and the Council. In addition, mechanisms that have proven their efficiency to facilitate investment in renewables and their preferential market entry, as well as greater energy democracy in the self-consumption of public investment, should be promoted.

If a 40 percent ban on the consumption of energy comes through, everyone will notice this not only through rising rents, because the apartments for the socially weak are then energetically really luxury. No, please explain to me how we are to bring about the change to electromobility: we will soon need a gigantic amount of electricity for this, and most of this electricity will soon come from renewable energies – as Mr Caéete has mentioned, the importance of the expansion. But we are now saying: energy saving also for energies that do not pollute the climate at all. That does not go into my mind as to how one can be for such a line, and where should the additional electricity needed in huge quantities come from, for example in Denmark, Sweden, if they want to switch to electromobility? Yes, from the socket, the Greens are familiar with that, And I know that.

(Applause) Good relations with Palestine are of great importance to us in the European Union. The EU is Palestine's main partner in financial, economic and humanitarian cooperation. But a stable and functioning Palestine is also a moral task for all of us. Mr President Abbas, I would like to thank President Abbas for his You have dedicated your life to a mission: the non-violent commitment to freedom and the recognition of Palestine. You were one of the architects of the Madrid Peace Conference and the Oslo Accords, which are still a milestone in the Middle East peace process. Your presence today, Mr President, is a strong signal in this House yesterday, following the speech by the President of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, that the will for a sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine remains alive. In this context, I also appreciate the tireless work of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission, Federica Mogherini, who is with us this morning, as he did yesterday. Welcome to you, Mrs Mogherini! (Applause) In September 2015, the European Parliament voted in favour of a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as the capital of both states. In this two-state solution, a state of Israel that lives in safety – as I emphasised here yesterday – and an independent, democratic, cohesive and living and viable state of Palestine – I would like to emphasise this today – should live peacefully and safely side by side. To guarantee this, there must first be an end to the violence. No political objective justifies blind hatred, hatred or even terrorism. This is not the first time that the European Parliament has condemned the continued expansion of Israeli settlements and the rocket fire of Israeli areas by militant groups. In its resolutions, it called for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip and for reconciliation among the Palestinians. Mr President Abbas, I would like to thank President Abbas for his excellent work on this It is precisely this reconciliation – the willingness to forgive and empathize with both the Palestinians and the Palestinians and the Israelis – that is an elementary part of the peace process that you are advocating.

(The following is a transcription of the interpretation of the original speech from Arabic into English.)  – Mr President, in the name of Allah, the most merciful, may I first of all thank you for this invitation to address you in your Assembly.  First of all, let me express my admiration for the democratic model you have constructed, the diversity of cultures and languages and different governments. For us, this is a mirror which reflects great civilisation, great culture and reflects the human principles represented by your European peoples.  I would like to express our respect for you and our thanks to you for the positions you have taken up which honour you. You have taken up positions which militate in favour of the restoration of justice and peace in my country, Palestine. For my people, I would like to convey their greetings, and I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to give you a number of pointers for you to think about in your various committees in this Parliament, so that you have some guidelines in thinking about our situation as we seek peace in our part of the world.  I would also like to thank you all for all the different kinds of aid you have given, aiding us in institution-building and helping us establish the bases for a democratic regime which will be stable in the future and which will be able to comply with international criteria for democracy, and in particular we want to establish a proper rule of law and proper respect for human rights.  So once again, our thanks to this Parliament for the recognition you have given our country. Thank you so much for recognising the State of Palestine. I would also like to thank all the national parliaments which, for their part, have recommended to their governments that they should recognise the State of Palestine.  I would also say this. When talking about a two-state solution, if you believe in a two-state solution you have to recognise both states and not just one of them. A hundred years have passed since the Balfour Declaration back in 1917. Sixty-eight years have passed since al-Nakbah, the catastrophe which we suffered when in 1948 the Israeli forces were guilty of slaughter and massacre in our part world, and this led to hundreds of thousands of our citizens having to migrate. This turned these hundreds of thousands of people into refugees. More than 485 of our villages were simply flattened, villages where our people were living peacefully and had lived peacefully for thousands of years. In 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza and once again, thousands of our people were forced to migrate from Gaza and from the West Bank. So the least you can say when looking at Palestine is this: Palestine as a country, and as a people, we have a history, an identity. We are a country, we are a geopolitical entity and this country has suffered a series of historic massacres. We have suffered unprecedented occupation, the sort of occupation of a country we have not seen elsewhere in the world in the 20th century or in the 21st century. And all this in full view of the international community and in full view of the international authorities.  We have been through so many black periods throughout history, and we are still going through a black period. Our Palestinian people are suffering from occupation, from suppression. We are suffering from arbitrary action by the Israelis. We are suffering from racism, hateful racism, and our people are living abroad as refugees. They are living in poverty, in a very precarious situation.  Now we have decided to resist. We have decided to remain in our country, on our land. We have decided to continue our efforts to put an end to Israeli occupation by using political, diplomatic and peaceful means. We have been successful in these efforts at international level, but we are not making progress in terms of our relations with Israel.  We have used every effort in order to implement the agreements which have been signed. We have complied with our commitments, and we are calling on the Israelis to comply with their commitments, but the Israelis refuse to respect these commitments and continue to oppress us and to dominate us in every area of life.  The Israelis are trying to change the situation in the City of Jerusalem. They are trying to change its historic identity. They are infringing holy places – Christian and Islamic and Muslim. They are continuing to build their colonies by confiscating our territory, by flattening our houses. Israel is still imprisoning thousands of our people.  Today, Israel is still a violent state. Every day we see cases of extreme violence for which the Israelis are guilty. We have seen the colonists have burned down houses only recently in which people were living. In particular, a young man died in the latest attack from the Israelis when his house was burnt down. Every day we see murders, extra-judicial killings. And this Israeli attitude, this Israeli behaviour is such that some Israeli politicians have started criticising their own government, for example, Mr Herzog, leader of the opposition, or Ya’alon, a former Army leader, and Ehud Barak, and a former head of the armed forces, and journalists. All these people – Israelis – announcing that the Israeli Government’s behaviour is fascist and racist, and I am quoting them there.  Resolution 181 of the United Nations divided the historic territory of Palestine into two states in a more or less fair sharing out of the land, but since then Israel has used force of arms to occupy 78% of historic Palestinian territory. This was back in 1948, but that was not good enough for Israel. It occupied the rest of our territory in 1967. People still quote that United Nations Resolution– Resolution 181 – today and they say that this resolution should not be interpreted literally all the way through, but only certain paragraphs should be implemented. I would say that United Nations Resolution 181 has to be applied in its totality.  Despite international resolutions, United Nations resolutions and the efforts of the international community to find a solution, a two-state solution, despite all these efforts our state is still not independent, despite the fact that we are now a member state of the United Nations, and that since 2012. And we are now a member of a great number of international organisations, as well as the United Nations organisation. We have ratified a great number of international conventions, we are recognised by 138 states around the world.  In order to make progress towards peace and to put an end to our years of suffering, we have now accepted the establishment of the State of Palestine on an area which is less than a quarter of the area of historic Palestine; 22% of our historic territory. We have accepted that as a state, respecting the 1967 borders, and that is an enormous sacrifice.  Since the Madrid Conference and since the Oslo Agreements we have made no further progress. We are going round in circles in negotiations. We are just negotiating for negotiation’s sake at the moment. And this is being imposed upon us by Israel. They are trying to gain time in this process so that they can change things on the ground, which will make it less and less possible for us to find a two-state solution.  Today Israel is carrying on with its colonisation. It is continuing to expropriate our land. It is building walls and all this is also being done on a racist basis. Under our other United Nations resolutions calling on Israel to put an end to colonisation, these resolutions have called on Israel to do away with colonisation, to reverse it, but nevertheless, Israel is carrying on with these projects. We are calling on Israel simply to freeze this colonisation so that negotiations can properly start, but Israel still does not stop colonising. It is carrying on.  Furthermore, over the last six years, Israel has started at least three wars in Gaza. It has killed thousands of people. Israel has killed dozens of Palestinian families. There are hundreds of families which have quite simply disappeared. There is no longer a record of them in our civil registers. These families have quite simply disappeared because of the three wars waged by Israel in Gaza in the last six years. Israel has destroyed houses. It has destroyed factories and since the occupation I can tell you this: one million Palestinians have been jailed by Israel at some time or another. At the moment we have 7 000 of our people held as prisoners of war. That is the bitter reality and the dangerous reality we are facing and is it not time to put an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine? Why is international law not being applied?  (Applause) Why is international law not being implemented in the case of Israel? You have here a state attacking another state. When that happens normally the whole world stands up and punishes the aggressor, except in the case of Israel. Israel seems free to attack us with impunity. Why have the United Nations resolutions been ignored in the case of Palestine and the rights of the Palestinian people? How long is Israel going to continue to benefit from this impunity? How long is Israel going to continue rejecting peace? How long is Israel going to continue ignoring the historic sufferings of the Palestinian people? How long is Israel going to accept the injustice it has inflicted upon the Palestinian people?  Our people want to live in peace and dignity on our territory, like any other nation in the world. Our people do not accept this colonisation. We do not accept this invasion. And we will continue to make sacrifices and to suffer until this situation is righted. That is why we are calling on you to help us. You are our friends. Help us. Help us alleviate this situation. Help us remove the desperation our people are suffering from. Help us put an end to the longest occupation in contemporary history. There are no other such lengthy occupations I am aware of. Help us put an end to this occupation.  It is so wrong that our Palestinian people – one of the most ancient peoples in the region and of the world, with its ancient culture – it is so wrong that this situation continues and that we do not have our own state. Is it not time for our people to be able to live in freedom, to live without checkpoints, to live without controls, to live without walls, to live without checkpoints again I say, the checkpoint set up by the Israeli army on an entirely arbitrary basis? It is time all this came to an end.  Israel has turned our country into an open air prison and our people are living in it. Here in this European Parliament, I would like to repeat: we do not want to wipe any other country off the map. Some people want to wipe our country off the map. This should not be allowed. No country should be allowed to wipe another country off the map. We certainly do not want to. On the other hand, all we want to do is exist, and we will not allow anybody to wipe our country off the map and confiscate our rights. We are still denied our rights, and this only serves to encourage our extremists. That leads to terrorism, that leads to violence. And this gives violent people and terrorists a pretext for doing what they do.  I appeal to you: do not make it possible for the Palestinian cause to continue to be used by these extremists and terrorists. We have to put an end to extremism. We have to encourage them to seek a way of life whereby we can all live in peace and fairness under rule of law, enjoying human rights, so I appeal to the European Parliament and to the European institutions to pursue your efforts, continue your efforts, at political and diplomatic level, so that we can come up with a fair and just solution to the problems of our region , and that means we need a two-state solution using the 1967 borders as your President suggested, and by respecting international resolutions and UN resolutions.  Israel and Palestine have both got close links with the European Union. We both have Association Agreements, we are both members of the Union for the Mediterranean, which means that the European Union is a major actor for us. And this is to the benefit of all parties, to all sides.  I want to be very frank with you. I am normally frank with whomsoever I have to deal and in being frank I would like to try and reply to some questions you may have for me. First of all, we are in favour of a two-state solution. We want to create the State of Palestine on all the territories of the West Bank, respecting the borders of 4 June 1967, with our capital being Jerusalem East, which is currently occupied. We are not against exchanging certain pieces of land as long as they are of equal value, within certain limits. There is also a need to deal with the problem of refugees and there we have to implement Resolution 194 on the basis of the Arab peace proposal, which calls for a fair, just and negotiated solution to the problem of refugees. This is an Arab country proposal which has produced a roadmap based on Resolution 1515.  Do not forget that the PLO has recognised Israel. The PLO recognised Israel back in 1993. So we want peace for everybody in our region and we have accepted that there should be a third territory between the Israeli territory and the future Palestinian territory. This would be in the interests of regional security. But we completely reject the provisional solutions which have been proposed, because we believe that they are a complete waste of time and we do not accept a Palestinian State with provisional borders. Our wish is for the Arab Peace Initiative, which was adopted in Beirut in 2002, to be implemented unamended, the Arab peace proposal.  The Israelis often talk about provocation. Well, I would say that Israeli provocation is never-ending. The colonists are still on our territory and to put an end to any provocation at all, including by extremists, we would like the Tripartite Commission involving Israel, Palestine and the United States to be brought back to life.  This Tripartite Commission was set up in Wye River in 1998 in order to resolve all the problems associated with the mutual proof of provocation on both sides and the United States were seeking to be the arbitrator. We are in favour of this Tripartite Commission being brought back to life with the membership of the European Union as a fourth member.  This would, I believe, show clearly that we are against incitation to violence, against provocation, we are against extremism. And we need somebody to arbitrate here, we think, in this particular situation. If you continue to say that the Palestinians are continuing to provoke and incite violence, we do not agree. The Israelis are doing this as well and somebody has to arbitrate and sort out these mutual accusations. The Tripartite Commission, I think, should be brought back to life and joined by the European Union.  I would also like to say that certain rabbis in Israel have said very clearly, and they have said it very clearly to their government, that our water should be poisoned in order to have Palestinians killed. Now that is provocation, that is an incitation to commit a crime. And we are against this sort of call for violence, this kind of provocation, this kind of incitation. Mr President, I would like to say this. The Palestinian nation would like to live with full sovereignty. This could be achieved very quickly; we could put an end to the occupation very quickly, and if we can achieve this, I think that will be a very positive thing for the world community if we could establish a Palestinian state. A full, independent, unoccupied Palestinian state. We could be a responsible actor on the world stage.  We would have a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital. Jerusalem would be an open city, open to all faiths, especially the three major faiths in the region: Judaism, Christianity and the Muslim faith. We would all have Jerusalem as a capital, as an open city, respecting the three main religions of the region, with free expression for all of them in Jerusalem: Jerusalem which would remain a free open city.  In this way our country could be responsible for its own management, its own government, its own development, its own natural resources. But to do this, we need to regain 70% of our territory and then it will be able to exploit and use all these resources, including our human resources, as for the time being these areas, 60% of our territories, are since the Oslo Agreement inaccessible to us, that is to say we cannot do anything with it. We cannot cultivate that land, we cannot establish industry on that land, it is categorised as a ‘C region’ – Region C – occupied by Israel since the Oslo Agreements.  And in that region Israel has been implementing an illegal project since 1993. Now if we can get that land back, that territory back, I believe we can perform miracles in agriculture, in industry and tourism, and I am wondering why the Israelis are insisting on keeping that land; I really am.  If we could do this, we could develop industry on this territory, develop agriculture, we could create jobs for tens of thousands of young people, we could exploit our own national resources: oil, gas, for example. We could generate clean electricity. We could develop the Jordan Valley. We could develop the Dead Sea region.  We could develop tourist projects, and of course you should not forget the importance of tourism – a pilgrimage in our country, for example, to Bethlehem, to Jerusalem – and in order to do that, we do not need a lot of assistance because we would have all these assets.  And in this situation, I have to say that, so far, the European Union has assisted us, has helped us. You have helped us create an embryo Palestinian state. Now we are going to continue with our efforts to develop a Palestinian state, so that we can enjoy full self-determination and that should not depend on negotiations with Israel. The right to self-determination should not be negotiable. It is a natural right.  So we need your assistance in this situation. We have dozens of educational institutions, universities, all of which are at a very high level. And these assets will allow us to develop and to further develop basic education, organise campaigns for literacy. These institutions will help us do our own research. We can become involved in joint projects with other educational institutions and do not forget, we are a free society, where women are equal to men. They have the same rights and the same duties.  On 3 June, a ministerial meeting was held in Paris. This was on the initiative of the French Government. Twenty-eight states were involved and three international organisations. We are grateful for this noble effort and this will now lead to a further conference on international law and international equality based on the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative which was adopted at the Beirut Summit in 2002. This conference will also be using the roadmap which has been developed by the Arab Peace Initiative.  Now if this major international conference is held, there should be very clear deadlines associated with it. Negotiations cannot start without some deadlines being set, and any agreements should also be subject to a schedule, to deadlines. And then, there should be a follow-up to these agreements, a monitoring arrangement for these agreements athat will be reached, similar to what happened in the case of Iran when you had the 5 Plus One Group, which solved an enormous number of problems in association with Iran.  So we would have to have a 5 Plus 2 or a 7 Plus 2 arrangement, that is to say a monitoring group to monitor the results of this major international conference which I would like to see take place with a view to achieving a settlement in the Middle East.  The European Council at its last meeting adopted a final communiqué to the conference held in Paris on 3 June. And let me say this: I and my colleagues, we support this French initiative. The President of the French Republic, Mr François Hollande, told me some days ago that France was determined to pursue its efforts so that this international peace conference can take place before the end of the year.  He said that the preparatory work should begin soon in order to make sure this international conference is a success. The civil servants and Sherpas, he said, should get to work as soon as possible, and I have to say, as a Palestinian and as an Arab, we Arabs are with you in this initiative. We are with you as well when it comes to combating terrorism and extremism. Here, we are on the same page. What is happening in the Middle East has also happened in Europe, in Brussels, in Paris, and in the United States. We are against terrorism – let me make this perfectly clear – whatever form it may take and whoever carries it out. We are against terrorism.  (Applause) However, in order to overcome terrorism we also need to end Israeli occupation by creating a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, so that Palestine can live in peace and security, side by side with Israel, and that will be a step towards ending terrorism. If this does not happen, we will still be giving pretexts to those who commit terrorism in the name of religion, but once this occupation ends those pretexts will disappear and extremism will be overcome, as will terrorism. There will be no more terrorism in the Middle East nor elsewhere in the world.  The beginning of the problem of terrorism is the problems that exist in Palestine. So the non-existence of the Palestinian state simply perpetuates the problem and that will only play into the hands of the extremists – the violence, terrorists – and many countries in our region and elsewhere have suffered at the hands of these violent extremists.  This terrorism has given rise to a wave of refugees that have fled now to Europe. Among them there are Palestinian refugees fleeing from this situation and we would ask you to treat Palestinian refugees in the same way as you treat other refugees, those who have fled from war, massacres and terrorism, and we condemn that terrorism.  Terrorism gives rise to waves of refugees. But among those refugees there are Palestinian refugees. Of course these internal conflicts that happen in the region are not our fault but when they happen we suffer from them as well. When Palestinian refugees arrive in refugee camps they have to be given the same rights as other refugees. My question is: put yourself in the shoes of a Palestinian refugee. That refugee is the same as any other refugee. They need help and they need support.  Regarding the internal situation in Palestine, I would like to say that we would like to manage our country properly. Currently there is a blockade in Gaza. We would like to put an end to the internal Palestinian blockade and division through an international governance agreement respecting the PLO commitments and international and regional commitments that have been undertaken regarding this region. We would like to create a Palestinian government involving all stakeholders in a national unity government, with all necessary elements in place to meet the commitments we have undertaken.  We have to meet all of the commitments that have been taken on and we are willing to form a national unity government with a view to establishing legislative and then presidential elections in order to overcome the current division and I would like to take this opportunity to once again assert my thanks to the European Union and to all of its Member States for all of the help they have contributed in putting an end to the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the attempts to rebuild the area.  More than 10 000 people have been killed, 100 000 people injured, many thousands of houses were destroyed during the Israeli bombings of the region and all of that was condemned here in the European Union and we have to acknowledge our thanks for that expression of support.  Please allow me to send out a message to the people of Israel from this podium, to the Israeli Government and its political parties. Our hands are extended with a desire for peace. We have the political will to achieve peace and we would ask you: do you have the same desire? Do you have the same political will to achieve peace and to acknowledge the historic injustice that your state has exacted on our country?  You have your history and we have ours. Our history has been, frankly, one of a continued existence in this territory since the dawn of civilization until now. We have constant ongoing rights in our territory, in a sacred place for Christians and Muslims alike. Peace and reconciliation will involve the acknowledgment of our rights and the need for reparation and compensation for damage.  This political struggle has been transformed into a religious struggle. That is an extremely dangerous element for our region. We have to remove religion from this conflict. It is a political struggle and the solution to it has to be political. Using a religious pretext is a genuine threat. It is a danger which we all face.  Peace is in everybody’s interests and I hope that you, Israelis, neighbours, believe in that too. Let us build a peace which does not involve hegemony or colonisation or aggression. Peace and coexistence on the basis of justice, law, respect and dignity for all parties involved, on an equal footing. That peace will be a genuine guarantee of security, stability and a promising future for our generations to come.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your welcome. We are counting on your noble efforts to help us restore peace in our region. Long live Euro-Palestinian friendship that lets the holy land of Palestine be one of peace, stability and security for the Palestinians, for its neighbours and for the whole of the world.  We have a specific interest today for what is happening in Great Britain. We are very closely accompanying what is happening in Great Britain and we would express our support for that process.

It is the committee's task to draw up the necessary recommendations to improve the existing legislative framework not only on tax avoidance but also on money laundering, and to see whether action will be needed to amend European legislation.

Lebanon is a member of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, which aims primarily at deeper economic cooperation with the 16 EU-neighbouring countries in North Africa and the Middle East. The purpose of the vote was to give parliament's consent or opposition to the PROTOCOL to the EU-Lebanon Agreement, while at the same time to make some formal changes to the agreement in relation to the accession of new states to the EU after its conclusion. Given that the agreement is generally aimed at gradually creating a free market between Lebanon and the EU, which could have some adverse economic consequences for Lebanon, I could not support the proposal. In my opinion, in general, when concluding economic cooperation agreements, it is necessary to take into account the negative effects that contracts may have on, for example, agriculture or industry in the country, and to try to limit them as much as possible. It is also necessary to lay down rules on respect for human rights in the treaties and to adjust sanctions for their violations. We will not find any such provisions in the agreement.

This report aims to take into account the accession to the Union of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic.

It also needs another country that will be a buffer for more refugees to arrive in Europe. For the EU, there is little need for a collapsing Lebanon. The country has received thousands of refugees, there are problems with the Syrian border, with Israel, with the presence of the self-proclaimed Islamic State. The main objective of the euro-Mediterranean partnership is the economic integration and privileged relationship of these countries with the EU, and is inseparable from objectives of economic dominance and market colonization.

Hence the need for the regulation that we voted on in plenary, which includes all the measures of the ICATT recovery plan adopted between 2012 and 2014. Various technical measures are envisaged: from the transfer and clogging of live red tuna, to the use of stereoscopic cameras for estimating the quantities of bluefin tuna.  The measures implemented in previous years are yielding initial results and we are witnessing a gradual reconstruction of fish stocks.

The figure of the multiannual plans has potential, but suffers from some of the limitations and constraints inherent in the CFP itself. There are positive aspects, which we highlight: - the definition of quotas takes into account the guidelines of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna - ICCAT; - the Regulation becomes more comprehensive, with several amendments valuing traditional fishing techniques and coastal fishing, regarded as sustainable techniques, in particular through the use of objective criteria for the allocation of quotas at national level; - valuing the role of ICCAT observers. The growth trend in bluefin tuna stocks has led ICCAT to increase its share by 20 %.

The European Commission, in order to act quickly, has of course tried to introduce acts of execution and delegated acts into the proposed regulation, in order to increase its power to the detriment of the European Parliament. But MEPs voted on amendments removing these provisions, in order to defend Parliament's prerogatives. It should also be noted that increased protection is afforded by the new regulation to artisanal fishermen, who use traditional fishing methods such as madrague. These fishing methods are very selective and therefore environmentally friendly.  In conclusion, the amended draft preserves Parliament's control, defends artisanal fishing methods and does not go beyond the recommendations of THE CICTA, i.e. not to impose unnecessary constraints on fishermen.

Tuna is a crucial component of the fish supply. Unfortunately, many fishing countries have sufficient capacity to destroy most of the tuna stock in the world without regulating fishing. To that end, today we are adopting a multiannual recovery plan for tuna stocks. When I look at the document, I can identify three of its shortcomings. The first is that the plan is quite irresponsible. It pays very little attention to the recovery of fish stocks, the essential condition of which is to fish far less than the growth of fish. The second drawback of the plan is socially irresponsible: poorer EU Member States are treated in the same way as the richer, despite the fact that even the development of fishing, but its revival, after irresponsible action to reduce THE EU's fishing capacity, could become one of the engines of sustainable regional development of regional growth. And the third drawback is that the plan does not pay sufficient attention to working with non-EU countries, especially those known for their failure to comply with international agreements.

Indeed, in implementing the recovery plan, the EU should pay particular attention to traditional traps, as these instruments have a very low impact on marine ecosystems due to their low energy needs and low by-catches.

At the same time, however, the EU is a signatory to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT), a regional fisheries management organisation, which regulates the maximum level of catches in order not to affect the biodiversity of the marine fauna in that area. Following scientific studies carried out in recent years, it has been concluded that bluefin tuna stocks have experienced spectacular regeneration, allowing for an increase in quotas set for the EU. In these circumstances, the Commission proposed a uniform and effective approach to Union-wide ICCAT regulations, including technical measures for the transfer and declaration of bluefin tuna catches, the use of stereoscopic cameras, the landing obligation in the event of quota overshoot.

In these circumstances, the Commission has proposed a common regulation for the management of the respective stocks in the Baltic Sea, which includes the maximum permitted stocks for each of the three species, but also for the domestic fish, such as turbot. The document also includes a multiannual approach, encourages small artisanal fishing enterprises and provides for regular reviews every five years for more flexibility.

After the negotiations have stalled, with any agreement to be unanimous on family law, this proposal is up to Parliament in the form of enhanced cooperation involving only 17 Member States. As a reminder, there is already the Convention of 14 March 1978 under the aegis of the Hague Conference, which commits only France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, but which remains open to all other ratifications.  The EU is not intended to legislate on family law. Member States, on the other hand, are free to conclude international conventions.

Although the increasing number of marriages with an international element has become an unquestionable everyday reality of the Union, international married couples are still faced with practical problems when settling their property, such as what law a particular property situation will be governed by or which court will have jurisdiction to settle their property. The result is legal uncertainty, delays in the case and the associated disproportionate costs. Enhanced cooperation will create a clear legal framework for the settlement of the assets of thousands of international marriages in the participating Member States. The property conditions of international marriages will thus be dealt with in a coherent manner, within one applicable law and by one judicial authority. In particular, I appreciate the flexible arrangements for the jurisdiction of the court for the settlement of assets and the principle of uniformity of the applicable law, where the applicable law applies to the property as a whole. This avoids fragmentation of the rules, where different parts of the spouses' property would be the case under different legal systems.

I did not have time to say in the debate yesterday that it is very good that the regulations have passed, but it is a great memento that, after a debate that has lasted more than five years between Parliament and the Council, a plan has finally passed, which is not, in principle, so ambitious. It regulates only certain conflict-of-law rules and certain procedural rules, and the problem is that it has not been adopted by all the States of the European Union, but only by 18 states.  So it's a big warning, a big memento for the future.

The applicable law part is subject to universal application and therefore also allows the law of third countries to be applied. The principle of uniformity of the applicable law, according to which the law on the property consequences of registered partnerships applies to all assets within the partnership, regardless of where it is located, is the greatest step forward. This eliminates the system of apportioning the legal regime of the matrimonial property situation of the couples.

In this place, too, we must repeat the desperate cry for help of the Christian denominations in Congo: like many places around the world, the extremist followers of Islam are committing genocide in Africa. The aggression of the Muslim Defence Force fits well with the overarching Islamist advance that has unfolded in many parts of Africa. Militias that follow the ideology of international jihadist movements aim to proclaim Caliphate under Islamic law across the continent in countries with significant Christian traditions. The latest atrocities and executions in May have forced thousands of families to flee eastern Congo, but religious leaders are trying to hold on to the severely traumatised faithful to the end. The survival of communities is made more difficult by the fact that the constant intimidation has led to the end of ceremonies in churches of Catholic, Anglican and other Christian denominations.

The fighting in eastern Congo stems from several sources, including ethnic conflict, political discontent and regional geopolitics, and this unreliable mix is exacerbated by resource shortages in the impoverished region.

In the review evaluation, experts note that one of the consequences of mass interest in higher education is the growing inequalities within education systems. As the system expands, the gap between the best and worst educational institutions in any country increases, which negatively affects the quality of education, the employability of graduates and social cohesion. It is welcomed that aid to educators has been identified as one of the new priority areas for ET 2020, as the quality of teacher training and continuous professional development programmes still does not correspond to the growing range and complexity of competences. But the reports raise concerns that academics are taking a negative view of the Bologna process and employers are complaining about graduate skills and are critical of the new degree structure.

The quality and effectiveness of training must remain the objectives to be achieved by 2020, but alongside this, urgent measures are also needed at national and European level in the field of education and training for adults seeking asylum who are in Europe. Education remains the key to integration: if national systems are unable to meet this challenge, the risk of social exclusion will be high in the coming years.

While these priorities address unquestionable aspects such as inclusive education, equality, equity, non-discrimination, civic competences, well-being, social cohesion, intercultural dialogue, innovation and support for teaching, they remain a wrap with which to prestige a neoliberal conception of education and training. The Krasnodebski report, in line with the Commission, does not hide the conversion of education and training into business, and guides them to employability rather than knowledge development. It is necessary to recognize the inclusion in the report of aspects such as the reception in this area of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, as well as the gender perspective.

In addition, we have a responsibility to take action against climate change, which can be greatly contributed by an increase in the share of renewable energy sources. In the long term, a policy on energy sources based on national objectives guarantees industry and investors the security they need to invest in electricity generation capacity and transport and distribution infrastructure.  It is important that the definition of the energy mix of the Member States remains a national competence, and each Member State can develop its own sources of renewable energy and shape its energy mix. State aid measures have helped to achieve the EU's objectives in many Member States, but a decisive political push is needed if further, even more serious results are to be achieved.

Wind parks fundamentally change the character of the landscape, wherever they are located. Multi-hectare photovoltaics significantly affect local airflow, as well as large projects of valley water reservoirs. At the same time, the daily and annual distribution of electricity consumption does not correspond in any way with sunlight, wind or precipitation conditions. So we still have biomass and geothermal energy. When comparing the possibilities of individual renewable sources, we find that, on the one hand, there are a large number of administrative barriers (especially when connecting small photovoltaics and installing small hydropower plants) and, on the other hand, there are legitimate concerns of operators of large electricity networks about ensuring the stability of the whole system.

In addition, we have a responsibility to take action against climate change, which can be greatly contributed by an increase in the share of renewable energy sources. In the long term, a policy on energy sources based on national objectives guarantees industry and investors the security they need to invest in electricity generation capacity and transport and distribution infrastructure.  It is important that the definition of member states' energy mixes remains a national competence, and each Member State can develop its own renewable energy sources and shape its energy mix.

Most importantly, the development of renewable energy will significantly decrease energy cost for Europe’s citizens and businesses.

The second message is that many Member States have already achieved the renewable energy targets set for the period up to 2020.

The resolution responds to some of the challenges that the deployment of renewables has brought and calls for an effective solution to them. For example, it stresses that some Member States have neglected their transmission networks and are now unable to accommodate fluctuations in renewable energy – the Czech Republic is also facing the consequences of the shortcomings of the German transmission network. I also consider it important to mention the impact of promoting renewable energy on agriculture.

The European Union and Member States have formally supported this process in recent decades, becoming the world's leading promoters of renewable energies. However, the transition to the sustainable energy production model involves an important regulatory effort, particularly at social, environmental and competitiveness level. The beginning was made by the adoption of Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy, which contributed to the development and diversification of this sector at European level. However, there is a need for a more ambitious political impetus to achieve the objectives set in the 2020 and the next.

In the amendments tabled in the ENVI Committee, I expressed the need to set a binding target of 40% energy efficiency by 2030 to be implemented through national targets and called for binding energy efficiency targets to be set by 2050 in line with the ambitious commitments set by the Paris Agreements to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5°C.  I have also repeatedly reiterated my concerns about the increasing pollution caused by domestic heating systems powered by solid biomasses which produce large quantities of fine dust, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and dioxins which are extremely negative for air quality and therefore harmful to human health.  The implementation of efficient and environmentally friendly alternative solutions must be in synergy with the transition to a low-carbon circular economy.

The development of energy efficiency systems stimulates the search for new and innovative solutions, which in turn stimulates the European labour market and brings climate and environmental benefits. One area where efficiency gains are particularly important is the housing sector. Investments are needed to modernise existing buildings and to encourage energy savings for heating and cooling systems. In the longer term, such changes also entail better and more efficient resource management, which also translates into real savings. Increasing energy efficiency should be an attractive opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises to increase their competitiveness by reducing spending on different energy sources. In a social context, on the other hand, better use of energy resources and the provision of energy at reasonable prices is a key element in the fight against energy poverty within the EU.

The resolution welcomes the flexibility of the directive – Member States can choose the best energy efficiency instrument for them. However, the Commission and the EP itself (EP in the resolution) regret to note that this target will not be met by 2020. The resolution also points out that the instruments for achieving individual energy-climate targets by 2020 are often in competition and are therefore inefficient. It also rightly points to the problems arising from the addition of additional requirements by Member States, in particular bureaucratic ones, to businesses and consumers, which are not required by European legislation.

I voted in favour of this report because, within the framework of the EU's energy and climate policy, it is of great importance by establishing a set of binding measures to guide the EU in achieving the targets of 20% increase in energy efficiency, a 20% increase in renewable energy production and a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions, all by 2020. Unfortunately, the directive has not been fully implemented in the various Member States and although it is possible that the emission reduction target will still be met, the credit will be for the economic and industrial crisis that has hit the EU over the last eight years more than the work done by the various Member States. The EPP rapporteur had tried to approach the reading of this failure of the directive with a perspective that would put industrial interests against climate and environmental objectives, requiring repeated deregulation and flexibility in the revision of the directive expected in the autumn. However, the political and amending work of us and the other more progressive and green forces has made it possible to make a more critical assessment of the problems of implementing the directive, such as the lack of binding targets, by outnumbering the most conservative forces and greatly improving the text.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 2163, "date": "2016-06-23.json", "name": "Milan ZVER", "mepid": "96933", "text": "  Writing. Greater energy efficiency and energy savings are important for protecting the environment and climate, strengthening economic competitiveness, creating new jobs and security of energy supply. This can be achieved through a policy that promotes the efficient use of energy through reductions in appropriate taxes and additional funding. However, the report on the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Directive, as advocated by the Left (with a binding target of 40% savings by 2030 for individual Member States), is unrealistic and does not contribute to a more efficient use of energy.
