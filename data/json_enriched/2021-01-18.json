We are talking about an essential instrument of judicial cooperation and, consequently, one of the foundations of the area of freedom, security and justice. The order, which was introduced by the Framework Decision of 13 July 2002, is undoubtedly the most outstanding achievement in judicial cooperation that we have achieved in the Union and has opened the way for other instruments which have since allowed this path of progress to continue. Replacing the classic extradition procedure, based on mistrust between legal systems, with a surrender procedure based on trust and mutual recognition of judgments was a real qualitative leap for the benefit of the rule of law and the reparation of victims by eliminating spaces of impunity. Throughout the discussion of this report , of which I have had the honour of being rapporteur, I stressed that the trajectory of the European arrest and surrender order is, on the whole, a remarkable success. But at the same time, we believe there is room for improvement. To explore these ways of improvement, this certainly legally complex but convenient and timely debate has been devoted. The order has raised important questions throughout its term which have been largely clarified by valuable case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. We have strengthened this instrument of cooperation in a dual direction. On the one hand, it has clearly placed the delivery procedure within the framework of the fundamental rights and procedural safeguards which it must respect. On the other hand, it reaffirmed the cooperation obligations of the States, avoiding deviations in their application and transposition into national law of the Framework Decision, deviations away from the spirit and letter of that decision. I believe that the Commission is aware of this situation, as is apparent from the report it recently submitted, and we encourage that these deviations be corrected, also, if necessary, through the relevant infringement procedures. The report I am presenting has been built on this balance between effective cooperation and guarantees. The text is clear in proposing that the use of the order must meet criteria of proportionality and coherence with other existing and less intrusive instruments of judicial cooperation, so that, where the same result can be achieved with those instruments, they can be used. I would like to point out, in a clear and conclusive way, that the concern to incorporate a demanding guarantee framework with respect for fundamental rights is clearly present in the text and has been at the heart of our discussions. We have not circumvented the objective factors which are now affecting trust between States, but, in the line of interpretation established by the Court, we want to maintain an attitude of extraordinary prudence so as not to damage this crucial instrument of cooperation. Delivery is the general principle, and refusal to execute an order must be the exception, interpreted restrictively and duly substantiated. The report proposes to expand the current list of thirty-two offences or criminal categories that do not require double incrimination control to incorporate ten new categories ranging from certain types of tax evasion, violence against women, specific web crimes, hate crimes, acts of mass contamination, crimes against public order in the event of serious threat or use of violence or against the constitutional integrity of States involving the use of violence, as well as crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. We understand that the logic of cooperation must lead to new spaces where such cooperation occurs more smoothly between States that protect essential legal goods, between states that are part of and which are recognized as members of a community of law. Precisely to make this cooperation more fluid, we do not overlook the practical aspects that advise strengthening Eurojust's role and means, as well as improving the training of legal operators, specializing national bodies that must deal with delivery procedures and also improving the information available on the implementation of the order. I would like to sincerely thank all the groups for their contributions. We have been able to discuss this issue in the best spirit, and personally I have sought to make a special effort to facilitate a comprehensive agreement that was reflected in the LIBE Commission vote at the beginning of the last December. I would like to stress in this regard that the widely agreed commitments cover the vast majority of the 235 amendments that were tabled. I hope that this consensus will continue and I also hope that those who did not join this initial agreement will be able to do so today. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, no one will deny that security and freedom — that binomial wrapped in what we call the rule of law — faces new challenges, new forms of criminality, powerful technological means used against it, new threats of violent destabilization, new forms of victimisation. The only alternative to impunity is cooperation. The best security for defending fundamental rights is precisely effective judicial cooperation against crime. This report wants to contribute to this reflection, it wants to help strengthen this cooperation with all the guarantees that are part of the legal acquis of the European Union, and for this I ask Parliament's support for the text which is proposed today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Didier Reynders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Zarzalejos, for the work done over the past few months on this report on the European Arrest Warrant. I look forward to having the opportunity today to be here with you to discuss this essential instrument for the area of freedom, security and justice. The European Arrest Warrant is the most effective criminal justice instrument in Europe. It is an essential tool for handing over persons suspected of having committed an offence from one EU Member State to another. It ensures that suspects and convicted persons cannot escape justice within the Union.  As evidenced by the number of warrants issued and executed, as well as the considerable increase in the preliminary questions put to the Court of Justice in this area, the European Arrest Warrant is widely used by legal practitioners and the Court's jurisprudence has played a major role in strengthening a uniform application of this instrument, as well as ensuring respect for fundamental rights.  Of course, as the Commission has already pointed out in its July 2020 report, there is room for further improvement in the functioning of the arrest warrant. This is also acknowledged by the Member States, which adopted conclusions on this issue in December 2020. In your report, you also included a number of suggestions. I would like to point out, already, that the Commission has read this report with great interest, and in particular in the context of our work on improving the arrest warrant. Let me give you some concrete examples. First, on the respect of fundamental rights, I want to underline that there is no doubt that European arrest warrants need to respect our fundamental values. The system is structured on that basis. As you know, the respect of fundamental rights is underlined in the framework decision itself. Clear standards for its application have also been set by the case law of the Court of Justice. In particular, the Court has confirmed that a refusal is possible on fundamental rights grounds as regards detention conditions and the right to a fair trial, as well as in exceptional cases. Moreover, the respect of fundamental rights is also enshrined in the EU's procedural-wide directives, which have to be fully transposed and implemented in all Member States. However, our work is not limited to this observation. The Commission intends to continue to reflect on possible additional safeguards for the protection of fundamental rights. As your report noted, issues of evidence admissibility and remand are particularly relevant and require in-depth analysis. We will be conducting studies on these subjects, in order to take a closer look at the existing problems and the need for possible European rules. Let me turn to your reports' proposal: the modification of the list of offences for which no double criminality check is required. Firstly, I would like to point out that the list as it stands covers most of the offences that Member States consider serious offences within the EU. Having said that, the Commission will look into this issue through a gap analysis to see if further offences would need to be added or whether a more precise definition of the offences as mentioned in the current list is needed. As you know, the Commission is also working on an initiative to expand the list of Euro—crimes with regard to hate speech and violence against women. This will result in more common EU offences no longer requiring a double criminality check. Moreover, any possible modification of this list would not just affect the functioning of the European Arrest Warrant, but would likely also have an impact on all of the relevant material recognition instruments that contain a similar list, such as the European Investigation Order. Another point. The Commission welcomes the soft law measures recommended in your report. As you know, the Commission is already providing funding for training and networks on the European Arrest Warrant, and we intend to continue doing so. We also share your focus on the importance of reliable data. The Commission is currently inquiring about the possibilities to expand the digital actions platforms to judicial cooperation instruments such as the European Arrest Warrant. This will lead to better comparable data in the future. We agree with your focus on the importance of direct contacts and consultation between judicial authorities. I hope we can also improve the situation by a closer alignment with all relevant parties through the European Arrest Warrant coordination group that was recently set up by the Commission.  Finally, we have started revising the Handbook on the European Arrest Warrant. It will contain an update of the 33 new judgments rendered by the Court of Justice on the instruments since the last version of the handbook in 2017. Before I conclude, let me go back to one last point that I think is fundamental. The Commission attaches the utmost importance to the complete and correct transposition of the framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant. So far, we have launched infringement proceedings against seven Member States on transposition issues and we will continue, if necessary, as early as this year. We welcome the fact that some Member States are planning to amend their national legislation to address the deficiencies identified. This is essential work if we are to achieve the optimal functioning of the arrest warrant throughout the Union. I thank you for your attention and I now look forward to hearing your questions and comments on this instrument, which, I repeat, is probably the most important instrument in the functioning of our criminal justice system throughout the European Union and the cooperation, of course, of the Member States in this area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Paulo RANGEL", "mepid": "96903", "text": "  draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. – Madam President, Commissioner, Dear Rapporteur, the European arrest warrant is one of the pillars of the Schengen area; it is a pillar for security, but also for the freedom and fundamental rights of all Europeans.

Mr President, a European area in which freedom of movement can be moved freely across borders needs tools to ensure that cross-border criminals actually go to court and do not escape their deserved punishment. The European Arrest Warrant is such an instrument. And it has proved to be a successful tool. Whereas at the beginning of this century it took an average of one year to exchange a suspect within the EU, we see that today it succeeds in an average of one and a half months. Justice is now eight times faster, and this is partly due to that European arrest warrant, a perhaps little-known but just as important part of our joint cooperation in the field of justice in the EU. It is true that the context has changed in those last 20 years. The digital transformation has also changed the nature of crime and there is therefore a need to adapt this instrument to the present day, for example by adding crimes – which have already been discussed – which have become more relevant in recent years, but also by looking carefully at detention conditions, proportionality and procedural safeguards, and – an absolute prerequisite for cooperation in this area – protection of the rule of law in all our Member States.  Yes, there are challenges to the European arrest warrant, and Mr Zarzalejos has already put it very well in his report, but it does not detract from the fact – as the report also says – that the European arrest warrant has been an extremely important tool, is today, and will continue to be indispensable in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 7, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Juan Fernando LÓPEZ AGUILAR", "mepid": "96812", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the European arrest warrant, by Government Framework Decision in 2002, was an anticipatory giant step in the area of freedom, security and justice. It overcomes the old extradition, a political decision of governments by a guaranteeing, binding and directly operational judicial procedure, which does not also require a double incrimination review on a list of thirty-two offences. Since then it has been the story of a success: 43,000 European arrest warrants have been successfully completed, reducing the times of the old extradition from two years to an average of forty or fifty days. However, the time elapsed — the enlargement of the European Union, which in 2002 had fifteen members and then went on to twenty-seven and twenty-eight – made it more complex, but also more unequal, showing, in the succession of the episodes of crisis chained up ever since, the erosion of the principles of mutual trust and mutual recognition on which precisely the space of freedom is based , security and justice enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, Article 82 of which binds all Member States. That is exactly why the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs which I chair has adopted this initiative report: exactly to examine, reassess and re-en-repulse the European arrest warrant, learning from the lessons of experience. This means addressing the need for training to implement the European detention manual, paying attention to the divergences currently between the different procedural systems and their guarantees in the Member States, harmonising European criminal law..., but also expanding the list, free of double incrimination, to deal with crimes such as gender-based violence, environmental crimes or crimes against humanity or genocide and violence against the constitutional integrity of the Member States. All this, in compliance with the principles of proportionality, necessity and minimum intervention, but above all, relaunching the European order to overcome its restrictive refusal, which prohibits the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and ensuring that in no case does the guarantee of fundamental rights cover up an examination by the requested State of the quality of the judicial organisation or the competence of the states required in judicial matters. If this initiative is approved, as we expect, in this European Parliament, it will be up to the Commission to adopt the legislative initiative.

Thanks to loyal collaboration between the large political groups in this house, we have an implementation report that clearly shows us the blind angles of this cornerstone of judicial cooperation in the European Union, the Euroorder. Minimizing, as I say, impunity in the Schengen area is key. And it also means adapting judicial cooperation to the new times, to the digital revolution, to threats, to new threats to the rule of law. Because the world changes and our rules must improve with those changes, with those mutations also of crime. So we are committed to a mechanism with greater proportionality, which means not using the instrument in misdemeanors, but at the same time being effective in prosecuting the most serious crimes, such as threats to public order in the Member States and crimes against constitutional integrity committed with the use of violence , not forgetting other crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes.

Madam President, Andrew Symeou is a British citizen accused of being involved in the death of a man in Greece and handed over to the Greek justice system by European arrest warrant in July 2009. He then spent ten months in dire conditions of detention and was prevented from returning home until July 2011, when he was exonerated. Two years of a life wasted, away from his loved ones and with a violent interruption of his studies. If this case is emblematic and a little more known than the others, it is not isolated. The consequences on people's lives are dramatic. It is difficult to have figures on these abuses that are due to multiple reasons: disproportionate use for minor offenses, non-compliance with fundamental rights or mere normal police error that a remote hearing could have demonstrated. However, the European Arrest Warrant is an indispensable tool for the development of this judicial cooperation which guarantees a true European Union, and it avoids many problems related to conventional extradition. That is why we must evaluate it with the utmost seriousness and sincerity.  The proper functioning of the tools of cooperation is based on the principle of mutual recognition and implies mutual trust in the legal systems of the Member States, but the deterioration of the rule of law and freedoms in our Union no longer encourages blind trust. In some cases, the independence of the judiciary is weakened, as in Hungary. It is even questioned in Poland.  Today, the immense responsibility lies with the judge concerned by the request to decide whether or not to extradite a person to a Member State, where his rights may not be respected, without genuine European support or resources available to him to investigate and justify his refusal. The European Parliament must therefore send a strong signal that the application of the mandate is accompanied by strong procedural guarantees, both in the issuing state and in the implementing state. Above all, we must guard against any political instrumentalisation of these tools and, in this matter, we deplore a small lack of hindsight, sometimes, of some European parliamentarians, and the importance that Spain's national interests have taken at the expense of a global watchful eye.  It is proposed to add the mention of a country's crime against the constitutional integrity of a country to the list of offences that do not require verification or debate. This opens a terribly dangerous gap. Such a provision would endanger many political activists in the European Union, the notion of constitutional integrity being able to lead to so many interpretations, our Constitutions are so different. We cannot allow conflicts of interest in a Member State to have a police impact on an entire European process.  The European Arrest Warrant can be a very effective and positive tool for victims, for a European Union that guarantees rights and for confronting mafias, major crimes, violence and terrorism.

Madam President, thank you to the services for this tireless work so that we can speak here in your House.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank you for your speeches during this debate. It seems to me, of course, with nuances, that there is a broad consensus on the usefulness of the European Arrest Warrant within the area of freedom and security, particularly for practitioners in the field. It must be remembered that this is really a tool at the heart of this discussion on freedom and security but also justice, I would remind you as the Commissioner responsible.  Perhaps I would like to clarify the framework in which we are involved with practitioners. The arrest warrant procedure is a purely judicial proceeding, and though the Commission can help practitioners with technical expertise, it has no jurisdiction to intervene in the manner in which Member States administer justice in individual cases. The framework decision allows the executing authorities to refuse execution of the arrest warrant in certain cases, in particular for offences other than those covered by the list of 32 crimes for which there is no double criminality check. The executing state may decide a surrender will be subject to the condition that the acts at stake equally constitute an offence under its national law. Thus the outcome of a double criminality assessment may be different from one Member State to another, depending on whether the charge as determined by the issuing state would constitute a criminal offence in the executing state and whether that Member State decided to make use of its discretionary power to invoke this ground for refusal. And the Commission will, of course, as I said, continue its work to ensure that the European Arrest Warrant is properly implemented in all Member States. We have already introduced infringement procedures and, if necessary, we will introduce more. I also note that you share the Commission's desire to improve certain shortcomings in the functioning of the European Arrest Warrant, notably through training, networking of different actors and the adoption of certain non-legislative measures. This is certainly something we are working on and will continue to work together.  We need to improve judicial cooperation, particularly through this tool, but also through other instruments that we will still have the opportunity to discuss, especially in a judicial world that is moving towards an increasingly digital transition.  And, in this context, we will also continue to work to protect, as I have pointed out, fundamental rights. The European Court of Justice is helping us in this area, particularly through its case law, which we will include in a manual for practitioners. It is important that this protection of fundamental rights is also at the heart of the debate on the European Arrest Warrant.  I would like to end by saying, of course, because many have mentioned it, that we will also continue to use all the instruments at our disposal to ensure the rule of law within the European Union, across all member states. But, again, the tool we have before us today is a very effective tool for judicial cooperation.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Hahn, representatives of the Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We are living in extremely difficult times. As always in the European Union, however, major crises often lead to major steps forward and to innovations that would have been considered impossible only a few months earlier. Thanks also to the perseverance of this Parliament, the major decisions and agreements that will be crucial for EU finances over the next seven years have been finalised in good time. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the then Presidency and the Commission on the results. We can now look forward to the Member States' ratification of the own resources decision, which I hope will be swift. I am pleased to be here with you today, together with my colleague Tony Murphy, the Member of the Court responsible for the annual report, to present and discuss the Court's annual report for 2019. Due to the particular circumstances of the current COVID-19 crisis, this year's presentation of the annual report will take place a little later than usual. Perhaps this is even an advantage, since the Committee on Budgetary Control has now made further progress with its work on discharge. The lessons you have all gained in recent weeks in the course of the various hearings can thus already be incorporated into today's debate, and I do not think that is a bad thing. It is particularly important that the political decisions you make in this House or that you agree with are translated into results on the ground and that you can assess what went well and what has not and how things can be improved. That is what our detailed and independent audits that we have presented to you are all about. In the meantime, our findings for 2019 are probably widely known. We continue to give an unqualified opinion on both the reliability of the accounts and the regularity of revenue. In terms of expenditure, the overall error rate we estimate has remained stable – 2.7% in 2019, compared with an estimated 2.6% in 2018. This overall rate, of course, masks the considerable differences that exist between the various policy areas. In the area of competitiveness, the error rate we estimate has increased to 4%, mainly due to ineligible costs. However, the improvements observed in the field of natural resources reduced the estimated error rate to 1.9%, i.e. also below materiality. In the area of administration, as in previous years, we did not determine a significant error rate. In the area of cohesion, we estimate that the error rate, taking into account the corrections made by the authorities of the Member States, is 4.4%, which is lower than in the previous year, but still substantial. Moreover, if the national authorities and the Commission succeed in remedying the shortcomings in the error rates they estimate in the next few years, we may well be able to make greater use of the work of the member states' audit authorities. But it is not so far. I know that the Commission is determined to achieve this objective, but a great deal of effort is still needed at all levels to achieve this in the end. For several years, we have distinguished between expenditure, which we believe involves a high level of risk – such as cohesion expenditure, where management is shared with the Member States – and expenditure of a different kind, where we consider the risk to be low. Expenditure associated with high risk has a significant error rate of an estimated 4.9%, compared with 4.5% in the previous year. What happened in 2019, however, was an increase in the proportion of high-risk expenditure, particularly in the cohesion sector, to 53%. This is not a problem in itself, because cohesion expenditure is usually very useful.  The fact is, however, that the majority of our audit population now has a significant error rate – so the error rate is comprehensive according to our audit understanding. That is why the Court of Auditors has issued a failed audit opinion on expenditure for the financial year 2019 and not, as in previous years, a limited opinion. This is not to be understood as a kind of recrimination directed solely at the Commission – after all, the authorities of the Member States manage around 74% of the Union's expenditure. Each body has a role in the chain, and excessive simplification, as we all know, is ultimately also no solution. However, this should not be seen as a general step backwards in EU financial management. Compared to the situation 10 or even 20 years ago, we have achieved an enormous amount. Moreover, in addition to the overall statement for 2019, our conclusions for the various areas of expenditure are very different. I know that, as part of your work, particularly in the technical committee, you are paying attention to these areas as you prepare Parliament's discharge decision. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen! Let me address three overarching questions that we will face in the future. Firstly, instead of the debate in this House later this week on the nomination procedures for the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which is important, i would rather have seen the European Public Prosecutor's Office actively in its work and see how it is proceeding with real bite in order to protect the European Union's financial interests against irregularities and fraud as if they were national financial interests. It is high time that this authority was finally put on the road and provided with adequate resources, and I am aware of the firm determination of the Prosecutor General and the European Parliament to make this a reality at long last. The Court of Auditors is, of course, keen to support these efforts as much as possible, in accordance with its audit mandate. Secondly, we note that reference is made to the Court's reports as a possible source of information, based on the qualitative assessments carried out by the Commission under Regulation 2020/2092 on a general conditionality regime for the protection of the Union budget. By recognising the obvious, namely that 'there is a clear link between respect for the rule of law and the efficient implementation of the Union budget in accordance with the principle of sound financial management', the EU legislator has drawn a clear line, the implementation of which must now be enforced in practice if necessary. I welcome the fact that several of our recommendations have been taken into account during the legislative process, in particular the position of final beneficiaries or beneficiaries of European funds. Thirdly, we have repeatedly pointed out in our reports that many Member States still have considerable difficulties in making use of the EU funds they are entitled to, regardless of the objectives or requirements set at political level. This has again contributed to a large increase in outstanding commitments, amounting to EUR 298 billion at the end of 2019. As a result, these funds still have to be used for the good purposes intended by the legislator. This problem of delays in expenditure must be addressed as a matter of urgency by the Member States concerned. Let me also take the opportunity of our debate to make two more practical and forward-looking comments. With the start of NextGenerationEU, EU spending will almost double in the coming years. We discussed this in the Committee on Budgetary Control in November, when I last spoke here. I wanted to inform you that we are currently examining what this means for us as auditors in terms of tasks and the resources required. It is clear that there will be an impact on the necessary staffing levels, and I hope to be able to provide you with up-to-date information on this shortly. Finally, I would like to refer to the Court's pilot project, its 'Report on the performance of the EU budget – at the end of 2019', which responds to the desire of many in this House to focus more on the performance of the European budget and the assessment of the Commission's information in this regard. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by saying that, in these times of crisis, the Member States and the Commission have an enormous responsibility for sound and economic management of European finances. Our annual report, which I am presenting here today, makes it clear that further efforts are needed. As directly elected Members of Parliament, you have a great responsibility in the exercise of your legislative and political control function, so that this is also successful.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 31, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, dear President of the European Court of Auditors, dear Tony Murphy, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank President Lehne for his presentation and for the work the Court of Auditors has undertaken to prepare its 2019 annual report. The European Union budget makes an important contribution to our common priorities for Europe. The Commission is pleased that the Court has expressed a clean opinion on the accounts for the 13th year in a row and on the revenue side of the budget. On the expenditure side, the Commission is also pleased that there are positive evolutions. The estimated levels of error for the chapters on administrative expenditure and natural resources are altogether around 55% of expenditure audited by the Court, below the Court’s 2% materiality threshold. The Commission also positively notes that the error rates for the two main blocs of EU expenditure – natural resources and cohesion – decreased compared to last year. Overall, the level of error for the EU budget as a whole remains stable: 2.7% compared to 2.6 of the previous year. The Commission carefully monitors the implementation of the Union budget on the ground in order to identify weaknesses and implement the necessary remedial actions. To do this, it has set up multiannual control systems and strives to ensure that, once a programme is closed after all controls and corrections have been carried out, the remaining level of error stays below 2%. The Commission estimated that this risk, which we call risk closure, is below 1% – 0.7, to be precise – for 2019 expenditure. According to the Commission’s own conclusion, as a manager of the European Union budget, we consider that in 2019, as in previous years, internal control systems were working effectively. Inevitably our more detailed assessment leads to slightly different results than the Court. To put it simply, the Court has a specific mandate and assesses what happens within a year. If you allow me a cinematic reference, the Court takes a snapshot; the Commission makes a movie, and while the snapshot is an integral part of the movie, it does not tell you the whole story. However, the findings and recommendations of the Court, together with ours, do help us to improve further our control systems. Simplification and better controls – not more controls – are key for the future. The Commission also gives the highest priority to the performance of spending. It’s absolutely crucial not only to do things right, but also to do the right thing: that is, to use the funds to achieve the objectives and deliver concrete results for the citizens. In conclusion, I would like to underline that more than ever, we collectively need to strike the right balance between a low level of errors, fast payments, reasonable costs of controls for public authorities and beneficiaries, and, of course, added value. The finalisation of the legal basis for the spending programmes of the new period, including the Next Generation EU, gives us the new opportunity to do so. In this context, the Commission had, for instance, proposed an obligatory use by Member States of a tool which would have allowed to collect and compare information on recipients of Union funding. This proposal has, however, not been retained in the final agreements by the co-legislators. But I would like to use the opportunity to thank in particular the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) and its members for their tireless efforts to achieve this – but finally, unfortunately, it was not possible. Nevertheless, the Commission will nonetheless do its best to encourage Member States to use this mechanism, and it was confirmed also by the Court that this is definitely a potential improvement our for reporting system and therefore also for the quality of our assessments – both of the Court and the Commission, but also the national authorities.

But there are problems, too. All EU spending must be based on simple and clear rules. However, this is not the case at the moment. When you look at the errors found by the Court of Auditors with regard to the contributions received by one Political Party at European level, it is totally inappropriate for a European party to be unable to produce written agreements or receipts for expenditure paid with taxpayers' money. This undermines public confidence in decision-makers, which is vital to the functioning of democracy. It is incomprehensible that the Court of Auditors should have to make a recommendation on this matter year after year over and over again.  Citizens' credit to the political system will be strengthened or weakened at all levels of activity.

I very much welcome the report on the performance of the EU budget and the work of the Court, especially the part that strongly emphasises the outcome and the results achieved following the implementation of the EU budget, which has been one of the main priorities of the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) and Parliament in previous discharges. So we welcome that fact. It is also positive to know that the report concludes that the revenue for 2019 is legal, regular and free of material error. The acknowledgment that there is a significant improvement in the EU’s spending is also encouraging.  However, it is not positive that this year the Court is giving an adverse opinion in terms of expenditure and it sees a deterioration compared with the previous three years. It is also quite surprising that the highest error rates are in competition and research and not in cohesion, which is usually the case. Cohesion remains one of the areas where the risk of error rate is highest.  In the context of the previous discharge procedures, it is important that our priority remains to learn from the previous implementation of the MFF in the various programmes. The aim in the future shouldn’t only be the implementation of the budget, but also the achievement of the results. It is important to draw the appropriate conclusions and to take adequate measures in order to continue limiting the errors in EU spending.  Also, in the context of the unforeseen pandemic, I would like to conclude by welcoming the fact that, just a few hours ago, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) published a review of the EU’s initial contribution to the public health response to COVID—19.

It is indeed one thing to have accounts without irregularities or even errors, yet it is necessary that the means be effectively invested in economically promising projects or policies with important leverage for the development of our values. Every euro spent must be spent efficiently. Commissioner, some of the comments would merit more attention from the Commission, given the new budgetary programme and Next Generation EU with 750 billion. In particular, I remain concerned about the very low absorption capacity of many states. Only 9 out of 27 states have better absorption capacity compared to 2012. The European average is just 40%. How can we revive our economy with such low numbers? What is the point of identifying resources if states are not able to use that money? Moreover, and unsurprisingly, errors are mainly seen in high-risk spending areas, such as rural development, innovation and cohesion.

But that's the good thing - that's the only way financial control works. It must hurt. As rapporteur for the discharge of the Commission in 2019, I am, of course, particularly interested in, and indeed absolutely dependent on, the reports.

I am afraid that too many of us are concerned with considering what we need more own resources for or what programme we could put in place. In my view, it would be much more important to consider how we should be more careful and more economical with taxpayers' money. In fact, the whole parliament should be a supervisory authority. However, we prefer to postpone this task to the few colleagues who are here in the CONT Committee – they are all super committed, and they will do so. Ladies and gentlemen throughout the European Parliament, can I introduce you to this small but effective committee? He is one of the most diligent. Please equip it so that it can carry out its extensive control tasks better. Dear Commission, give us access to all the information relevant to the budget, including DG SANTE. And then, ladies and gentlemen, please strengthen the Court of Auditors with staff and material resources – as the President mentioned – as well as with the mandate for a comprehensive audit law at the EIB. We cannot increase the budget by 85% and adopt six new own resources and then hope that the Court of Auditors will be able to cope with this with the existing staff! Only those who want less control can want this. Let us respect not only the good work of the Court, no, let us strengthen it and ensure that it is not a knight without a sword, but an effective weapon in the fight to protect the EU's financial interests.

I would like to draw your attention to three aspects: firstly, the fact that there is now finally a performance report, secondly, the relatively high error rates in parts of the EU budget and, thirdly, the historic high level of outstanding commitments to be made, in the case of the backlog. We MEPs need the most precise picture possible of the actual performance of EU spending. And this has now been significantly improved by the coherent performance report – this should also be mentioned here. At the same time, the reliability and completeness of the data handed down from many countries need to be improved. The European Court of Auditors, together with the Commission, should press for reliable data from capital cities in order to be able to make truly verifiable statements on the overall performance of EU expenditure. Secondly, in selected areas such as cohesion and competitiveness, error rates are still too high. The deviations of the ECA audit reports from the Commission's own data are also striking here. It is essential to improve the internal control system here. A brief change: For a long time now, her House has been clearly critical of the effectiveness of agricultural policy. The largest EU expenditure item still lacks the necessary effectiveness. The billions of payments are not spent in a targeted manner on biodiversity, climate protection or animal welfare. However, the requirements of the European Green Deal mean that EU funds urgently need to be used more effectively in order to meet climate protection targets. Thirdly, the historical backlog. We are now talking about almost EUR 300 billion, which the Commission will have to make available in the next MFF. Of concern is not only the absolute large sum, but also the fact that the funds of the commitments entered into are significantly higher than those for payments, which could lead to the Commission becoming insolvent.

In general, the Court is becoming increasingly dependent on the Commission's data. I think this is a worrying development – after all, the Court of Auditors should review the Commission. I also believe that the Court of Auditors should concentrate on its core tasks, rather than performance: proper and lawful use of the funds. There really is more than enough to do here. Mr Lehne mentioned it: EUR 298 billion. We have far too many mistakes in the cohesion programmes and in the second pillar of agricultural policy. This is where we should start: more staff for the review directly in the Member States.

Why is only 55% of cohesion spending available in the Arachne Fraud Detection Tool? In responding to this report and before this Parliament, the Commission even stated that it had no statistics on the impact of corruption in 2019. Work not carried out, activities or beneficiaries ineligible and irregularities in public procurement: in the end, auditors come to the conclusion that in 2019, the level of error is widespread. The auditors therefore expressed an unfavourable opinion on EU spending.  As for the European Structural and Investment Funds, EUR 300 billion of commitments had not yet been liquidated by the end of 2019, two years of a backlog of budgets. France had absorbed only 45% of the financing to which it is entitled. And you want Brussels to manage 750 billion euros of post-COVID stimulus?

It seems that 10% of bank agencies for cohesion funds are showing errors, as we are seeing in Slovakia with a large corruption scandal.

We are launching the new discharge procedure, and I would like to draw very clear on two or three priorities. Firstly, I very much welcome the fact that performance, performance, is now also being judged. Of course, we will also learn from this. We are seeing that some administrative procedures are perfectly observed, but the usefulness and the objective of legislation is not actually achieved. At the same time, we are seeing that there is still some over-bureaucratisation, which leads to a great many administrative errors within the Member States. What really depresses me is that it is made so difficult for the Court of Auditors, but also for Parliament and the Commission, for the Member States to get valid data. The data of the national inspection bodies, the data of the national authorities are often not valid. We cannot simply assume that in all countries the data of both national audit authorities and national paying agencies and managing authorities are correct. We often see that there are sometimes misallocations, that there are frauds, that there are massive trickery, that there are false tenders, that there are manipulations and that it is made so difficult to track this. Commissioner, unfortunately, we were unable to enforce the digital system in this MFF, otherwise we would have had to stop the whole MFF.

I come from the private sector and ask the censors committee to be demanding with me, because that's how I could perform the firm.  I therefore ask the Court of Auditors not to be stingy at recommendations to the European Commission and certainly, and to the Member States, because, in the end, we all win if we are demanding in the way we spend our money. I support all the recommendations of the Court of Auditors. I am glad that you have also touched on the idea of increasing the consultation and transparency of the Commission's consultations, and I hope that this will happen, because the recommendations must be taken into account by the Commission. Of course, it has been achieved here, and I repeat, I sincerely regret that our important objectives – social cohesion, competitiveness, the European Development Fund – have had a very high error rate. Perhaps this is where we can find the means, Commissioner, to reduce the error rate. Of course there is shared responsibility here.

Madam President, Mr President, Members of Parliament. Thank you for this good, committed discussion. A few comments, if i may, first of all, if you really look at the evolution of error rates over the last ten years, then there is definitely a significant decline. When I left the position of Regional Commissioner in 2014, the error rate was around 5 to 6% at the time, and I did not think that it was possible to go much lower than that. In the meantime, however, this is the case. Number one. Number two: But we should also see the price in the truest sense of the word. And lest you misunderstand me: I am in favour of every form of control and effective control. However, we must also see – and there is an investigation that goes back several years – that 2 000 full-time equivalents are needed for the discharge process throughout Europe alone. In other words, 2 000 people are working all year round to relieve the European Union in the Member States at European level. In other words, we must strike the right balance between the use of resources and the effect. Overall, I believe that we are on the right track. Secondly, you have complained on several occasions about the large backlog of payments, which is approximately in the order of EUR 300 million. I also complain that there is no misunderstanding! But you also need to see what the cause is. The main reason for this is that a majority in this House agrees with the Member States that there must be the possibility of the so-called N+3, in other words, the possibility of completion and payment up to three years after the approval of a project, particularly in the case of cohesion payments.  I remember when I started ten years ago, it was still N+2, and we did it anyway. And we even had a higher absorption rate because there was just the pressure. In other words, my proposal, as always, is to return to N+2, ideally N+1, and then we would definitely have a smaller number of outstanding commitments. Third and final point: staffing levels. I understand all this. We also had the discussion in the course of the MFF. As you know, we have not received any significant allocations in terms of additional staff. However, I must also say that we must all develop a certain amount of creativity here together. Because yes, we almost have a doubling of the normal budget. But this is a temporary matter – at least from today's point of view. So when we look at how we deal with this issue – on the implementation side, but also on the control side – then we must also be aware that this is a temporary, temporary matter and that we cannot build up a staff ingesstep here, which we may not need afterwards. So together we need not only a certain flexibility, but also creativity.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to thank you for the contributions and for the interesting discussion. A few comments also from my side on what has been said. Mrs Penkova, Mr Sarvamaa have pointed out the areas in which the real problems lie: competition, research and cohesion. The fact is that in 2019, it is precisely in the high-risk areas that more expenditure has taken place than in previous years. That is why, I would like to say, the development towards this opinion, if you look at it realistically, has been a predictable development, if you look at the situation in these budgetary sectors over the past few years. That is how I ask you to understand it. I can only confirm emphatically what the Commissioner has just said: if we look at developments over the last ten to twenty years, we have come forward not just one, but a whole host of enormous steps forward. The fact that there are fluctuations in the result, sometimes in one direction or the other, is perfectly normal, especially since we are also working with statistical methods here. Nevertheless, if we act according to our own self-image, we must, of course, put the facts on the table and also say what is and what we have established. The consequences must then be drawn by the executive and the legislature, as far as it considers it necessary. That is not our job. On the subject of performance reporting, I would just like to say in principle that performance and compliance are two sides of the same coin. Mrs Hohlmeier was right to point out – and there were others – that there is no point at all if we have perfect compliance, for example, the specific tender for the construction of a bridge or for an airport terminal or anything has gone perfectly, and since there are no legal errors in it, but nobody or hardly anyone uses this airport terminal or bridge afterwards. In other words, the question of meaningfulness must, of course, also be examined. This is what, of course, has to be checked as part of a performance test in terms of performance, performance. I also believe that this is of particular interest to Members, to the executive, but also, of course, to the public, whether or not these funds have been spent sensibly on certain objects and products, in other words whether they have also been effective. I think that is crucial. This is why the Court has significantly stepped up performance work in the past. Incidentally, as far as this performance report, this accompanying report, is concerned, we will be discussing in the Court this week how we will continue to do so. As I said, this was a pilot project and experience must of course be drawn from the pilot project, or there may be adjustments here or there depending on the course of this week's discussion, but I believe that in principle – if I may say my personal opinion here – this was a step in the right direction, and I certainly believe that this was the case. , that this makes sense in principle, even if, of course, we still have to talk about details and implementation in the individual use of funds. Mr Kuhs is, of course, absolutely right: financial control must be effective, this is not an issue. However, I also believe that we, as the European Court of Auditors, feel in good hands here in this House and have always received the appropriate support here. As I said, we will certainly come to you with regard to additional human resources and technical resources in the preparation of the next budgets, although we are well aware, as the Commissioner has also said here, that the change in budgetary structures is about – yes, seasonal is perhaps understated, but it is about temporary expenditure. That is why we will continue to make appropriate proposals to you, which means that doubling the budget will not lead to a doubling of staffing requirements. I believe that this is logical and clear and does not require any further discussion. But, of course, we must also be able to cope sensibly with the increased effort. The issue of the reliability of the information we have has also been raised. So anyone who reads this report, Mr Pieper, will notice that we have made very clear distinctions as to where we can use data materials that have been made available to us by Member States or by the Commission and where we cannot use them. We only take such data material, where we are sure that it has the same quality as if it were we are looking at this very carefully and very sustainably. This has been one of the priorities of our activities in the context of the annual report, particularly in recent years. That is another reason why we have had a greater use of resources for the annual report than we might have originally hoped, because these special checks of the data that have been made available to us have, of course, also created additional effort. Mrs Garcia Muoz, Mrs Hohlmeier, Mr Christoforou, and others have also raised the issue of digitisation. The Court will do everything necessary to be prepared for the digital era, which has already begun and which will certainly be of even greater importance. But I would also like to make this quite clear here: this is not something that the Court can do on its own. Some time ago we had an idea from Ernst and Young about the way they audit private companies: same data base, full access to all data at any time, push of a button, complete overview. We cannot do that. We cannot do this because, for example, in cohesion audits, we are dealing with 170 different institutions, institutions, in which we then have to carry out audits, all of which have different data bases, and that makes it impossible. But my dream would be – and this is probably only possible by amending the Financial Regulation with a long lead-up, perhaps over ten years, because it also creates investment and costs, not only here, but also in particular in the Member States – to oblige the Member States and the institutions in the Member States that have to deal with the money in the long term through the Financial Regulation. to provide compatible data. That would be really desirable, i think that would perhaps also be an initiative for this parliamentary term, and that would also make a considerable contribution to us and our work and open up completely new opportunities. I am not sure now whether I have raised all the issues, but I am already over the time that was intended for me. Once again, I would like to express my sincere thanks and wish you every success in the further discussions on the discharge reports.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 50, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Klára DOBREV", "mepid": "197579", "text": "  The debate is over.

For 2019, the European Court of Auditors presented for the first time, together with the Report determining the legality and regularity of the accounts, an assessment of the performance of EU spending programmes, going beyond the formal budget review, to examine the performance of EU policies and the achievement of their objectives in an effective, efficient and economical way (the '3 Es'). Unfortunately, for 2019, the Court of Auditors delivered a negative opinion on the use of EU funds: more than half of them, in fact, were considered high-risk with an error rate estimated at 4.9%. The economic challenges we face and the health, social and economic crisis we are experiencing require the utmost attention to be paid to the correctness and good use of all EU spending programmes, starting with the recovery fund that offers an unprecedented opportunity for European states to restart the economy. In my role as Vice-President of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I will work together with the Court of Auditors and the European Commission to ensure that EU funds are implemented promptly and correctly, in order to support the Member States, and thus support citizens and businesses, to get out of the current economic crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 52, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Klára DOBREV", "mepid": "197579", "text": "   The next item is the debate on the single market reinforcement report prepared by Morten Løkkegaard on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection: the report on the future of free movement of services (2020/2020(INI)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 53, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Dita CHARANZOVÁ", "mepid": "124708", "text": "  deputising for the rapporteur. – Madam President, thank you for giving me floor. Unfortunately our rapporteur, Mr Morten Løkkegaard, is not able to present his report – he is stuck in traffic. So therefore I will present the report on strengthening the single market: the future of free movement of services, on behalf of Mr Løkkegaard. This report is extremely relevant right now. The European economy is in a terrible crisis due to the coronavirus, which affects all countries. Last year, the European economy contracted by 7.4%, and the unemployment is rising in all Member States. We need to boost the economy and create jobs. One way to do this is to realise the huge potential in the single market for services. The European Parliament Research Service estimated that the potential gain of completing the single market for services could be around EUR 297 billion, or close to 2% of European EU GDP. The aim of the report is to realise this untapped potential – a potential that doesn’t require new laws or new recovery funds to be established. The three main proposals of the report are: firstly, we must make sure that unjustified barriers in Member States are removed and that Member States enforce the existing rules. Secondly, we must provide legal clarity to businesses and consumers by supplying the necessary information. Thirdly, we must provide transparent evaluation of Member States’ performance. For example, the report suggests using scoreboards to rate Member States’ implementation of the existing rules of the single market. Mr Løkkegaard has asked me to thank all the Groups and the shadow rapporteurs who participated in reaching a compromise for this report. Thank you, all of you, for your hard work and your valuable inputs to this proposal. This area has often been highly debated among the political groups; therefore it’s a victory to reach a consensus. The broad support for this report shows that Parliament now has a majority behind several proposals to strengthen the single market on services. This is an important step in the realisation of the potential. We are facing an urgent need to create jobs and growth in Europe, and strengthening the single market for services is one of the ways to do it. With a broad majority in Parliament, it will be up to Member States and the Commission to follow the proposals in the report and to make use of the opportunity that lies at our feet. We hope that all of you will support the report. Now let me add on my behalf, Madam President. I would like to stress that the service sector accounts for around 70% of the European GDP and a similar proportion of its employment. A better-functioning single market for services is therefore a crucial necessity for a more competitive and innovative European economy. The economic fall-out from the coronavirus pandemic has only increased the urgency of unleashing the full potential of the service sector. We need greater clarity and transparency for businesses and consumers alike. We must remove unjustified barriers that deprive our citizens of jobs, our consumers of choices and our entrepreneurs of competitiveness. For too long, Member States have hidden behind over-regulation of professions and administrative barriers to prevent one of the four freedoms. I was extremely disappointed with the decision to withdraw the Services Notification Directive after the Member States and the Council blocked it. Commissioner, I call on you to engage to find new solutions, new proposals, on how to ensure all four freedoms are fully implemented. You must have the courage to act. Now it’s time to complete the single market for services: now or never.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 54, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to first of all welcome this initiative report and thank the rapporteur, as well as all the other colleagues concerned, for the important work done. The Commission would like to stress that we need a functioning and well-functioning single market in services today more than ever before. That is the message that my colleague, Commissioner Breton, in charge of the internal market, would have wanted to point out today and it is the same message that I want to share with you.  I absolutely agree with the central message of this report on the need to deepen the single market in services to strengthen the economic recovery and growth of the European Union. The COVID-19 crisis has clearly shown us how fragile the functioning of the single market can be.  At the same time, she stressed how much the European economy depends on the single market and that when the single market does not work, everyone pays the price: supply chains are interrupted, small and large enterprises cannot source, deliver or sell related goods and services.  I draw a strong lesson: the demands of economies that are more dependent on services or manufacturing industries are the same: to be able to rely on the backbone of a fully operational and resilient single market.  It is therefore time to put an end to the old-fashioned dichotomy between the so-called friends of the industry and the friends of the single market. The crisis has affected a whole range of sectors of our single market and also of services. The latter depends heavily on the free movement of workers and service providers.  They were confronted with closed borders or delays in crossing them. To restore and safeguard free movement, the Commission has made considerable efforts to put in place quick and effective solutions in this regard, as shown by the many guidelines and communications presented.  It is clear that a more integrated, more competitive single market has never been more important for recovery and resilience. It is also an indispensable asset in mastering the dual transition to a greener, more digital economy. And, as the report points out, the services sector accounts for almost three-quarters of the EU's GDP and employment. Services are at the fore in our key industrial ecosystems. Services generate nine out of ten new jobs.  In addition, we are witnessing a growing service of products, and as the crisis has highlighted the essential nature of services for our industry and our economy, I assure you that services will be at the heart of our work on ecosystems. But there is equally convincing evidence that the services market remains fragmented and characterized by weak intra-EU trade and investment.  From this perspective, the initiative report rightly highlights the remaining barriers to services that deprive citizens of jobs, consumers of choice and entrepreneurs of opportunities. It is our common responsibility to combat unjustified restrictions on the way to a genuine single market for services.  Some key themes of the report, but first of all, as you have seen, we have decided to withdraw the proposals on notifications under the Services Directive and the electronic card in the Commission's work programme for 2021. Don't see it as a sign of abandoning our ambitions. On the contrary, while we regret that it has not been possible to continue these initiatives with you, we will mobilize all our resources to draw a new route. First, a few words about implementation and application. Very often, barriers to services are linked to insufficient or incorrect implementation of existing single market rules. You are right to put pressure on both the Commission and the Member States. The improvement of implementation can only be done in close collaboration between the European Union and the national or even local level.  Our long-term action plan on compliance with single market rules reflects this shared responsibility. In addition, the Working Group on the Application of Single Market Rules with Member States plays a key role in addressing obstacles through better implementation and enforcement of the rules. Second, I want to emphasize the importance of prevention. It is often much easier and more effective to prevent barriers to the single market in services than to try to prevent them delete later. The importance of having effective notification procedures and ex ante testing of the single market is undeniable when it comes to avoiding unjustified or disproportionate restrictions in the service sector.  Here we are also working on several fronts. On the one hand on the rigorous application of the Directive on Proportionality Control by Member States, on the other hand, we will mobilise all our resources to improve the application of the notification procedure established under the Services Directive. Thirdly, again, I would like to stress the importance of digitisation. This is a necessary prerequisite for the functioning of the single market for services. The recently adopted digital services and digital market legislation, which is currently being considered by co-legislators, will modernise the EU regulatory framework and will be of paramount importance to the single market services sector. I am also pleased that the initiative report focuses on the role of the single digital portal launched last December. It will gather information, provide much-needed administrative simplification for businesses and eventually set up a one-stop shop. The one-stop shop and other problem-solving and assistance services will be fully integrated into the portal. The success of the portal will now depend largely on the political and operational support of the Member States to put things into practice and we are counting on Parliament to continue to advocate for this. Finally, it is encouraging that the initiative report highlights the role of greater integration of service markets in achieving social goals and sustainability. It goes without saying that services can and must contribute to increasing the sustainability and resilience of our industrial ecosystems while respecting the principles of the circular economy and the objectives of our Green Pact. It is also clear that the objectives of the single market and social and environmental policy can and must go hand in hand for truly sustainable development. In conclusion, much remains to be done and we must work together to strengthen the single market for services. Your initiative report is a useful contribution to this work. In the spring, the Commission will present a review of the industrial strategy in March 2020, to ensure that we take into account the lessons learned from the COVID-19 crisis and the acceleration of transformation processes.  The single market will be central to this. We will take stock of the progress made under the long-term action plan for enforcement. We will also present concrete ideas on how to deal with the crises in our single market and to remove persistent obstacles. This will form the basis of our fruitful and ongoing work to ensure a genuine single market for services.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 55, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Marc BOTENGA", "mepid": "187917", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – Madam President, it's too bad that the rapporteur couldn't be here.

The free movement of services in the European Union all too often facilitates social degradation and dumping. For example, a company from one country can provide services in another country, in the construction or transport sector, without guaranteeing workers the same rights. It also makes it difficult for municipalities to stop a McDonald's that is too close to a school or to regulate Airbnb to keep neighborhoods livable. We had drawn up an opinion from the Committee on Employment, and that was clear: the free movement of services must not harm social rights. In this report, our opinion is completely discarded. You can't do that. It is a call for fewer controls on social dumping and less freedom of regulation for municipalities.

Indeed, services generate as much as 73 per cent of Europe's GDP and create as many as nine out of ten new jobs. On the other hand, only 6.5% of Europe's GDP is generated from cross-border provision of services. This means that the huge economic potential lies precisely in strengthening the cross-border provision of services, which is the topic of this report.  Internal markets and its four freedoms are the cornerstone of the functioning of the European Union. Unfortunately, freedom of movement of services is the least developed among freedoms of movement in the internal market. This is not only due to the fact that the horizontal legislative framework for services was created only in 2006 with the adoption of the Services Directive, but is that in as many as 20 countries the implementation of this directive was delayed and we know what all the political debates were like on this occasion both at local and national and European level. Scientific studies show that the hidden potential of the single market for services accounts for as much as €297 billion. This is huge money with which we can finance healthcare, support SMEs or invest in protecting the external borders of the European Union and strengthen European competitiveness in times of crisis. That is why we want to send a clear message today that the timely and correct implementation of existing legislation is a guarantor of the completion of the single market. In particular, we must work to remove unjustified national barriers holding back business in the single market. And this report sends a clear message: protectionism in the European Union has no place today. In addition, I would like to stress, of course, that this report strikes a quality balance between this freedom to provide services on the one hand and the protection of social rights on the other.

Ladies and gentlemen, if around 70% of EU economic services are services, but services are only around 20% of intra-European trade, then we have far too much wasted potential, because too many Member States still create unjustified barriers to protectionism. However, we need to raise this potential, also on our way out of the economic crisis. More competition means more opportunities, more markets for businesses, more choice at more competitive prices for consumers. This is what we need, above all, for the digital economy. Digital business models, digital services, need to be much easier to scale across the EU. In particular, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act must also break down barriers. And rules for artificial intelligence and other new disruptive services, technologies must be made at European level. I want us to put the Union at the forefront of innovation. And that is not possible with national solo action. This requires a common European market: the Digital Single Market. The foundation stone for this is a really real market for services.

It is clear, in that case, it is also a negligence of the Italian Government, which did not defend a regulation, the one introduced in 2018, and which deserved to continue in a dialogue with the European Commission, which had been opened, but in my opinion that is not a positive example: to start a procedure today, at this stage, with the Italian tourism companies affected , like all European companies, is not a positive sign.  I hope, of course, that the Italian Government will do this, in a context in which, for example, in Italy we have a strong conflict with the judiciary in my region, which writes to the mayors not to apply an Italian law.

More than ever, people in the European Union need smart basic health care. But it's not just in Corona times that this is important. Public transport, waste collection or a functioning water supply are the basic framework of our society. Studies have shown that people in regions with weak infrastructure feel abandoned and are more likely to vote far right. Nevertheless, here in the European Parliament and in the Commission, there are forces that still want to liberalise even more, even more, who believe that high standards and public services of general interest are obstacles to a genuine internal market for services. However, ladies and gentlemen, the European internal market is a success story precisely because we have high standards for workers, for the environment and for consumers, because we have enabled local authorities to organise genuine and strong services of general interest.

As the initiator of the subject of the report, which is the subject of today's debate, in the absence of important initiatives in this area contained in the European Commission's priorities presented at the beginning of this mandate, I would like to congratulate Mr Løkkegaard on a very good report.  The report takes into account a number of extremely important problems that we have to face in the European market. Not only has the importance of the services sector for the European economy been recognized, but also the losses suffered by the Community due to existing barriers and limited implementation by Member States. The development of disruptive technologies in Europe is being significantly hampered precisely because of the fragmentation of the EU services market.  I am therefore pleased that the final text stresses the need for urgent action to create an efficient market for services, which should be one of the priorities in the fight against the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. They are also crucial for an effective industrial policy and for increasing the competitiveness of businesses. I hope that the solutions called for will contribute to removing unjustified barriers to the free movement of services.

But it only works if we ensure that freedom of movement goes hand in hand with fairness. In the report we are discussing today – the Løkkegård report – we Social Democrats have ensured a much better balance in the relationship between freedom of movement and fairness.

Let me highlight a few of the things that we think are very good in the report: firstly, with the report, we are giving a very clear signal to the Commission that we do not want an e-service card. We therefore support the decision to withdraw it. We don't want it. We do not believe that this will create a fair internal market. Secondly, I also think it is really important that we ensure fairness for workers, and that is why it is good that we are committed to the european labour authority being fully operable, and we are putting pressure on that. The third, which I also think is important, is that we should focus on the development of a European social security number so that we can strengthen legal certainty for our workers and combat social fraud more effectively. All this is the prerequisite for us to have a fair internal market in services. We must ensure that freedom of movement goes hand in hand with fairness around it. And then, of course, it is also hugely important that we protect all the special services that are in the public sector – the public tasks of, for example, health and education, etc. It should not be the subject of ordinary classical freedom of movement.

Some of them are historic, but more are left there intentionally because of nationalistic financial services’ views of Member States. So, if we are to work for citizens, I highlight a particular issue that is very relevant in the everyday lives of people in Ireland. The average mortgage rate in Ireland is 2.9%. The EU average is 1.3%. That is a key area where financial services is not functioning on behalf of the citizens of Ireland.

Today, in particular, I would like to highlight three areas.  Firstly, there are still serious obstacles in the common market which make it impossible for small businesses, in particular, to benefit from it. For example, 36 percent of small businesses cite the absence of translations of rules and legislation into national languages as an obstacle.  Secondly, we have made progress in the area of recognition of qualifications, but we still need to improve the comparability of levels of professional qualifications, particularly because of the mutual recognition of education and practice in services.  Thirdly, the process of evaluating the European Semester should also be used to strengthen the common market.

It accounts for 450 million consumers and 22.5 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, we still have to take some steps before the true completion of the Single Market. An area in which the Single Market can be strengthened is in the free movement of services. Services account for 70% of all economic activity in the EU and create 90% of new employment. Cross-border trade in services, on the other hand, generates only 6.5% of the EU’s GDP. This shows a clear need to further stimulate the free movement of services by effectively and coherently implementing existing legislation, the use of public procurement where needed to reduce the costs of cross-border procurement for SMEs, micro-enterprises and self-employed, and the use of the European Semester to remove administrative and regulatory barriers when presenting country-specific recommendations.

Cultural heritage is a source of our common wealth, which brings evidence of European history, maintains a living memory of civilisation, inspires us to create new cultural values in the present and offers us lessons to build our common future. Cultural heritage forms the core of the path of each individual and community. It represents our different traditions, languages, lifestyles, but at the same time helps us to become aware of the common that unites us all. Europe's unique, diverse cultural space is made up of countless cultural treasures, whether tangible and intangible, movable and immovable, printed, audiovisual and digital. In order to better understand this range of rich values, 2018 was announced as the European Year of Cultural Heritage. During this period, more than 23 000 events took place in Europe, involving 12.8 million people in all Member States. The European Year of Cultural Heritage was an excellent achievement and, to a large extent, we must thank the Member States and civil society organisations that have played an important role in shaping it. The European Parliament's report, which I have created, must be seen as a roadmap for what needs to be done in the future, so that the successes and developments of the Year of Cultural Heritage are a lasting follow-up to the future. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the shadow rapporteurs here and all the administrative staff, as well as the civil society activists, who have done a great deal of work to help prepare this report. Firstly, it was important for us in the report to highlight the versatility of the value of cultural heritage. Undoubtedly, cultural heritage is a value in itself, not just an suffix for other industries and industries. The cultural heritage sector in Europe is an important driver of growth and employment, employing around 300 000 people, while 7.8 million jobs in Europe are indirectly linked to it. The industry's estimated employment growth rate is very high, ahead of many other sectors. Cultural tourism is a particular driver of growth in the European Union, as four out of ten tourists choose their destination depending on its cultural offering. Europeans are unanimous in assessing cultural heritage. According to the Eurobaromentra survey, 84% of respondents in the Member States believe that cultural heritage is important to them personally and to the local community they create, while eight out of ten respondents consider cultural heritage to be important for the whole of the European Union. The report also highlights aspects of cultural heritage education. Cultural heritage enriches the educational process and content with values and new educational opportunities. Education, on the other hand, is the most important means of maintaining cultural heritage and maintaining the inheritance chain. Aware of this synergy, the availability of Europe's cultural heritage and the active participation of the public in its knowledge and preservation should be extended, including through European Union programmes and initiatives such as the European Capital of Culture, Creative Europe, Erasmus+, the European Heritage Label and others. In the context of education, one of the challenges is the lack of qualified cultural heritage specialists – restorers and skilled craftsmen. It is therefore important to ensure stable funding for the preparation of professionals in the fields of cultural heritage. It is also necessary to strengthen intergenerational dialogue and the relationship between masters and apprentices for the inheritance of skills. The report also stresses the need to develop a comprehensive European Union framework with adequate funding to better identify and preserve the digital heritage, given its growing importance, especially during a pandemic. Indeed, it is not possible to overestimate the rapid reaction of cultural and creative industries and the expression of solidarity during the Covid-19 crisis, ensuring that the public has wide-ranging online access to culture. Among other things, we experienced the creation of many new innovative cultural values in the digital environment, which today is already an asset— a valuable testimony of this age. However, one cannot talk about the negative impact of Covid-19 on the cultural and creative sector : museums, galleries and other cultural heritage sites, including tourist attractions, closing their doors to visitors, drastically reduced their sources of revenue, severely undersaly understizing the management of cultural monuments and the well-being of those employed in the cultural sector. To this point, it is the right time to work on sustainable funding models for preserving cultural heritage in order to reduce its dependence on commercial activities. The report reiterates Parliament's call for a better integrated and coordinated approach to the preservation of Europe's cultural heritage by the Commission and for improved internal cooperation with different policies and administrations. The report also calls for the development and appropriate funding of a permanent platform for cooperation and coordination in the field of cultural heritage policy at European Union level, centred on organised civil society. To conclude, I am convinced that the european Parliament's the report will serve as a new impetus for the assessment, preservation and application of the value of cultural heritage in the European Union and its Member States. This will also provide new initiatives, such as the experience and expertise accumulated in the field of cultural heritage and its preservation, to contribute to strengthening a European way of life, to the priorities of Digital europe and the Green Course, and to stimulating a sustainable economy. I hope that the report will strengthen our conviction that every European has the right to live in a quality cultural environment and, at the same time, a duty to take care of its sustainability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 82, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to begin by expressing my sincere gratitude for the efforts you have focused on the European Year of Cultural Heritage, as well as for your valuable work on this report. A warm thank you is extended to the rapporteur Mrs Melb-rde. We all know very well that the European Year of Cultural Heritage was a great success, almost 13 million people participated, 23,000 events organized in 37 countries. But this is a common success because it has involved all THE EU institutions, national coordinators and civil society organisations in a truly multi-party approach. This success is also due to the excellent cooperation and support of the European Parliament.  The European Year of Cultural Heritage was not a one-off initiative, we continue to implement a longer-term vision to manage, safeguard and enhance Europe's cultural heritage, because, yes, cultural heritage is the soul of Europe. It is part of our European and national identity. It gives us a sense of common identity and inspires a better future.  Cultural heritage is an economic asset, a unique wealth, and contributes to social cohesion. And this is the case with the European Framework for Cultural Heritage, which, as you know, includes more than 60 activities aimed at boosting the results of the European year. Several activities in the framework are already responding to calls in this report. The challenge and the challenge is to follow up on it. I was also pleased to see that the Cultural Heritage in Action project is mentioned in your report and this project is an example of action included in the framework, which is consistent with the integrated approach to cultural heritage.  Therefore, it is crucial to maintain cooperation, the unique political dialogue carried out during the European year. And that's why in 2019 we have created a group of experts on cultural heritage that serves as a platform for cooperation and policy coordination. I would like to thank once again the honourable members of the group, Mrs Melb-rde and Mrs Ojdrov, who represent the European Parliament in this group. Now, ladies and gentlemen, let me make some comments on some of the key issues raised in this report. As a starting point, I am pleased to see that he attaches great importance to education and skills and rightly so. The report stresses the importance of educating younger generations about their heritage and history, and I could not agree more. In this regard, a very good example of the legacy of the European Year is the joint project with UNESCO on the integration of intangible cultural heritage into school learning programmes.  As the European Commission, we are very committed to this important aspect: safeguarding cultural heritage necessarily means safeguarding the skills of cultural heritage professionals. Indeed, the Commission mobilises funds for actions in this area, and this through the various programmes we have at our disposal, from creative Europe to Erasmus.  Now we will have to think about what new instruments we can mobilise in the European Education Area, in the digital action plan, how we can use micro-qualifications but also centres of professional excellence, simply to broaden learning opportunities. With regard to climate change and its impact on cultural heritage, you know that this is a subject close to our hearts. The Commission brings together experts from EU Member States as part of a working group to identify and exchange best practices and innovative measures to protect the cultural heritage of climate change. Experts are working to have a report published in 2022. The report also mentions economic potential and sustainability. The preservation of cultural heritage is an expensive activity. Member States' public budgets are sometimes subject to severe constraints, including due to the current crisis. That's why we're holding a two-day workshop next week on other sources of cultural heritage funding. In December, we also launched a climate education coalition.  Culture is at the heart of climate change. The fight against climate change requires an innovative and creative exchange between many disciplines, including culture, and this must be one of our top priorities for us to build together a sustainable future for Europe. In addition, as part of the European Capital of Culture initiative, networking activities and synergies with innovation capitals, green capitals will also continue as part of the joint action plan we have adopted with the Committee of the Regions. This deserves more attention.  The Commission also places a high priority on sustainable cultural tourism, which is strictly linked to this issue. The Working Group for Sustainable Cultural Tourism, made up of representatives from Member States, is a good example of the work being done on sustainability. This group created the first-ever definition of sustainable cultural tourism and made more than 50 recommendations.  However, cultural heritage is not limited to material and intangible aspects alone. The year 2020 showed us the importance of accessibility to digital cultural heritage like never before. I am pleased to see that the rapporteur stresses the importance of the Europeana project. It is also expected that the Digital Europe Programme will support the digital transformation of cultural heritage.  And that's how I come to innovation. Digital heritage innovation reminds me that cultural heritage is also a strategic area of the Commission's research and innovation policy. Around 600 million euros are already being spent on cultural heritage in the Horizon 2020 programme. We will have a new cluster with a budget of 900 million euros in the new program.  Today, we need to increase their visibility, but above all to make these instruments accessible to as many people as possible. And it is precisely within the framework of the Horizon Europe programme that we will be working, including for innovative services such as the cloud, i.e. a collaborative area of European cultural heritage, a reference to a possible cloud of European cultural heritage, as requested by the European Parliament during the negotiations of the Horizon Europe programme. In addition, we also need high-quality digital educational content based on European cultural diversity and creativity, which is why the Commission is planning to launch a feasibility study on the creation of a European exchange platform. Europe needs to catch up and create its own common space to share certified online resources and link existing educational platforms.

It has been an honour to be shadow rapporteur and to work with My Colleague Melbarde on this report. Much has already been said about the importance of cultural heritage. Cultural heritage, these are our roots, that is our identity, and that is why we should get to know them, we should nur them and also pass on cultural heritage to future generations. It's our DNA, but it's also an economic asset. We do not have a sea in the Czech Republic, so we say, \"Monuments are our seas.\" This is the source for our tourism. But Italy, for example – we know very well that ancient monuments in Rome, for example, have greater financial benefits than exports of the automotive industry in Italy. And we can continue with examples of other countries. In short, we are supposed to take care of cultural monuments not only for their value, but also for their economic contribution. This is also what our report talks about and highlights, among other things, the need for digitalisation, the need for networking between institutions, monuments, between schools, highlighting the contribution to the young generation, education. And we also stress cooperation with UNESCO. I would like to say that cultural heritage is an inspiration, and that is why we are calling for a new European Year of Cultural Heritage, which can take advantage of the challenge of today.

Forty-seven years after this report, Parliament is once again a pioneering institution, in part with this position we are adopting today. But we remain far from some of the objectives that were identified then, taking into account the memorandum on Community action in cultural matters promoted by Altiero Spinelli, which gives our building its name. Thus, we still do not have Community competences in the European dimension of education, culture and heritage. And we also need to continue to drive the fight against trafficking in cultural goods.

Madam President, Commissioner, Madam rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, in this context where our heritage sites are almost completely closed, where millions of cultural professionals struggle every day to survive, it was very difficult but also very important to value past successes. Last week, a player from the cultural sector in the southern neighbourhood told me, \"Now you understand what life without culture is.\" He was right. This unprecedented pandemic crisis has reminded us all of the essential value of culture to make society, to accept differences, to build social bonds, to see the world differently, to discover the other than oneself. But once again, our colleagues on the far right are against the project of a heterogeneous, non-hierarchical, shared and inclusive culture. I am particularly proud to have tabled an amendment to include the cultural and linguistic heritage of minorities in Europe in any reflection on European heritage. Cultural heritage is a common good, a universal and multicultural common good. Culture is a bridge between peoples, between societies. It must heal the wounds of the past and create the foundations of the future: this must necessarily involve the recognition and respect of other cultures, including the return of stolen or looted goods during the waves of colonization. Our cultural relationships reflect our societies and identities.

Special attention must be paid to conservation and it is closely linked to infrastructure as a necessary condition for development and access to cultural heritage.  In Bulgaria we have a huge number of priceless archaeological finds of European and world importance and from personal bad experience I know how many of these sites are discovered and then abandoned. These sites cannot be developed, let alone maintained, due to the lack of adequate infrastructure. When you've uncovered an ancient city in the middle of no where, there can be no flow of tourists. Infrastructure must be a key element in funding. Money must be allocated not only from the cultural budget, but also from the Structural Funds and from regional development funds in order to build conditions for access and exploitation.

On Thursday, the European Commission gave a essentially dismissive response to the Minority Safe Pack initiative, and in doing so the Commission once again missed a great opportunity to take measures to show its commitment to indigenous minorities in Europe, to support and protect their culture. He practically turned his back on these people. The role of cultural heritage in taking on and promoting diversity, cohesion, solidarity and understanding is invaluable. That is what our draft decision reads.

This only proves how important our cultural heritage is and that there is a great deal of interest in it among European citizens. However, this must not end in 2018. In order to achieve this objective and continue this action, we need better policy coordination and cultural heritage funding. Here I would expect the European Commission not to forget culture. It is therefore very unfortunate that the Commission is not working on culture in its work programme for 2021.

Unfortunately, instead of taking the request of its citizens seriously and thereby bringsd the Union to them, the Commission decided not to initiate a legislative process to protect traditional national and linguistic minorities. Yet European languages are on the verge of extinction, our traditional cultural riches.  The real equality of opportunity for 50 million European citizens is at risk. For this reason, we will send a letter to the President and Vice-President of the Commission with the minority intergroup in connection with the negative reply. As stated in the report that is being debated, there is a need to protect the cultural heritage of Europe's traditional national minorities through coordinated measures. The same is the case with the protection of our Christian cultural values. According to one survey, four out of five EU citizens believe that the protection of religious buildings is essential. Despite this, hundreds of buildings are being destroyed before our eyes. Memorials with roots become victims of vandalism.

We can debate in this Chamber, fortunately, but the artists have no right to return to the stage. Not essential works, historical sites, the heritage of Europe. Would shopping malls be safer than the galleries in our museums that are 90% closed? More profitable, no doubt, for sure. As if the only basic needs were material, as if only immediate consumption was a vital emergency, all we learned about the civilization that made Europe is that real life begins with the life of the spirit and if we do not find the meaning of existence there, then why fight so much for the health of the bodies? The crisis we are experiencing threatens the already fragile life of our cultural fabric and strikes hard at those who are the soul: actors, musicians, guide lecturers, publishers, craftsmen, thousands of them have already been forced to change their profession today.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this rich and interesting discussion. I have taken note of your contributions and will cherish them in my future work. They will be very useful for the Commission's work on this issue. Before I conclude, let me mention the difficult times we are currently experiencing. We all know that the European cultural heritage sector, including museums, heritage sites and other cultural heritage institutions, is seriously affected by the crisis. This is very well reflected in the report and I agree that these sectors need adequate financial support.  That's why we've innovated. In the summer of 2020, the Commission launched an extraordinary appeal on partnerships for creativity within the framework of Erasmus. EUR 100 million has been made available to support projects that develop skills and skills to encourage creativity.  We have also, with you, made the Creative Europe programme more flexible. We have launched specific industry actions and appeals. We have also ensured that the Union's horizontal measures to address the challenges of COVID can benefit the cultural sector. We have created specific platforms to give the industry the opportunity to exchange and create solutions.  Finally, we have maintained an ongoing dialogue with the cultural heritage sector and look forward to continuing to work closely with Member States to continue to find ways, solutions to mitigate the effects of the crisis, to look to the future together. Once again, I reiterate my strong support for the 2% of the recovery and resilience facility to be devoted to supporting this report. Today, we have new features. We have the Creative Europe programme, we have the Erasmus programme, we have, including within the framework of my portfolio, new developments such as the new culture cluster, we have a new community of innovation and communication with the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.  These are the elements from which we need to build new partnerships to build ecosystems. I also mention something we are not used to talking about, but three of the five new missions under the Horizon Europe programme have specific references and recommendations related to the cultural sector.  So today we have these programs, we have a strengthened budget thanks to you. It is now a question of building real synergies, of being able to finance this sector and help it, not only through programmes that we know but which are not sufficient. In this context, let me just mention that today, together with Commissioner Ferreira, we announced the launch of the design phase of the new 'European Bauhaus' project.  Today, we know that the green and blue transition will only be possible if we transform them into cultural projects that aim to involve all our fellow citizens and I obviously count here again on the sector of culture, cultural heritage, creation, so that we can truly build a bridge between the world of science and technology and that of art. , creativity, culture, unique resources that set us apart from the rest of the world, and that will enable us to transform, work and find solutions together. So I think we're all aware that there's still a lot of work to be done, but I'm sure it's only by working together that we can get out stronger and more united.

The Technical Support Instrument (TSI) generates knowledge for Member States’ public administrations and it allows them to implement sustainable reforms and investments, drawing – with the help of the European Commission – on the best and tailor-made expertise available. So it is no coincidence that it enjoys strong support from all Member States. Thanks to a strong position of the European Parliament – and here I would like to thank my co-rapporteurs, Othmar Karas and Dragoș Pîslaru, for their excellent cooperation on this file – today we have a Technical Support Instrument that is substantially greener, more gender-equal and ensures stronger transparency. That is to say, it is more in line with today’s European priorities. First of all the European Green Deal, because knowledge about climate mainstreaming and climate tracking methodologies, for example, will help Member States to make their economies and their societies future—proof.  Strong transparency mechanisms will help to showcase the positive contribution of the European Union and foster pro—European attitudes, and more power to local and regional levels will enhance change from the bottom with the more direct involvement of citizens. So, we have many reasons to be proud of this new instrument.  But let me first explain what the Technical Support Instrument actually is. It supports Member States in their efforts to implement reforms and investments, giving them the institutional and administrative capacity they need. That means that Member States can simply ask the European Commission for help and the European Commission will either provide the expertise directly, or task experts to do so, working very closely with Member States. The TSI replaces the Structural Reform Support Programme, which has successfully supported over 1 000 reform projects in the 27 Member States since 2017. It has a budget of EUR 864 million for the period 2021—2027, and although it is a standalone instrument it will also assist the national authorities in implementing the recovery and resilience plans successfully.  As I mentioned at the beginning, the TSI is more than the continuation of a successful programme. It specifically addresses crucial challenges of our time – climate change and the European Green Deal – listing among the eligible actions, which are a sort of menu for the Member States to pick and choose from, methodologies for climate tracking. This is a crucial instrument, which we need in order to fulfil not only our climate goals, but also to raise awareness on local, regional and national levels to the many ways in which reducing CO2 emissions can also improve the life of citizens. For example by reducing air pollution in cities, which is something our citizens care about.  Then there is the resilience of our health care systems. We are still in the midst of the COVID—19 pandemic, which has demonstrated all too clearly how essential well—organised public health systems are. There is also the digitalisation of public services, upskilling policies in the labour market – we know how much change we will experience in the labour market in the next years – and the fight against poverty and income equality.  Then there is the last point, which is particularly close to my heart: gender equality. Because when we speak about competitivity and growth, we often forget one of the key factors to achieve sustainable growth, competitivity and more social justice at the same time, and that is gender equality. There is ample evidence that gender equality in the labour market is closely linked to economic growth. There is also ample evidence that women are currently paying the highest economic price for the COVID—19 crisis. So, in order to overcome this crisis successfully, we need to support gender equality. The right way to do this is to invest public funds equally between men and women. This is not easy, because it requires a good methodology and often even external expertise, and that is one reason why many administrations still shy away from it. Unfortunately, this has also been true for our European Commission, which shied away from gender impact assessments in the Recovery and Resilience Fund for that reason.  This is the reason why Parliament insisted on including expertise on gender budgeting and gender impact assessment among the eligible actions.  All administrations therefore have access to the best methods to determine what impact their measures and budgets have on women and men and how to promote a more gender—equal – and therefore more inclusive and more successful – society.  I am convinced that the Technical Support Instrument will make an important contribution to the socially inclusive, green and digital transition we urgently need in Europe.

Optimists understand that life can be bumpy and they learn from mistakes and failures in order to be prepared next time. Now it’s time for us to learn the lessons.

The technical support instrument has a more challenging task than its predecessor, the structural reform support programme, and therefore has a larger budget: EUR 864 million worth of technical support is right now available for the Member States, and that’s for those Member States that wish to undergo long-term reforms and encourage public and private investment.  This instrument will prove essential if we aim to truly address the green and digital transitions, to achieve the Union’s 2030 climate and energy targets and climate neutrality by 2050. Member States can also receive assistance when designing digital infrastructure skills and the e—government solutions of building a secure digital communication system.  A stronger Europe, a stronger Union, is one that overcomes social divergence. For that the instrument helps Member States that wish to fight against poverty to promote entrepreneurship, labour market integration, lifelong learning and vocational education and ensure access to health care and child care. These measures are not possible without solid institutions and this is why Member States should use the Commission’s expertise to build capacity to better absorb EU funds, to build capacity of competition, and antitrust authorities then to strengthen financial supervision.  But before aiming to achieve convergence and resilience, we need to address our urgent demands. The most important role of the instrument lies in the recovery of EU Member States after the pandemic. Therefore, as part of the recovery package, this instrument will first and foremost be available to prepare, to amend, and to implement and revise the national plans the Member States will put forward to access recovery money under the recovery and resilience facility. It is highly recommended, and if we wish to have a sustainable and fair economic and social recovery, we need to use this instrument.  The pandemic showed how valuable our civil society is and there is no doubt that it has to be treated as a partner when implementing large scale reforms. Measures to empower civil society, as well as consultations with relevant stakeholders, are crucial and are particularly encouraged by this instrument. We also need to think more about gender equality since women have been hit especially hard by the consequences of this outbreak. The instrument will show expertise on gender budgeting, on collecting gender disaggregated data and providing gender-impact assessments.  This instrument will show a positive example of proper communication and transparency. Transparency promotes good governance and builds trust in the decision-making process. It is extremely important as a tool to prevent corruption and bad governance practices. I wish to assure you that all EU actors play their role in this instrument, including the European Parliament. This House will receive information on Member States’ requests and this information, as well as the outcomes of the support provided to the Member State, will also be published on the Commission website. We will look forward to receiving annual reports from the Commission and we will gladly welcome the Commission in this House to discuss about the implementation of this instrument.  We see governments leaving their citizens in crisis in a moment in which people truly rely on them. To them and to all Member States I wish to say, leave politics aside and please use this instrument. Use it to prepare your national recovery resilience plans in order to access the funds needed for reforms and investments. Use it to implement the measures listed in the plans and to recover. Use it afterwards until 2027 to create a sustainable and fair economic, social and gender-equal future beyond the pandemic. This way we will truly become more resilient for the upcoming challenges.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 106, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the last 12 months have highlighted the crucial role of public administrations and public services at all levels of government. In the roll—out of vaccines, support to businesses, digital solutions for work and schooling, public administrations have to adapt quickly and find the right tools and solutions that best serve their citizens. This is why the modernisation through reforms is so crucial for both the public and private sectors. Today we are discussing a powerful tool for supporting growth—enhanced reforms and for building better public administrations: the Technical Support Instrument. Reform support has come a long way in the last ten years, from crisis management to structural challenges, and from just two Member States to working with all Member States. In the past four years, we have supported more than 1 000 reform projects in a broad range of policy areas. Most importantly, these were nationally owned reforms, requested by Member States. With a results—oriented and hands—on approach, we have gained the confidence of Member States. But reform is never a goal in itself. Reform is a means to an end, a better environment for business, more resilient healthcare systems, better social and educational systems, better resilience to crisis and a smooth return to sustainable growth. Our method is Europe at its best. We aim to act as the catalyst bringing together Member States so they can help each other, sharing the expertise that is already there. We do so in respectful partnership with Member States.  This expertise is needed today more than ever in the recovery from COVID—19, in the transformation of our economies to prepare the green and digital transition, and in preparing and implementing the European Recovery and Resilience Facility. In fact, I would say that this instrument will be important for the success of the MFF and the Next Generation funds. The Recovery and Resilience Facility offers unprecedented support for reforms and investments, but will be a massive administrative challenge, a challenge requiring strong project management skills and robust administrative capacity.  With the Technical Support Instrument, we send a clear message to all Member States and regions: we stand by you, we will do what it takes to help you succeed, including when it comes to making the most of the Recovery and Resilience Facility. I can think of no better example than the spirit of Europe than standing together both in crisis and in good times, facing events such as this pandemic, and building our digital and green future. I thank the rapporteur and the co—rapporteurs for their work on this instrument, and not least for speeding up the legislative process to ensure we are ready to deliver support on the ground already by early spring. I look forward to our discussion.

The recipe: \"Ever Closer Union\", that is, the cause of even the EU's permanent crisis. With the RRF, the EU is writing member states a debt-financed cheque for €672.5 billion, the advance reward for reforms, the European Semester, illegal debt community, non-contractual ECB bond purchases, zero interest rates and empty threats to force the Commission, reforms – that teach us ten years of experience – that will never come. Why? Because the EU slept through the outbreak of the crisis, this House prefers to debate the third sex, human rights on Borneo, climate rescue or interference with freedom of expression, rather than border closure, competitiveness or selective protection for particularly COVID-vulnerable people as an alternative to lockdowns and the Leyens Commission ordered too little vaccine, and in the midst of the crisis prefers to think of new Africa strategies and safe access routes for more corona-infected migrants. In the absence of a vaccine, death rates and debt are rising, but the economy is shrinking. The technical support instrument here is that the EU is now to support states in the preparation and implementation of the record expenditure. A further EUR 864 million for more bureaucracy and external consultants, because member states lack the expertise in the absence of reforms – despite ten years of promises of reform.

It is in all our interests that our states be more robust, effective and transparent through reforms. As we see painfully directly in the current crisis, public administration must be able to withstand shocks and crises. It must be able to provide citizens with quality services and have complete confidence in them. This can best be achieved through transparency. This is not only about time lost in office, but, unfortunately, as we can see, human lives may also be at stake as a result. Investing in reform support is thus clearly worthwhile. I am also very glad that, as Parliament, we have prepared high-quality material. Material that would introduce broad transparency and publication of the results and studies processed under the Technical Support Instrument. I see this as an absolute necessity for the instrument for supporting public administration reforms. Citizens have the right to know on the basis of what data, in cooperation with whom and why changes will take place in their state. I must express my disappointment that, in the trialogues, the Council has clearly opposed transparency. I also find this very unfortunate from the point of view of the nation states.

The so-called 'technical assistance instrument' – which we will adopt tomorrow – is much more than its name suggests at first sight: it is an essential wheel in the gears of 'NextGenerationEU', which assists Member States in future projects, supports the planning, implementation and revision of the reconstruction plans and encourages urgent reforms and investments. First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the excellent cooperation: to my two co-rapporteurs, as well as to the entire negotiating team, the Commission and the German EU Presidency. We have pulled together across institutions, committees and factions in order to make the already successful precursor instrument even better. We are putting the 'technical assistance instrument' at the service of our future by adapting the scope to our common challenges. We support the implementation of the European Semester with a clear link to the country-specific recommendations.

Mr President, Commissioner, I am proud to be able to present this report to you today, on a subject that is particularly close to my heart. I am an ecologist, daughter and wife of a sailor and a friend of many fishermen in my area. While here, including in this Parliament, some are still trying to oppose fishing and the protection of fisheries and biodiversity, the fishermen I meet have understood that they depend on it. That is the central idea of my report. More fish in the seas means both achieving our environmental goals and protecting biodiversity. But it is also to allow fishermen to continue to fish in the long term. The year 2020 was to be the year when the European Union had to achieve the good environmental state of the seas and the year when all fish stocks had to be exploited at a sustainable level. Since the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2013, real progress has been made but the targets are not being met and there is an urgent need.  The situation is very different in the Atlantic and Mediterranean areas. Some time ago, I met the fishermen in Brittany and Normandy. They explained to me that some species, such as the scallop, were doing very well but were seeing other phenomena such as a proliferation of sea spiders due to warming water and climate change. The situation in the Mediterranean is alarming. More than 80% of fish stocks are still overfished. So we have to go further. There is a need to strengthen scientific knowledge of fish populations, but also of interactions between different species. Selectivity, bycating bycating catches, framing and limiting the most destructive fishing techniques must be improved. All quotas must also be set transparently and never beyond scientific recommendations and levels to achieve sustainable maximum performance. I also proposed in this report to study the relevance of new indicators such as the ER (maximum economic return). It aims to fish below the level of the RMD (maximum sustainable yield). This would improve the resilience of fish populations and the economic viability of fisheries in the medium and long term. To prepare this report, I met with many stakeholders from the world of fisheries and environmental associations. I am lucky enough to live next to the sea, near several marine protected areas, including Cape Roux, in the Var. While a fisherman was showing me around the marine protected area, we saw a trawler coming to fish in the middle of this area.  His observation, I heard him repeat in the mouths of many fishermen and associations I met: many of the marine protected areas in Europe are protected only on paper: no monitoring, incomplete management plans when they exist... Using different methods, NGOs and scientists have come to the same conclusion: while we claim to have protected 10% of Europe's seas, less than 2% are actually protected. The biodiversity strategy sets a target of 30% of European waters being covered by marine protected areas with a high level of protection. This is an excellent thing that is consistent with the scientists' recommendations, but it will only be a large greenwashing operation if these protected areas do not have real management plans and controls. Fishermen's acceptance of marine protected areas is a key element of their success. All stakeholders must be involved in the establishment, management and monitoring of these marine protected areas, starting with fishermen and scientists. So we must also explain: 30% of marine protected areas does not mean that fishermen are excluded from 30% of maritime areas. In the 10% that will benefit from strong protections, there will have to be areas where all catches and economic activity is prohibited, but in the majority of protected areas, it is only the most destructive fishing techniques that must be limited according to local characteristics and seasonally.  There are examples. Very few fish population recovery zones have been established since their inception in 2014. However, there are areas for the replenishment of fish stocks, such as the \"Jabuka/Pomo\" set up in 2017 by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, which are already bearing fruit. Placed in a strategic location where certain species breed, including hake, it has allowed the reconstruction of populations of this species, visible beyond protected area and won the support of local fishermen. Let us draw on this for all marine protected areas. Fish populations also face climate change and various sources of pollution, such as wastewater treatment, the use of pesticides in agriculture, cigarette butts thrown into or from beaches, sunscreens, etc. We need to study these phenomena better in order to act afterwards. It is also important that the resources of the future FEAMP be mobilised towards objectives that I have cited: the creation of these high-level marine protected areas, the management and control of them, research on selectivity, the training of stakeholders, such as jurors. I call on the Commission to take up this report for the implementation of the biodiversity strategy, which must be translated into binding legal texts, for the action plan for the conservation of fisheries resources and the protection of marine ecosystems that you have announced for this year and for the evaluation of the common fisheries policy, also in the coming months. I wanted to conclude by thanking my various fellow shadow rapporteurs whose spirit of compromise has enabled us to have a full report. I was pleased to work with you on this report, even though the negotiations took place mainly through our teams. Thank you to the NGOs, to the fishermen who helped me with this report.

Yes, more fish in the sea is what we all want and what this planet needs. Our fishermen and women, who go to sea every day to supply us with healthy food from the ocean, are the first to benefit from more fish in the waters, but abundant life in the ocean also plays a crucial role in our fight against climate change. The ocean has absorbed more than 90% of human—generated heat in the last century. It will only keep its ability to protect us if its ecosystems are healthy and rich, with lots of fish in its waters. I also welcome most of the findings of this report. They support the Commission’s approach under the European Green Deal, the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the common fisheries policy. In the past decade, we have achieved significant progress to increase fish stocks in the North—East Atlantic, where the rate of fishing is on average already close to the maximum sustainable yield. However, we are still confronted with overfishing in the Mediterranean Basin. We are starting to make progress there too, with the multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean and with many measures adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, mostly proposed by the EU. Our immediate priority is to build further on that success. In order to further move towards more sustainable fishing in all sea basins, I agree with the report that we need to improve our fisheries management to end overfishing. We need to expand our network of marine protected areas, improve their management and tackle other environmental factors beyond fishing that threaten our fish stocks. When speaking about improving our fisheries management, I fully agree that more data collection is necessary in order to assess the health of our stocks and monitor bycatches of sensitive species like harbour porpoise and dolphins. Bycatch must be eliminated or, where this is not possible, minimised so as not to threaten species conservation status. We need to do everything to better protect sensitive species and sensitive habitats. This is clearly required by the Technical Measures Regulation. The Commission will present, later this year, a report on the implementation of this Regulation and, as announced in the Biodiversity Strategy, an action plan to conserve fishery resources and protect marine ecosystems, which we announced in the Biodiversity Strategy and for which the roadmap will be published very shortly. I agree with the report that we need more sea areas covered by marine protected areas with a more efficient management and control system in order to deliver in the interest of our fishermen and women and to protect marine biodiversity. I hope that the final report, as it will be voted on Thursday, will keep this high level of ambition in terms of sustainable fishing and healthy fish stocks. Regarding the use of the maximum economic yield advocated in the report, I am more cautious. At this stage, the priority is reaching maximum sustainable yield for all stocks, which is also the agreed legal objective of our current common fisheries policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 121, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "François-Xavier BELLAMY", "mepid": "197534", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Commissioner, how can we not share this objective, Commissioner, as Mrs Roose's report wants? A few weeks ago, I went to Mayotte and Reunion to meet the fishermen who have been criss-crossing these tropical waters for generations, and I would like to speak here for their concern: we have never seen such fragile marine species. Of the four tuna species in the Indian Ocean, only one was on alert only five years ago. Today, only one is out of danger. Stocks of all other species are collapsing, so there is an urgent need to respond. The first priority is to find the path of a reasoned fishing, controlled and respectful of the environment, as well as the wisdom inherited from its own tradition. Fishing is a wonderful relationship with the balance of life and not with a material available indefinitely. Innovation and technology must enable us to extend this legacy and pass it on.  Let's be clear, the drifting fish concentration devices that have multiplied in recent years have had a major impact on species survival. They divert marine migration, trap younger fish, multiply collateral catches and contribute to sea pollution. Together, we must find the path of shared responsibility with all stakeholders. Secondly, it is imperative that the European Union accept clear and respected common rules by its partners. We must put all our weight together to get out of the denial in which many third countries still persist, which can only lead to disaster. We will only achieve this with real firmness by requiring regular checks such as those practised today on European fisheries.  Finally, we need to improve the knowledge of these species through an ever-increasing investment in science, with the support of fishermen. We are not among those who believe that fishing is a way of delinquency against the sea, it is only with fishermen, the first explorers of the oceans, that we will be able to better know and preserve species and biodiversity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 122, "date": "2021-01-18.json", "name": "Isabel CARVALHAIS", "mepid": "199996", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group- Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Roose for her work. I believe that we have reached a balanced report which contributes to improving the sustainability of the exploitation of the seas. I reinforce here the challenge to the Commission, the Member States and the scientific community to the need to find a scientific model that best suits the management and exploitation of multi-specific fisheries. It will be an important development that could contribute to the more sustainable exploitation of fishing resources, with environmental but also social and economic gains for the sector.  I advocate the use of marine protected areas as an essential tool in the protection, management and recovery of marine habitats and species. For this tool to fulfil its purpose, it is necessary to ensure that it works through good governance based on the best available scientific knowledge with constant monitoring and effective control. In the implementation and management of marine protected areas, it is essential that all stakeholders are involved and, in this sense, strengthening that, since the beginning of the establishment of any marine protected area, professional fishing, recreational fishing, as well as all other sectors of commercial and recreational activity and the populations of the surrounding areas should be called to the process.  Marine protected areas are not incompatible with the existence of some more selective fishing activities and with fewer negative impacts on the existing environment or resources. We must, once and for all, combat, demystify this idea, whether among the members of this Parliament or with the fishing communities, because only in this way will we be able to implement the changes so relevant and necessary for the protection, recovery and resilience of the habitats and biodiversity of the European sea.

There’s a simple logic to the message I’d like to share with you today. It’s if we keep on taking fish out of our seas at the current rates, without giving them a chance to rest and reproduce, our sea beds will become barren waste grounds sapped of marine life, and a wonderful source of food and employment. Protecting 30% of our waters should be legally binding by 2030 as recommended in the biodiversity strategy. We need more fish in our seas, not less. The EU committed to end over-fishing by 2020 - clearly, this has not happened. It is possible to implement measures that will allow for effective management of marine protected areas where fish will be given space to thrive. It is possible to do this whilst supporting sustainable fishing communities. Using improved fishing methods and monitoring and further improvements around meeting the basic targets set out by the Common Fisheries Policy and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, we can and we must halt this decline. This crisis is made more urgent now with the complexities of ‘live’ Brexit. Over-fishing is a human-made problem but with a comprehensive and committed rebuild and restore strategy, we humans can be the solution. We can have more fish in the sea.

Mr President, Commissioner, fortunately, a lot of fish stocks are doing quite well. Sustainable management based on the maximum sustainable yield (MDO) is beginning to bear fruit, especially in the North Sea. However, overfishing remains a problem, particularly in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. That is why it is important that we get as many species as possible at the MDO level. We rightly stress in this initiative report that this important measure must remain the starting point for file management, and that we should therefore not switch to other methods.  Fortunately, the report's initially indiscriminate criticism of ground-based fisheries has been removed, and quite rightly so. After all, we should not be guided by emotion, but based on facts. That is precisely why, Mr President, selective pulse technology must also be made possible within responsible frameworks.  More customization is also needed. After all, the differences between the various sea basins are very large. That is why I think it is very unwise to support the proposal to establish 30% of the sea everywhere as a protected maritime area, especially since no impact assessments have been carried out at all.

We need to do more to support small-scale low-impact fishing and end harmful capacity-enhancing subsidies.

We have not yet fully implemented the concept of 'maximum sustainable performance', and there are already those who want to change it to 'maximum economic performance', without any scientific basis. Protecting is fine. I strongly support him. I am not against marine protected areas, but we distinguish between tools and objectives. Marine protected areas are a tool and not a target. Activities in an area cannot be limited without pre-evaluating the conservation objectives of that area and its consequences. Nor can certain fishing arts and techniques be criminalized a priori.

We really must protect 30% of the EU's maritime areas against overexploitation and depletion. We must also ensure that fishing quotas are based on what ecosystem services can deliver, that they are real sustainable and not anything else. And then we really need to put an end to the harmful, purely harmful fishing methods, such as the bottom trawling, which causes enormous damage to plants and animals and entire ecosystems on the seabed.

And yes, I cannot stress it often enough as Ms Carvalhais stated, that strengthening scientific coverage and control will be key. Replying to Mr Ruissen and Mato, as regards the concept of maximum economic health, I’ve already mentioned it in my introductory remarks that our first ambition of course should be to properly implement the maximum sustainable yield, which is at the moment our current legal obligation and of course top priority.  And let me say that I particularly welcome also the involvement of the members of the Environment Committee in this debate The issue we discussed tonight is so cross-cutting that we need to ensure close cooperation between fisheries and environmental communities experts to ensure the necessary coherence and credibility of our actions and policies. Apart from a lot of support and ambition, I also heard some of you raising concerns in particular about having 30% of Europe’s seas covered by marine protected areas, of which 10% will be strictly protected. Let me reassure you that I fully understand that you want to ensure that our fishermen and women can fully benefit from marine resources, in particular in the current economic context of the global pandemic and the challenges several Member States face in the aftermath of Brexit. And let me be very clear, so do I.  However, it is precisely our fishermen who will be the first to benefit from more abundant fish stocks in the areas around those marine protected areas. There are very concrete success stories of fishermen and women with increased income around well-functioning MPAs, such as the Columbretes area in Spain, the Torre Guaceto area in Italy and the Jabuka/Pomo Pit in the Adriatic Sea. These positive examples should encourage us all. Honourable Members, I hope that the final report as it will be voted on Thursday will underpin our common efforts under the European Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy for 2030, in line with the resolutions of the European Parliament of January 2020 on the European Green Deal and on the 15th Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Biodiversity.

The presence of such legislation in one of the legal acts laying down the basis for the functioning of the EU would make it possible to assume that the protection of animals from suffering is among the Community's priorities. Unfortunately, the legal protection of animals, including farmed animals, in the European Union still leaves much to be desired, and fish and other aquatic animals are perhaps the most glaring example of this. Since the beginning of my term of office, I have emphasised the need for appropriate standards of legal protection covering all animals, including aquatic animals. I therefore supported the amendments prepared by the GUE, which highlight the need to regulate such fundamental issues as more humane methods of catching and killing fish. We also call for legal protection for marine invertebrates, including crabs and lobster, which are now still widely prepared for consumption by throwing live animals into boiling water.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow the report on the application of trade rules is subject to your approval. Tomorrow, with its adoption, you will carry the voice of a more credible, effective and ambitious Europe. Tomorrow, with the amendment of this regulation, you will meet the expectations of our businesses, our citizens for a Europe that asserts itself and protects itself. Tomorrow, by this vote, you allow Europe to send a message to its partners, the rules exist and they must be respected.  Power relations, clashes, trade tensions, it is in this geopolitical context of economic rivalry that Europe must register, with a global trade watchdog faltering. For just over a year, in December 2019, the appeals body of the World Trade Organization has had only one judge. In the face of the U.S. refusal to appoint new members, the dispute settlement system is paralyzed.  Faced with this deadlock, we could not stand still without action and the revision of the regulation, together with the Commission's original proposal, was therefore welcome. The Council quickly agreed, establishing a form of status quo. We, as parliamentarians, have understood the importance of this review. Bold and determined, with a clear mandate, we have managed to go beyond that. Colleagues, this vote also represents the voice of a United Parliament at the service of Europe that is gaining credibility, efficiency and ambition. Anna-Michelle, Berndt, Reinhard, Emmanouil, Helmut, thank you for your trust and for your joint work. Together, we have carried in the negotiations the urgent need to strengthen our trade policy, pressing it to defend our European interests, the imperative to strengthen our legal arsenal. Thus, with your vote, ladies and gentlemen, further progress will emerge. Let me go into the details. To be able to react, we must first give ourselves the means and have sufficient levers of action in the face of states that are taking the path of unilateral and illegal behaviour. By broadening the scope of our counter-measures, it is therefore the efficiency for Europe that is proposed.  In a world where the share of services and intellectual property rights is growing, the European Parliament has therefore convinced the Council to open up the possibility for the European Union to take action not only in the area of services and public procurement, but also in the services and intellectual property rights sector harmonised at European level. And we have met in a year's time, with an explicit revision clause to extend the scope to all intellectual property rights.  Commissioner, you have committed and willing Members in front of you and we expect much more. So, in the face of our determination to introduce interim and immediate measures against the manifestly illegal and unilateral actions of a trading partner, the Commission seems to have heard our appeal. You have pledged to present a new instrument to deter and counter coercive measures by third countries as soon as possible and by the end of 2021.  Commissioner, there is an urgent need. Commissioner, there is an obligation for the European Union to have such a deterrent to respond to behaviour that does not need to be. It is not a question of launching a trade war, simply of ensuring compliance with international rules and asserting itself as a trading power. Colleagues, in this institutional agreement, the three institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament have committed themselves with a joint declaration and I very much hope that we will not have to wait until the end of the year for the Commission to come up with a proposal. Immediate response to measures that do not comply with international law is essential, it is an issue of credibility.  With the arrival of Joe Biden as President of the United States, many imagine that we are immune to the unfounded measures that Donald Trump has accustomed us to. On the American side, perhaps. But the extraterritorial effects of their laws will certainly remain. On the other hand, other states are not left behind and we would make a mistake to wait. Our toolbox has few screwdrivers or wrenches. It is high time to complete it and it is high time to have all these keys that will allow us to open more doors. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we know all the issues relating to sustainable development provisions in our agreements. Commissioner, the Commission is committed to dealing with the EU's trade compliance official and the new single entry point, all violations of labour law, climate change and human rights at the same level as market access complaints. As you know, we want new concrete proposals so that the commitments that are included in our trade agreements are not just declarations of intent and are actually respected and implemented. Tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that Europe must continue to support the multilateral system and WTO rules unabated. With this report, we demonstrate that we are fully mobilized to combine discourse and action. Tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, with the update of the regulation on compliance with the rules on trade, it is therefore the choice of efficiency, credibility, ambition, the choice of our strategic autonomy. Once again, I thank all my fellow shadow rapporteurs, the German Presidency and Vice-President Dombrovskis.

The Commission regards this amendment as both important and necessary. Given today’s realities, there are two reasons for this. First, since December 2019 we no longer have an impartial and binding two—step adjudication mechanism within the WTO. This is of major concern for the European Union’s economic interests. To recall, this happened because of the Appellate Body of the WTO; the second tier of adjudication is unable to function due to the blockage of appointments by certain WTO Members. As you know, the Commission is sparing no effort in resolving the crisis. We have improved the situation in Geneva through the multi-party interim appeal arrangement, or MPIA for short, but it will not apply in all cases. The MPIA does not engage the entirety of the WTO Membership, far from it, and it is voluntary. In other words, WTO Members need to agree to its use in their cases with the EU. Therefore, as you have recognised, it is wrong to think that the danger arising from the breakdown of the WTO dispute settlement has passed. This underlines the importance of the legislative file you are voting on tomorrow. Next to our ongoing efforts to resolve the crisis, the amended Enforcement Regulation would enable the Union to protect its interests in the face of blocked dispute settlement systems. The Union would be able to take measures where it prevails in an offensive dispute against another country at the panel stage, but it’s unable to obtain a binding award because the other country blocks the process. Thus, the revised Enforcement Regulation will act as a line of defence, while at the same time it would act as a deterrent and an incentive for others to cooperate. Similarly, under the EU’s free trade agreements, there is no guarantee that a contracting partner will, in all cases, allow the proper functioning of dispute settlement. In the bilateral context, dispute settlement requires a certain degree of cooperation. The amendment would play a particularly important deterrence role for parties that might otherwise contemplate obstructing the proper functioning of dispute settlement. By concluding this file, we send a powerful signal to our trade partners. The Union is able to equip itself quickly and is ready to protect its rights, if a need arises. This is very important for the credibility of the Union’s enforcement action and for its timeliness, which is ultimately what our stakeholders will judge us on. Second, the importance of the amendment also lays in the broadening of possible remedies to cover trade in services and some trade—related aspects of intellectual property rights. The extension will allow the Union to make use of these additional possibilities whenever it is necessary for the effectiveness of the enforcement action or because the rules require it. The extension of scope results from a proposal advanced by Parliament. The Commission welcomes this improvement.  The extension unquestionably renders the Union’s enforcement action more effective and in line with today’s realities. It corresponds to the needs of modern and knowledge—based economies. It matches the prominence of services and intellectual property rights in international trade agreements. It makes the Union credible when it seeks to negotiate protection for the right holders abroad. It means the Union is serious about its agreements and obligation and will expect that partner countries stick to their commitments. And finally, broadening the scope increases the deterrence effect. Even though the extension is only partial in the field of trade—related aspects of intellectual property rights, we should not lose sight of the immense benefits of the extension in its current form. The Union is clearly better equipped than ever.

Mr President, the adoption of the revised enforcement regulation is really a step forward for the European Union.

In addition, the scope of possible countermeasures to services is extended, which was a constant request of both the EPP Group and the majority of Parliament.  However, the European Commission should become both faster and bolder in exercising its rights to apply and enforce international trade rules, especially when faced with trading partners who have a long history of non-compliance with international rules, such as Turkey, which, for years, by unilaterally applying tariffs and equivalent measures, has been in breach of the provisions of our bilateral trade framework. At the same time, it continues the challenges in the Eastern Mediterranean, the violation of the sovereign rights of Greece and Cyprus, so I ask: can the European Union really trust a partner that does not respect international law? Despite Turkey's recent attack on Europe, I have serious doubts about its intentions. Both the Council and Parliament have called on Turkey to comply with international law.

Never has trade been as extensive as it is today. Some of the EU's most important tasks are to work towards free world trade, governed by rules, where agreements are actually also held. It is only then that trade becomes a real tool for both economic growth and for promoting human rights and protecting the climate and the environment. It is therefore unacceptable that some countries are exploiting shortcomings in the structure of the WTO in order to avoid complying with contractual obligations.  With this decision, we are closing loopholes. It is a clear victory for Parliament. The EU will be able to take countermeasures. Not only in the area of trade in goods, but also in terms of services and certain intellectual property rights.
