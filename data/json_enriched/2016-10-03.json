President Peres had a vision of a pacified Middle East in which Israel would live non-violently with its Palestinian neighbors and Arab states. Shimon Peres pursued this vision, and he implemented it with his participation in the Oslo Peace Agreement in September 1993. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 alongside Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat for this milestone in the Middle East peace process. Shimon Peres was a friend of Europe. He has honoured us several times here in the European Parliament with his presence and spoken to us. I think you will agree with me when I say that his personality, charisma and ideas have inspired us every time he has been with us. His message was simple and clear: never give up fighting for peace! The legacy of Shimon Peres is enormous, and it is now the responsibility of the next generation of politicians in Israel to continue on its path of diplomacy, dialogue and reconciliation. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our deepest sympathy to his family, to his friends, to the people close to him and to the Israeli people. I would ask you to rise from your seats in honour of Shimon Peres.

(Parliament adopted the amendment) Tuesday: I had just said when I introduced it: the Committee on the Environment is voting this evening on Mr La Via's report on the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on behalf of the European Union within the framework of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. If the report is adopted in committee this evening, it will be included in voting time here on Tuesday. I have to say that first. Ladies and gentlemen! The Secretary-General of the United Nations – I have just said this – has accepted an invitation to take part in tomorrow's vote, on the grounds that tomorrow's vote here and the associated transmission of the vote to the Council and the deposit of ratification at the United Nations will be the minimum quorum that the United Nations needs to implement the climate agreement worldwide. , is achieved. There is no doubt that this is a special process. I therefore intend to give the floor to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon tomorrow at the beginning of 12 noon. He asked to be able to give a brief address to Members. I would therefore ask you to be here at 12 o'clock for this formal sitting. There will then be a short round of group chairmen before the vote. Then we vote on the ratification of the climate agreement. If the vote finds a majority in this House – as I suggest – I will then sign the communication letter to the Council here in the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, President Juncker, the Responsible Energy and Environment Commissioner and the Council side, and Mrs Royal, as President-in-Office of the COP 21 Conference. With this signature, the Council can act directly, clearing the way for the entry into force of the climate agreement, legally binding for all The United Nations states. Tomorrow will certainly be an extraordinary day, because the European Parliament's decision will achieve the minimum quorum here. I would be pleased if you could also increase the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon tomorrow by your presence.

I will take an example: 'Brussels wants to set up the equivalent of a city of illegal immigrants in Hungary'. The quota in Hungary, if it had been accepted, is 1,294 people. Really a very small town, not to say a village. That is 0.01% of the Hungarian population, not enough to upset the values of Hungary, it seems to me.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has Since 2000, the Cotonou Agreement has been in force between the 28 EU Member States and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. This agreement is unique in the world. It is the result of close cooperation between our countries in Europe and 78 countries, mainly developing countries, referring to the HYPERLINK 'http://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/lexika/lexikon-der-wirtschaft/20027/lome-abkommen' Lomé Agreements I and II from the 1970s. The Cotonou Agreement expires in a few years. It is therefore good to set the course early enough now as to what will happen beyond 2020.  The European Parliament is well placed. We are presenting this report today, and therefore our position on ACP relations. The Commission will follow suit in a few weeks or months; then the Council is called upon. The negotiations in which the Commission was represented have shown that we, as parliamentarians, are roughly in line with the Commission. That is why it would be good if we could achieve a broad majority in Parliament, because there is opposition in the Member States, in the European Council, also in some countries, against the continuation of this agreement.  Why do I believe that this agreement should be continued? There is a legal framework that we would not have would have without this agreement after 2020.  We must also see that, as Europeans and also as parliamentarians, we are better off overall. Acceptance among parliamentarians could be better, as could the commitment of the Member States. I would point out that, since 2013, the Member States that each held the Presidency of the Council have refused to host the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. These were Ireland, Greece and the Netherlands, and I hope that perhaps next year Malta, when it has the Presidency of the Council, will behave differently.  The importance of the ACP Agreement, in three pillars, is, firstly, development cooperation, the political dimension and economic and trade cooperation. During the debate on the continuation, it has often been said that we are not discussing enough human rights violations on the European side with our African, Caribbean and Pacific partners. However, this is also up to us, because the Cotonou Agreement does indeed see this possibility in Articles 8 and 96, and we should continue to take this into account in the future, when the agreement is extended. We have to address new challenges in an agreement after 2020. I mention climate change, migration, the new SDGs and the fight against terrorism – global issues that we can solve well within the framework of the EU-ACP and where we work with our partners on solutions.  What do we need in the future? We need better regional orientation, because not all the issues that the small island states or the large countries such as Nigeria and South Africa have touch, and that is why I think we need new regional structures under a common roof, and cushioned by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2016-10-03.json", "name": "Norbert NEUSER", "mepid": "96844", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the Committee on Development and the rapporteur, Mr Neuser, for the report on the future of ACP—EU relations beyond 2020. I also thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Budgets for their opinions. This report is an important milestone. The Cotonou Agreement binds us with almost 80 countries in the world. We have a unique opportunity ahead of us. Let us put the EU global strategy into practice and let us use a future partnership as a vehicle for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development jointly. I am pleased to express support for this report. Let me point out some of the features I find most important. We are aiming for a partnership that is flexible enough to cope with a radically, and rapidly, changing international environment. We should aim to address effectively common challenges and take advantage of economic opportunities to deliver peace and prosperity for our people, both in the European Union and in the ACP countries. We need a partnership that reflects and reinforces EU interests, objectives and means, as well as those of our ACP partners. This new partnership should keep what has worked, but we should also use the opportunity to improve, or create new ways of working, where weaknesses have been shown. Our main concern should be to keep the essential elements as global safeguards, such as respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, as well as good governance. This is clearly fundamental. We should also maintain and reinforce our regular political dialogue with our partner countries. International commitments, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development or the Paris climate agreement, should be central references in a future partnership. Enhancing dialogue with ACP countries in order to forge global alliances in multilateral settings offers a new perspective for a future partnership. An excellent case in point was the final round of negotiations during COP 21 in Paris. The fight to eradicate poverty and combat inequalities is at the heart of our policies and we know that efforts should be maintained. We also expect strong commitment on the part of the ACP countries. Any future framework that links the ACP to the EU should learn from the positive aspects of Cotonou, including its legally binding nature. The world around us is evolving and so are the roles of organisations and institutions. The partnership should recognise this and give due consideration to all levels, both continental and regional. It should equally reflect on how to involve national parliaments and other actors at local level, as well as non-state actors, in our project. The impact of the private sector should also be fostered since it has proven to be an essential motor for development. The report encourages engagement with additional countries as well as our current ACP partners. For the sake of geographical and political coherence, this certainly merits consideration.

Firstly, the sustainable development goals must be at the heart of our future partnership. Secondly, any post-Cotonou agreement must remain legally binding and enforceable.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our colleague, Norbert Neuser, for the work that has been done and for the excellent cooperation on this issue. This report is important because it sets out our priorities for the future of our relations with the ACP countries and will, I hope, guide the European Commission in its proposals.  I am convinced that we must use Cotonou's achievements and improve it in order to respond to new global challenges such as migration or climate change. We can't start from scratch. We need to move forward and advance what already exists.  Thus, a legally binding text must be kept aimed at the entire ACP group, even if the regional dimension needs to be better taken into account. I think it is important to include our partnership after 2020 as part of the new Sustainable Development Goals and to insist that human rights and good governance are the cornerstones of our partnership with the ACP countries.  If we call for a budgetisation of the European Development Fund in our report, it must be subject to two preconditions. First, the maintenance of existing envelopes and, secondly, the creation of an instrument to finance security development-related expenditures. Indeed, I share the idea that there can be no development without peace and that security is a prerequisite for development. We therefore need a tool to address these issues.  In this regard, I am pleased that the report supports the idea of taking overseas countries and territories out of the European Development Fund and proposes the creation of a financial instrument specific to them. This is a new step that must lead, from 2020, to better reaffirm the European membership of our overseas countries and territories and to promote their role as ambassadors of the European Union by defending our values in neighbouring developing countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 28, "date": "2016-10-03.json", "name": "Enrique GUERRERO SALOM", "mepid": "96768", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank Mr Neuser for the report he has prepared for us, which I think is a very comprehensive report which will allow a roadmap for Parliament to participate in the renewal of the Cotonou Agreement.

Madam President! There are some who believe that you can create growth by making income redistribution. I don't think that's what the past 50 years of world history have been able to do. What is driving growth and prosperity and, fortunately, political rights such as democracy and freedom, that is free trade. The fact that nations and actors can act freely and unhindered when they have to exchange goods and other good causes, it creates growth! And that is what we need in relation to the partner countries we are talking about today. A great deal has happened since the first agreements were concluded, but it is also time that we looked inwards in relation to many of the challenges of a more dogmatic nature that we in the European Union are presenting. I cannot help but think of the whole support that exists in the agricultural sector, which is extremely protectionist and prevents, for example, agriculture in many of the partner countries we are talking to from acting freely in relation to European producers.  We also need to better assess the programmes we put into the lake. When I was preparing for today, I looked back and examined when we actually last received special reports from the Court of Auditors, which reviews the aid programmes in which the ACP countries are part. And so we have to go back more than ten years to find a thorough account of all the support programmes that we have put into the sea. That's not good enough! Not at all when you look at the criticisms that were made at the time. There is therefore a great need for us to re-look at all the cases.

Nor does it attempt to end illicit capital flows or tax evasion, which empty their economies from domestic resources. These countries are subject to constant exposure, as large amounts of capital generated in them return to Europe or tax havens, and that's called stealing.  All of this has only one name: financial neocolonialism. Basing development aid on asymmetric trade relations increases inequality and poverty, condemning these countries to a state of perpetual subjugation and dependence.

However, their dimension is still not satisfactory. There is a noticeable need for further cooperation and even strengthening it, especially from an economic point of point of time. Indeed, 80% of the ACP countries are still among the least developed countries.  This and the current economic situation indicate that a change in the formula in ACP-European Union relations is needed. The EU's commitment should increasingly be to develop relationships that are more partnerships.  Economic agreements and investment should play a key role in further development, which will also contribute to the greater empowerment of the ACP States. Trade is one of the three main pillars of the Cotonou Agreement, which increases investment, reduces unemployment and, of course, fights poverty. Strengthening it is therefore essential for the further growth and economic development of these countries.

On the contrary, the EU-ACP partnership has always been able to evolve in changing contexts, as many evaluations confirm. Significant progress has been made in the areas of health, promotion and regional cooperation in Africa, not to mention infrastructure. In terms of political cooperation, the record is a little more mixed. Indeed, this dimension is still largely unused. I still believe that the Doha Round, for example, which sought to combine trade and development for the benefit of all, and especially the weakest, failed because it could not agree on a common line between the Union and the 79 ACP states. From my point of view, it would be in the interest of both sides to agree on a strategic pact that could weigh heavily on the United Nations Assembly and the major multilateral conferences. But we must first ask ourselves how to value these potentials. However, it is clear that, unfortunately, our politicians - the Member States - are only weakly involved in this cooperation. As we keep proclaiming all day long that Africa's awakening is imminent, we would be entitled to expect more offensive, robust, determined and effective political action. Yes, we are forming a community of destiny in areas as diverse as climate, energy and security, and more specifically with our neighbours in sub-Saharan Africa.

The EU taxpayer will pay EUR 30 billion for the EDF in 2014-2020 in order to ensure that the poorer nations are in its debt and therefore subject to the rapacious greed of big business. This is against all that your European Union is supposed to stand for, and we see the results in the economic partnership agreements, in the fisheries agreements and in the common agricultural policy. If the EU really wants to help the third world, then it should enable those nations to build their own economies and ensure free trade, not just for raw materials in the age-old manner of the colonialists, but also for finished products and goods. As long as we keep pouring in aid for no good outcome, we encourage the cycle of third—world government dependency and keep the poorest the poorest.

As the Permanent Rapporteur for Policy Consistency for Development (CPD), I am pleased to see that this concept has been highlighted in this report. The CPD has much to contribute, not only in revising the Cotonou agreement but also in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. That is why I wanted the report to once again call for the establishment of permanent co-staff on the CPD in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly.  It is true that the ACP-EU partnership has not fulfilled all its objectives and has disappointed in some respects, but I am convinced that we can improve these weaknesses while maintaining the current structure, which is a unique tool in the Union's external relations. Its legally binding nature contributes greatly to its effectiveness.  In my view, partnership reform must take into account our other foreign policy tools, including the various roadmaps that will lead to the Union's overall strategy. I regret that this strategy does not specifically mention the ACP-EU partnership. If there is one point on which the reform of the Cotonou agreement must focus all its efforts, it is that of strengthening political dialogue.

I would like to highlight two elements that would improve the situation of the peoples of the partner countries: first, placing the 2030 agenda and the sustainable development goals at the centre of the new agreements; and, second, placing the human—rights aspect at the centre of European action. Migration and displacement will dominate the ACP-EU agenda for the future. A new agreement must address this expanding challenge. To increase political oversight, we need a strong parliamentary dimension in the new cooperation agreement. We must guarantee that European development partnerships are concluded only with regimes respecting human dignity. Where governments cannot be our partners, we must bring on board local communities that are ready to cooperate with us. Faith-based communities and their organisations represent the real local power in very many places. They often manage development programmes that are already functioning well. Their efficiency on the ground is remarkable. My strongest message today is that we must engage better with local communities and faith-based organisations in coordinated – and I underline again coordinated – dialogue. Let me draw attention to the importance of local small and medium-sized  enterprises: they are key to the improvement of communities and the extension of social cohesion. Lastly, the situation is quite clear: let us have cooperation with local powers and international actors to address the humanitarian situation which can no longer be overlooked in many ACP countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 50, "date": "2016-10-03.json", "name": "Maria ARENA", "mepid": "124936", "text": "   Mr President, the EU-ACP framework represents a unique and privileged partnership between Europe and its partners in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Sixteen years later, it's time to take stock. The sometimes too divergent characteristics between the different regions have led to the under-exploitation of the institutions of Cotonou. Yet they offer a unique opportunity for dialogue, exchange and cooperation between regions of the world that have so many challenges in common. It will therefore be essential, in my view, to review the framework for cooperation taking more account of the regional specificities of each party. It seems to me that we can work around four priorities. The first is that the future framework will have to put the sustainable development goals at the heart of its priorities, but also and above all the coherence of development policies to ensure that trade, migration, security and environmental policies are coherent and compatible with development objectives. The second priority is political dialogue. At a time when tensions are affecting much of Africa, it remains a fundamental pillar that has been used too little so far. This pillar will need to be strengthened and equipped with adequate tools to make it more efficient and relevant. The third priority is the economic pillar. In this regard, the European Union should commit itself to further supporting ACP countries in the implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) when countries have decided to conclude them and to ensure that these countries have first strengthened their institutional capacities and their capacity for economic diversification and that they have reformed their tax policies before embarking on trade liberalization. Finally, the involvement of civil society must be guaranteed in all areas of cooperation, both in development and in trade cooperation, at all levels of dialogue and with new and more effective tools.

And now that so much is being talked about the failures of the European Union, and now that so much is being said about the need to work on the causes of migration, we must at least show the peace of mind that we Europeans have long understood what needed to be done and got to work. We didn't start yesterday. It is worth recalling here the Lomé agreements and the one at issue today, the Cotonou Agreement, which remains a valid instrument, much more specific in development cooperation objectives than the Union's overall strategy or the United Nations 2030 Agenda, for example, both in promoting regional integration and in actions against climate change , one of the issues on which we have reached a common position. However, it is also true that, as of today, we have outstanding issues, challenges to overcome, new paradigms in the Union's relations with the ACP countries or the relations of these same countries with other global actors, such as China. We believe that, in essence, the model of collaboration based on both the political dimension, development strategies and economic and trade cooperation remains valid. Precisely, the coincidence at the time of the expiry of the Cotonou Agreement and the Union's multiannual financial framework gives us a unique opportunity to integrate the European Development Fund into the general budget and thus improve in transparency, efficiency and accountability. We know that political dialogue has failed to make improvements in human rights and democracy in countries that do not share the values of the Union: another challenge to overcome. From this house we must ensure that the work done in the twenty years has been consolidated and improved in the future. There's more than three years left, there's room.

We have an enormous lot of important work to do that Brexit will not, if it happens, financially. Relations and cooperation between the ACP and the European Union to date have been and remain aimed at strengthening universal values and objectives such as the promotion of human rights, democracy and sustainable development. The agreement was concluded in Coutonou in 2000 and revised twice. In the years following the last audit, the development has shown, as demonstrated by my experience on the ground, with the conduct of two European Election Observation Missions in support of democracy in Nigeria and Kenya, that the starting points that we share with our ACP partners must be condensed through more specific regional strategies and regional agreements that take greater account of the changed political, economic and security situation. On the other hand, I very much agree with the report's emphasis that cooperation should take place in areas of common interest where mutual benefit could be expected, not only from an economic point of view, but also, and above all, with regard to peace and security, human rights, the rule of law, good governance, democracy, migration, the environment and so on. Peace is a value that, in my view, remains the first development priority. We cannot successfully tackle poverty unless peace is guaranteed. I therefore find it sensible that the ACP and the European Union work together as a whole, on this and other supporting values. In this context, I propose that, in the future, we devote even more energy to intercultural dialogue, which is still an underestimated potential for added value in polarised societies, which need a higher level of internal co-sim for a more sustainable development.

Mr President, I believe that if we really believe that the European Union should not be introverted, but should reach out to help - with a social face, with a social character and with an imaginative development policy - other countries outside the European Union, then we should support agreements such as the Koton agreement, the agreement with the Caribbean countries. , Africa and the Pacific, where the European Union really contributes, both economically, and in other ways... (The President interrupts the speaker for lack of English interpretation, which then takes the floor again) , then we should also consider that the agreement reached between the Caribbean, Pacific and African countries and the Member States of the European Union is the culmination of a modern European Union that responds to the calls of the whole of humanity and is everywhere where there is a problem. I believe that if one studies this agreement, in the sixteen years of its existence, one will realise that, no matter how many problems there are, no matter how many difficulties and obstacles arise, that it is a very useful agreement, useful because it really offers these countries and contributes both to sustainable development and to their development and integration into the world economy.  But I agree - and as shadow rapporteur in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets I supported this view with all my might - that the timing of the revision of the multiannual financial framework in 2020 and the expiry of the agreement offers us an important opportunity to integrate the budget of the European Development Fund into the Budget of the European Union, so that there is more effective management with transparency and with all those conditions required.

The AFET, INTA and BUDG committees support this report, and it is important that we have also involved these three important committees.  We have not yet discussed how the ACP countries will stand for a successor agreement, and I think these are the signals from our ACP partners: they want to maintain these developed relations. It is a very important argument to know what the partners want and to what extent the partners want to continue their work with us, the EU, beyond 2020.  We talked about new challenges.

It must therefore be based more than ever on the involvement of national parliaments, local authorities, civil society and the private sector from the ACP countries. A good step in this direction was the extensive public consultation carried out by the European Commission with citizens and various social organisations around the world.

It is absolutely essential that we do not lose a generation of displaced Syrian children. First and foremost, this is important for the well—being of the children themselves. It is also crucial for regional stability, for the eventual recovery of Syria from this crisis as well as – let’s face it – in our own interest over the long term. Where there are needs, we are responding and we are ready, if necessary, to do more. Our neighbours in the region need to know that we stand by them as they work towards a better future. One of the outcomes of the London Conference was a joint commitment to provide access to quality education for all refugee and vulnerable children in host communities. We will make every effort to empower young Syrians by investing in their future. Education is, and has always been, a key priority of the EU response to the crisis in Syria. So far we have made a substantial contribution to education in Lebanon, with EUR 180 million allocated to this sector since the beginning of the crisis. We have stepped up this approach both through the EU Trust Fund in response to the Syria crisis as well as the compact we have been negotiating with the Lebanese and Jordanian authorities. This aims to turn the challenges posed by the huge influx of Syrian refugees into an opportunity both for refugees and host communities. In Lebanon the focus has been on education, where we hope that reforms will have an impact across the entire public education sector.  EUR 42.5 million has already been allocated to the so-called Reaching All Children with Education Strategy, the abbreviation for which is RACE, which I think is a good one. Called the RACE Programme, it was designed by the Lebanese Ministry of Education. A substantial part of this has gone towards the enrolment of Syrian children in formal and non-formal education, the supply of educational material and transport. I am pleased to say that this coming school year is already well funded and we will be able to cover school fees for over 168 000 Syrian children in formal education. I must stress, however, that money alone will not solve the problem of access to education. There are still serious legal, administrative and technical barriers. This includes the lack of residency status, the distance between where refugees live and the schools that service them but also, unfortunately, harassment and discrimination, which has been documented in last summer’s Human Rights Watch report.  The problem of residency status is a serious one and has a clear impact on freedom of movement of refugees and leads to exploitation, including child labour. This is why we have placed this at the core of the EU-Lebanon compact. In exchange for the considerable financial support being offered by the European Union, Lebanon has agreed to provide an appropriate and safe environment for refugees. We are working closely with various UN agencies and international NGOs in this respect and it should be noted that when we see or hear of the commendable work being done by UNICEF, UNHCR and others, that behind this effort there is a strong European Union contribution which should also be acknowledged.  Although not directly linked with the subject we are dealing with today, I should also mention the humanitarian initiative launched by my colleagues Mogherini and Stylianides over the past few days. The tragedy of Aleppo cannot continue and we call on all parties concerned to ensure that the desperately needed aid can be delivered.

We visited the Committee on Civil Liberties in Lebanon a week and a half ago and we have seen on the ground that EU support for the country is really crucial. Support to help Lebanon deal with the more than one million refugees from Syria who have sought refuge in the small neighbouring country. 489 000 Children between the age of 3 and 18 from Syria are in Lebanon. It is also our responsibility to ensure that they can also go to school. It is quite right what the Commissioner said: not only Syrian children but also, please, keep an eye out for other vulnerable children, such as those of the local Lebanese population, but also those of palestinian refugees.  With regard to Syrian refugees, many of these children have been sharing or sometimes missing entire school years because of the circumstances, and that requires a tailored approach to ensure that these children do not end up being the child of the bill. Such an approach costs money and we have seen on the ground that the support from the European Union is greatly appreciated and works.  However, it is about more than just money and I am very pleased that the Commissioner made the comment on the residence papers. More and more Syrian refugees in Lebanon are struggling to renew their residence papers. At the moment, around 70% of people do not have the right papers and this also has consequences for the children. Some parents are afraid to take their children to school because they are afraid of being checked for those papers. So I also ask the European Commission: continue to consult with the Lebanese Government - very keenly - so that we really try to get these children to school in this way. The European aid budget to Lebanon is working. It's tangible.

However, as I would like to emphasise, the situation of Syrian children and young people in Lebanon is particularly difficult. My PPE colleague also talked about refugees from Palestine, but they have their own self-government, for example, they have their own law enforcement, and this is a community that has been operating in Lebanon for decades.  The degree of colonization of Palestinian children is much greater than that of Syrian children and young people. Of course, we in this House can differ on many issues when it comes to migrants, the influx of immigrants into Europe, their separation. However, I think we are no different in terms of the fact that we need to make it worthwhile and we need to invest precisely in the refugees who live there, as well as in their education.

Some of us came from Lebanon a few days ago and we could see, on the one hand, that the Lebanese authorities saw as a very, very difficult burden to cope with the situation of refugees in their country— to which, by the way, because they are not obliged, they are practically not given legal roles. Indeed, increasingly, Lebanese society is talking about sending them to Syria; and they talk about safe places, which we know doesn't exist.  And indeed, UNHCR and Unicef work extraordinarily, and you are talking about 168,000 schoolchildren in this school year, but there are more than 250,000 who are out of school, and we cannot settle for less than everyone has opportunities for schooling.  In this case, efficiency is not something we have to pursue, but we have to achieve. Because six years of lost schooling is practically a creature's life, and we're talking about elementary school, high school. And only a very small handful, a handful of young people with enough schooling have been able to access the university, all the Syrian refugees who are of age and who are studying, because Syrians had the highest graduation rate in the whole region. And we're talking about people like you and me who six years ago started to miss opportunities, and who also know that their parents, their cousins, their older siblings had opportunities for schooling before the war that plagued them.

I would have been proud if the countries of Europe had taken the same responsibility, if we had also given the refugees a residence permit and work permit, given the children schooling, etc., etc.  When 163,000 refugees arrived in Sweden last year, our reception system collapsed. Housing, schools and health care were not enough. Nevertheless, we are one of the countries that received; not everyone does. I fully understand that Lebanon has the same problem, but their problems are so much greater. I also understand whether Lebanon thinks we should take more responsibility.  In order to avoid being accepted into Europe, we are talking about us helping out on the ground, and that is where the money comes into it. Although we have promised a lot of money, great resources, not all those resources are in place. According to the study to which the Commissioner referred, i believe only 23% had arrived.  At the same time, we also want lebanon to give a residence permit and work permit when refugees come to Lebanon, they should give their children school, etc., and we want to help. But we're going to look at what we do ourselves. We're not actually doing the same thing ourselves. We should also make demands on ourselves.  The Commissioner also raised the problem of losing his residence permit. When you are without a residence permit, you become undocumented, and when you are undocumented, you dare not let your children go to school because you are afraid that the authorities will find one; you can search for the parents by knowing where the children are. This is a problem that we have not only in Lebanon, but also in countries here in Europe. It's hard to be undocumented no matter where in the world you live. But the important thing about this is to make sure that we do not get these lost generations, perhaps, of refugee children, which the Commissioner was talking about. Not being able to go to school, which may be the only fixed point in life, also leads in the long term to major health problems for those children, and we must avoid that at all costs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 71, "date": "2016-10-03.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "   – Mr President, today we cannot stay silent and turn our back on the bloodshed in Aleppo. Children are being slaughtered, injured and starved. They are trapped and traumatised. More than 100 kids have been killed in Aleppo last week by the Syrian army and Russian air strikes. More than 100 000 children are under siege. We have to strongly condemn the indiscriminate bombing of families and hospitals and the use of illegal weapons. The United Nations Secretary calls it war crimes. So what can we do?  The EU should call for an immediate ceasefire, and I welcome the new humanitarian initiative for Aleppo to ensure access to emergency aid, safe passage for rescue workers and the evacuation of the sick and the wounded. The EU must also relaunch negotiations. There is no military solution. The EU should unite in confronting Russia with its responsibility as a member of the United Nations Security Council. For Russia to be a partner for peace, they must respect humanitarian law and go back to the negotiating table, and those responsible must be held accountable.  All Member States should increase resettlement for thousands of kids, especially unaccompanied minors, and education. Going back to school gives children a sense of normality, a chance for self-sufficiency, and hope for the future. Education empowers children, it helps prevent violence, early marriage, forced labour and radicalisation and recruitment. With the Intergroup of human rights in the European Parliament that I co-chair, we stand united with the children of Syria. We fully support the ECHO/UNICEF Emergency Lessons campaign to provide education for children in conflict, and the No Lost Generation initiative to recruit Syrian teachers for Syrian children.

More than half of Syria's 500 000 children are unable to access education and granting a right is not always the same as ensuring that they are practised. The extreme poverty of Syrian families and the difficulty of access to the world of work and having a residence all weigh on the future of these children who have already experienced the worst that this world could offer them.  Lebanon – but I believe it is Europe's moral duty – must give these children the opportunity to fight one day by the force of culture that enemy so ignorant that today forced them to leave their homes and their country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 85, "date": "2016-10-03.json", "name": "Caterina CHINNICI", "mepid": "124861", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too recently had the opportunity to participate, together with the Committee on Budgetary Control, in a mission to Lebanon and Jordan, visiting the very refugee camps where Syrian refugees live.

Some have been out since their arrival five years ago. Despite the efforts of the Lebanese Government and donors, the lack of resources and the restrictive residence requirements limit access to education and give them to the scourge of child labour. Education is a right and must be given priority in these contexts, as it ensures a guarantee of protection and a sense of normality for children, at the very moment when they are most vulnerable. Postponing educational activities until the emergency and the crisis are over means risking never returning to school, often condemning them to a future of poverty.

It is also important to take care that those who are not yet in school have the opportunity to attend school. It is impossible, and I think there is a moral obligation, not to lose any generation, not to lose any child and to give everybody an opportunity to be educated. I think we are all impatient and we are all concerned because still, I agree, not every child is going to school. There are a lot of reasons for that and we should not underestimate that many families push, urge, force their children to work, to contribute to the family’s financial support and income. There are also reasons, as it was already said by some colleagues, because of the lack of having a residency status. This is why one of the key areas we have addressed in our negotiations with the Lebanese Government concerning an EU compact agreement is that this has to be resolved in order to guarantee, including from a legal perspective, the possibility to enrol in schools.  There is also some progress, I have to admit. There is now a decision by the Lebanese Government to apply the new Lebanese curriculum. There were some discussions in the past whether it should be the Syrian or the Lebanese curriculum, but there is now a decision, and I think it is a good decision to apply the Lebanese curriculum which allows also that Lebanese teachers can teach Syrian kids. There should also be an opportunity for Syrian teachers who are refugees to get a work permit to teach Syrian kids, and this is also something we have addressed in our negotiations concerning the compact. There was also an issue about the money. May I say that in 2016, as far as the expected number of school children being de facto in school is concerned, this is being financed. There is an overall budget of EUR 191 million. Out of that, EUR 190 million is provided by the European Union and its Member States, with more than 60% of this budget being provided by the European Union. Primarily the financing is provided via UNICEF, but we are also trying to find an agreement with the Lebanese Government directly. This also depends a little bit on the very complicated political situation inside Lebanon. As there is no president elected, with all the consequences of that, it is difficult to have an agreement with the Lebanese Government, and therefore we have decided, in order not to waste time and resources, to channel most of the money via UNICEF. There is one element I would like to highlight, and I think this is something we should not forget. Of course it is important to provide elementary and secondary school education, but it is equally important to offer afterwards children in the region vocational education. Therefore, also the aim of this new compact is to support the Lebanese economy to offer jobs, to offer economic business opportunities and to give young people the opportunity to get an apprenticeship, as an example.  So while this is about investment in young people, it is not only an investment in their basic education, but equally important is to have an investment further on in specific training and education to become a skilled member of the workforce. I think this is something which should be our joint focus in the future, of course still taking care about the elementary and secondary school education. Once again, I think we should be determined to provide this additional education not only in Lebanon but also, of course, in Jordan, in Turkey.

In September last year, world leaders, encouraged and accompanied by civil society, including numerous non-governmental organizations, agreed on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The various points, specifically in the second, referred to, underlined that the fight against hunger and malnutrition is still a central issue today, as early as the 21st century. Working to end hunger, achieve food security, provide better nutrition, provide means for sustainable agriculture are, in today's world, still to be achieved. The Committee on Development, which is presenting this question for debate, would like to stress that part of our contribution to development has undoubtedly served to reduce the number of people suffering from malnutrition in the world, but it is far from having achieved the objectives of eradicating it from our reality. In fact, the proportion of malnourished people in developing regions has halved since 1990, but still 785 million people do not receive enough food and do not get the necessary nutrients either. Chronic malnutrition affects 160 million children, the cause of nearly half of deaths among children under the age of five, one in six being below weight for their ages. Inadequate nutrition during the first 1,000 days of life will have negative consequences on a child's physical and intellectual abilities throughout his or her life. That is why, in 2012, the World Health Assembly set a target of achieving a 40% reduction in the number of stunted children by 2025. We urge the Commission to increase efforts to combat malnutrition and that is why we need specific interventions in those first 1 000 days of life. I would like to recall that the European Union committed itself at the 2012 London Summit to reduce the stunting of at least seven million children by 2025 and to contribute EUR 3.5 billion by 2020 to this cause. We hoped that this year in Rio de Janeiro we would take stock of progress and renew our commitments. It wasn't possible. However, action is now more urgent than ever, because development interventions against malnutrition receive only 0.57% of all official development aid. We need to multiply the investment by 70 times to meet our goals. In 2013 the European Union committed 400 million for specific initiatives. We call on the Commission to increase this commitment to an additional 1 billion euros. We need to implement strategies, we and all of our partners, to support the important role that small-scale farmers play. They produce 70% of the world's food. We need to support them, use their potential, increase their yield and productivity, preserve the variety of seeds and the nutritional value of what they produce. Commissioner, I would like to hear what the Commission intends to do in this area. I'm sure you agree with us that we have to do a lot more. So has the President of the World Bank, who has even pointed out or said that we need to point out to the governments of countries that are not meeting their objectives. We also know what needs to be done in food security and we ask the Commission to tell us what it intends for the coming years. We would like to hear new initiatives and ask Member States to commit themselves in 2017 to an intergovernmental summit that reviews the objectives and takes stock of the needs ahead.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 1, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 5, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 1}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2016-10-03.json", "name": "Enrique GUERRERO SALOM", "mepid": "96768", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on Development and its Chair, Ms Linda McAvan, for putting nutrition high on the development agenda in line with our commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals. The resolution on malnutrition proposed by the committee is, in our view, an important step forward. Since 2012, the Commission has emerged as a world leader in the nutrition arena. This leadership is backed by a robust policy framework addressing both stunting and wasting. Over the last three years, we have observed a trend pointing towards the decrease of stunting. Our first progress report on the European Commission’s Nutrition Action Plan shows that we are well on track to reach the commitment of reducing the number of stunted children under the age of five by seven million by 2025.  Our further actions on nutrition and food security should be guided by the approach that would seek to strike the right balance between our preferred nutrition-sensitive interventions that address the multiple nature of undernutrition and malnutrition causes, including food insecurity, health, sanitation, social safety nets and inequalities, and the needed nutrition—specific interventions. This balance is to be better assessed in the programming exercise with partner countries and other donors. This may also include a further look into our development instruments in 2017.  We have taken due note of Parliament’s request to increase the Commission’s funding for nutrition-specific actions. In this context, the Commission has put forward the following approach: we should maximise the synergies and complementarities of our development and humanitarian responses to nutrition and food security needs, having in mind that humanitarian responses are, in principle, nutrition-specific.  We will promote programming coordination with other donors, who can focus on nutrition-specific interventions, thus complementing the Commission’s focus on nutrition-sensitive issues. We shall also advocate at global level, especially through the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement, to increase investment in nutrition, including nutrition-specific investments by both donors and developing countries.  The first results of this three-pronged approach are encouraging, notably in Rwanda, Ethiopia, Niger, Mali, Bangladesh, Laos and Guatemala. We support partner countries in developing and implementing their own true multi—sectoral nutrition action plans, which combine nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions. This also allows donors to align their support to national priorities and coordinate the division of nutrition efforts.  The Commission has gained a strong record and evidence in supporting nutrition, mainly through the agriculture, education, water or health sectors. However, the Commission is exploring other areas, such as social safety nets, which have proved to be successful in improving nutrition – particularly in Mali. In this context, the Commission and the Club du Sahel are organising a major event on social protection for nutrition in Abuja in December. The objective will be to further increase investments and to reduce undernutrition faster, while putting women, children, and small farmers at the centre of nutrition actions.  At the global level, the Commission will continue advocating further investment in nutrition, notably through the Scaling Up Nutrition movement. We should also explore with the SUN Movement the opportunity to organise a pledging event for nutrition in the coming years.

According to united nations data, as colleague Guerrero has already mentioned, currently 795 million people (i.e. 1 in 10 people) are malnourished. This figure is projected to rise to 2 billion by 2050. The agricultural sector is not only a food supplier, but is also considered the largest employer in the world (it provides livelihoods for more than 40% of the world's population). Combating poverty and eradicating hunger, as well as supporting this sector of the economy, should be the overarching objective of the European Union, the second point of the SDGs. Hunger has particularly negative consequences for children, and the effects are felt not only on an individual scale, but also on societies as a whole, resulting in a inhibition of personal development and further negative social consequences. Estimates for 2016 indicate that in Ethiopia alone, the number of people who will be affected by hunger will increase from 10 million to 18 million, and already it is about 6 million children.  Action to address these problems also means helping to tackle other threats, from social to migration.

Today, through our policies, we are turning our backs on this food self-sufficiency. In the economic partnership agreements we sign with Africa, ultimately, we make African countries dependent on European business, which thwarts their normal agricultural development. Similarly, at European level, our common agricultural policy is perhaps the only one of the world's major agricultural producers that decouples aid. For example, CAP aid - which accounts for 40% of the EU budget - is completely decoupled from the economic reality of agriculture.  It is therefore clear that aid must be cross-referenced with economic reality.

Mr President, the eradication of hunger and malnutrition is a great commitment of the European Union. Our intention must be to achieve sustainable development within Objective II, but also the related objectives, which aim to eradicate both hunger and malnutrition, by 2030. However, the current situation shows that our policies so far are ineffective and wrong and I disagree with the encouraging results and figures mentioned.  The new objectives can be achieved mainly by increasing the productivity of small crops and properties and by creating sustainable farming and food production systems capable of fuelling a total population expected to reach 8.5 billion people. It is therefore particularly important to carry out coordinated actions between the global community and national and local authorities, non-governmental organisations and the private sector, as well as between donors to tackle famines and all forms of malnutrition, through increased production and a more efficient process of developing the productive food chain.  On this basis, the European Union should also take into account the need for greater coherence and coordination between all the institutions and bodies of the European Union and the Member States. Member States should step up, in line with their commitments, their efforts for global food security and give priority to sustainable agriculture and local food production, as well as to supporting small farmers and women farmers as food producers. At the same time, the international community and the European Union must work with all countries to support the development and implementation of an integrated framework with concrete, achievable and strong national and supranational food measures, on the basis of sustainable development objectives, in order to reduce underdevelopment and malnutrition.  As far as production is concerned, careful and scientific selection of crops should be made, by educating farmers and adapting to local climatic and soil conditions, but also to the needs of local populations. Finally, humanitarian aid must be targeted, not exploited by corrupt actors, waste must be avoided and supplemented by Commission strategies linking humanitarian and development aid. At the same time, the Commission should increase investment in specific nutrition-related interventions, especially given the current huge funding gap.

Other people have proper malnutrition, which means that minerals such as iron, iodine and zinc are not sufficiently present in their diets, which really leads to major health problems – especially in children. And more children die from the effects of hunger than from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.  Despite these catastrophic situations, there is too little intervention in development policy, and only a fraction of the financial needs are met. I really can only welcome the Commission's commitment to invest EUR 3.5 billion in food here. But we also know that this is not enough to achieve Sustainability Goal 2, which will end hunger by 2030. That is why Parliament is calling for another billion. But it's not just the money that counts, it doesn't just matter how much money comes in, it also counts how it's spent – the key things are the measures we take with that money. Because it is not only enough to provide enough calories, but we need a diverse, healthy diet, and that means in the end: we have to produce the food where it is needed.

Besides that, there is the danger that the EU is influencing the political agenda in the governments concerned, causing more instability.  However, there is another point that I would like to make. On the one hand, the EU promotes itself as a champion of development, providing poor countries with aid and assistance to deal with food security and food shortages. But, on the other hand, the EU is undermining food security in many parts of the world. Taxpayers in the EU are forced to bear the cost of EU fisheries agreements, which are essentially a tool to allow a few big fishing companies to plunder the waters of poor African coastal nations. People of poor coastal communities rely on fish as an affordable source of protein. Fish is their main source of food and they need it to survive, but we are stealing it from them.

In addition, food security on the planet is related to the use of safe food, which means that mutants should be hit and organic farming and livestock farming strengthened. But how can this be done, Commissioner, when in Greece over the last five years organic livestock farmers have not gotten the aid they are entitled to from the European Union? The same applies, Commissioner, to farmers who support the conservation of endangered breeds of farm animals. They are also still waiting for subsidies. So what is going to happen, Commissioner?

The European Union is also addressing undernutrition through its humanitarian assistance. We had EUR 700 million spent between 2011 and 2015. But we all must do more.  We will continue keeping our development policy focus on nutrition and food security issues, as well as advocating further investment in nutrition by other donors and partner countries. We will explore with a strong movement the possible Pledging Conference on Nutrition. We will continue also to explore other interventions, such as the social safety nets, as well as reflecting on the balance between nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions. We will continue to coordinate with donors who focus on nutrition-specific interventions, as well as maximising the synergies and complementarities of our development and humanitarian responses.  This development humanitarian collaboration has been further confirmed by the Commission’s response to the food crisis generated by El Niño climate change phenomenon. The Commission allocated an additional EUR 543 million this year, almost equally shared between humanitarian and development interventions. This is coherent with the resilience approach, which aims at meeting the more immediate needs of populations in food crisis while addressing the root causes of partner countries’ fragility and vulnerability.

In 2015, the European Court of Auditors issued a special report identifying gaps in FLEGT implementation and enforcement. The Court found that EU support to timber—producing countries was not sufficiently effective and targeted and called for an appropriate work plan with clear objectives, milestones and a dedicated budget. The Court also found that monitoring and reporting on progress had been inadequate, in particular due to the lack of an accountability framework.  The Commission has recently issued an evaluation of the FLEGT Action Plan, 12 years after its entry into force. Given this context, five committees asked the Commission to answer the following questions. First, how will the Commission concretely respond to the European Court of Auditors recommendations in its Special Report No 13/2015? Will additional resources be mobilised to respond to implementation challenges and will specific monitoring and evaluation mechanisms be developed to strengthen implementation of the EU Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade? What is the Commission strategy to revive the political momentum for FLEGT in voluntary partnership agreement countries and to accelerate the governance reforms that are necessary for the issuance of FLEGT licences?

Illegal logging and trade in illegal timber has a devastating impact on the world’s forests, threatening the survival of various wildlife species and contributing to climate change. Regrettably, we have not managed to reverse global deforestation, even though illegal timber imports to the EU have declined. This signals the urgent need to step up our efforts. The Committee on International Trade is a lead committee for FLEGT, the voluntary partnership agreements that are signed under the FLEGT Regulation between the EU and timber-producing countries, and that should address the supply side of the problem.  I note with satisfaction that Indonesia will be the first country to start issuing FLEGT licenses this autumn, and the whole process has contributed to strengthened forest governance through an inclusive multi-stakeholder approach. Today, over 90% of Indonesia’s timber exports are from independently—audited factories and forests, compared to just 20% in 2002. It is an important milestone, especially as one third by value of the EU’s tropical timber imports come from Indonesia. I would like to hear from the Commission how they are going to step up and accelerate the process in other Voluntary Partnership Agreement countries (VPAs). Could the Commission indicate which VPA countries, in addition to Indonesia, are closest to signing FLEGT licenses, and – as we have just heard, this is especially relevant in light of the Court of Auditors recommendation – notably that resources should be allocated to where they are likely to have the greatest impact in tackling illegal logging and related trade? In cases where implementation of the VPA requirements appears less feasible, would the Commission agree to propose measures supporting forest governance without necessarily signing a VPA?

The FLEGT Action Plan has built an effective global coalition against it, tackling both the supply and demand sides through trade measures, through development cooperation and through broad stakeholder engagement. Our action plan tackles some of the real drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. But deforestation continues and its consequences are potentially catastrophic at many levels – for the local communities that depend on forests, for the ecosystems that they support and at the global level as we deplete one of the most effective carbon sinks that we have. We must continue this fight both through our own actions and in the new global dynamic of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. The honourable Members are right to raise their concerns, and I welcome the interest of the Parliament in the follow-up to the European Court of Auditors report. FLEGT has been the subject of two reviews in the past two years. EU support to timber production countries under FLEGT was reviewed by the European Court of Auditors, while the overall performance of the action plan was also independently evaluated.  A basic finding is that FLEGT remains highly relevant and that the work carried out so far under the action plan is delivering significant results. Forest governance has improved, particularly in targeted countries, while demand for illegal timber in the EU has been reduced. The design of FLEGT has also been found to be future proof.  That being said, things have changed since the inception of the action plan. Imports of tropical timber in the EU have fallen, whilst China has become the world’s largest market and global political attention has shifted to other drivers of deforestation such as the competition for land and to other drivers of climate change. The evaluation stressed that such changes may have an impact on the relevance of the action plan if not sufficiently addressed. That is why the Commission has been considering opportunities to scale up efforts to combat deforestation through FLEGT but also through other instruments such as REDD+ and the EU timber regulation.  We have now commissioned a study to consider the feasibility of a comprehensive EU action plan on deforestation. The review of the Court and of the independent evaluation have highlighted important implementation challenges and areas for improvement in the way the FLEGT Action Plan has been managed, particularly in relation to the support to the countries concerned, and have recommended adjustments.  We are working to address these findings to a multiannual work plan with clear objectives, targets, timeframes and budget. This will redefine priorities geographically and thematically and will ensure more effective monitoring of progress, achievements and impact. FLEGT is our flagship priority under the Global Public Goods and Challenges Programme of the European Development Cooperation Instrument, but we should remember that the action plan is a joint initiative. It must draw on the combined strengths and capacities of the EU and of its Member States. According to the evaluation, stronger commitment and more active support by more Member States is needed.  Finally, the honourable Members also asked about voluntary partnership agreements (VPAs). As mentioned by Paavo Väyrynen, VPAs are a central FLEGT element, and the Commission has invested intensely in their negotiation and implementation through political dialogue, through stakeholder engagement and through capacity building.  Our colleague David Martin also mentioned Indonesia and yes, soon we will be launching Indonesia’s FLEGT licensing, and hopefully Ghana will follow soon after, hopefully next year. These efforts are yielding good results in those countries where there is willingness to implement the necessary reforms. The difficulty of putting in place these reforms should not be underestimated. There are often strong vested interests, benefiting from the status quo.  We will, of course, continue to make all possible efforts to maintain political momentum in VPAs and address the challenges with our partner countries.

The European Union is aware of the importance of the forest ecosystem, which is why, since the 1990s, it has been dealing with the problem of illegal shrinkage, trade in this timber and, as you said, even through these, now 25 years, things have been changing significantly. I do not know, China is now emerging as the biggest buyer, and in the meantime, the European Union has also committed and, as the European Court of Justice has also reviewed, as much as €300 million in resources, in order to improve this forest management worldwide and to improve forest management, as well as on common recommendations. In addition to the great biodiversity, which is one of the key problems in the face of environmental damage, there is certainly a major problem in this area, the area of corruption and, in fact, the failure of the countries where we come from. Therefore, in some ways, there is also a minor disappointment that we have only a few signed, that is, an agreement with Indonesia and some agreements with African countries. I wish you every success in this part because, as I have already said, I very much support that this issue be resolved. These problems, we want or don't want, they come to our homes sooner or later. Let me just say my own experience from Slovenia from a good two years ago, when in the winter of 2004 we suffered great damage after a great gutter, that is, climate change, causing various phenomena, great damage, when almost half of the Slovenian forest was forsageed into ice and as a result, two years after that, we feel after a very hot year with the underheabs that are destroying the now pine forest.

There are countries where the illegal logging rate reaches 90 %, implying forms of corruption throughout the slaughter, transport and sales chain. The objectives set out in the Action Plan are still hampered by a multitude of factors, including resistance to change in the forestry sector, the delay in implementing the European regulation, the importance of other markets such as China and India, and the boom in agricultural raw materials whose production occupies forest land. Extensive farming plays a key role in the process of deforestation, when we consider that since 2000 about half of the tropical forest has been converted into agricultural land or for monoculture plantations, often against the will of indigenous peoples, as is the case with palm oil in Indonesia, Liberia and Ecuador. It is estimated that today 80 % of global deforestation is caused by agriculture and, with the import of products such as palm oil, beef, leather, soya, rubber, cocoa and timber, the European Union is also a major player in this problem. In addition, the environmental damage caused by deforestation cannot be underestimated. In addition to the very serious loss of biodiversity, deforestation is one of the main causes of hydrogeological failure and causes floods and landslides.

A globally sustainable logging and trade of wood is the basis for a functioning timber industry. Personally, it is particularly important to me to be careful with our resource and to protect our markets. Illegal logging has been a concern for us for a long time. Here are a few facts: about 20 to 40% of global timber production is illegally cut. The economic damage is about 15 billion dollars due to lost revenue in the area of the state, the municipalities, the industry, but also the private forest owners. Worldwide, this will reduce the price of wood by about 10%. About 16% of timber imports into the European Union come from illegal logging, and the World Bank even talks about organised crime, which must be combated with tougher laws. So we cannot continue to watch here. Today we are evaluating the FLEGT action plan. It was intended to address and resolve the problems. At the heart of the action plan are bilateral agreements between Europe and the timber exporting countries. Despite all efforts to establish responsible rule of law here, rainforests continue to be cleared and biodiversity destroyed. Our precautionary measures have so far had little success. We need action against the backers of trade. Let us therefore pick up on the most important points from the Court of Auditors.

First of all, we have the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate agreement, which both require effective action on illegal logging and deforestation. Besides, illegal logging is a major problem in illicit capital flows from developing countries. Indeed, FLEGT has had many successes, but the global context has changed a lot since its introduction in 2003. So now we really need new measures and we need to look at innovative ways of shedding light on the supply chains. It is a very important task for us to make sure that consumers in the end—user countries, like those in the European Union, have full access to information on the origin of the timber. I believe that FLEGT could actually inspire many other sectors and products. The approach is really innovative, with the voluntary partnership agreements. One of the things that I have noticed is that the evaluation has come to the conclusion that there are limitations in terms of lack of data on illegal logging and trade and on governance achievements. Here I believe some new instruments could be introduced. We could see how customs information could be used to shed light on which companies are importing what to the EU Member States. I also firmly believe that we could look in the countries of origin at how we can support the countries to put in place proper systems of forest inventory.

What is needed is to ask the Commission whether it has done a robust behavioural economic analysis of the incentive system in the global logging market.

Mr President, the Special Report 13/2015 of the European Court of Auditors describes the failure of the European programme to support timber-producing countries in the fight against illegal logging. This scourge threatens the world's forest heritage, but also the indigenous peoples who depend on the forest for their livelihoods.  The reasons for these illegal loggings are diverse. First, in Indonesia, a large number of trees are cut down to make way for plantations that will produce paper or palm oil, destroying biodiversity. In South America, illegal logging is used to export this wood to organizations sometimes linked to corrupt authorities who, of course, want to enrich themselves by meeting the demand for wood on international markets. The loggers are pursued when they are victims of a system that exploits them and, of course, the decision-makers are never arrested.  In addition to corruption, the fight against illegal logging is not always the priority of the government of the country in question. The expansion of palm oil or soybean fields to support intensive agriculture is part of the problem.  Finally, the last problem is the traceability of products on the market. For example, 80-90% of the timber exported from Peru to China and other Asian markets is illegal, which corresponds to a loss of about 86 million euros. Finally, I think that developing and hardening the traceability imperative would be a good solution.

What is at stake today is to join forces so that the trade in illegal timber is finally stopped. Worldwide, a forest area the size of a football field is illegally cleared every two seconds, and reliable data on illegal logging in third countries is still very difficult to access. However, it is estimated that 1.2 billion euros of illegal timber is sold in the European Union every year. The economic damage to the timber-producing countries is therefore enormous. Every year they lose eur 10 to 15 billion in revenue, and this money, especially in view of the immense challenges, especially in the Member States – on the African continent – is really of particular importance here. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a responsibility here for future generations, because in addition to the economic damage, illegal logging is also a massive intrusion into our global ecosystem.

In addition to deforestation, biodiversity loss and increased greenhouse gas emissions, illegal logging contributes to conflict among indigenous and local communities, human rights violations and corruption. The proceeds of these activities are often used to finance armed conflicts, contributing to an increase in poverty levels. In Africa, nigeria, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of congo have suffered the greatest losses in the forestry sector in recent years. The authorities of some of these countries use the so-called controlled firing of forest areas to harvest these lands for cultivation.

Support is needed for the exchange of good practices and for appropriate forest policy reforms.

It seems also a good summary of the perception of the ills affecting the Union: well thought out, but we are late and bad.

I have to say that I agree with many points that have been raised. I will also communicate these to my colleagues, Neven Mimica, Miguel Arias and Cecilia, with whom I work very closely on deforestation issues. It has already been mentioned that progress is being made even with some timber producers, and in a few weeks’ time we will see the launching of FLEGT licensing in Indonesia. I think this is a major step and one we hope will be followed by Ghana next year. At the moment we are discussing VPAs with some 15 other countries. So there should be no doubting the Commission’s commitment to making FLEGT work. There were also some interesting points which were made like, for example, Mr Tomašić, who mentioned the joint surveillance between Member States, and the fact that we still have illegal timber coming into Europe, and  I have to stress again the responsibility of the Member States.  There is also the fact of the link between deforestation and the agricultural sector, especially the fact that we have to find monoculture and so on, and the socio-economic impact as well. I think many of you also spoke about inadequate implementation and I have to say yes, the Commission acknowledges that the absence of an implementation plan to guide strategic management and monitoring has rendered implementation of FLEGT, and VPAs in particular, largely demand-driven. That is why the Commission is working towards the development of a multiannual plan to guide activity planning by setting clear targets, indicators, monitoring deadlines and associated budgetary resources. Many of the honourable Members also mentioned the corruption problem. I totally agree with what they said, and that is why we took a number of precautions, especially in VPAs. The scheme developed for VPAs has several layers of safeguards and independence. Firstly, compliance with legal requirements is checked by private certification companies. Secondly, a specific role is provided for civil society to check that audited enterprises and forest operators comply with legal requirements. Thirdly, there is an overall systems audit, or periodical evaluation, that is foreseen and that will be carried out at least on an annual basis to check that the system is working properly overall. There were several mentions of dealing with SDGs and climate change, and many of the action plan’s areas of action contribute to addressing several goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including SDG 8, SDG 12 and SDG 13, which is climate change, SDG 15 which is life on land and SDG 16, which is peaceful and inclusive societies. What the Commission intends to do: as indicated in the 7th Environmental Action Plan, the Commission remains committed to developing policy proposals to address the deforestation challenge, and to this end the Commission is in the process of considering the feasibility of measures to achieve this objective, also as a follow-up to the study on the impact of EU consumption on deforestation. We will continue to ensure adequate resources for the implementation of the action plan, through the development and cooperation instrument, including support for the engagement of civil society, private sector and public administrations. When we talk about resources, as Notis Marias mentioned, we have not only to monitor and talk about input but, more importantly, I think we need to monitor the output as well. As the Court’s report found, the fundamentals of the FLEGT Action Plan are right. It is making an important contribution to mitigating climate change and to improving governance by clarifying tenure rights but, I agree, still more needs to be done. The Commission is also acting to address the important recommendations of the Court to ensure that the action plan is fit for purpose in a world where the pressures on forests are increasing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 160, "date": "2016-10-03.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   The debate is closed.

A FLEGT permission is a voluntary framework within which the desired objectives can be achieved. I consider it positive to highlight the example of Indonesia, which has raised the proportion of certified logging from 20% to 90% since 2002, thus demonstrating its commitment to the conservation and sustainable use of its forests. This is important for us because the EU imports almost a third of its tropical timber needs from Indonesia.

Since we do not know whether we will be faced with a great success of the European Union, whether a solution is achieved, or whether this will collapse, with all the risks that this entails, taking into account what is going on in the surrounding area, I would like to give some thoughts on the need to resolve the Cyprus problem and its parameters. We therefore call for the withdrawal of turkish occupying troops in the solution and abolition of the anachronistic system of 1960 guarantees, as well as any unilateral interventionist rights. My party rejects any NATO solution to the security issue.  Secondly, we call for the continuation of the Republic of Cyprus and its evolution into a Bi-Community Bi-League Federation. We call for a seamless application of basic freedoms and human rights for all Cypriot citizens. We do not accept permanent deviations from the acquis communautaire. We demand an end to settlement and respect for the population ratio of 4 to 1. We call for substantial territorial adjustments, such as the accession, inter alia, of Famagusta and Morfos under Greek Cypriot administration. We consider it necessary to minimise the timetables for both the return of territory and the withdrawal of occupying troops and we call, finally, for a strong Security Council resolution and other related commitments by all parties involved to ensure the implementation and faithful observance of the overall settlement.

We should remember what kind of ideology it is, what aspirations motivated this crime.  We should not accept eugenics in any form.
